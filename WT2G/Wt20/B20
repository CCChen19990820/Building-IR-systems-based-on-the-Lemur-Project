<h1>The Endangered Species Act Reconsidered</h1>

<h3>How Congress Can Restore Balance and Common Sense 
    to the Protection of Endangered Species</h3>

</CENTER>

<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>


Republicans in the new Congress have assumed responsibility for
directing the nation's legislative agenda for the first time in
nearly half a century.  Among the most important issues they must
consider in 1995 is the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due for
reauthorization this year.
<P>
Reauthorization of the ESA is certain to engender fierce debate
in Congress.  The ESA needs to be changed in fundamental ways,
not only in its actual workings and administration by a zealous
bureaucracy, but also in its design and purpose.  The public needs
to understand what is at stake in this debate, and both Congress
and state lawmakers need to be alert to the land mines awaiting
the implementation of attempted reforms.
<P>
The emerging debate on the ESA may well be more intense than those
over the Balanced Budget Amendment or welfare reform.  This is
because it will force Congress and the nation to choose between
individual liberty and big government.  For the first time since
the beginnings of the environmental movement in the 1970s, a major
environmental policy will be evaluated on the basis of the actual
results of its enforcement, and not the self-congratulatory rhetoric
of the bureaucrats who administer it.  For the first time since
its passage in 1973, the ESA will be debated as a matter of <I>public
policy</I>, not a matter of state religion.  In their deliberations,
the people's representatives will have to weigh the possibility-indeed,
the considerable evidence-that the ESA has done more harm than
good to the environment.  For all these reasons, the ESA debate
will stand as a watershed event in the history of environmental
legislation.
<P>
<B>The Political Species Act</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has been described as one of the most
far-reaching laws ever passed, yet most Americans are only vaguely
aware of its profoundly radical character.  Unlike most laws,
which attempt to balance competing interests in an effort to achieve
equitable results, the ESA is virtually absolute in its favoritism
toward what its authors perceived to be &quot;environmental&quot;
interests.  Under the ESA, an &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;
species is <I>always </I>favored over the competing interests
of men.
<P>
Like all special interest legislation, the ESA is unevenly applied.
 Few exceptions to the ESA are allowed, but with enough political
clout the law can be circumvented.  For example, when a little
fish called the snail darter held up the Tennessee Valley Authority's
giant Tellico dam project in Tennessee, Senator Howard Baker led
the charge in Congress to create special legislation to exempt
the project from the Act.  Other <I>ad hoc</I> exemptions followed,
including limited exceptions for agricultural pests and the so-called
&quot;God Squad&quot; cabinet level exemption, whereby a committee
of cabinet heads may override the law and thereby pass judgment
on the fate of a threatened or endangered species.
<P>
Sometimes this special interest favoritism goes too far and the
courts intervene.  In the case of the controversy of the Northern
Spotted Owl, for example, a federal court ruled that Congressional
antics to overrule a lower court's findings were unconstitutional.
 But in general, political exceptions to the ESA have little or
no relevance to ecology, and frequently go unchallenged.  This
arbitrariness is but one reason that the ESA is inimical to the
principle of the rule of law.  To be fair and just, a law must
be certain, and the ESA's application in particular cases is as
far from certain as the bald eagle is from extinction.
<P>
<B>&quot;Shoot, Shovel, and Shut Up&quot;:  Advanced Weed Abatement
and Other Perverse Incentives Of The Endangered Species Act</B>
<P>
That the ESA contains perverse incentives toward the destruction
of species is a fact that even environmental groups cannot deny.
 Because the ESA imposes the full burden of its costs on property
owners, property owners have a strong incentive to ensure that
there are no endangered species or habitat on their land.  Ever
since Richard P. Christy shot and killed a protected grizzly bear
that was marauding his livestock, landowners have sought to minimize
or eliminate any endangered species or endangered species habitat
from their property.  Examples are legion, from destruction of
habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker in the South to the careful
weed abatement practiced nearly everywhere else.  Such measures
are known in the West, and increasingly across the country, as
the code of &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up.&quot;  The court
that heard Christy's case ruled that under the ESA, he had no
right to protect his property from destruction by the bear.  But
most Americans, despite their sentimentality and charity toward
wildlife, put themselves ahead of all other species, endangered
or otherwise.
<P>
The law is equally unkind to those who might extend their charity
to help endangered species.  The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service is empowered to determine what constitutes &quot;harassment&quot;
of an endangered or threatened species.  All too often, productive
use of a private conservator's land is deemed &quot;harassment&quot;
and thus is prohibited.  It is therefore not surprising that private
efforts to create habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, the
northern grayling (a fish), and the bald eagle have been abandoned.
<P>
But Congress can and must learn from the remarkable private efforts-undertaken
before the enactment of the ESA-to restore the populations of
the wood duck, the bluebird, and the falcon, as well as dozens
of other endangered and threatened species.  The private sector
has proven its ability to protect truly endangered species, and
can do so again, but only if the current perverse incentives of
the ESA are removed.
<P>
<B>The Secret Process of Endangered Species Listings</B>
<P>
Central to the application of the ESA is the &quot;listing&quot;
of threatened and endangered species.  Such species are listed
through a complex political process that is completely outside
the arena of public debate and without the benefit of traditional
scientific analysis or peer review.  One U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service biologist determines whether or not a species is listed.
 Imagine our government permitting one physician to decree a serious
public health hazard!  Yet when it comes to endangered species
we are bound by the opinion of a single federal civil servant.
<P>
The failure of this system is illustrated by the listing as an
endangered species of the so-called Alabama Sturgeon.  That fish
is indistinguishable from other sturgeon that inhabit waters elsewhere,
and yet it was listed as endangered despite over-whelming scientific
evidence to the contrary.  U.S. Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL)
argued persuasively against the listing to no avail.  The story
of the Alabama Sturgeon is similar to that of the kangaroo rat,
another plentiful species listed as endangered because many distinct
populations in the West are smaller than the government thinks
they ought to be.
<P>
Saving every distinct population without regard to the real impact
on human beings is wrongheaded and impractical.  That it is wrong
is best illustrated by the unnecessary destruction of private
property caused by a wildfire fueled by uncleared brushbrush that
the government had declared kangaroo rat habitat.  Saving every
distinct population under the ESA is impractical in that huge
expenditures are made to protect creatures that are endangered
not due to human action but to the harshness of nature.  Moreover,
many species whose range lies primarily outside the geographical
United States are protected even though they are plentiful in
their chief habitats.  At the same time, funding for other, truly
endangered species goes wanting.  Despite self-congratulatory
rhetoric from federal agencies, there is no hard evidence that
a single species has been saved from extinction by application
of the ESA.
<P>
The dismal record of the ESA as a species-saving measure is well
documented.  Under the ESA several species have certainly become
extinct, and the government itself claims to have saved only one
species from extinction.  Like other command-and-control environmental
laws, the ESA fails to enhance the environment.  For the reasons
stated above, habitat is destroyed rather than enhanced, and truly
endangered species are further endangered by those who consider
them a blight on their land.  There is also a high probability
that many of the 853 species listed as endangered and the 3900
candidate species are not, in fact, endangered.  Many have been
listed for purely political purposes to serve the ends of special
interests or to enhance the reputation of the biologist who recommends
the listing.
<P>
Given public awareness of the absurd consequences of the listing
process, one might imagine that the federal bureaucracy would
at least try to improve it.  However, Senator Shelby has accurately
described the &quot;avalanche of proposed rules and the continuing
expansion of the law's scope beyond the preservation of species
in peril from immediate development.&quot;  Do Americans need
more bureaucratic experts making these decisions without regard
to their efficacy or the consequences to the citizenry?  The public,
not just pressure groups, should have a role in the listing process,
and all scientific evidence with regard to listing under the ESA
should be subjected to an academic's peer review process.
<P>
<B>The Real Costs of &quot;No Cost&quot; Federal Land-Use Controls</B>
<P>
The real impact of the ESA is that it amounts to a &quot;no cost&quot;
federal land-use law.  That is, it severely limits the use of
private lands and yet costs its advocates almost nothing to invoke.
 Many commentators have remarked that the ESA is but one of many
arrows in the quiver available to opponents of land development
and public projects.  In fact, a legal challenge to land development
can be made by any interested party seeking to invoke the ESA.
 If an invocation is successful and development is blocked, the
landowner must shoulder the cost of attorney's fees.  Since most
environmental groups have large budgets with which to pay their
lawyers and private landowners typically have little with which
to fight back with, it is nearly always a winning proposition
for a special interest group to try to invoke the ESA.  Even failed
challenges may result in an eventual victory.  Designation of
a species as &quot;threatened&quot; instead of &quot;endangered&quot;
has nearly the same effect-the private land-use or public project
may not proceed.  The ESA is actually more valuable to special
interest groups that want to block land development than that
it is to genuine environmentalists concerned with saving species.
<P>
Because the Fish and Wildlife Service is not constrained by cost
in its efforts to implement the law, application of the ESA is
said by its proponents to be &quot;free,&quot; but the actual
costs of the law are staggering.  From increased costs of raw
materials and financial hardship to landowners to the loss of
productivity of lands and tax losses to local government, the
true costs of the ESA certainly run into the billions of dollars
annually.  The notion that the ESA is &quot;free&quot; assumes
that it costs government little or nothing to enforce.  This view
fails to take into account the loss of liberty to the productive
sector of our economy.
<P>
<B>Environmentalism As a Religion</B>
<P>
One may wonder, given the poor record of the ESA, how such a law
can be supported.  To understand support for the ESA, one must
look to the law's origins.  During the 1960s there was growing
concern that human activity, particularly industrialization and
public works, was rapidly destroying many species that were vital
to the earth's ecosystems.  Lacking scientific agreement and scientific
support on the subject, many of those concerned with the issue
turned to an anti-Western philosophical argument to support a
new environmental policy.
<P>
The primary academic bulwark for this new philosophy of ecology
was the work of University of California at Los Angeles history
professor Lynn White.  White's thesis is that our Judeo-Christian
heritage, and Christianity in particular, is the root cause of
environmental pollution and destruction of the earth's ecosystems.
 White proposed a new ethic, essentially based on Eastern pantheism,
that was readily adopted by environmentalists.
<P>
Environmentalist pantheism asserts that all species are equal
and that mankind is the principal threat to the environment. 
To extreme environmentalists, mankind is a virus on the earth.
 Environmentalism grew in popularity as the American media was
announcing the &quot;death of God.&quot;  Hence it filled a spiritual
need for many Americans, especially among those most susceptible
to influence by the media and the academic elites.  When codified
into the ESA, a new religious order was created, officially sanctioned
by the government of the United States. Earth Day is its religious
holiday, dutifully celebrated by the faithful.
<P>
The ESA (1973) was enacted and the Environmental Protection Agency
(1971) established at the height of environmentalist enthusiasm.
But it is the wholesale, root-and-branch attack on our Western
heritage, not the goal of protecting endangered species, that
now alarms most Americans.  As an abstract idea, environmentalism
and reverence for the natural world had and still has broad appeal.
 But its popularity wanes in direct proportion to the visibility
and economic impact of its bureaucratic manifestations in everyday
life.  Experience with the ESA over the past twenty years has
generated a popular backlash against its excesses.  Radical environmentalism
today retains its religious character only on college campuses
and among clergy of &quot;progressive&quot; churches, where it
is one of the pillars of Political Correctness.  Outside that
insular world, most Americans are re-evaluating the impact and
legacy of that destructive era.
<P>
Despite its popularity among environmental activists, Professor
White's thesis has been widely disputed on both philosophical
and historical grounds.  Father Robert Sirico, a Paulist priest
and economist, squarely identifies the religious nature of environmentalism
and argues that it is inimical to our heritage.  Other writers
have also demonstrated the poverty of White's thesis against the
richness of the Western tradition and Judeo-Christian teaching.
 Christianity mandates individual<I> responsibility</I> as a necessary
corollary of individual <I>liberty</I>.  Whatever warm feelings
may come about from &quot;saving&quot; endangered species, adherence
to the basic tenets of &quot;species egalitarianism&quot; -that
all species are morally indistinguishable and that other species
are to be given priority over mankind's interests -is contrary
to our Western heritage and common sense. 
<P>
Most Americans have concluded that much of the environmentalist
litany is patently ridiculous.  If the premises of the ESA were
broadly accepted by the American public, we would let cows walk
in the streets, rats forage unmolested in our restaurants, and
bears roam in our school yards.  Moreover, reverence for &quot;natural
processes&quot; would mean abandonment of attempts to defeat the
HIV virus and other diseases.
<P>
<B>The Endangered Species Act and the Rule of Law</B>
<P>
Another sober realization now shaping the American political landscape
is that the Endangered Species Act works in opposition to the
economic interests of most Americans.  Unwary citizens can have
their entire estates bound up in land subjected to government
control, and thousands of jobs are lost through ESA enforcement.
 When it comes to endangered species, individuals are forced to
pit their own interests against the purported interests of the
state.
<P>
Thus it comes as no surprise that citizens &quot;shoot, shovel,
and shut up,&quot; cut down trees before they can become habitat,
ensure that weeds are plowed under rather than letting land lie
fallow, and fill all low spots to avoid vernal pools on their
land.  The fact that the law cannot be fairly applied without
extraordinary coercion is a telltale sign that it violates the
cornerstone of our ordered system of liberty-the rule of law.
<P>
Our legal system is based upon the rule of law.  It assumes that
the law exists to preserve the liberty <I>of the citizens</I>.
 To work, it must be universally applied and general enough to
receive the support of the populace.  It must also be certain
in its effects.  The ESA has popular support only when it is applied
against some giant corporation whose position in the community
may be easy to envy and criticize.  As regards certainty, it is
certain only that the ESA will yield disparate, unfair results.
 Landowners who do not destroy habitat will be affected, and then
only if the endangered species chooses their land instead of a
neighbor's.  It is also uncertain because government agencies
and large corporate interests can often buy special rules to avoid
it.  The ESA thus lacks the universality, generality and certainty
basic to the rule of law.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act needs to be amended.  Reform should
be grounded upon the principle of balance, and the objective of
the law should be to preserve not federal power but endangered
species.  The debate should begin from the premise that human
liberty is the guiding principle of American law.  Private property,
a vital prerequisite and safeguard of ordered liberty, should
not be denigrated.  Individual responsibility with regard to the
environment should be encouraged.
<P>
Congress must address specific deficiencies in the current law.
 But the first order of business should be to open up the debate
and insist on &quot;truth in advertising.&quot;  This means that
the philosophical underpinnings of the current program and the
proposed solutions should be openly discussed and called by their
right names.  The American people should not again submit to the
wholesale abandonment of their traditions and their liberties,
as when the ESA was passed in 1973.  If we wish to reauthorize
a new state religion-pantheistic environmentalism-we should be
open about doing so.  The law should not be &quot;curious,&quot;
as Chief Justice Warren Burger described the ESA in the case of
<I>TVA v.</I> <I>Hill</I>.  Its preferences must be clearly stated
and labeled.
<P>
Specific features that need to be changed in the law include the
following:
<UL>
<LI>Congress should provide that the listing and de-listing process
includes peer review of all candidates for endangered and threatened
species.  Funding of peer reviewers should be disclosed to ensure
that the review is objective, as should any special relationships
or conflicts of interest.
<LI>Public input into the listing and de-listing process should
be required, as should ample public notice so as to ensure the
opportunity for all those concerned or affected to be heard.
<LI>Congress should state explicitly that all species are not
created equal.  The revised ESA should state a preference for
mankind where balance is an issue.  And the impact on humans of
endangered species listings should be part of the listing analysis.
 Economic impacts should be part of any listing procedure as well.
 That is, a full analysis of the true economic costs of endangered
species listing should be required whenever a candidate is considered
for listing.
<LI>Congress should state that some non-human endangered species
may be determined to be more important than others.  In this way,
limited public resources may be allocated to those species deemed
the most important public resource. 
<LI>Congress should require periodic re-evaluation of species
listed and all candidates for listing.
<LI>Congress must compensate for the loss of private property
taken by endangered species regulation.  Compensation must be
required for full, partial, and temporary takings, and it should
be paid upon determination that private property must be taken
for use by an endangered species.  Also, a declaration of condemnation
and filing of condemnation proceedings must be filed not just
in any court competent to hear the action, but within the congressional
district of the affected citizen or that in which the property
is located.  Nothing in the condemnation proceedings may infringe
upon the property owner's right to just compensation as guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
<LI>Congress should also encourage individual efforts to enhance
endangered and threatened species.  Such private efforts have
the greatest chance of enhancing small numbers of species and
of preserving or creating critical habitat.  Permits should not
be required to use private property for endangered species enhancement,
except in cases where such efforts may constitute a public nuisance.
 Tax incentives should be established, including deductions from
estate and income taxes, for the contribution of private property
for endangered species habitat.  No income tax should be levied
upon the sale of critical habitat to conservation organizations
devoted to endangered or threatened species enhancement.  A divided
real property estate should qualify for endangered or threatened
species tax treatment.  In this way, the presence of an endangered
species would be a boon to the landowner instead of a dreaded
blight.
<LI>Commercial opportunities geared to endangered species enhancement
should be permitted.  Congress should allow private husbandry
of threatened and endangered species.  It also should allow regulated
marketing of threatened and endangered species, following the
enlightened example of Zimbabwe, whose game population has flourished
under commercial management.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Congress should address reauthorization of the Endangered Species
Act in a manner consistent with American tradition, through open
and honest debate, and with a view toward protecting both the
liberty of our citizens and truly endangered species.  Only in
this manner can the injustices and excesses of the existing law
be rectified.  In crafting the language to effect these changes,
and in monitoring their implementation, Congress must be alert
to the self-interest of the bureaucracy in perpetuating and extending
its discretionary powers. 
<P>
After Congress acts to correct ESA deficiencies, the states must
follow suit in revising state plans to reflect the new federal
policies.  State policy-makers must match federal changes with
innovative steps of their own in the balancing of competing interests,
compensation for takings of private property, and other changes
in the direction of common sense.

<P>
<B>Rethinking Welfare Reform in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
In 1966, one year after Lyndon Johnson and Congress declared war
on poverty, the poverty rate stood at 14.7 percent.  Over a quarter
century later, after approximately $5 trillion in federal, state,
and local welfare spending, the poverty rate remains virtually
the same at 14.5 percent in 1992.  In California, even as the
economy boomed in the 1980s, welfare caseloads continued to grow,
and they continue to grow rapidly in 1994.
<P>
Over the past three years the Wilson administration, in concert
with a reluctant Democratic legislature, has made several changes-from
cuts in individual grants to instituting fingerprinting programs-and
their effects on the California budget have been relatively beneficial.
 Budget tinkering, however, will not solve welfare's core crisis.
 Through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other
programs, we subsidize behavior that destroys communities.  Teenage
motherhood, divorce and separation, absent and delinquent fathers,
and even drug addiction can qualify a person for state payment.
 Fortunately, after nearly thirty years of destructive social
policy, a new consensus has emerged:  something has gone dreadfully
wrong with the welfare state.  Unfortunately, this new consensus
on the scope of the problem does not yet extend to agreement on
how to fix it.  
<P>
We can learn from the experience of past generations.  We need
not be prisoners of welfare state misconceptions and biases about
either &quot;root causes&quot; or workable solutions.  In fact,
it is only by looking beyond the &quot;welfare establishment&quot;
that we find innovative thinking and viable solutions.  The history
of that last thirty years teaches us one clear lesson: our goal
should not be to &quot;reform&quot; welfare or to turn it into
a new public works program.  Our goal must be to abolish it.
<P>
Much can be learned from examining how welfare was managed in
19th century, which was done largely, and more successfully, by
private charities.  We must relearn and reapply what was common
knowledge less than a hundred years ago, before the rise of the
welfare state, its entitlements, and its bureaucracies.
<P>
Prior to outlining new proposals for reform, we will examine trends
in California welfare in the 1980s and 1990s.  We will also explain
why Bill Clinton's program to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;
will not help California-or do anything substantial to break the
cycle of dependency.  
<P>
<B>RECENT TRENDS</B>
<P>
<B>Expenditures</B>
<P>
Welfare in California operates on several different levels.  The
main program is AFDC, the costs of which are shared by the federal
and state governments.  AFDC falls into two categories:  AFDC-Family
Group (AFDC-FG) which goes to single-parent families, and AFDC-Unemployment
Parent (AFDC-U) which goes to two-parent households with at least
one unemployed parent.  In 1992-93 these two programs enrolled
2,458,6000 individuals per month at a cost of $5.9 billion, of
which California paid $2.8 billion and counties paid $0.4 billion.
 (California accounted for 27 percent of all money spent on AFDC
nationwide in 1993-more than double the average per capita for
the nation.)
<P>
The two AFDC categories differ in significant ways.  AFDC-FG now
accounts for 84 percent of the AFDC caseload.  Growth in the AFDC-FG
caseload was &quot;completely unrelated&quot; to fluctuations
in the unemployment rate for ten of twelve large counties in California
over a seven-year period through 1991-92.  In contrast, the Department
of Social Services found that the recession accounted from much
of the growth in the AFDC-U caseload.
<P>
Why do people go on welfare in the first place?  According to
nationwide data on AFDC, 75 percent of AFDC-FG cases begin receiving
aid because of changes in family structure, while only 15 percent
do so as direct result of a reduction in income.  Of those who
leave AFDC, 46 percent leave because of changes in family structure,
and 26 percent leave AFDC because of increased income.
<P>
This information suggests that offering employment in exchange
for AFDC-FG will not significantly reduce the caseload.  There
is another element at work-teenage pregnancy.
<P>
California has the highest teenage birthrate in the nation, with
births to mothers under age 18 comprising over 10 percent of all
births.  During the 1980s, the teenage birthrate increased by
12 percent.  These numbers have a direct effect on the AFDC-FG
program.  Approximately 54 percent of women currently receiving
aid had their first child as a teenager, and 32 percent of AFDC
families have additional children after first receiving aid, making
them eligible for a larger grant.  This suggests that if we reduce
teen pregnancy, AFDC payments will also fall.  We believe an inverse
relationship exists as well.  Reduce or eliminate AFDC and replace
it with a system absent the current perverse incentives, and teen
pregnancy will fall significantly.
<P>
Other forms of welfare in California include General Assistance,
a county-operated program which enrolls approximately 165,000
people per month, providing benefits mostly to adults with no
children.  Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program
(SSI/SSP) is jointly funded by federal and state governments,
and provides aid to 960,500 aged, blind, and disabled people per
month.
<P>
The Department of Finance estimates that in the fiscal year 1993-94,
2.6 million people, or 8.2 percent, of all Californians received
some kind of welfare benefit.  This is up from 7.3 percent in
1991-92-an 11 percent increase in two years.
<P>
<B>Recent Reforms</B>
<P>
Some progress has been made in reducing the size of individual
welfare grants, which are currently 12.9 percent below 1990-91
levels.  The &quot;need standard&quot; (a schedule that reflects
the state's determination of the income that families need to
subsist) has increased to reflect the cost of living.  The difference
between the two is now 15.1 percent, and the legislature has lifted
some limitations on work income for recipients.  Despite these
changes in benefit levels, the AFDC caseload and budget will continue
to grow, 4.5 percent for AFDC-FG, and 4.7 percent for AFDC-U,
according to Department of Finance estimates..
<P>
The current 1994-95 budget will reduce individual grants for a
family of one parent and two children from $607 to $593 per month,
but because of increasing caseloads, the entire Health and Welfare
budget will increase by 3.3 percent.  The costs of new cases are
outstripping the reductions in individual grants.  Clearly, just
reducing the size of individual grants is not enough.
<P>
The new budget includes two additional changes.  First, beginning
in November 1995, AFDC families will no longer receive the automatic
increase in benefits from having another child.  Welfare families
will also be allowed to keep their benefits for one year after
marriage.

<P>
Even these modest improvements, however, are in jeopardy.  On
July 13, 1994 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
cutting individual welfare payments is against the law.  In 1992,
California obtained a waiver from the Bush administration to reduce
AFDC payments.  Now, two years later, Judge Alfred Goodwin of
the Ninth Circuit Court has written that the Bush administration
improperly considered the request's effect on the poor.  The ruling
also called into question this year's decision to deny additional
benefits for children born while their mothers are on AFDC.  The
Wilson administration is appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
<P>
In December 1992 welfare payments to out-of state emigrants were
reduced to home state levels, but a U.S. District Judge promptly
blocked the law.  In April 1994, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of appeals upheld the decision, agreeing that new residents must
be held equal with respect to the &quot;basic necessities of life.&quot;
 The Wilson administration is, once again, appealing the decision
to the Supreme Court.
<P>
In our 1992 report, we found that welfare fraud is more prevalent
than is officially reported.  New data collected by the Department
of Finance has backed that view.  To address this problem, Los
Angeles County has instituted a fingerprinting program for general
assistance benefits, as has San Francisco. That city-home to 14,900
general assistance recipients-has seen between 400 and 610 people
ignore two notices to be fingerprinted or be kicked out of the
system.  If just 350 of those people leave the system, the city
estimates savings of $1.2 million annually.  In the budget this
year is a provision for a pilot fingerprinting program in Los
Angeles for state AFDC benefits<I>.</I>

<P>
<B>The GAIN Program</B>
<P>
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) is California's version
of the federal JOBS program, a provision of the Family Support
Act of 1988.  The GAIN program is overseen by the Department of
Social Services and administered by the 58 counties.  The Department
of Social Services estimates the GAIN budget for all levels of
government for  the 1993-94 year to be $211 million.
<P>
The California Department of Social Services commissioned the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in New York to evaluate
GAIN'S effects on welfare recipients.  MDRC has tracked 33,000
welfare recipients in six counties for three years.  A control
group that was precluded from the GAIN program but could seek
employment services in the community was compared with the 33,000
in employment rates, average earnings, average AFDC payments,
and percentage of each group that left the AFDC rolls.
<P>
That last category should be the ultimate test of any work-training
program, and GAIN's impact on this has been modest at best.  At
the end of three years MDRC found virtually no difference between
the control group and the GAIN group for both AFDC-FG and AFDC-U
in leaving welfare (the difference was only three percent).  In
some countries, there were marginal to significant increases in
average total earnings and employment of GAIN participants, and
welfare savings were achieved through individual grant reduction.
 Nevertheless, these gains are modest and it is premature to call
GAIN a success.  We can't say GAIN has succeeded until it moves
people off welfare for good or reduces the entire welfare budget,
and so far, that hasn't happened.
<P>
Undoubtedly, the GAIN program has produced positive results for
a number of individuals, although that number is a fraction of
the total AFDC population.  In California, 171,865 people, or
20 percent of adults receiving AFDC, will participate in GAIN
in the current budget year.  Thus, it is probably true that GAIN
has been a worthwhile reform, and should be continued.  Yet it
is too early to gauge its long-term impact or its effectiveness
in reducing welfare expenditures statewide.
<P>
It is also too early to gauge the effects of fraud prevention
measures.  If the San Francisco experience is typical, fingerprinting
programs may save the state considerably.  Likewise, some evidence
shows that moving AFDC recipients into training and education
programs like GAIN can achieve some savings in some counties.
 But legitimate welfare caseloads are still on the rise, outstripping
the modest gains realized through fraud prevention and worker
training programs.  Until we stem that tide, reducing individual
payments or stamping out fraud is akin to rearranging deck chairs
on the <I>Titanic</I>.
<P>
<B>THE SOCIAL COSTS OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY</B>
<P>
Governor Wilson justifies his welfare reform proposals &quot;because
of the severe nature of the fiscal circumstances facing California,&quot;
and in the face of Democratic majorities in the legislature, Wilson's
success in reducing welfare payments <I>at all</I> is laudable.
 But the logic of Wilson's economic argument implies that if fiscal
circumstances were more favorable, we should maintain, or even
increase, welfare grants.  In confining his arguments strictly
to the budget impact, Wilson ignores the seminal reason for welfare
reform: government welfare payments have demoralized their recipients
and have created a culture of dependency.  Yes, comprehensive
welfare reform will save Californians money, but saving money
in itself ought not be the primary goal.
<P>
Consider two recent news stories, representative of events occurring
across America nearly every day.  From <I>Newsweek</I> magazine:
<P>
The cops found the last of 19 [children] asleep under a mound
of dirty clothes; one 4-year-old gnarled by cerebral palsy, bore
welts and bruises.  . . . And though the six mothers living there
collected a total of $4,500 a month in welfare and food stamps,
there was barely any food in the house.
<P>
In Sacramento recently, four boys-two 17-year-olds, a 14-year-old,
and one just 13-were arrested for a string of robberies and callous
shootings.  &quot;Don't care about nobody,&quot; said the 13-year-old,
who was the &quot;designated shooter&quot; in the group.  The
grandmother of the 14-year-old spoke to the <I>Sacramento Bee:</I>
<P>
We are stunned and very sad.  I feel very badly about the people
who were hurt. . .  In my age it was different.  I worked all
my life.  I set an example.  I was a nurse for 30 years.  I got
an education.  None of this welfare business. . . . It's just
a mass problem, and I don't have the answers. . . . The truth
is, these kids need their mom.
<P>
It turns out that the boy's mom has a drug problem and his father
is gone. 
<P>
<B>The Illegitimacy Connection</B>
<P>
These examples are extreme, yet we see them in the headlines every
day.  At the same time youth crime has become more common and
increasingly serious, out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed,
and both common sense and statistics demonstrate a strong correlation
with welfare.  Robert Tector of the Heritage Foundation provides
the common sense:  &quot;[A teenage single mother] will continue
to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she fulfills two conditions:
1) She must not work; and 2) she must not marry and employed male.&quot;
 In the early 1940s illegitimacy among blacks was 19 percent,
at a time when racial discrimination was high, and crime rates
were relatively low.  By 1965 that rate had risen to 28 percent.
 Since 1965, however, the rate is up to 68 percent overall, and
is much higher in many inner city neighborhoods.  Among whites,
the illegitimate birth rate stands at 22 percent, and for high
school dropouts it is 48 percent and rising rapidly.
<P>
Establishing that births to unwed mothers has increased is relatively
simple.  What links that fact with the breakdown of cities like
Washington D.C. and New York?
<P>
Social scientists Douglas Smith and Roger Jarjoura found that
high crime rates are caused by a greater number of single-parent
families.  Other factors found to contribute to high crime rates
were population density, mobility, and the percentage of adolescents
in a community.
<P>
Poverty<I> per se</I> is not the driving force behind violent
crime.  Other factors are far more decisive.  Dr. June O'Neill
of Baruch College found that young black men raised in single-parent
families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activity than
black men raised in two parent families, even accounting for variables
like family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment,
and parents' education.
<P>
Furthermore, children from one-parent families are two to three
times more likely to need psychiatric care than those in two-parent
families, and more likely to begin sexual activity at a younger
age, thereby increasing the chance the cycle will continue.
<P>
An alternative theory popular with the social welfare establishment
is that high crime rates are not the results of generous welfare
benefits and illegitimacy, but result from the absence of available
jobs in inner cities, giving residents nothing to do but join
gangs and commit crimes.  This is the philosophy behind Jesse
Jackson's answer to &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; laws.
 &quot;Four Balls, You're On&quot; includes job training, education,
and guaranteed employment.
<P>
The available evidence suggests that the more likely answer is
not the absence of jobs, but the absence of a<I> work ethic</I>,
the very foundation of seeking and keeping a job.  Mayron Magnet,
a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, illustrates the point:
<P>
That is the lesson of Korean economic success in ghetto neighborhoods.
 No opportunity?  Then why do Korean greengrocers flourish in
Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where no such business has flourished
for years... It doesn't take arcane skills to run a vegetable
stand, only hard work, long hours, determination, rudimentary
entrepreneurialism, and family cooperation... What limits economic
opportunity for the underclass above all is the lack of such skills-skills
like being able to show up on time dependably, to be conscientious
and have manners, to treat customers well enough so they'll come
back, to stick to something unpleasant and arduous, to attend
to details.
<P>
Why do families with no fathers tend to produce juvenile criminals,
and  contribute to the overall breakdown of values in a community?
 UCLA political scientist James Q. Wilson believes the key to
community harmony is that &quot;fathers live there.&quot;  That
is, it the males who live in a given neighborhood are responsible
adults with something to protect, the community will likely be
safer than a neighborhood in which many of the males are rootless
and lawless.  Professor Wilson suggests that young males without
fathers still feel the need for them, and finding none present,
turn to street gangs for that guidance.
<P>
In addition, many of the single-mothers in the communities Wilson
is talking about are ill-equipped to be parents themselves.  A
recent study by the Columbia University Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse demonstrates the disastrous level of alcohol and
drug abuse among AFDC recipients.  From the report:
<UL>
<LI>37 percent of women on AFDC 18 to 24 years of age abuse or
are addicted to alcohol and drugs.
<LI>Mothers receiving AFDC are three times more likely to abuse
or be addicted to alcohol and drugs than mothers not receiving
AFDC (27 percent compared to 9 percent).
<LI>14 percent of pregnant women on public assistance in California
would test positive for cocaine use.
<LI>Nationally, 200,000 drug-exposed babies will be born every
year to mothers on AFDC.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
As the study shows, too many children are left not only without
fathers, but without any parent at all.
<P>
In an influential essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, Charles
Murray of the Manhattan Institute predicted that if this trend
is nor revised, we can count on high crime and high unemployment
in white communities, a crisis of bigger proportions because of
sheer numbers.
<P>
In every human society, from Brazil's Yanomamo Indians to Communist
China, the family has been the basis for bringing the next generation
into the society, teaching its members that particular society's
customs and laws.  Our welfare system thwarts this pattern by
subsidizing a system in which one person (usually the biological
mother) is charged with raising one or more children, and penalized
if she attempts to marry or become self-sufficient.  When viewed
through the scope of human history and experience throughout the
world, the result is unsurprising: many of our youth are growing
up uneducated, anti-social, and violent.
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: BOLD RHETORIC. BALD POLITICS</B>
<P>
In an NBC News interview, President Clinton commented on Charles
Murray's widely-read essay, published a month earlier.  &quot;He
did the country a great service.  I mean, he and I have often
disagreed, but I think his analysis is essentially right.  There's
no question that [ending welfare payments to single mothers] would
work.  The question is . . . is it morally right?&quot;
<P>
Clinton's answer to his own question is found in the &quot;Work
and Responsibility Act of 1994.&quot;  Unfortunately, his plan
doesn't live up the advance billing.  Instead of bold new ideas,
it falls into the pattern of other liberal &quot;reforms&quot;
of the recent past.  The plan simply calls for more of the same-more
job training, guaranteed (&quot;last resort&quot;) government
jobs, and incredibly, <I>more money</I>.  President Clinton would
spend an additional $9.3 billion over five years in order to &quot;save
money in the long run.&quot;  (It's a quintessential Congressional
reform plan: spend now, save later-in the &quot;out years&quot;
of the budget calendar).
<P>
Some of President Clinton's proposals are laudable.  He would
require unwed teenage mothers to live with their parents or a
responsible adult before they receive a welfare payment.  Currently,
young teenage mothers might be put up separately in their own
apartments.
<P>
The few positive effects of the Clinton plan, however, would be
offset by its sheer irrelevance in solving what the President
himself acknowledges is the core problem, namely, the cycle of
dependency.  Clinton's plan does propose to eliminate welfare
benefits after two years, but this change is a hollow reform because
the federal government would guarantee a public service job at
that point.  So much for &quot;ending welfare as we know it.&quot;
 This jobs program will almost certainly cost more than projected,
since by  administration estimates, government-subsidized jobs
will increase from 15,000 today to 394,000 by the year 2000. 
Furthermore, the major provisions of the plan will apply only
to those born after 1971.  This means that only one-third of welfare
recipients will be affected by the program.
<P>
In the final analysis, the Clinton plan will do virtually nothing
to solve the underlying problems of the American welfare system.
 For all of his eloquent speeches about the breakdown of the family
and the specter of teenage motherhood, the Clinton plan is nothing
but gradualism and &quot;business as usual&quot; for the welfare
state:  $9.3 billion in new expenditures and a guaranteed public
works job for those who can't find or keep a job in the private
sector.  This is warmed-over Democratic machine politics: put
people on the public dole and they'll vote for you forever.  A
&quot;guaranteed job&quot; is no job at all; it's merely disguised
public assistance, and no one will be fooled.  If there is no
threat of firing, whether explicit or implicit, what incentive
is there to work?
<P>
To his credit, President Clinton proposes to allow states to cut
benefits for additional children born while the mother is on AFDC.
 But it is likely that any Clinton reforms wouldn't take effect
until 1996 or 1997.  California can't wait that long.
<P>
The irony is that nothing short of radical solutions will change
the trends, yet Americans are traditionally wary of radical reforms
from which there is no escape, i.e., a Congressional mandate encompassing
the entire United States.  Americans want to see something work
<I>somewhere</I>; before it is implemented <I>everywhere</I>.
 The answer is for Congress and the President to remove all impediments
to state- and county-based reforms.  This idea, like most good
ideas, is not new; but has never been allowed a trial run.  Allowing
real freedom for states to test new welfare concepts would be
a radical departure from the history of the past thirty years.
 Its an idea whose time has come . . . again.
<P>
<B>WELFARE BEFORE THE WELFARE STATE</B>
<P>
Most people have at least heard of the two milestones of the American
welfare state:  the New Deal in the 1930's and the Great Society
programs launched in 1965.  But how many Americans know what welfare
&quot;programs&quot; were in place <I>before</I> the Great Society?
 Without AFDC, did single mothers and their children starve to
death in the streets?
<P>
Marvin Olasky of the University of Texas studied the approach
to welfare in the late 1800s and early twentieth century.  He
found that the approach to welfare was nearly the mirror opposite
of today's practices-and the results far more benign.  The ingredients
were legislative support for the family, and local community support
for those known as the deserving poor: widows, orphans, and the
disabled.  Distinctions were made between those physically unable
to work, and the able-bodied who were temporarily down on their
luck.
<P>
Olasky writes of a more striking crisis in the 1890s in New York
City:
<P>
Thousands of orphans roamed the streets.  Infant mortality rates
were 10 times present levels . . . A survey found 6,576 New York
slum families living in tenement 'inside' rooms-rooms without
windows facing out, only air-shafts, which many tenants used as
garbage chutes.
<P>
According to Olasky, a &quot;war on poverty&quot; was waged by
various local charities and religious groups using firm principles:
<P>
Emphasizing the restoration of broken ties to family and friends
. . . forging long-term contact between a volunteer and a needy
person . . . Using &quot;work tests&quot; and background checks
to distinguish among different types of applicants . . . Learning
to say 'no' in the short run so as to produce better long-term
results . . . Requiring work from every able-bodied person . .
. Helping the able needy to resist enslavement to the charity
of governmental or private masters.
<P>
Federally funded welfare has induced national amnesia.  Grants
are now seen by recipients, bureaucrats, and social welfare advocates
not as charity, but as an entitlement from a faceless bureaucracy,
for which nothing is owed in return.
<P>
Charity, in the proper sense if the word, is a voluntary expression
of compassion for someone in need.  Exactly who is in need is
determined by those willing to give, and when the transaction
is voluntary, the relationship enriches both parties.  Comments
by one Sacramento welfare mother points out the core distinction
in any charity program:  &quot;There are those who honestly need
it as a steppingstone.&quot;  She is right, but who best can distinguish
between those truly in need and those simply trying to sponge?
 The answer is-those who are closest to the problem: individuals,
private charities, and in some cases, local governments.
<P>
<B>THE FIRST STEP IS CRIME CONTROL</B>
<P>
No welfare reform plan can hope to succeed without simultaneously
addressing the other crisis of the American city-juvenile crime.
 The U.S. Department of Justice reports that in the four years
between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles in court for murders
increased by 55 percent.  For aggravated assault, robberies, and
forcible rapes, the increases were 80 percent, 52 percent, and
27 percent respectively.  But the real tragedy is that children
ages 12 to 17 are the most common <I>victims</I> of violent crime
in America.
<P>
When violent crimes like murder, rape, and armed robbery are commonly
committed by teenagers, some as young as 13, a light sentence
of 10 years is simply not enough.  These perpetrators must be
considered adult criminals and sentenced accordingly.  Their values
and outlook on life are so empty of human consideration that even
human life has no meaning.  And what values does one learn in
the prison system?  For most, exactly the same values they learned
growing up without proper parental guidance.  Turning these young
criminals loose at the age of twenty-five will do nothing but
endanger more innocent lives.  We must eliminate age discrimination
in sentencing.  Violent crime is violent crime no matter what
the age.
<P>
This get-tough policy regarding juvenile crime is not a matter
of imposing heavy punishment for the sake of retribution.  Its
goal is to remove the criminal element from the streets so that
the law-abiding population can pursue jobs, family life, and recreation
in safety and security.  Communities cannot be built in a war
zone.  
<P>
As we identify and incarcerate the few pathological juveniles
among the teenage population, so too can we identify those who
show early signs of criminality with relatively minor transgressions,
such as shoplifting or vandalism.  For these minor crimes, we
should not allow suspended sentences or lenient treatment after
a first offense.  On a second offense, even of minor crimes, the
time for leniency has passed.  There are any number of punishment
options, from boot camps, to forcing vandals to clean up the walls
of a city, to minimum security jail time.  The important thing
is not the specific punishment exacted, but that any punishment
is swiftly and surely applied.  This will send a message that
even minor transgressions will be taken seriously, and that actions
have consequences.  This is a message rarely conveyed today to
any criminals, least of all to juveniles.
<P>
Getting violent young hoodlums off the streets is essential to
making neighborhoods and schools safe for young people who want
to pursue positive goals, to build families and prepare for careers.
 Without such policies to bring crime under control, the &quot;positive
role models&quot; in every community will continue to be victimized
by gangs and street crime.
<P>
<B>INVESTING IN THE FUTURE</B>
<P>
The other component of radical welfare reform is fortifying family
structures through new incentives and new mechanisms for fostering
family life.  What do we know about successful child-rearing?
 Close supervision, attention to the child's needs (often in place
of the parents' selfish interests) and making that child feel
needed and loved are important ingredients.  It is abundantly
clear that most teenagers are incapable of the maturity needed
to raise a child.  This problem is greatly exacerbated if the
teenage mother is alone.  That is a recipe for social disaster,
as we have learned to our collective sorrow.
<P>
Once we accept this basic truth, there are several approaches
we can follow.  The first and most essential reform must be to
abolish the AFDC program at both the state and federal levels.
 It is time for the federal government to end its &quot;war on
poverty.&quot;  As part of a radical restructuring of welfare
policy, the social welfare function should be returned to the
states, with federal taxes reduced commensurably to allow states
the latitude to finance needed reforms at the local level.
<P>
Once the problem is reduced to a state and county level, it becomes
less overwhelming.  The people in each locality must then answer
two questions for themselves: First, what can we do about teenage
mothers and their children <I>today</I>?  And once we have agreed
that teenage motherhood is on the whole undesirable, how do we
reverse the trend?
<P>
For the present, for young mothers already on welfare, we must
move to alternative structures and incentives.  We  must encourage
them to support themselves in some way, either by getting married,
getting a job, or living with their family, or all three.  For
mothers with preschool age children and nowhere else to turn,
group homes can be established under county government or-better
yet-private charities to provide both generations much needed
parenting.
<P>
Once the children are of school age, the mothers must move out
on their own, and they will have a choice.  If they have proved
their willingness and ability to care for the child at home, they
may take him home, and enroll him in a public school.  If the
mother cannot provide for the child, or feels the child is better
off elsewhere, public or private <I>boarding</I> schools should
be created.  These new schools, financed through philanthropy,
vouchers, and local government money, can also be available to
non-welfare recipients.  The schools should have great latitude
in instilling discipline and responsibility in their students.
 No federal money, mandates, or federal court decisions should
be involved.  This is a plan that can radically change the face
of the inner city, but will only work at a grassroots, hands-on
level.
<P>
Several notable programs are meeting with success with no help
from the federal government.  In Cleveland, the private National
Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Development has
been counseling wayward teens since 1982.  The Institute employs
counselors (available 24 hours a day) assigned to young fathers
and mothers who haven't had parental guidance.  Fifty-seven year-old
Charles Ballard, himself a former teenage father and founder of
the Institute, talks about the requirements for the program: 
<P>
We only insisted on three things.  First, legitimize your child.
 Second, be in school or a GED class.  Third, find a job, no matter
how menial, to learn financial responsibility.  We also spent
a lot of time teaching how to change diapers, to feed and bathe
the child-and how to respect the mother.
<P>
In addition to boarding schools, adoption should be expanded.
 In particular, racism in adoption policies must be abolished.
 Just such a bill, authored by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, is currently
in the House/Senate conference committee.  According to Al Hunt
of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, there are currently 200,000
children available for adoption, 40 percent of which are black.
 Minority children on the average wait twice as long to be adopted,
in part due to a policy position by the National Association of
Black Social Workers, which calls interracial adoptions a &quot;blatant
form of racial and cultural genocide.&quot;  Such ideological
nonsense should not pass for social policy.
<P>
For the mothers who are unable to care for their children, once
relieved of the burden of not having to support them, they can
go to work.  If they have drug or alcohol problems, one-chance
community programs can be implemented.
<P>
In these ways, we can convince pre-teen girls that teenage pregnancy
is an impediment to success, not a path to independence.  The
boarding schools will instill this message clearly and effectively.
 Combined with abstinence (not condom) education, this is a program
that can significantly reduce the teenage pregnancy rate in coming
years.
<P>
<B>FEDERAL MANDATES: TIME FOR A REVOLUTION?</B>
<P>
There is a web of federal statutes that force state governments
to implement various welfare programs, including AFDC.  This labyrinthine
system of mandates hamstrings state legislatures if they want
innovative change.  Assume that a state legislator or the Governor
wants to create a new program to combat AFDC fraud, or amend an
existing program, or even eliminate one.  Included in such legislation
must be a provision for the Department of Social Services to apply
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver
to implement the change.  If HHS refuses, the state legislation
is invalidated.
<P>
During the last 12 years, not a single waiver has been denied
for welfare demonstration projects in California.  However, this
does not mean California has had a free hand in experimenting
with changes in AFDC or other elements of the welfare system.
 State Department of Social Services officials contemplating a
waiver request must calculate the costs, delays, and difficulties
in negotiating a formal waiver request with the federal government.
 Moreover, the request must first be approved <I>internally </I>with
the leadership of the legislature and the Governor's office. 
At this design stage, the request is &quot;pre-negotiated&quot;
with HHS regional and national headquarters staff, and informal
consultation that smokes out the arguments, the obstacles, the
threatened law suits, and the likely outcome.  Thus, all too often
this &quot;pre-negotiated&quot; stage acts as a screen against
genuine change: radical reforms are bartered away for  more &quot;realistic&quot;
ones.  In other words, the fact that waivers must be approved
by the federal government-and now by the federal courts!-determines
the parameters of permissible reform.
<P>
The waiver process itself leads to abominations such as the two
recent Federal Circuit Court decisions (described above) that
have invalidated wavers for California welfare reform.  That states
must apply for &quot;wavers&quot; to decide how they will spend
their tax money is perverse, and must be changed if we are to
make any significant improvements.  Unfortunately, this change
will require changes in federal legislation, which will not occur
without far more aggressive political leadership by governors
and state legislatures.
<P>
There is yet another, more fundamental obstacle to state experimentation
with welfare reform.  States are under many federal mandates that
are costly and burdensome.  But ending the mandates would be only
a first step in creating a policy framework for true reform. 
Bringing full welfare responsibility back to the states will also
require reducing the federal tax burden so that states may have
the fiscal resources to shape and administer alternative plans.
 Without significant federal tax reform as part of a total reformulation
of the federal partnership, shifting full welfare responsibility
to the states would be yet another unfunded mandate.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Our proposals have covered only the AFDC program and the federal-state
nexus fro welfare policy.  We have not examined the General Assistance
programs, largely because they are locally administered.  California
counties are strapped for funds and have ample incentive for policy
innovation-if the state government and federal bureaucracy will
let them do it.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, reform on a comprehensive scale is only
possible through a massive power shift from Washington D.C. back
to the states, followed by further devolution to the counties
and local communities.  Inefficient and perverse programs like
AFDC must be eliminated and their budgets revert back to local
governments, to be replaced by more efficient systems of determining
who are the truly needy.  Innovations like these have heretofore
been stifled by the long arm of federal bureaucracy.
<P>
This policy shift will require a revolution in thinking about
welfare.  Not a revolution from above, but from below, in thousands
of communities across the nation.  Communities are different,
and we should leave administration of welfare for the needy to
them.  No county or state should be forced to apply to Washington
D.C. to change a failed system.
<P>
Congress has exhausted its moral authority in the realm of welfare
policy, and should return welfare to its rightful place in our
political system-to the people in the respective states and counties.
 Then the real revolution can begin.

<B>A Practical, Market-Based Concept to Solve Certain</B>
<P>
<B>Air Quality Problems in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The following paper was  presented at a conference on air quality
cosponsored by The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental
Protection Agency, January 20, 1993, Los Angeles, California.
 </I>
<P>
Nearly everyone but the hard core socialist holdout on his academic
campus agrees that our ecological problems will not be adequately
addressed unless market forces are put to work to control pollution.
 Our efforts to solve these serious problems through police action
have been abysmally ineffective.  Not only have these efforts
been horrendously costly, taking jobs and hastening the de-industrialization
of our country, but they have also threatened our liberty.  Worse,
they have not solved the problem.  So, many of us are in agreement
that we need to go back to what works, the overpowering forces
of the market as the means to address our waste of the environment.
<P>
I would like to present an outline of an idea that is based upon
market principles, which at its core, stresses individual responsibility.
 Without individuals choosing between alternatives, no market
may exist.  Individual accountability is the swiftest and most
effective means to achieve our goals and is the essence of any
market.
<P>
Nobel laureate Ronald Coase demonstrated in &quot;The Problem
of  Social Cost,&quot; that both economic systems (economists)
and blame allocating systems (lawyers) cost society the same number
of dollars when applied to social ills.  If both systems cost
the same, why not continue increasing the regulatory system, exacting
fines from those who pollute.  First, the efficiencies and effectiveness
of using economics instead of blame to deal with social problems
that are generally caused by a majority of the population create
opportunity of choice.  Second, blame is difficult is allocate
among majorities and is ant-democratic.  Third, government lawyers
and their police enforcers  have not surprisingly demonstrated
gross inefficiencies in the area of controlling pollution.  In
summary, it is not possible to regulate clean air.
<P>
Sixty percent of the air pollution of this state is caused by
autos.  A small fraction of this total is caused by commuters
going to and from work.  (That is partly why the car-pool idea,
even when coerced, has not done much about air quality).  The
vast bulk of this air pollution is caused by housewives and other
individuals when they attend to their daily routines and affairs,
privately and efficiently, in their own autos.  These individuals
are very difficult to regulate-that is, it is not possible to
deny them the opportunity to move about by car.  It is this population
of users or buyers in the market that we must address.
<P>
Even though most of the individuals who cause the majority of
the air pollution would like to &quot;do something&quot; about
the problem, there are no opportunities for them to contribute
to the effort.  So, they go about wasting public resources without
regard to the true social cost of their activity other than to
perhaps experience some misguided guilt.  This situation is analogous
to the days when everyone talked about recycling as though it
was someone else's duty.  We all want clean air, but a public
commodity like air is hard to restrict, and is virtually impossible
to package for sale.  Air is the product, but it must be marketed
to the polluter / user.  How can this be done?  By putting a value
on air that is wasted.
<P>
Valuing a common resource poses a problem.  To John Locke the
waste of natural resources was immoral.  Locke's words regarding
the waste of common property are true today.  But, we live in
a relativistic society with little institutional regard for moral
sentiment.  To individuals, Locke's words probably still have
meaning, and I submit this is why they want to &quot;do something&quot;
about the problem.  To institutions, the notion that there is
some moral compunction limiting one's use of public goods is doubtful.
 Nevertheless, our government, which is to exist, &quot;by the
people, and for the people,&quot; may, even in this time of limited
moral accountability, be requested to follow the will of the people.
<P>
Who should put a value on wasted air?  Since it is a public resource,
the logical answer is that the state should initially put a value
on air that is wasted.  How is that value determined?  It should
be determined fairly, equitably and should not be influenced by
false notion that certain individuals have a right, because of
their social status, to pollute.  I suppose that the value of
wasted air could be set in some manner similar to rate setting
for other monopolistic enterprises, with public input.
<P>
How can the wasted air be quantified or sold?  The state of California
has at its disposal and use, extensive, detailed data on the amount
of pollution put into the air by virtually every one of the autos
in the state.  This data is provided by the Smog Check program.
 Each Smog Check testing device records all pertinent data from
each auto registered in the state and that data is stored in digital
memory storage in Sacramento.  Smog Checks are done annually or
bi-annually, depending upon the car's location, and upon each
transfer of the car.  Thus, there is an accurate means of measuring
the amount of air wasted by each auto in areas that do not attain
the standards set by the California Clean Air Act.  The state
should be able to bill each individual for the air that he or
she has wasted with precision during the period between Smog Checks.
 The bill for payment would logically come at the time the car
is registered or re-registered.
<P>
This program could be implemented with little cost of bother to
the state.  The state should alter its shopworn ad valorem system
of licensing fees and replace it with fees paid by the owners
of autos for the value of air wasted by each auto.  Obviously,
this would make low polluting cars very attractive to most people.
 This may not result in an immediate loss of state revenues, but
it most assuredly would have that effect over time because air
pollution from autos would decrease.  Many should cheer this result
on its own merit.  The cost to individuals would vary, according
to their use and wasting of air.  Thus, strong and symbolic incentives
would be given to the individuals to either drive lower polluting
vehicles or drive higher polluting vehicles less.  The choice
would rest with the car owner, not the state.  Like recycling,
wasting air will become not only a matter of conscience, but will
also carry a significant price to the individual choosing to pollute.
 The state would not have to regulate by coercion and thereby
restrict liberty, because the individual would choose how much
he could afford or wished to pollute.
<P>
Since the ad valorem system of taxation on vehicle license fees
is out of place in an age when autos are everyman's, and this
type of tax falls under Proposition 13, the first step to accomplish
this scheme would be for the state legislature to vote by the
supermajority of both houses to implement this program.  Failing
that, a vote of the people could implement this change.
<P>
As the author envisions this program, the cost of this new market
should be approximately equal in terms of dollars to our current
polluted/ regulated status.  In other words, there is no reason
for the state to establish a value for wasted air that is higher
or lower than the tax currently generated by the ad valorem system
of licensing fees.  This is based upon Ronald Coase's theorem
that market focus usually results in the same social cost as a
fault-allocating system.  Since there is presently no fault associated
with one's incremental wasting of air, the current total licensing
fee burden may initially set the value of wasted air.  The state
should not try to make a killing on this market just because it
will play a role in establishing it.  The price of wasted air
would thereafter be adjusted, depending upon the willingness of
the public to tolerate air pollution caused by cars.  Like cigarettes,
pollution may be literally priced out of reach. Or , we may find
a level of air pollution tolerable to the electorate.  Over time,
the improvement in air quality will offset the tremendous costs
of polluted air, enriching everyone.  But most importantly, the
individuals affected by the polluted air will now have a choice
in the matter.
<P>
One may anticipate that the ultra-egalitarians will argue that
individuals of lesser means will be shortchanged by this program.
 After all, under my program the poor must &quot;give up&quot;
something that God has provided them if they cannot afford to
pay for their wasteful use of it.  While I cannot agree with the
philosophy underlying such thinking, I can offer a solution to
this objection.  Presently some $100 millions are collected annually
from surcharges to vehicle registration fees.  These are supposed
to be spent on reducing air pollution caused by motor vehicles.
 Instead of spending all this money on air police employed by
the various air quality agencies, it should be set aside, invested
by private banks and used to provide low-cost loans and other
subsidies to qualified individuals who wish to get rid of their
belchmobiles and trade up into a new low pollution model.  Also,
there is no reason that the revenues raised by my air pricing
system cannot also be used partly for this purpose.  Putting poor
people into a new car may not make them rich, but it may help
them safely and reliably get to work.
<P>
I think that you will agree that this idea is practicable.  It
is timely. It is politically acceptable and realizable.  It would
be a good initial step  toward the establishment of individual
accountability for air pollution.  Best of all, by actually providing
individual incentives to clean up the air, it may mark the beginning
of the end to the ever expanding regulatory police state

<TITLE>THE CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN: BAD MEDICINE FOR CALIFORNIA?
</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 2.0z Beta">

<CENTER>
<B>The Clinton Health Plan:</B>
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine For California's Ailing Economy</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION: A MANUFACTURED CRISIS</B>
<P>
 In 1990, state and federal governments spent $280 billion on
health care, amounting to over 42 percent of health care spending
in the United States.  This is up from just $24.9 billion in 1970.
 The nation's Medicaid bill in 1990 was $34.2 billion, up 150
percent since 1980.  MediCal cost California $9.9 billion in 1990,
up from $3.9 billion in 1983. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted,
government experts predicted that its 1990 budget would be $9
billion to $12 billion in 1990.  In reality it was $107 billion-almost
1000 percent higher than predicted. 
<P>
 Despite these statistics demonstrating government's inability
to control, much less predict, its own health care costs, the
Clinton administration proposes a radical <I>increase</I> in government
control.  To sell the idea, it must convince Americans that their
health care system is in a crisis.  Thus, for instance, we are
told that there are 37 million uninsured Americans. This is extremely
misleading.
<P>
 For one thing, the 37-million figure comes from a snapshot of
society which fails to account for people in-between jobs or recently
married.  In fact, &quot;half of all uninsured spells end within
four months, and only 12 to 13 percent of  the uninsured have
spells that last more than 24 months.&quot;  The Congressional
Budget Office itself has found that 51 percent of the 37 million
are uninsured for less than four months, and 72 percent less than
one year.  Realistically, then, we have 10.4 million Americans
who are without health insurance for twelve months or longer-nowhere
near the 37 million touted by the Clinton Administration.  
<P>
 For another thing, lack of health insurance does not mean lack
of health care.  By law, hospitals may not deny emergency health
care to anyone who walks through the door. Indeed in 1991, the
American Hospital Association estimated that hospitals provide
$10 billion annually in uncompensated care.  Fred Barnes memorably
illustrates the absurdity of the Clinton administration's claims
by revealing the free care now available to a poor uninsured AIDS
patient at a Washington D.C. health clinic: the patient would
be treated immediately, and if circumstances required it, he or
she would be given AZT, which costs $5000 a year.  The doctor
care, the AZT, any other required drugs, and laboratory work would
be financed, mostly by the federal government.
<P>
 In spite of the facts of the matter, the Clinton public relations
campaign has been effective.  The Center for Health Care Policy
and Evaluation examined 29 public opinion surveys over a two year
period and found that nine out of ten Americans indeed believe
there is a health care crisis.  When asked to relate health care
problems to their own personal situation, however, 70 percent
of Americans were &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;somewhat
satisfied&quot; with the quality and availability of coverage.
 Satisfaction levels increased with income, but even 61 percent
of those making less than $20,000 a year were satisfied.  A Gallup
poll in May 1993 showed that 81 percent are &quot;satisfied with
the quality of health care for themselves and their families.&quot;

<P>
 What explains the mixed signals given by public opinion polls?
 While there is no crisis in access to health care, some health
care costs are soaring.  The goal of health care reform should
be to lower these costs, including and especially the costs for
the uninsured who receive medical care from emergency rooms. 
We will suggest below how such cost containment might be accomplished
without the radical bureaucratization of the Clinton-plan, which
judging from the history of government intervention in health
care and other areas, would lead to soaring rather than lower
costs.
<P>
<B>HEALTH CARE REFORM IN CALIFORNIA TODAY</B>
<P>
 In 1993 California enacted a form of managed competition, establishing
a Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC) to negotiate
with insurance companies on behalf of small businesses.  Businesses
with between five and 50 employees are allowed to join on a voluntary
basis.  In 1997 eligibility will increase to businesses with as
few as three employees. 
<P>
 California's HIPC provides a wide choice of plans to member businesses.
 Early results are encouraging: 32,587 Californians are already
enrolled.  Twenty-one percent of participating employers didn't
previously offer health insurance.  The rest are obtaining coverage
at a lower cost.
<P>
 HIPC does use a form of price control-no insurer may charge 20%
above the average premium-but since the plan is voluntary, businesses
and insurance companies can choose to leave HIPC if they find
a better option.  The system's weakness is that it does not sufficiently
address cost containment.  Included in the HIPC bill were provisions
reforming MediCal and malpractice insurance, but one of the major
causes of inflated medical costs, third party payment for health
care, is left unaddressed.  Still, HIPC provides a good foundation
for any further needed reform.
<P>
 Already the California legislature is considering such reform.
 For instance, Senator Bill Leonard introduced a bill last year
to create Medisave accounts.  It died in the Revenue and Taxation
Committee, but Leonard will submit a scaled back version of the
bill again this year as a pilot program for some state employees.
<P>
 One of the worst consequences of the Clinton health care plan
is that it would cut short the innovations in health care reform
now taking place in the 50 states.  Here in California, for instance,
it would eliminate the existing improvements brought by the HIPC
and force the creation of quasi-governmental bodies called &quot;Health
Alliances.&quot;
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: EMPOWERING A NEW BUREAUCRACY</B>
<P>
<B>An Overview</B>
<P>
 The Clinton administration's claim that its health care plan
will help control costs was dealt a major setback on February
8, when the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified
to Congress that the &quot;premiums&quot; to be paid by employers
under the Clinton plan are, indeed, a tax, and that the plan will
add $74 billion to the federal budget deficit, rather than reduce
it by $58 billion as the White House has claimed.
<P>
 At the top of the pyramid of the Clinton health care bureaucracy
would be the National Health Board (NHB), comprised of seven members
appointed by the President to four year terms.  Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala described the proposed NHB as
a &quot;relatively minor oversight group.&quot;  In truth, it
would establish &quot;global budgets&quot; and &quot;premium targets&quot;
for state governments as well as establish and oversee a package
of  benefits which insurance companies would be required to offer
and which consumers would be forced to buy.  The NHB would also
&quot;certify&quot; individual state compliance with their specifications.
<P>
 Consider just the establishing of &quot;global budgets&quot;
by this &quot;minor agency.&quot;  These budgets-a form of price
controls; they set an advance limit on total health care expenditures-are
meant to encourage savings through increased efficiency.  The
history of price controls, however, teaches us clearly that they
end in restricting supply.  In this case, restricted supply coupled
with increased demand for health care-universal coverage-will
inevitably lead to some form of health care rationing.  (Canada's
provinces all operate under global budgets.  As a result, Canadian
hospitals close beds for part of the year, limit the number of
operations performed, or use what are known as &quot;bed blockers&quot;less
costly patients occupying beds that could be used to serve those
with more costly diseases.  Thus the infamous months-long waiting
lists for major surgeries.  Needless to say, in Canada as in Europe,
politicians in need of surgery go directly to the head of the
line, while everyone else waits, often in severe pain.)
<P>
 The Clinton plan creates several new bureaucratic agencies in
addition to NHB, including (but not limited to) the following:
<P>
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR):  collects
and analyzes data from Patient Outcome Research Teams (PORTs),
which gather physician and hospital medical practice patterns.
<P>
Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council (LTCIAC): a five-member
board appointed by the secretary of Health and Human Services
to &quot;monitor the development of the insurance market.&quot;
<P>
National Health Advisory Committee (NHAC): advises the NHB and
is comprised of  &quot;representatives of states, health providers,
employers, consumers and affected industries.&quot;
<P>
National Health Data Advisory Council (NHDAC): &quot;oversees
the information and data activities, including standard setting
and privacy protection, of the federal government under health
care reform.&quot;
<P>
National Privacy Panel (NPP): ensures &quot;privacy protection
as applied to health information.&quot;
<P>
Premium Target Advisory Commission (PTAC): appointed by the NHB
to recommend adjustments to the methodology for calculating premium
targets.
<P>
Risk Adjustment Advisory Committee (RAAC): institutes the &quot;Risk
Adjustment System&quot; which will set &quot;premium payments
to health plans to reflect the level of risk assumed for patients
enrolled in comparison to the average population in the area.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to creating new government agencies and expanding
duties of existing agencies such as the Departments of Labor and
Health and Human Services, the Clinton health care plan would
create programs to train physicians and to mandate what specialties
medical students will study-or whether they will study a specialty
at all-on the basis of &quot;national need.&quot;
<P>
<B>Health Alliances</B>
<P>
 The Clinton health care plan would operate on individual Americans
most directly through regional health alliances.  These alliances,
like the current HIPC in California, are non-profit bodies created
to negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of businesses.
The similarities, however, stop there.  For one thing, there is
nothing voluntary about participation.  Due to the so-called &quot;employer
mandate&quot; component of the plan, all businesses with under
5000 employees would be forced to buy their insurance through
their regional alliance. Each employer's &quot;premium&quot; would
be 80 percent of their employees' health insurance costs, although
no company would be obligated to pay more than 7.9 percent of
its payroll.  The Clinton plan currently offers federal subsidies
on a sliding scale to companies with fewer than 75 employees.
 For example, the smallest businesses will pay premiums of no
more than 3.5 percent of payroll, and others will be subsidized
at various rates up to 7.9 percent.  The Clinton administration
has proclaimed the exact amounts of the subsidies to be negotiable.
<P>
 Health alliances would have the sole power to determine which
health plans operate in their geographic area and to decide how
those plans are presented to the public, effectively limiting
choices and eliminating competitive advertising.  Alliances may
exclude a health plan for a number of reasons: for exceeding the
average premium by 20 percent, for failing to have the &quot;capacity
to deliver services,&quot; etc.  Obviously the government, not
the consumer, will decide these things.  (The Clintons maintain
against reason that health alliances aren't the government.  But
what else can one call not-for-profit agencies created by legislation
to carry out such functions?)
<P>
 Health alliances would also have the power of the purse, that
is, the power to levy taxes:  They would be authorized to assess
businesses and workers up to 2.5 percent of their insurance premiums
to provide for the alliance's &quot;administrative allowance,&quot;
plus up to 1.5 percent of premiums to fund federal academic health
centers and graduate medical educational programs.  And in order
to comply with the global budget set by the NHB, alliances are
authorized to impose fee schedules on doctor's services.
<P>
 At least one of the plans offered in each alliance must be a
fee-for-service plan, in which consumers pay directly for a doctor's
care.  But this plan would be subject to strict price controls,
and the absence of tax relief for such expenses would make it
untenable for all but the rich.  If an individual refuses to join
a plan from the health alliance, they may obtain other insurance,
but will be charged double the premium they would otherwise have
paid.
<P>
<B>Community Rating</B>
<P>
 The most egregious problem with the Clinton plan is what is known
as &quot;community rating.&quot;-a complicated way of saying that
everyone in a given alliance area is charged the same insurance
premium regardless of health risk or condition.  The top ten causes
of death in the United States are behavior-related; community
rating provides no incentives for people with unhealthy behavior
to change their ways.  And it would supersede a longstanding tradition
of fairness in the insurance industry which &quot;protects insured
persons from paying excessive amounts to subsidize high-risk policyholders
and groups.&quot;  One commentator has concluded that community
rating undermines the very idea of insurance:
<P>
Healthy people purchase health insurance because they fear the
possible financial consequences of illness.  People purchase health
insurance while they are well, so that they will have it when
they are ill.  However, if health insurance become available regardless
of health status, much of the incentive to pay for health insurance
while healthy will be removed.  For many people, it will be a
rational choice to do without health insurance until the need
arises.
<P>
 The Clinton plan's answer to this problem, of course, is to force
everyone to buy high-priced, standard-package benefits, thereby
subsidizing high risk patients in the same alliance region.
<P>
 Beginning in 1993, the State of New York has operated under community
rating.  As a result, the average price for commercial insurance
is up 18 percent, and has more than doubled for some New Yorkers.
 The table below dramatically demonstrates the economic effects
of community rating.

<B>The Divisive Politics of the Clinton Plan</B>
<P>
 Taken together, regional health alliances and community rating
are a recipe for political gerrymandering.  The Clinton plan tries
to account for this problem by mandating that &quot;the entire
portion of a metropolitan statistical area location in a state
shall be included in the same alliance area.&quot; But this will
not keep politicians from fighting and conniving to place their
constituents out of high health risk areas like San Francisco
or Los Angeles, or areas with acute illegal alien populations
such as San Diego, in order to get the lower community-rated premiums.
 
<P>
 As Elizabeth McCaughey has written,  &quot;Everyone will figure
out that you get more health care for your dollar or pay lower
premiums in an alliance without inner-city problems.  The plan
will bear an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate.&quot;
Real estate prices will be drastically affected by all this reshuffling,
as businesses and homeowners attempt to leave high risk alliance
regions.
<P>
<B>Impact on the California Economy</B>
<P>
 Most economic impact studies on the Clinton plan have had a national
focus, but one can extrapolate from them a dire prognosis for
California.  Lewin-VHI, a non-partisan research firm based in
Virginia, found that 67 percent of firms not now providing insurance
will be forced to pay at least $1,000 per year extra per employee,
and that half of all working-age households will pay more for
health care under the Clinton plan.  Professors June and David
O'Neill of Baruch College estimate that 3.1 million jobs will
be lost as a result of the employer mandate alone.  Seventy-five
percent of these jobs will be concentrated in service industries
such as restaurants and agriculture.
<P>
 The most prominent study to date examining the effect specifically
on California comes from the Legislative Analyst's Office.  It
estimates the Clinton plan might result in 75,000 lost jobs. 
At the same time it estimates an eventual annual savings to the
state of several hundred millions of dollars.  But most of this
savings comes from shifting the financial burden of health care
to the federal budget, and away from state and county budgets.
 That is, California's taxpayers will still foot the increased
bill for the Clinton plan through federal taxes.
<P>
 The estimated savings in the Legislative Analyst's study amount
to the federal government assuming the burden for some services,
while the estimated costs generally amount to new mandates on
the state government.  For example, the Clinton plan requires
that states share the costs of a new federal program for home
and community based long-term care.  The Analyst predicts a cost
of $200 million in 1996 and higher thereafter.  We must keep in
mind though that the federal government can easily unload its
funding responsibility for the plan onto the states at a future
date.  This occurred in the mid-1980s when federal &quot;Revenue
Sharing&quot; was the first item to get chopped when Congress
started cutting costs.
<P>
 The Clinton administration also plans to increase federal taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol, which the state already taxes, as a
way to help fund the plan.  The Legislative Analyst predicts the
new federal levies will reduce state revenue by $200 million.
<P>
 The Wilson administration is worried about several adverse effects
of the Clinton plan on the California economy.  First and foremost
is the devastating effect of the employer mandate on small businesses,
which account for 85 percent of California's new jobs.  A White
House official's recent response to an expression of concern about
California job loss was unsettling:  &quot;We haven't factored
that in at this point.&quot;
<P>
 A survey of the 48,000 California members of the National Federation
of Independent Business revealed that over 90% oppose the employer
mandate feature of the Clinton plan.  They do not believe that
the promised subsidies for the smallest businesses will work over
the long term.  Such subsidies will simply put more strain on
the federal government to provide something else for which it
doesn't have the means.  Moreover, the subsidies require new appropriations
each year, and can be easily reduced or eliminated by Congress
after the health care plan is entrenched, putting the burden on
the states, whose coffers are already depleted.
<P>
<B>The Death Knell of Federalism</B>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, by January 1, 1997, California must
submit a report to the National Health Board detailing how it
intends to comply with the Clinton plan.  If any state resists,
the secretary of Health and Human Services has two options: she
may withhold federal funds for hospitals and other federally funded
programs in the state or, failing that, she may do what is &quot;necessary&quot;
to make sure that the &quot;comprehensive benefits package is
provided to eligible individuals in the state during the year.&quot;
 In lieu of state compliance, she may also assess yet another
tax on premiums-up to 15 percent-to offset administrative overhead
in setting up one or more regional alliances in a non-participating
state.
<P>
 If the Clinton plan becomes law, the only option available to
the states besides compliance is a state-instituted &quot;single-payer&quot;
system.  Thus Assembly Bill 16, authored by Assemblyman Burt Margolin,
and Senate Bill 1098, authored by Senator Art Torres, which would
implement a Clinton-type plan on the state level.  These Clinton
clones include state global budgets, a seven member California
Health Commission responsible for creating a standard benefits
package, and are written &quot;in anticipation of federal action.&quot;
<P>
 In short, the Clinton plan will effectively usurp the authority
of state governments over health care policy.  Constitutional
justifications for like infringements on state powers in recent
years have cited the power of Congress to regulate commerce, a
power originally meant to override interstate trade barriers.
 In <I>Wickard v. Filburn</I> in 1942, however, the Supreme Court
used the commerce clause to rule that a farmer growing wheat for
his own consumption had an effect on interstate commerce.  Therefore,
Congress was permitted to bar him from doing so.  David Rivkin
warns that the Clinton plan threatens to stretch the commerce
clause to dangerous new limits:
<P>
 If the courts uphold Congress's authority to impose this system,
they must once and for all draw the curtain on the Constitution
of 1787 and admit that there is nothing that Congress cannot do
under the Commerce Clause.... For example, if Congress thinks
Americans are too fat-many are-and that this somehow will affect
interstate commerce, can it not decree that Americans shall lose
weight?  Indeed, under the new system, any activity that might
increase the costs of health care might be regulatable.
<P>
<B>MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B>
<P>
 The largest health-care cost-containment problem comes from the
fact that most medical bills are paid by third parties.  This
reduces efficiency because patients do not feel they are spending
their own money.  J. Patrick Rooney, Chairman of  Golden Rule
Insurance, employs an analogy to demonstrate the point:
<P>
Imagine if employers provided &quot;grocery credit cards&quot;
as a fringe benefit the same way they now provide employee health
care.  It would pay 80 percent of an employee's food bill after
a $100 per year deductible, then, 100% after the first $5,000.
 If that were a fringe benefit like health care, grocery stores
would stack only the highest-price food because that is all that
employees would want to buy.... People spend their own money on
food.... Hence, grocery prices are not increasing in the range
of 15 to 20 percent per year the way health care spending has
been.
<P>
 The use of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) can change this destructive
pattern. These are tax-free accounts, similar to IRAs.  Employers
would purchase high-deductible, lower-premium health insurance
policies, and put the difference in the MSA to cover the deductibles.
 Employees would contribute, for example, up to $3,000 a year
to cover routine medical expenses.  At the end of the year, money
not spent on health care can be taken out of the MSA (subject
to income taxes) or rolled over for medical expenses in the next
year.  Since Americans never spend on health care in a year what
they spend on health insurance, money will usually be left over
at the end of the year.
<P>
 As competition for the savings account money increases, prices
will fall, making health insurance affordable for more and more
businesses and individuals.
<P>
 Vouchers might be provided to the poor for MSAs instead of, or
in addition to, the MediCal coverage they now receive.  This would
have the immediate effect of allowing doctors to compete for MediCal
patients rather than struggling to avoid them, because they lose
so much money in treating them in the highly regulated MediCal
market.
<P>
 The main objection to MASs concerns the numbers.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the difference between the premiums
of high-deductible policies is insufficient to cover the deductible
that must be paid in the event of a catastrophe.  However, in
any given year, it is likely that the deductible will go unused.
 In Los Angeles in 1992, for example, health care costs for 88
per cent of the population were below $3,000.  In Chicago and
Cincinnati the numbers were 90 and 92 percent respectively. Even
if the CBO's estimate is correct, then, the contributions of one
year could be rolled over into the second year. As a last resort,
more of the employees' wages can be placed in the account to cover
the deductible.  While  the employee would see less take home
pay, the money could be removed at the end of the year if there
was no medical emergency requiring deductible payment.
<P>
 Another objection to MSAs is that people won't go to the doctor
as often if they know they are spending their own money.  But
this is the real key to cost containment.  Someone must decide
to spend money on health care or on something else.  Advocates
of MSAs believe the individual should do so-not the government.
<P>
<B>Medicare/ Medical Reform</B>
<P>
 As shown at the outset of this report, Medicare and MediCal costs
have exploded over the last 15 years.  The surest solution to
this is to inject competition into the system. For instance, vouchers
could be issued to both Medicare and MediCal recipients by which
they could purchase a private insurance policy or start a medical
savings account.
<P>
<B>Medical Liability Reform</B>
<P>
 Malpractice insurance cost hospitals and doctors $10 billion
in 1991, and that cost is estimated to rise to $15 billion in
1998.  The costs of &quot;defensive medicine&quot;- doctors ordering
unnecessary tests to guard against lawsuits-was $27 billion in
1993.  In a recent study of lawsuits filed against hospitals and
doctors in New York, 80 percent were found to be without basis.
To curb this trend we might adopt the rule that the loser pays
all lawyers' fees, a practice most other countries in the world
employ to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Insurance Mandates</B>
<P>
 The number of state laws mandating that insurance companies include
certain benefits rose from 48 in 1974 to over 700 in 1991.  These
mandates raise the prices of minimum benefits and make insurance
too costly for people with the lowest incomes-thus increasing
the number of uninsured.  This could be solved by offering a &quot;no
frills&quot; package of benefits to the public, absent the expensive
mandates.
<P>
<B>Occupational Licensing</B>
<P>
 By restricting entry into the medical profession, licensing laws
have increased the price of medical services.  While needed to
protect the consumer, these laws can be amended to increase efficiency.
 For instance, hospitals might be given more leeway in licensing
personnel for routine services.
<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE CLINTON PLAN</B>
<P>
<B>The Chafee Plan:</B>
<P>
 Senator John Chafee's proposal has the essential structure of
the Clinton plan, but injects some competition into the formula.
 It would eliminate the employer mandate and avoids spending caps
and global budgeting.  States would be required to set up purchasing
cooperatives similar to health alliances, but more than one would
be allowed in a given geographic area.  A national commission
would establish a minimum benefits package.
<P>
 Under the Chafee proposal, health plans &quot;may not discriminate
on the basis of  health status.&quot;  This amounts to community
rating and all the problems that entails.  Chafee would create
MSAs, but they are not central to the plan.  The main problem
with the Chafee plan is the potential for expansion.  Hillary
Clinton herself has said that the Chafee plan is a good first
step, since much of the structure (National Health Board, standard
benefits package, community rating) is already in the bill and
may be easily expanded later.
<P>
<B>The Cooper Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Congressman Jim Cooper's proposal has much in common with both
Clinton and Chafee.  It eliminates the employer mandate, but a
national commission would establish a minimum benefits package
and premiums offered by the cooperatives will be community rated.
 The Cooper plan has been supported by some business groups, most
notably the Business Roundtable.  But it contains provisions that
impose significant costs and constraints on business, and which
can be easily expanded once the program is in place. William Kristol
has pointed out that through changes in the tax code in the Cooper
plan, &quot;businesses that today offer their employees generous
health plans would effectively be forced either to accept the
government's more austere benefit limits or face stiff economic
penalties.&quot;
<P>
 Another onerous provision of the Cooper bill  requires all business
firms with fewer than 100 employees (about 93% of all businesses)
to register with regional Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives,
forward information about all their full- and part-time employees,
and deduct from all paychecks the cost of health care premiums-whether
or not the firms were providing health care coverage.  The Cooper
plan doesn't include MSAs.  Like Clinton, its implementation would
require a massive tax hike.
<P>
<B>The Nickles Plan</B> 
<P>
 Senator Don Nickles' proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, which serves 10 million federal workers,
and gives its members a choice of nearly 30 plans with a variety
of benefits and prices.
<P>
 Nickles calls his bill &quot;The Consumer Choice Health Security
Act.&quot;  It would outlaw exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
cap medical malpractice awards, and require only that Americans
buy catastrophic health insurance.  A potential drawback is that
&quot;underwriting&quot; would not be allowed beyond age, sex,
and geography, a restriction that is only slightly better than
a full community rating.  But insurance companies would be allowed
to give incentive discounts to promote healthy behavior.
<P>
 The focal point of the Nickles MSAs, into which participants
could put up to $3,000 per year plus $500 for every dependent,
tax-free.  Tax credits would be offered to the poor to purchase
their own MSAs.
<P>
<B>The Gramm Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Senator Phil Gramm's proposal differs little from Nickles.  It
would institute medical savings accounts and leave most choices
up to the health care consumer.  Unlike Nickles, Gramm does not
require individuals to buy catastrophic insurance; rather it institutes
a wage garnishing mechanism to punish those who abuse the system.
 The Gramm plan has no community rating, though it does offer
some relief for individuals with pre-existing conditions.  And
it would require that losers pay winners' fees in malpractice
cases.   
<P>
 All of the these congressional alternatives offer cuts in Medicare
and Medicaid, as well as malpractice reform.  A final bill will
likely have these included.
<P>
 From California's perspective, any one of these plans would be
preferable to Clinton, since all avoid the job-killing employer
mandate.  Only Nickles and Gramm, however, avoid the other major
problems of the Clinton plan, and clearly address the cost-containment
obstacle of third-party payment.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
  No one believes that the revolutionary Clinton health care plan
will pass without being &quot;melded&quot; to Cooper or some version
of Chafee-Cooper.  It is unlikely any of the plans can pass in
the Senate without some Republican votes or in the House without
moderate Democrats.  The key question is this:  Will Republicans
and moderate Democrats hold out for a genuine alternative that
avoids a federal takeover of the health care industry and massive
new taxes to finance it?
<P>
 The answer may depend on how coherent the Republicans' alternative
plan is, and how persuasive Senators Dole, Nickles, Gramm and
other Republicans can be in taking it to the nation.
<P>
 Rejecting the &quot;crisis&quot; atmosphere fostered by the Clinton
propaganda machine is the first step in resisting the Clinton-Cooper
juggernaut.  The second step is an insistence on honest numbers
and truth-in-packaging.  The third step is to show courage in
resisting and rebutting the White House demagoguery against the
health care industry.  If these steps are taken, it will be possible
to gain widespread public support for an alternative plan that
provides practical remedies to real problems.
<P>
 Some health care reform-changing the federal tax code to allow
for medical savings accounts and Medicare reform, for example-must
be done in Washington.  But aside from these federal actions,
health care reform should be left to the states.  The best strategy
is to support market-oriented plans at the federal level that
won't encroach on the right of California and other states to
implement their own modifications in the future.  The Clinton
plan closes the door not only to consumer choice but to California's
policy options as well.

<B>The California Teachers Association:</B>
<P>
<B>Power Politics vs. Education Reform</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Editor's Note
<P>
<I> This is the first in a series of reports on the California
Teachers Association and its role in the California public policy
arena. It sketches the outlines of a large and energetic organization,
and lays the groundwork for future reports on the CTA's pervasive
impact on California's educational system.</I>
<P>
<I> We will try to shed light on the CTA's record of opposition
to meaningful education reform-from alternative certification
and merit pay to charter schools, parental choice, and district
decentralization. We will explore its operations at the local
level-its collective bargaining strategies, its  relationships
with local school boards and superintendents, its role in the
fiscal mismanagement of local school districts, and its efforts
to obstruct charter schools. We will also spotlight CTA's not
negligible contribution to the state's budget and fiscal crisis
through Proposition 98 and other political stratagems. (Be forewarned:
the CTA is considering a &quot;Super-Prop. 98&quot;  initiative
measure that &quot;closes the loopholes&quot; and guarantees the
schools an even bigger slice of state outlays. It could be called
the Kevorkian Amendment: assisted suicide for the state budget.)</I>
<P>
<I> It is not accurate or fair to blame all of the state's education
woes on the teachers' union. Others have contributed and deserve
recognition. Some big city school boards (like Los Angeles Unified)
have failed at both management and leadership: those mammoth districts
need to be broken up.  The educational media have not been the
most vigilant watchdogs of the public interest in covering educational
matters: reporters' attention span is short and they often behave
like PR flaks for the education industry. What the PTA-or the
PTSA-stands for is hard to discern, but it is not parent empowerment.</I>
<P>
<I> Yet by far the most disappointing performance has been that
of the business community. With a few notable exceptions, business
leaders are surprisingly naive in dealing with educational matters.
Always seeking a safe &quot;middle road,&quot;  they're easily
coaxed  into supporting incremental add-ons and enhancements,
particularly if the new funds are targeted on &quot;at-risk&quot;
kids. (We should ask why the definition and number of &quot;at
risk&quot; students keep growing, and whether rewarding schools
with more money for finding more children &quot;at risk&quot;
is a good idea. In the business world, if you subsidize something,
you tend to get more of it. Is there any reason to expect anything
different in education?) The result is that nothing much changes
in public education except the price tag. Our schools aren't any
better than a decade ago, they just cost more.</I>
<P>
<I> Who is responsible for this state of affairs? California legislators,
State Board of Education members, the state school chief, elected
school board officials- are all accountable to the public, however
imperfectly. What about the CTA?  The CTA  is accountable only
to its members-which is fine; it is a private organization. The
problem arises when it claims to speak not for its members' interests
but</I><B> <I>for our children's future</I></B><I>. The point
was perfectly illustrated by American Federation of Teachers president
Albert Shanker's quip, &quot;I'll start representing kids when
kids start paying union dues.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I> The CTA can't have it both ways. If the level of  teachers'
salaries and benefits were the measure of school quality, California
would have the 7th best schools in the nation. Our public schools
rank 29th in math proficiency, 42nd in high school graduation
rates, and near the top only in one category-public disaffection.</I>
<P>
<I> It's time for our public officials to look beyond the familiar
rhetoric of &quot;more is better.&quot; More centralization is
not better. More categorical aid is not better. More strikes are
not better. More school district bankruptcies are not better.
More state debt is not better.  The only way to foster the needed
economies, innovation, and accountability is through a new kind
of thinking. Instead of trying to &quot;reinvent&quot; schools
from the top down, why not a revolution <B>from the bottom up-</B>through
radical decentralization, expanded charter schools and charter
districts, alternative certification of teachers,  and parental
choice? Such actions would set in motion a new dynamic:  local
communities could redesign their own schools without permission
from bureaucrats.</I>
<P>
<I> </I>
<P>
<I> The CTA stands across the path to such innovation, saying,
&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Born of the struggles of the 70s,
it fears change in the 90s, and it means to fight any threat to
its financial empire. But it cannot hold back the tide of change
forever. Parents will continue to flee government schools in search
of a better education for their children, especially in the inner
cities. Creative teachers and talented principals increasingly
will seek out charter schools and other escape hatches. And savvy
politicians will learn that the empowerment strategy pays dividends
for everyone.</I>
<P>
<I> The task of bringing fundamental change to public education
in California will require more than summits and public relations
wizardry. The good news is-it doesn't require more money. What
it does require is more leadership.     </I>

<P>
    &quot;Follow the money.&quot;
<P>
    - Deep Throat in <I>All the President's Men</I>
<P>
 The California Teachers Association (CTA) operates what most
observers consider the best organized and most effective political
machine in the state.  Affiliated with the National Education
Association (NEA), the CTA's influence on California government
is unmatched by any business or trade group. Its political clout
is envied by other special interest lobbies.  It wages ferocious
political battle when its vital interests are at stake-which is
to say, its economic interests. 
<P>
 CTA represents teachers in over 950 of the state's 1,006 public
school districts, at most community colleges, and in the 19-campus
California State University system.  CTA's 235,000 membership
includes 186,600 full-time teachers and 39,900 associate members.
 Another 8,500 non-members are required to pay &quot;representation&quot;
fees to CTA for contract negotiations and collective bargaining.
<P>
 CTA's affluence (and influence) arises mainly from its large
membership and regular source of income, consisting of mandatory
teachers' dues.  With membership of more than 235,000, its annual
budget approaches $74 million.  A CTA member pays $600 per year-$200
more than the national average-with the NEA netting $99, CTA $376,
and local chapters $125.  (A chapter is defined as a local unit
of self-governance, chartered through CTA and affiliated with
NEA.)
<P>
 More than a third of all school districts-and all major districts-operate
as agency shops, thus forcing non-union teachers to pay the CTA
for collective bargaining expenses (although not for political
activities, under current law).  As of September 1991, 357 of
the approximately 900 CTA-chartered locals operated under agency
shop rules.   
<P>
 In a &quot;fair share&quot; agreement, a teacher with religious-
or philosophically-based objections against CTA membership must
contribute the equivalent dues amount to a CTA-approved charity.
In 1993-94 the 8,500 non-union members will pay $2,350,000-or
3.6 percent-of CTA's current budget.
<P>
 The amount of such &quot;representation fees&quot; is determined
by the union, unless challenged in court by an individual teacher.
 According to the Public Employees Relation Board (PERB), CTA
set its representation fees for the 1991/92 school year at 81.5%,
or about $300.  For 1993/94, the CTA adjusted the amount downward
to just over three-quarters of its spending.  In other words,
the CTA claims (under oath) that it uses 76.1% of all revenues
for negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  
<P>
 The CTA also imposes special levies on its members.  A recent
levy will generate over $12 million over three years, with funds
going to pay costs of defeating Proposition 174, the voucher initiative.
 Another levy instituted in 1990 yielded over $2 million for a
television campaign to protect Proposition 98-the 1988 Constitutional
Amendment guaranteeing a minimum funding level for public education.
<P>
 The CTA's clout is due not only to its financial resources but
to its vast membership, which can be mobilized in every state
legislative district down to the precinct level.  It has become
adept at guerrilla warfare as well, as seen in efforts to obstruct
and sabotage signature gathering to get Proposition 174 on the
ballot.
<P>
 A discussion of the emergence of public sector unions is beyond
the scope of this paper. But it is important to understand that
the emergence of teachers' unions is part of a larger phenomenon,
the rise of public sector unions in state and local government.
Secondly, it is important to note that this rise has been simultaneous
with the <I>decline</I> of unionization in the private sector
since 1960. Public sector unions have inherited all the folklore
and political mythology of traditional unions, but they are in
fact far more powerful than their private sector counterparts
ever were. The reason for this is essentially the absence of any
external market constraints on the demands public sector unions
can make: the only constraints are political, not economic. Thus,
when politics becomes the handmaiden of  politicized unions, and
politicians are so tied to them that they fail to balance competing
interests, public policy and the public interest are the victims.
<P>
 That the self-interest of its members is the touchstone of CTA
policy is made clear by the CTA mission statement, in case anyone
had any doubts.  According to the CTA's &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives: 1992-94,&quot; its central mission is threefold:
 &quot;To protect and promote the well-being of its members; to
advance the cause of free, universal, and quality public education;
and to contribute to the establishment of a more just, equitable
and democratic society.&quot;
<P>
That the interests of its members come first in this trilogy is
not news, but it is good to keep it in mind when listening to
CTA rhetoric about the needs of children. And, of course, &quot;free,
universal ...education&quot; will be pursued all the more energetically
if the union is in the politically protected position of being
the sole provider of this &quot;quality&quot; education. The document
then lists 11 institutional goals for 1992-94 in order to pursue
CTA's mission:
<P>

<P>
CTA ASCENDANCY
<P>
 In the 1960s, certified teachers and classified school employees
(e.g., &quot;clerical&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; workers)
were represented by employee organizations within school districts.
 These organizations were limited to representing their members
only, and could meet and confer over a school board's policies
of employment without negotiating a binding contract.
<P>
 CTA rewrote its constitution in the early 1970s to exclude administrators
as members and became more involved in collective bargaining for
its teacher members.  In 1975, Senate Bill 160 (Rhodda) and the
Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) were signed by Governor
Jerry Brown.  The Rhodda Act required school districts to recognize
elected unions as the sole bargaining agents and to negotiate
binding contracts with them.  Under the EERA, a union could become
the exclusive representative either in certification by the Public
Employee Relations Board (PERB) or by voluntary employer recognition.

<P>
 Many of the pre-existing certified teachers and classified school
employees' organizations established in the 1960s and early 1970s
remained largely unaffected by the EERA's new collective bargaining
system.  That was the case until 1982, when Governor Edmund G.
&quot;Jerry&quot; Brown granted forced dues privileges to state
employee unions, including teacher unions.  And in 1983, automatic
deduction of non-member &quot;agency&quot; fees became negotiable
for teachers unions.  
<P>
 In 1978, the struggle over collective bargaining rights was eclipsed
by Proposition 13, which slashed property taxes-the major source
of school funding.  At that time CTA's political action committee
and fragmented state organization was ineffective against the
initiative's juggernaut.  CTA President Ed Foglia explained: &quot;We
came to understand that politics is not just a publicity campaign.
 Politics is door-to-door-the kinds of things that you have to
do in order to win elections.&quot;
<P>
 Subsequently, Foglia helped develop a &quot;Blueprint for Political
Action,&quot; which is CTA's centralized system of data retrieval,
voter registration, absentee canvassing and extensive member education.
 This fostered a consolidation and integration of CTA's campaign
apparatus and statewide lobbying infrastructure.  
<P>
 In 1983 Alice Huffman, a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, was hired as a lobbyist for CTA.  The following year she
was promoted to director of government relations, and soon after
CTA's political action committee was making the top ten lists
of state campaign donors.  Huffman's major accomplishment was
to help CTA better mobilize its economic resources and &quot;people
power&quot; in shaping public policy.  As Huffman points out,
she &quot;politicized&quot; CTA, overseeing the fine tuning of
a sophisticated grass-roots operation in which a chapter can,
on short notice, mobilize the people-power to man phone banks,
 walk precincts, or host media events.  Says Huffman, &quot;I
had to teach them that they [CTA] could do the right thing and
be successful.&quot;
<P>
CTA OPERATIONS
<P>
 Registered with the IRS as a 501(c)(5) non-profit labor organization,
CTA is exempt from property taxes. It receives tax deductible
contributions as well as government grants for educational research.
 With headquarters in  Burlingame, the thirty-one CTA offices
from San Diego to Eureka occupy 204,100 square feet of office
space.  
<P>
 CTA has approximately 480 full-time employees on its payroll,
nearly half the number employed by the state Department of Education
to direct the entire statewide education bureaucracy.  Included
in the CTA total are 21 managers and assistant managers, who are
paid an average of $110,000 per year (excluding benefits, which
are generous) to oversee CTA's 17 departments. These include Governance,
Governmental Relations,  Association for Better Citizenship (CTA/ABC
- CTA's political action committee), Group Legal Services, and
Training and Bargaining Services.  Three other departments-Communications,
Human Rights, and Instruction &amp; Professional Development-work
together to make up the Information and Development Division,
under the supervision of the associate executive director.  
<P>
GOVERNANCE
<P>
 There are two categories to CTA Governance: policy making and
policy implementation.  Policy making occurs at both the state
and chapter levels.  Smaller chapters hold regular meetings to
adopt policies and determine program direction, while larger chapters
delegate policy authority to an elected body, called the State
Council of Education. 
<P>
 The State Council is a 660-plus member representative body which
serves as the legislative and policy-making arm for the membership.
 Representatives are elected from among the state's rank-and-file
teachers.  The ratio of  representation is 1:350 members, so small
chapters share Council delegates while large chapters have more
than one.  The State Council has thirteen standing committees
that assist in developing recommendations to implement CTA policy.
 Policies are approved by a simple majority voice vote of Council
delegates.
<P>
 Among other duties, the Council approves the increasingly frequent
special levies, which is used to fund CTA's political action and
advertising efforts. Recently, the Council was asked to approve
a $6 dues increase, designed to raise an additional $1,000,000
annually,  &quot;for future political struggles,&quot; including
a possible 1996 initiative campaign for a successor to Proposition
98.  The Council is expected to approve the dues hike at its June
1994 meeting. This new levy would come on top of the $19 annual
surcharge approved in 1993 to fund the campaign against Proposition
174. A prior surcharge of  $12 in 1991 raised $2.4 million for
the advertising blitz that helped derail Governor Wilson's effort
to suspend the provisions of Proposition 98.
<P>
 
<P>
 Policy implementation is the responsibility of CTA's executive
body.  It has a 24-member Board of Directors (or Executive Committee),
three executive officers, 16 directors from various geographical
districts, an Executive Director, two Minority Directors-at-large,
and one NEA Director.  The board creates its own committees or
task forces to assist it in implementing policy.  Altogether,
these special committees and CTA leadership constitute the &quot;action
arm&quot; of CTA.
<P>
 The three executive officers-President, Vice President, and Secretary/
Treasurer-are elected by the State Council to a maximum of two
2-year terms.  The President serves as CTA's main executive officer
and official spokesman on policy matters.
<P>
LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY / REGIONAL SERVICES
<P>
 For administrative and organizational purposes, CTA divides its
statewide operations into four geographical regions.  Most CTA
programs and services to chapters are provided and coordinated
through an integrated system of offices and staff throughout each
region.  These regions, in turn, are divided into Directorial
Districts A through P, each producing one elected director on
the Board of Directors.
<P>
 CTA regional offices were established in 1971.  Regional Services
assists with chapter organization, trains chapter leadership,
and develops communication systems among members, local leaders,
and the community (e.g., phone trees, drop systems, local Association
Newspaper, Media Relations).  This department also helps chapters
with collective bargaining negotiations, contract monitoring,
membership recruitment, Group Legal Services, and political action.
 Hence Regional Services is part of the action arm of CTA in implementing
the association's policies.
<P>
 Included in Local Service Delivery are the 24 Service Center
Councils, a network of chapter presidents and State Council representatives
who inform membership of actions under consideration by the State
Council and Board and coordinate membership participation in regional
CTA activities (i.e. political activities and CTA/NEA representative
elections).  More importantly, this department develops regional
strategic action plans to organize regional membership for political
action.  This grass-roots corps is the fountainhead of CTA's political
activities. 
<P>
 With 159 full-time employees in the four Regions, Local Service
Delivery's share of CTA's  1993-94 budget is 41.5% or $30,040,556.
 This large allocation suggests that Local Service Delivery plays
a vital role in implementing and coordinating CTA policy.
<P>
GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS &AMP; CTA/ABC-PAC
<P>
 The Governmental Relations Department seeks to attain CTA's political
objectives and serves as liaison to government and private agencies.
 Alice Huffman, who heads this department, explains: &quot;The
job of this department...is to help CTA implement through legislation
and political action the goals set by CTA members and enunciated
by the State Council of Education, the Board of Directors, and
the elected officers.&quot;  This involves aggressive lobbying
and massive political expenditures.  The department oversees membership
political activity and regularly organizes rank-and-file teachers
to flock to Sacramento to &quot;inform&quot; legislators on issues
of concern to CTA
<P>
 CTA/ABC (Association for Better Citizenship) provides campaign
contributions to CTA-endorsed candidates for local and state offices,
coordinates and directs membership involvement in political campaigns,
offers political action training, maintains a membership database,
and conducts member and public opinion polls to support the CTA's
political agenda.  Since 1985, CTA's PAC consistently has ranked
among the top five contributors to state legislative campaigns,
according to California Common Cause. It ranked number one in
1989-90.  In the past eight years the  CTA PAC  has given out
nearly $3.2 million in legislative campaign contributions.
<P>
 CTA claims to be non-partisan, but of the nearly $1 million it
donated to legislative campaigns in 1991-92,  91% or $903,352
was doled out to Democrats with an astounding 81% win rate.  Just
9% ($89,343) was donated to Republican candidates, and of this
small amount only $7,500 was contributed <I>after</I> the 1992
June primaries. This means that  80% of the amount given to Republicans
was given to spend against other Republicans.  Less than 1% of
CTA's $992,695 PAC money was contributed to Republicans to use
against Democrats.  
<P>
 With this record in mind it is curious to note that, according
to the co-directors of NEA's &quot;Republican Educators Caucus,&quot;
42.8% of CTA's membership are registered Republicans, including
CTA President Del Weber.
<P>
 CTA has a second political action committee, devoted solely to
ballot measures and non-candidate campaign expenditures.  Since
1985, this CTA Issues PAC has forked over more than $10 million
to support or oppose various initiatives. This total includes
expenditures to pass Proposition 98, but also includes hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on measures completely unrelated
to education.  For example, in 1992 CTA spent almost $300,000
on behalf of failed Proposition 167, which would have raised taxes
on California businesses.  CTA has also expended funds to oppose
term limits ( Prop. 140) and prison inmate labor (Prop. 139),
to influence reapportionment (Props. 39, 118 and 119), and to
support Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird and Big Green (Prop. 130).
<P>
 CTA's success rate in political endorsements is impressive. In
November 1992, 99 of the 119 CTA-endorsed state and federal candidates
were elected-a whopping 83% win rate.  Of CTA contributions made
toward 181 local school board races and issues, CTA Secretary/Treasurer
Lois Tinson claims a 70% win rate.
<P>
 It is noteworthy that CTA dedicates at least 25% of its political
action money to local school board elections and requests that
local chapters' political action committees match these donations.
 Thus, while CTA/ABC  handed out over $1 million to state candidates
during 1991/92, it also gave over $300,000 to local candidates.
<P>
 School boards are considered the &quot;employer&quot; in collective
bargaining agreements (which set salaries, benefits, and other
working conditions), while the CTA is the bargaining agent. School
boards often give in to union demands for politically expedient
reasons.  This observation is underscored by the Little Hoover
Commission's study, &quot;Costs and Casualties of K-12 Education
in California&quot;:
<P>
The fact that school board members receive monetary contributions
from teachers' unions does...make for the appearance of a relationship
between unions and school boards and, at the very least, can contribute
to diminished public confidence in the board's independence.
<P>
 The Little Hoover Commission's study determined that this intermixing
of school board and union interests fosters a negative financial
impact on school districts and even the state budget:
<P>
Thus many of the agreements reached through collective bargaining
are not based on the long-term interests of the district and the
financial condition of the State...[such] decisions are not based
on the soundest of fiscal considerations [but] are arrived at
nevertheless because of political pressures.
<P>
 Such political pressures include the threat or execution of teacher
strikes, which force school boards to agree to unsound fiscal
policies regardless of the district's or State's financial condition.
 Indeed, teachers' salaries and benefits gobble up at least 83%
of the State's General Fund expenditures, reducing budgets for
textbooks, library books, maintenance, and other needs vital to
learning.  In 1991-92, a mere 3.87% of the school expenditures
went for vital learning materials like textbooks, computers, and
classroom supplies.  Moreover, during fiscal year 1991-92,  529
school districts-over half-ran budget deficits and four were so
miserably managed that they became wards of the state.
<P>
 In addition to its direct campaign contributions to causes and
candidates, CTA has spent millions on lobbying and other political
expenses.  According to California Common Cause, the CTA ranked
number one in political expenditures during the 1991-92 political
cycle, far outdistancing other moneyed interests such as the California
Medical Association, California Trial Lawyers Association, and
the Association of California Insurance Companies.  In fact, of
the $7.4 million that CTA spent on political purposes during 1991-92,
$3.9 million went for lobbying in Sacramento, making it the biggest
spending political lobby during the two-year session.  Moreover,
CTA's &quot;soft&quot; spending to run its political apparatus
handily doubles its total political expenditures.
<P>
 Perhaps more important than raw dollars spent on campaigns is
the extent of the grassroots political activism under the direct
control of the CTA.  CTA's Governmental Relations Department annually
holds a Political Action Institute in the first week of August,
designed to train teachers and local chapter leaders in effective
grass-roots politics.  Recently, the CTA claimed that more than
1,000 teachers received intensive training in political activism
to fight against Proposition 174, through the Institute and at
a Chapter President's Conference.
<P>
 Furthermore, a special department program of CTA/ABC, the Master
Plan for Political Action, actively promotes political involvement.
 The Master Plan provides workshops on political activism, internal
polling of members' political attitudes and participation in state
political parties, and instructional materials such as a political
action handbook. It  maintains a Political Action Database for
use in contacting and mobilizing members on political issues,
and hires outside political consultants.  Specific political contributions
and expenditures are recommended to the Board of Directors by
the CTA/ABC Committee to support the Master Plan.
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS
<P>
 The Communications Department's threefold task is public relations,
internal communications, and membership promotion. The department's
seven professionals and four full-time support staff issue numerous
publications, including tabloids, leadership newsletters, news
releases, feature and op-ed pieces, letters to the editor, and
the CTA Briefing Memo (directed to media professionals).  Its
primary aim is to boost CTA's public image and advance its political
agenda. The department coordinates the annual John Swett Awards,
given to newspapers, radio and television stations, and individual
journalists for what the CTA considers exemplary coverage of education
issues. 
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS
<P>
 &quot;Members can call upon Human Rights,&quot; explains Department
Manager Dolores Heisinger, &quot;for assistance in racial-ethnic
minority group concerns, equal rights for women, teacher/student
rights, affirmative action, sex equity issues, discrimination,
academic freedom, far right attacks, segregation and integration,
violence in the schools, comparable worth, and peace and international
relations.&quot;  With just six employees and only 1.2% of CTA's
budget, this department focuses on minority leadership development,
women's leadership training and, in its words, &quot;far right
awareness.&quot;
<P>
 In a 1984 CTA pamphlet entitled &quot;Guidelines for Academic
Freedom in the Public Schools,&quot; the CTA Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee expressed opposition to the &quot;New Right&quot;
as follows: &quot;Who dare take on religion, free enterprise,
patriotism, and motherhood?  We do, and we must!&quot;  When this
extreme statement is compared with the recent CTA-sponsored workshop,
&quot;Extremist Attacks on Academic Freedom,&quot; held at Madera
High School in February 1993, it appears to accurately encapsulate
CTA policy.  
<P>
 In the workshop booklet, CTA defines extreme groups and individuals
as those &quot;who attempt to set moral judgments for everyone,&quot;
and proceeds to list six &quot;far right&quot; organizations active
in California.  They are: Citizens for Excellence in Education,
American Family Association, Traditional Values Coalition, Concerned
Women For America, American Coalition For Traditional Values,
and Focus On The Family.  CTA claims that the policies of such
&quot;far right&quot; groups &quot;are detrimental to public education&quot;
and urges all CTA chapters to &quot;actively oppose&quot; them.
<P>
 Since CTA is an NEA affiliate, it is bound to support NEA resolutions
and policies and affirms this in its &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives, 1992-94&quot; (see page 5 above). In the
arena of human rights, the NEA, and by extension the CTA, supports
affirmative action quotas, gay and lesbian rights, the dispensing
of condoms in public schools, abortion-on-demand, in-school care
for teen-age parents, a nuclear freeze, drafting women in the
military, gun control, socialized medicine, and statehood for
Washington DC. None of these policies have ever been submitted
to rank and file CTA members for their vote.  CTA by-laws do not
require it.
<P>
INSTRUCTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (IPD)
<P>
 The goal of IPD, according to department manager Deborah Edginton,
is  to &quot;make the classroom work of our members both easier
and more productive.&quot;  IPD serves as CTA's liaison to dozens
of government agencies and private organizations, and thus provides
the basis of CTA's educational image. It spends only 1.4% of the
CTA budget on these instructional activities. 
<P>
 IPD sponsors numerous workshops and conferences to inform teachers
of their union rights, and synthesizes and disseminates information
that promotes the teaching profession.  IPD conducts research,
publishes studies on educational issues, provides research information
for other CTA departments, and works with a number of private
sector foundations providing funding for educational projects.
 
<P>
 As a non-profit labor organization, CTA is eligible for government
grants and tax deductible private donations. Thus IPD taps into
outside sources of revenue to finance its research.
<P>
 IPD staff works with three State Council committees, including
Curriculum and Instruction, Credentials and Professional Development,
and the Special Education Coordinating Committee. IPD has forged
a close relationship with colleges and universities to coordinate
and promote interaction between education departments and K-12
teachers on mutually beneficial projects.
<P>
GROUP LEGAL SERVICES 
<P>
 Providing free legal protection to CTA members and chapters,
Group Legal Services produces publications, conferences and workshops
on legal issues such as fair share, assists in agency fee reporting
and record keeping obligations, and maintains a comprehensive
labor-law library.  It fights teachers' lay-off notices, strengthens
probationary teachers' rights, comparable worth salary placement,
and defends CTA's right to strike.  At last count Legal Services
employed at least six attorneys and ten support staff in its Burlingame
and Los Angeles offices.
<P>
TRAINING AND BARGAINING SERVICES (TBS)
<P>
 Each summer CTA holds a Negotiations Finance Institute that has
trained thousands of contract negotiators.  Dick Odgers, Manager
of TBS,  explains, &quot;We've developed a Collective Bargaining
Reference Manual that serves as a guide for contract negotiations
around the state, and we were involved in the development of the
new State Budget forms which are in effect in 240 districts this
year [1991], all districts next year.  And we've developed training
for staff and chapters to help them understand these new forms.&quot;
<P>
 TBS maintains a Contract Master Index and Microfiche File to
provide chapters and negotiation teams with comprehensive contract
information.  Additionally, TBS furnishes ready access to California's
state budget, and often makes such information available to CTA
negotiators before it is available to school districts.
<P>
 CTA has developed a &quot;master agreement,&quot; containing
what are thought to be the best features of  all local agreements.
This functions as a template for local chapters to use in their
collective bargaining. Presumably, the CTA updates this template
each time new agreements are reached with desirable new features;
it is then redistributed to local chapters. Some of the features
of this master agreement will be examined in a future paper.
<P>
<B>SERVICE DEPARTMENTS</B>
<P>
 Service departments, operating from the Burlingame headquarters,
assist all other CTA departments.  They include the usual business
functions:  Accounting, Central Services, Data Processing, Governance
Support, Human Resources, and Management.
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to these traditional service departments there is
a budget category, &quot;Other Expenditures,&quot; which finances
the purchase of property, equipment, and computers. It also includes
three not-so-traditional funds-the Crisis Assistance Fund, Media
Advertising Fund, and the Voucher/Choice Fund.
<P>
 <B>The Crisis Assistance Fund </B> provides money to chapters
undergoing negotiations or &quot;representation&quot; problems.
 This fund provides interest free loans of $70.00 per day to CTA
members on a chapter sanctioned strike of five days or more. 
It also enforces CTA's &quot;Brezhnev&quot; doctrine of exclusive
bargaining representation for all CTA chartered locals. Should
a chapter opt for alternative representation in collective bargaining,
CTA would disqualify the chapter and its membership and use its
Legal Services department to maintain CTA control.  Conversely,
CTA provides &quot;crisis assistance&quot; to CTA chapters not
certified as sole bargaining representatives in order to achieve
this coveted status.  Hence the purpose of this special fund is
to consolidate and expand CTA's control-and prevent defections.
<P>
 <B>The Media Advertising Fund </B> is financed by a dues increase
of $12 approved by the State Council of Education in March 1990.
 Its purpose is to sponsor annual television &quot;blitzes&quot;
promoting public education or CTA and place advertisements and
commentaries in the print media.  In 1991 this fund financed a
television commercial telling Governor Wilson, &quot;Don't Suspend
Proposition 98,&quot; which is generally credited with turning
public sentiment against Wilson's proposal.
<P>
<B>The Voucher/Choice Fund</B> consists of income generated by
a $19 dues increase for a period of three years, beginning in
1992-93.  It will generate over $12 million of the approximately
$13 million that CTA spent in its fall 1993 campaign against Prop.
174.
<P>
<B>THE CTA AND THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION REFORM </B>
<P>
 Despite its record of political success and legislative clout,
CTA is not satisfied. We learn from CTA President Del Weber that
CTA's mission to promote &quot;the well-being of its members&quot;
is failing: &quot;California's teachers work under grueling conditions,
with little support, a lack of funding and too many students in
their classrooms.&quot; Weber has hinted  at the CTA's future
strategy: &quot;Several circles within this organization...are
discussing that CTA might have to carry a future initiative for
school funding. The one we have is not working.&quot;  According
to Weber, the guaranteed minimum funding level under Proposition
98 is too easily evaded. (Proposition 98 was amended by Proposition
111, which effectively reduces the original 40% to about 33%.)
<P>
 Teachers' pay and benefits absorb about 80% of classroom funds
but only 51% of total funds spent at the district and county levels.
Translated, this means that 49% of funds are going to non-teaching
costs. So has CTA challenged California's top-heavy system of
thirteen non-teaching staff to every ten teachers?  Not yet. And
CTA has consistently opposed attempts to break up the state's
gargantuan school districts or cap non-teaching positions.
<P>
 Despite CTA's on-going campaign to puff public education's image,
CTA's policies are failing miserably at improving the actual quality
of public education. 
<UL>
<LI>Student drop-out rates in California schools are topping 30%-worse
than 41 other states-and 50% of those who do graduate get a seventh
grade education or less, lacking the basic skills to fill out
a job application.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>More than one million students in California do not speak
English well enough to understand what is going on in the classroom,
despite (or perhaps because of) tens of millions of dollars spent
on CTA-backed bilingual programs.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  SAT scores in California are declining relative to other
states' scores.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Violent crime in California's  public schools is on the rise,
threatening the safety of students, administrators and teachers
alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 CTA's answer to any criticism of the schools is always the same:
We need more money. But &quot;more money for schools&quot; always
translates to more money for salaries and benefits. This is not
to say that teachers' salaries are too high, but it is noteworthy
that  they are 7th in the nation, and that salaries have more
than kept pace with inflation since 1980.  
<P>
 It's interesting that teachers who are parents behave much like
other citizens when confronted with the choices available in the
public schools. According to a statement by NEA president Keith
Geiger, 40% of urban area public school teachers send their children
to private schools. AFT president Albert Shanker disputed this
figure in a series of paid ads in national magazines. But whatever
the rate of teacher bailout, it is not an indictment of unions.
Teachers-as-parents are parents first, union members second. Bravo!
<P>
 But teachers <I>as political activists</I> are another story.
Do we fully understand the implications of a <I>teachers' union
</I>using 91% of its PAC money, nearly half of which comes from
the forced union dues from non-Democrat members, to support Democrat
candidates for state and federal office?  Thomas Jefferson rightly
observed, &quot;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money
for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors
is sinful and tyrannical.&quot; 
<P>
 In 1992 the CTA sent 365 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention and 25 delegates to the Republican National Convention-a
ratio of over 14 to 1. This cohabitation of CTA PAC funds and
political operatives within the California Democrat Party  raises
interesting questions.  Is this heavy commitment to a single political
party a healthy thing <I>for California classrooms</I>? Even if
one assumes that individual teachers will make a conscientious
effort at fairness in discussing current events, it is disturbing
to know that teachers <I>collectively </I>so closely identify
their interests with the fortunes of a particular political party.

<P>
 And what about &quot;fair share&quot; fees taken from non-union
members?  Is it really credible, as CTA claims under oath, that
it devotes 76% of all its dues to <I>collective bargaining</I>?
 When taking into account not only CTA's overt political expenditures
but also the CTA activities that support its legislative, public
advocacy, and communications programs, the 76% figure appears
to be inflated.  After all, collective bargaining per se is the
job of the local chapter.  Yet CTA claims to spend only 24% on
its non-collective bargaining activities-the political and legislative
activities that are in reality its heart and soul.
<P>
 The CTA believes it not only has a right to speak for its members,
it should speak for <I>all </I>Californians in deciding what is
fit for public debate and decision. Regarding CTA's blocking campaign
against the 1991 petition drive to qualify the school voucher
initiative for the November 1992 ballot, CTA President Del Weber
explained their new mandate:
<P>
[CTA] realized that we would be accused of acting in an undemocratic
manner.  What was wrong, after all, with letting people vote on
an issue?  Our answer was firm.  There are some proposals that
are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters.
<P>
 Arrogance and intolerance of this magnitude might be excusable
in almost any other interest group; after all, it's not unnatural
for groups to have strong opinions about the rightness of their
cause.  What is especially malodorous about the CTA's arrogance
is that these are the people who claim to know <I>better than
parents</I> what is best for California's children.  They claim
to teach citizenship, while trying to subvert the initiative and
referendum process. They claim to promote democracy, while suppressing
debate within their own organization. Through NEA and CTA Resolutions
they claim to speak for all teachers on dozens of controversial
(and often non-education) issues without polling their membership
to determine its views.
<P>
 The CTA, of course, is free to make claims and promote policies
as it sees fit. The public is also free to exercise some skepticism
about these claims and positions. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
 Teachers are entitled to representation in the legislative arena,
but so are parents and taxpayers. It is the job of  policy makers
to balance the professional views and economic interests of the
teachers' union with the interests of the public in improved educational
performance and expanded choices and opportunities.
<P>
 The test of sound policy in education should <I>not</I> be whether
a proposal meets with the approval of CTA or any other special
interest lobby. The test should be whether it expands choices
and opportunities for students and parents trapped in a failed
system.
<P>
 The dilemma facing the state's political leadership is as simple
as it is stark: The system that the CTA built hasn't failed the
CTA-it is doing quite well, thank you. But it has failed California.
That the state legislature is held in such low esteem by the voters
may have something to do with the public perception that special
interest lobbies are calling the shots. Whether in educational
affairs political leaders can change that perception without first
changing the reality is the question of the hour.

Taking Crime Seriously<BR>
An Agenda for the Governor's Crime Summit
<H1>Executive Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The increase in violent crime in California calls for new approaches
and a new directness in dealing with criminals.  Putting criminals
in jail-and funding the prisons needed to keep them there-must
take precedence over attempts to solve the &quot;root problems&quot;
that supposedly underlie criminal behavior.  While these efforts
have an understandable appeal, they have become a roadblock to
effective crime control policies because they allow politicians
to pretend to be solving a problem when they aren't.  Sound public
policy requires a sober admission that such &quot;root-cause&quot;
policies have failed; government must focus on putting criminals
in jail and keeping them there. Any policy that doesn't focus
on this goal is a fraud.
<P>
 We must put aside the misguided ideas that framed the social
policy approaches of the 1960s and 1970s.  We must realize that
although rehabilitation is a necessary and worthwhile effort for
many first-time offenders, habitual offenders need to be locked
up. To achieve effective crime control and restore public order
to acceptable levels, we propose a four point program:
<UL>
<LI>Reform the Juvenile Justice System
<LI>Expand Community-Based Policing
<LI>Secure Our Borders from Illegal Immigration
<LI>Reform Our Sentencing and Corrections Practices
</UL>

<H2>Juvenile Crime: Turn Off the Spigot</H2>

<P>
 Locking up all &quot;three-time losers&quot; will not halt the
rise in crime rates if our system continues to produce growing
numbers of young criminals to take their place on our streets.
 Children who are mere &quot;status offenders&quot; can be identified
and treated through community-based programs that do not involve
incarceration, while juvenile offenders who commit violent crimes
should be subject to adult penalties and incarceration.  Juvenile
court proceedings should be open to the public and juvenile records
shared across jurisdictional lines, and juvenile records must
be part of a criminal's record when he commits his first crime
as an adult. 
<H2>Road to Safe Streets: Adopt Community-Based Policing</H2>

<P>
 Until fairly recently in American cities, police patrolled on
foot and exercised broad authority to discourage a range of offensive
behaviors and petty crimes.  Such foot patrols also were effective
in discouraging violent crime.  As the police presence in urban
neighborhoods has declined, both community life and economic activity
have suffered, meaning a loss of jobs and opportunities for urban
residents.  Recent court decisions have reversed the prohibitions
against regulating anti-social behavior and improved the community's
ability to assure safe streets to its citizens.  California's
cities and counties should act to implement a range of policies
to restore safer streets and neighborhoods.  This is a necessary
first step toward restoring stable and livable communities that
will attract employers and halt the flight of middle-class families
to the safer environments in the suburbs.
<H2>Securing Our Borders: A Time for Leadership</H2>

<P>
 The rising tide of illegal immigration into California adds considerable
direct and indirect costs on the criminal justice and corrections
systems.  Concerted action is needed at both state and federal
levels to stem this tide. Illegal aliens arrested for minor offenses
should be fingerprinted and deported rather than tried and incarcerated
at taxpayers' expense.  Those convicted of serious crimes should
be subject to extradition through expanded prisoner-exchange programs.
 
<H2>Career Criminals: Lock Them Up</H2>

<P>
 Many politicians across the state bemoan the resort to an initiative
ballot to enact tougher sentencing guidelines for third-time offenders.
It must be recognized that such grass-roots efforts signal a failure
of public policy:  If legislators had provided leadership to address
the underlying problems, such initiatives would be unnecessary.
It is time for a total overhaul of our sentencing and corrections
practices that will assure citizens that offenders who commit
violent crimes are kept off the streets.
<H1>
<CENTER>
A New Agenda: Getting the Priorities Right
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I> </I>In a recent poll of Californians, crime was ranked as
the top concern. And with good cause.  Other surveys report that
Americans consider crime to be the number one problem in their
neighborhoods, with 60% fearing criminal assault in their own
homes. Although national statistics show that the overall crime
rate is slightly lower than last year, the reduction is due to
a drop in property crime. Violent crime is on the increase.  Few
areas of the country provide a more dramatic example of this than
California.  Between 1952 and 1992, as the state's population
has nearly tripled, the rate of violent crime has increased seven-fold.
 A person born in California today is five times more likely to
be murdered and ten times more likely to suffer serious injury
from criminal assault than one born forty years ago.
<P>
 Widespread public fear of crime first appeared as a public policy
issue in the 1960s.  Government's response to it was to accept
the advice of social theorists and adopt programs focusing on
its &quot;root causes.&quot;  These were identified as poverty,
ignorance and social oppression.  A corollary or logical result
of this was to emphasize rehabilitation over incarceration. 
<P>
 The broader policy framework for this change in criminal justice
policy was the massive investment in  the &quot;Great Society&quot;
approach to urban development.  Federal and state bureaucracies
were created to funnel tens of billions of tax dollars to programs
delivering services for the poor, particularly the residents of
urban areas.  Parallel to these &quot;urban strategies&quot; probation
and parole alternatives for those convicted of crimes were increased
dramatically.  California was at the forefront of this effort,
and it suffered immensely as a result: the explosion in crime
rates began in 1967, when the increase in crime was double what
it was five years earlier.
<P>
 Public officials  and bureaucrats have continued to fight to
preserve the social reform approach to criminal justice, despite
growing public anger and opposition. Their response to public
demands for tougher law enforcement is always the same: more calls
for increased attention to the &quot;root causes,&quot; which
are always found in social pathology rather than personal conduct.
<H2>The Citizens' Revolt Against Permissiveness</H2>

<P>
 Despite this failure of political leadership in California's
governing elite, California voters were successful in re-establishing
public safety as the top criminal justice priority in virtually
every area available to them.  California has adopted three death
penalty laws since 1972.  Since 1981, voters have passed five
general obligation bond measures authorizing $2.5 billion for
prison construction and anti-crime initiatives containing two
dozen major reforms which the state legislature was unwilling
to adopt. In 1986 voters took the unprecedented step of rejecting
three members of the California Supreme Court because of their
apparent unwillingness to enforce the death penalty and other
strong sanctions against criminals. 
<P>
 There has been no lack of public support for more comprehensive
reforms, but the California legislature's unwillingness to adopt
them has allowed remnants of the social reform movement to influence
the three important areas of the criminal justice system most
essential to the effective control of crime: handling of juvenile
offenders, policies concerning illegal aliens and public order,
and the rules governing sentencing and corrections.  Current practices
in these areas continue to contribute to the crime problem.
<H2>Unmasking the Funding Bogeyman</H2>

<P>
 Politicians who say Californians are unwilling to pay the bill
for more police officers on the streets and new prison construction
need a lesson in elementary arithmetic.  There is plenty of room
in a $57 billion state budget for funding the operations of our
criminal justice system and adequate prisons and corrections staff.
All politicians need to do is reread the Constitution and their
oath of office: the protection of life, liberty, and property
is the first order of business for democratic government-not something
government does if it has money left over after all the special
interests are taken care of. If citizens themselves were allowed
to rank the state's spending priorities instead of having it done
by Sacramento, many of the things government is doing with that
$57 billion would fall off the list. 
<P>
 The public's demand for effective crime control is not a passing
whim or product of media hype. It is an expression of the public's
justified concern and anger over failed leadership. Budget priorities
must be set straight. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Meeting the Challenge of Juvenile Justice
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Future crime rates in California will be greatly affected by
the state's ability to make the juvenile justice system effective
at preventing juvenile delinquents from becoming hard-core criminals.
In a 1989 study, juvenile justice expert Donna Clontz identified
attempts over the previous decade to &quot;graft public safety
concepts into a system designed purely for rehabilitation&quot;
as cause for the system's failure to succeed in either area:
<P>
The current system, in its effort to rehabilitate, actually contributes
to the delinquency of many minors by allowing them to commit multiple
crimes before taking any substantial action . . . . there is little
or no consequence until aberrant patterns are so ingrained that
it is very difficult to change them.
<P>
 A review of juvenile arrests seems to bear this out. Between
1987 and 1992 the number of adults arrested for violent crimes
increased by 35%.  Over the same period, the number of juveniles
arrested for violent crimes shot up 75%.  To combat this trend
California must first realize that its juvenile justice system
is failing to stem this flow of juvenile offenders into a life
of adult crime.  For the thousands who are today committing violent
crimes, the diversion of scarce resources for rehabilitation cannot
be justified.  In most cases the goal should be to remove them
from society, hopefully to a penal system which requires the development
of occupational skills and basic education as the criteria for
release.  The crime that a person commits, regardless of his age,
must become the primary basis for the length of his confinement.

<H2>Identification and Filtering</H2>

<P>
 The first priority of  any juvenile justice system should be
to protect the public.  The second is to act in the best interests
of the minor.  To accomplish this, children developing a pattern
of violating the law must be identified before they begin to commit
serious crimes.  The bulk of California's juvenile justice resources
must be focused upon those most likely to benefit, the youth at
the front end of the system.  The popular term for this is &quot;early
intervention.&quot;  The first step is to change the way the system
deals with status offenders.  Children who habitually run away
from home, who are truant or incorrigible, who roam the streets
at night, are displaying early behavior patterns common among
criminals.  Existing resources at both the state and local level,
including schools, juvenile courts, local offender juvenile programs,
and probation departments, must be pooled to help identify these
at-risk children and to monitor changes in their behavior.
<P>
 As a major step toward an overhaul of local juvenile justice
programs, California should require counties to develop community-based
programs which involve parental control and supervision while
applying a uniform schedule of increasing consequences for repeated
offenses. 
<P>
 An existing program which has been successful is the voluntary,
community-based effort to deal with truancy under section 601
of California's Welfare and Institutions Code.  The School Attendance
Review Board (SARB) program utilizes a team of local representatives
from schools, law enforcement and juvenile justice to identify
children who are habitually truant from school and require that
the child and the parent(s) participate in a counseling program
focused on preventing future delinquency.  Children and parents
who fail to participate are referred to the juvenile court to
face the possibility of more severe consequences.  At this early
stage of misbehavior, the specter of parental and official authority
has a positive effect on children.  An expanded version of this
program should be adopted in every county to identify and monitor
truants, runaways, incorrigibles and curfew violators.
<P>
 Every child who habitually commits these offenses, and the parents
of that child, should be required to participate in SARB-type
counseling as the initial contact with the juvenile justice system.
 This program should also be utilized to monitor the behavior
of juveniles who continue to commit offenses and have graduated
to more serious consequences.  This is the first step in a much-needed
identification and filtering process.
<H2>Increased Supervision of Young Offenders</H2>

<P>
 Presently, juveniles on formal probation for committing crimes
are supervised by a probation officer.  In some counties probation
officers have caseloads of over eighty offenders.  In a given
month these overburdened officers often find it difficult to communicate
with their charges over the telephone, let alone through visits
to their homes.
<P>
 California must make a strong commitment to increase the supervision
of its juvenile offenders.  This will necessarily require additional
expenditures, including funds for an increase in the number of
probation officers.
<P>
 Schools can play a major roll in this increased supervision for
students who are on probation. The assignment of probation officers
should be based on where juveniles attend school, and probation
officers should visit these schools on a regular basis.  At the
same time, schools must not be coerced into retaining juveniles
who are seriously disruptive.  Teachers should be notified when
their students are on probation, what the conditions of probation
are, and how to report violations of those conditions or other
suspicious behavior.
<P>
 In areas where there is community-based policing, officers should
also be notified of the juveniles on his or her beat currently
on probation and, when possible, become familiar with the juvenile's
home, parents and neighbors.  Under this system the young offender
will be constantly aware that someone is monitoring his behavior.

<H2>Sharing Information Across Jurisdictions</H2>

<P>
 Presently, in most parts of California, there is no way patrol
officers can quickly access the record of juveniles.  This means
that they may often be at risk of attack, release a serious or
chronic offender with only a warning, fail to detain a youth with
an active warrant, prolong investigations, or make other important
decisions without proper information.  Additionally, many agencies
working with juveniles have inaccurate or incomplete information
about their charges.
<P>
 Juvenile court judges, probation officers and the staff at county
and state juvenile facilities have many options regarding the
handling of young offenders.  Their decisions should be based
upon accurate information about a juvenile's previous contact
with the system and the evaluations of those who have been responsible
for him.  When a juvenile offender reaches adulthood the criminal
justice system is unaware of his history of juvenile offenses.
 In most cases the offender's fingerprints are not even on file.
 
<P>
 California must establish a system of documenting and sharing
the criminal histories of juvenile offenders.  At initial contact
with the juvenile justice system, every juvenile should be fingerprinted
and that print should be maintained by the state department of
justice.  A juvenile's future record of arrests, referrals, commitments
and treatment programs should be maintained and indexed to his
fingerprints and made available to law enforcement agencies and
other government entities responsible for him. 
<H2>Increased Consequences</H2>

<P>
 It is essential that all young people clearly understand that
the price for breaking the law goes up with repeated offenses.
 Regardless of where an offender is arrested, local authorities
should be able to quickly review his history and determine what
sanctions have already been applied for his prior offenses.  Donna
Clontz described the practice in her 1989 study:
<P>
In most jurisdictions, real sanctions are nonexistent early in
a juvenile delinquent's career.  The message to the minor is &quot;It's
okay to break the law.  Nothing happens to you.&quot;  The result
is a total disrespect for &quot;juvenile justice&quot;-because
it is not providing justice for anyone at all.  It is important
that people who fashion consequences for crimes and create solutions
to diverse youthful problems retain some discretion in decision
making.  However, they too must be held accountable for providing
consistent consequences as well as requiring parental participation.
<P>
 California must establish a basic schedule of increasing consequences,
incorporating programs generally available throughout the state,
including probation, community service work programs, suspension
of driving privileges, boot camp, counseling, and juvenile hall.
 Counties should be required to follow this schedule.  Changes
in juvenile court procedures and the evidence requirements to
prove violations of probation-making them comparable with those
in the adult system-would be a major step in demonstrating to
juvenile offenders that breaking the rules will not be tolerated.
<P>
 The California Youth Authority (CYA), which has increasingly
become a warehouse for serious juvenile offenders, should provide
a last opportunity for those who have gone through the basic schedule
of locally administered consequences to avoid the lengthy confinement
associated with adult habitual criminals. 
<P>
 A person should be sent to a CYA facility only once.  A juvenile
whose most serious offense is a misdemeanor should not be eligible
for CYA.  Violent offenders should be held and treated separately
from habitual, nonviolent juveniles.  While confined at CYA, juveniles
should be required to participate in programs designed to educate
them about the consequences of future criminal activity and other
programs designed to address specific categories of offenders.
 Currently available services include drug rehabilitation, development
of occupational skills, and sex offender counseling.  In most
cases, a CYA commitment should be no longer than it takes to administer
and evaluate the effect of such programs.  An appropriate goal
might be six months.  Offenders who fail to perform should be
transferred to state-run facilities for juveniles which operate
like adult prisons.
<P>
 Juveniles who commit additional crimes after a CYA commitment
should be referred to adult court and, upon conviction, sentenced
to adult-length terms to be served in the above-mentioned prisons
until they reach the age of 18 and can be transferred to an adult
correctional facility.
<H2>Opening Up the System</H2>

<P>
 The public knows very little about what happens in juvenile court
because most cases are decided in closed hearings.  With current
levels of juvenile crime, it is no longer prudent to allow such
proceedings to be conducted in secret.  The community-based approach
to juvenile crime, discussed earlier in this paper, requires the
full support of the local citizenry.  To assure this support and
that the system is working to protect the safety of the public,
juvenile hearings should be opened to the public.  In states that
have opened their juvenile courts on the same basis as their adult
courts, none have experienced increased expenses due to spectators
or had other negative side effects.  The individual juvenile's
desire for privacy is far outweighed by the public's need for
information about the operation of its juvenile courts and their
effect on public safety.
<H1>
<CENTER>
The Road to Safe Streets: Community-based Policing
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Until the latter part of this century the maintenance of public
order was a major priority of  American law enforcement.  In virtually
every big city and small town, police patrolled on foot and exercised
broad authority to discourage vagrants, rowdiness, public drunkenness,
and other offensive behavior.  This role of police changed as
the economic benefits of using patrol cars equipped with radios
to police growing urban centers were recognized.  The radical
changes in social policies of the 1960s included successful political
and legal efforts to strike down laws which had given police authority
to control the behavior of vagrants and panhandlers.  In the face
of these developments, prosecution agencies were reluctant to
test existing laws, political leaders were reluctant to enact
new ones, and municipal police departments completely abandoned
their order-maintenance duties. 
<P>
 This official tolerance of public nuisances had a dramatic effect
on serious crime.  In his book <I>Thinking About Crime</I>, Professor
James Q. Wilson discusses studies conducted in New York and Great
Britain between 1954 and 1965 reporting that increases in foot
patrols resulted in reductions of serious street crime by more
than thirty percent.  An article Wilson wrote in <I>The Atlantic</I>
in 1982 with George L. Kelling further established the link between
general order and serious crime. It and subsequent studies have
led many American cities to restore foot patrols (community-based
policing) and enact local statutes to discourage aggressive panhandling,
prostitution, sleeping in parks and on sidewalks, and other offensive
behavior which has converted prosperous urban business and residential
areas into filthy, open-air flophouses where the only commerce
is in drugs and violence. 
<P>
 While homeless advocates and civil liberties groups continue
to challenge these actions as class discrimination and unconstitutional
violations of free expression, some recent federal court decisions
to allow enforcement of laws punishing behavior rather than status
offer encouragement.  For instance, a 1992 United States Supreme
Court decision in <I>International Society for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc.</I> v.<I> Lee</I>  upheld a New York law prohibiting panhandling
in airports. In 1990  the federal Court of Appeals ruled in <I>Young
</I>v.<I> New York City Transit Authority</I> that another New
York law prohibiting panhandling in subways passed constitutional
muster.
<P>
 It is important to note that national studies have repeatedly
proven that estimates regarding the size and makeup of the &quot;homeless&quot;
population advanced by these advocates and accepted by the news
industry are highly inflated.
<P>
 In places where public order laws have been enforced, the effect
has been positive.  Since 1990, for example, following the Young
decision to allow enforcement of public order regulations in New
York's subway system, the rate for robbery has dropped by 41%
and the rates for felonious assault and grand larceny have decreased
36%.
<P>
 The arguments for reducing crime through enforcement of similar
laws on public streets are compelling.  The director of a homeless
shelter in Boston underscored this when he publicly requested
that people not give panhandlers money because it is used to buy
drugs, subverting any rehabilitative efforts the city provides
and increasing the expense for medical treatment.  In light of
findings that the bulk of America's street population consists
of drug-addicted and alcoholic males, this request makes very
good sense.
<P>
 In order to reduce crime and improve the economic environment
of its urban areas California must become an initiator and a supporter
of community-based policing and the maintenance of public order
as a law enforcement priority. 
<P>
 In <I>A Guide to Regulating Panhandling</I>, published last April,
public interest attorney Kent S. Scheidegger offers model laws
which give beat officers a means of controlling the behavior of
panhandlers.  Similar laws and others addressing sleeping in public
parks and blocking sidewalks have been adopted in many communities,
including several cities in California.  Some of these laws are
currently being tested in state and federal court.  State efforts
to encourage communities to adopt these policies, perhaps with
incentives, will speed efforts to make our streets, sidewalks
and parks safe and attractive for everyone.
<H1>
<CENTER>
SECURING OUR BORDERS
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The nonenforcement of immigration laws teaches those entering
California illegally, and others already here, the same lesson
that criminals learn from urban streets littered with drunks,
drug addicts and prostitutes, i.e., &quot;the law is not enforced
here.&quot;  Exacerbating the federal government's unwillingness
to enforce the law at the border, the local policy in some urban
areas has been to actually forbid police who discover illegal
aliens while investigating crimes from reporting them to federal
authorities for deportation.
<P>
 The annual cost of confining illegal immigrants who commit crimes
is estimated to be $500 million.  This does not take into account
the cost of arrest and conviction, which is borne by counties.
 The state suffers an even larger financial burden for social
programs delivered to illegal aliens.
<P>
 Governor Wilson has focused upon this problem and suggested several
steps to stop the flow of illegal aliens, and several members
of California's congressional delegation have expressed support
for some of these proposals.  Yet there is still no consensus
on the need for urgent action.  It is time for all of California's
political leaders-state and federal, Republican and Democrat-to
unite behind a demand that the federal government fulfill its
legal obligation to secure California's borders against alien
immigration.
<P>
 It may take time for the federal government to fulfill its obligations
in this area, but there are immediate steps that the state can
take to alleviate the problem.  As a first step, state and local
government agencies should be required to identify and report
illegal aliens among the populations they serve.  The cost for
such an effort would be far less than continuing to provide illegals
with services and process those who violate state laws through
the criminal justice system.
<P>
 With regard to illegals in the criminal population, there are
specific steps the state can take.  Illegal aliens arrested for
less serious crimes should be fingerprinted and deported rather
than tried and confined at the expense of taxpayers.
<P>
 The federal government must do its part.  California's political
leaders should ask the President to direct the State Department
to clarify and strengthen extradition agreements with foreign
governments to allow illegals convicted and sentenced for serious
crimes to be confined in prisons in their home country with a
similar understanding regarding the return of American lawbreakers
for confinement here.  The adoption of NAFTA leaves the United
States in a good position to make this agreement with Mexico.
<P>
 While the greatest benefits from these actions would be to reduce
state spending for social programs, the savings in local and state
criminal justice resources would be substantial.

Corrections and Sentencing Reform 
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 In December 1993, national headlines were dominated by another
abhorrent crime apparently committed by an habitual criminal.
 The kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas has brought
to the forefront the rules governing California's system for sentencing
and confining serious repeat offenders.  Robert Allen Davis, who
has been charged with the crime, had prior convictions for two
major felonies and was released from state prison four months
before the girl's kidnapping and murder. State laws granting convicted
criminals release after serving only half of their sentence undoubtedly
provided Davis with the freedom to commit other crimes.
<P>
 Under California law, a criminal sentenced to prison receives
credits for good behavior totaling roughly one-third of his confinement
upon entry to prison.  To lose part of this &quot;good time&quot;
the criminal must be found to have broken prison rules through
a time-consuming complaint and hearing process.  An inmate who
does lose part of his &quot;good time&quot; for attacking a guard,
for example, can earn it back by avoiding being caught and found
guilty of another offense over a fixed period of time.  In effect,
a criminal can continue to commit crimes while in prison and still
be eligible for early release so long as he spaces out his offenses
enough to regain his &quot;good time.&quot;  In addition, state
law provides that inmates who are willing to work receive one
day off their sentence for each day they are willing to work,
even if there is no work to do.  The maximum amount of credit
which can be earned utilizing &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; reduces a criminal's sentence by one-half.  Even convicted
murderers are eligible for these sentence reductions.
<P>
 The time to abandon this practice is long past. Strong truth-in-sentencing
guidelines must  require that habitual offenders serve the full
terms of their sentences.  
<P>
 While some correctional administrators have argued that such
sentence reduction credits provide incentives for convicts to
behave, and thereby become  easier to manage, correctional officers
actually working in prisons consider them useless in controlling
inmate behavior and actually a license to commit some offenses
with impunity.
<P>
 California must replace &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; credits with changes in the determinate sentencing
law to retain a minimum base term while creating an indeterminate
upper term.  Like the federal prison system, the overriding rule
in California should be, &quot;If you do the crime, you do the
time.&quot;  California's sentence for a first conviction for
forcible rape, for example, could be changed from the current
range of 3, 6 or 8 years, to an indeterminate term of 5 to 8 years.
 The new sentencing scheme would provide that only rapists who
avoid additional offenses and participate in work and other rehabilitative
programs would be eligible for release at completion of the five-year
base term.  Inmates who continued to offend or refused to participate
would not be considered for release until their behavior conformed
for a significant period (perhaps one year).  Those unwilling
to cooperate would remain in prison until completion of the upper
term of 8 years.  The key to this system is that the desired behavior
would be required for release at the end of the base term rather
than as a bargaining chip for a sentence reduction.   
<H2>The Discipline of Work</H2>

<P>
 Productive work should also be a requirement rather than an option.
 In the past, efforts to allow more meaningful work for inmates
have been blocked by labor interest complaints that working inmates
would take jobs away from law-abiding citizens.  The state of
California currently provides billions of dollars worth of services
to the public which are funded by the taxpayers.  The state also
owns and maintains buildings (including prisons), motor vehicles,
highways, dams and parks.  Inmates should be required to perform
these services (as attrition permits).  The savings would lower
the tax burden on California's economy, which has been shown to
encourage the creation of jobs in the private sector.
<P>
 Currently, many inmates are paid by the state for the work they
perform.  The wages can be used by inmates as &quot;credits&quot;
for the purchase of items from the prison commissary.  This practice
has not been proven to contribute to inmate rehabilitation and
can create problems in controlling them.  It should be abandoned.
 The savings realized from inmate labor should be used to help
pay for the cost of their conviction, confinement, and to support
programs and services related to public safety such as local courts
and delinquency prevention efforts. 
<P>
 The size of California's prison system has allowed for a wide
variety of living conditions among the various facilities.  The
state already utilizes these differences to separate inmates by
their level of criminal sophistication and behavior in confinement.
 This process should be continued and expanded to provide incentives
for inmates to behave well and participate in work programs. 
In the interest of rehabilitation, inmates who perform well should
be transferred to institutions offering work which can develop
proficiency in marketable skills, such as plumbing, carpentry
and computer programming.  Inmates with chronic behavior problems
should spend their indeterminate terms in institutions offering
work which relies less on skills and teamwork than on manual labor.

<H2>Habitual Criminals: The Cost of Prisons vs. the Costs of Crime
</H2>

<P>
 The greatest threat of crime is presented by habitual criminals.
 One survey conducted by the Rand Corporation found that the average
career criminal commits between 187 and 287 crimes per year, at
an average cost for each crime of $2,300.  The current cost of
confining a criminal in California is $25,000 per year.  This
does not include the expense of investigating crimes, arrest or
conviction.  Comparing the minimum $430,000 annual cost of keeping
an habitual criminal on the street with the $25,000 expense of
confinement makes a powerful case for the proposition that individuals
who continue to commit crimes should be imprisoned for increasingly
longer periods of time.  California voters demonstrated their
support for this with adoption of Proposition 8 in 1982, which
added five years to the sentence of a convicted felon for each
prior conviction.  With the above-discussed elimination of &quot;good
time&quot; and &quot;work time&quot; credits, California would
finally have an honest and effective process for confining most
habitual criminals. 
<P>
 California can further improve this process by taking three important
steps. 
<P>
 <I>Habitual criminals convicted for a third time of any major
felony should receive a mandatory prison sentence of life without
the possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 While a proposal currently being circulated in California, identified
in the press as the &quot;Three Strikes You're Out&quot; initiative,
does appear to increase confinement for habitual criminals by
requiring a mandatory prison term of twenty-five years to life
for a third felony conviction, the proposal retains a 20% &quot;good
time&quot; credit, reducing the minimum commitment to 20 years.
 After serving that term the criminal would be eligible for parole.
 A better alternative was adopted last November in the state of
Washington.  That state's Initiative #593, also labeled &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out,&quot; mandates a life without parole sentence
for a third violent felony conviction.  California should enact
a similar law.
<P>
 <I>Sentences for <B>violent</B> crimes should be increased across
the board. For example, persons convicted for a second time of
attempted murder should receive a mandatory prison sentence of
life without possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 Criminals with a history of violent behavior should not get 
&quot;three chances&quot; to repeat their crimes. Armed robbers
who demand that their victims lie face down and then fire bullets
into them should not be shown mercy because, by some miracle,
the victim survived. A would-be murderer who fails twice to kill
his victim should never receive another opportunity.
<P>
 <I>Elderly inmates who have been convicted of <B>nonviolent</B>
offenses should be considered for early release.</I>
<P>
 The recidivism rate for prisoners between the ages of 18 to 24
is roughly 22 percent, but it drops to only 2.1 percent for those
over the age of 45.  This dramatic reduction in the threat to
public safety, coupled with an estimated maintenance cost of $69,000
annually for older inmates (nearly three times the cost of younger
ones), raises questions about the benefits derived from their
continued confinement.  With many state prisons operating beyond
capacity and a large street population of young and violent repeat
offenders needing confinement, it is worth considering the early
release of inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses whose age
and behavior suggest that they can be managed outside of prison
with adequate parole supervision. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Postscript:  the Gun Control Experience
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The purpose of this paper has been to identify the major reforms
California must undertake to control crime and violence.  There
are many intermediate steps which can also be taken to correct
problems with post-conviction appeals, funding of courts, and
impediments to criminal investigations.  One proposal which is
conspicuous by its absence is for additional controls on the purchase
of firearms.
<P>
 For several years California has attempted to enforce a ban on
certain types of &quot;assault weapons&quot; purportedly popular
with criminals.  It has also had one of the longest waiting periods
for the purchase of handguns in the nation.  These restrictions
of hardware typically purchased illegally by criminals to aid
in their commission of other illegal acts do not appear to have
reduced the number and type of firearms used by criminals or the
rate of serious crime. 
<P>
 In large American cities with the most restrictive laws governing
the purchase and carrying of firearms, similar laws seem to have
had no appreciable effect on crime at all.  Of the five American
cities with the highest murder rates in 1991-Washington, D.C.,
New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit, and Birmingham-all but one, New
Orleans, are in states which have, for years, had strict gun control
laws requiring a license to purchase or carry a handgun and/or
registration of gun ownership.  The most restrictive gun control
law is enforced in Washington, D.C., which has, by far, the highest
murder rate of any American city.  
<P>
 While these figures do not prove that anti-gun laws are without
merit, they do indicate that energy and resources expended to
outlaw hardware might be better spent rounding up and confining
the criminals who are using it to threaten, injure and kill their
victims.

<B>California</B>'<B>s Private Schools:  </B>
<P>
<B>Survey Results</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
As the school choice debate heats up, the focus is on California's
private schools.  Anti-choice advocates vilify them as havens
for the wealthy and dens of discrimination.  Are these charges
true?  And if California should adopt a voucher system, how would
these schools react?
<P>
To answer these and other questions, the Claremont Institute commissioned
a survey of California private schools.  Approximately five hundred
schools responded, and the data permits us to reach some intriguing
conclusions about the likely consequences of a voucher system.
<P>
<B>The Survey</B>
<P>
The Private School Survey consisted of 25 questions which sought
to establish profiles of a cross section of California's private
schools.  Schools were differentiated by religious affiliation
(or non-affiliation), grade levels offered, type of property on
which the school sits, types and numbers of staff employed, length
of school day, parental involvement, size of student population,
admissions criteria, teaching methods, revenues and revenue sources,
and current expenditures.  The survey also asked private schools
to discuss their plans for the years ahead, with and without a
voucher system.
<P>
The results of the survey paint a picture of private schools far
different than the stereotype offered up by school choice opponents.
 They are diverse and varied, meeting the needs of widely different
segments of the population.  In other words, the educational marketplace,
like the marketplace for other goods, produces a wide variety
of products that meet the varying demand of consumers-in this
case, the needs of parents seeking an effective education for
their children.
<P>
<B>Private School Profiles</B>
<P>
Of the private schools that responded to the survey, about a third
were non-religious.  Of the remaining two-thirds, religious affiliation
ran the gamut from Catholic (22 percent of the total), Association
of Christian Schools (22 percent), general Protestant (7 percent),
Lutheran (6 percent), with smaller numbers of schools run by Seventh
Day Adventists, Jews, Episcopalians, and others.
<P>
In terms of enrollment size, a strong majority of the schools
fall into the medium range, with 56 percent having 100 to 499
students and 17.7 percent 50 to 99 students, followed by schools
with between 25 and 49 students (12.4 percent), very large schools
with more than 500 students (9.1 percent), and very small schools
with under 25 students (3.9 percent).  Although an almost equal
number of Catholic and ASC schools responded to the survey, Catholic
schools have by far the larger number of students (48 percent
of all the students in the religiously-affiliated schools).
<P>
Approximately four-fifths of the schools offer instruction in
grades K-6, 65 percent at the 7th and 8th grade level, and between
32 and 35 percent at the 9th to 12th grade level.  Although the
length of schools years ranged from very short to very long, nearly
64 percent said that it is between 175 and 180 days.  The average
school day is just over six hours.  Parental involvement in the
schools is not required by the 64 percent of respondents.
<P>
Schools in our survey obtained their buildings through various
means.  Fifty-five-plus percent constructed them.  Others bought
them (15.5 percent) or used a church or church property (13 percent),
a commercial property (9.3 percent), or a residential property
(8.9 percent).  The property the buildings stand on are most often
owned by an organization affiliated with the school (47.6 percent)
or by the school itself (36.1  percent).  Sixteen percent lease
their facilities.
<P>
In fact, the average annual revenue for the private schools responding
to the survey was just over $1 million, with nearly 64 percent
having revenues over $250,000.  Non-religious private schools
had a revenue average of $1.3 million, and religious schools $850,000.
<P>
Most revenues come from tuition and fees-nearly 84 percent of
the $1 million annual total (slightly more for non-religious schools,
slightly less for the others).  Remaining revenues come from parent/student
fund-raising, benefactor and alumni donations, and aid from affiliated
organizations.
<P>
<B>Teaching Methods</B>
<P>
The great majority of the schools responding to the survey (66.6
percent) employ interdisciplinary course work and instruction.
 This is the most familiar type of instruction:  instruction in
the sciences, math, English, social sciences, fine arts, etc.
 A significant minority (37 percent) use individualized courses
of study based on each child's ability rather than age or grade
level.  This includes a majority (58 percent) of the non-religious
schools.
<P>
Montessori teaching methods are used by 9.9 percent of the responding
schools, magnet-style instruction in a particular subject by 8.2
percent, and cooperative learning by 2.3 percent.  Although two-thirds
of the schools responding to the survey were religiously affiliated,
a bare one percent use religious teaching methods.  
<P>
Although few schools use religious teaching methods, 66.6 percent
engage in moral character training.  This includes 83 percent
of the religiously-affiliated schools and 32 percent of the others.
 
<P>
<B>Ratio of Teachers to Administrators</B>
<P>
One of the hottest issues in education is staffing.  In particular,
the public school system has been accused of being top-heavy with
non-teaching personnel.  In the California public school system,
the State Department of Education admits that non-teachers outnumber
teachers by a ration of approximately 13 to 10.
<P>
In their groundbreaking book <I>Politics, Markets and America's
Schools</I>, John Chubb and Terry Moe found &quot;an emerging
consensus among scholars and reformers that centralization and
bureaucratization are substantially at odds with the effective
organization of schools and the successful provision of education.&quot;
 The Private School Survey suggests that private schools are more
in line with this consensus:  Teachers outnumber non-teaching
staff in the private schools by a ratio of 2.2 to 1.  Adding classroom
aides into the picture, the ratio rises to 2.8 to 1.
<P>
Private school spending figures bear out this emphasis on the
classroom.  Of those responding to the survey, total spending
on teachers was three times that on non-teaching staff ($202 million
versus $65.7 million).  The numbers are even more dramatic in
private schools with per pupil expenditures under $3,000 per year,
where more than four times as much is spent ($58.7 million versus
$13.6 million).  
<P>
<B>Admissions Criteria</B>
<P>
Academic aptitude was listed by 74 percent of responding schools
as an admissions criterion.  This was especially true of religious
schools, with 80 percent of them (and 92 percent of Catholic schools)
taking academic merit into account.
<P>
Surprisingly, less than half of the religious schools (47 percent)
listed religious affiliation as an admissions criterion.  Indeed,
less than 38 percent of the evangelical-leaning ASC schools did
so.  The extremes on the scale were represented by Jewish schools
(82 percent) and Episcopal schools (11 percent), with 63 percent
of the Catholic schools considering religion.  Nor is having a
family member who is affiliated with a religion as important as
might be thought:  less than 23 percent listed this as a criterion
in their admissions process.  The same is true of &quot;connections&quot;:
 only 32 percent of the schools listed family affiliation with
the school as an admissions criterion.
<P>
Perhaps most surprising is the survey finding that a minority
of the private schools (41 percent) listed ability to pay tuition
as a criterion for admission.  The difference between non-religious
and religious schools in this regard was minimal (38 percent versus
42.6 percent).  Catholic schools were among the least concerned
with ability to pay tuition (34.7 percent).  
<P>
Other criteria used by schools included the catch-all category
of &quot;background of student&quot; (48 percent), student attitude
(14.2 percent), and learning disability/special needs (5 percent).
<P>
<B>Vouchers and Enrollment Growth</B>
<P>
Another hot topic concerns space availability in private schools.
 Critics of vouchers say that the private school system in the
state cannot expand quickly enough to handle the demand vouchers
will create.
<P>
First, according to the survey, an overwhelming number of the
responding schools (80 percent) would accept vouchers.  Just over
4 percent would not.  (The remaining 16 percent were unsure or
did not answer).  Schools with an annual per pupil expenditure
under $3,000 were more likely to accept vouchers (86.7 percent).
<P>
But what about space availability?  Of the schools responding,
49.6 percent said they had more spaces than applicants for the
1992-93 school year, while 46.5 percent had more applicants than
spaces.  Of schools with a per-pupil expenditure under $3,000,
nearly 52 percent had more spaces than applicants.
<P>
Thus clearly, existing facilities would not be enough to meet
the greater demand generated by vouchers.  And there are limitations
to expansion of existing schools.  Local zoning ordinances, for
example, limit the ability to expand facilities for 28 percent
of responding schools.  
<P>
If a voucher system is adopted, almost half (48%) of the schools
responding said that they would increase their size and capacity.
 Some would use portable classrooms to increase their capacity
(22 percent); others would build additional classrooms on their
current site (22.5 percent).  Thirteen percent said that they
would expand by opening an additional school at a new site, while
11 percent said they would expand by moving to a new site.  
<P>
In short, there will be an immediate and dramatic increase in
space and capacity in the state's private schools.  In 1995-96,
the responding schools would enroll approximately 8.6% more students
if the voucher initiative were passed.  In the outlying years,
this percentage increases.  In 1998-99, approximately 15% more
students, and in 2003-04, approximately 24% more students would
be enrolled if vouchers were available.
<P>
Of course, these enrollment projections do not account for the
building of <I>new</I> schools in response to increased demand
for private educational services.  Judging by the effects on colleges
and universities following passage of the G.I. Bill after World
War II, this proliferation of schools will be just as dramatic
as enrollment expansion in existing schools.
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
It is possible to make some broad generalizations based on the
Private School Survey.  The majority of private schools are medium-sized,
religiously affiliated, with budgets over $250,000.  Most of their
revenues come from tuition and fees, and are spent primarily on
teaching staff rather than administrators.  Academic merit, not
religious affiliation, is the most influential admissions criterion.
 The majority would accept vouchers, and nearly half would expand
their capacity to take new voucher students.  New private schools
will certainly need to be created to satisfy market demand under
a voucher system.  The best news is that if their profile resembles
that of existing private schools, California education can only
benefit.

<B>The Limitations of Land Use Planning:</B>
<P>
<B>A Warning for Californians</B>
</CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
 As California looks ahead to a resumption of the economic growth
and prosperity of the 1980s, the issue of how to manage its population
growth has returned to the top of the policy agenda.  The state's
population has topped 31 million and continues to grow by over
500,000 per year.  Projections are for  36 million by the end
of the century.
<P>
 This paper will outline and explain the inherent limitations
of long-range land-use planning, and recommend alternative growth
management guidelines.  It will pay special attention to SB 377,
Senator Robert Presley's key bill on growth management.
<H2>The Inherent Limitations of Planning</H2>

<P>
 Land-use planning is a variation of resource allocation.  The
same kind of general problems exist as in allocating other resources
through a governmental planning process.  Conversely, the case
<I>for</I> land use planning and regulation rests on the same
ground as that for any other kind of economic regulation:  the
argument that the marketplace, left to itself, will create negative
&quot;externalities&quot; or will use resources inefficiently.
 
<P>
 The inherent difficulty of trying to design a comprehensive,
long range land-use planning system is that it attempts to supersede
the decentralized decision-making system of the marketplace with
administrative judgment.  The practical problems facing planners
are extremely daunting:
<P>
* Information and projections about population and economic growth
are fundamentally unreliable and will place constrictions on land
use that further distort actual growth patterns.
<P>
* The various uses to which a parcel of land may be put, or the
relative attractiveness of alternative uses that are contingent
on surrounding land uses, are not possible to comprehend through
a comprehensive planning process.  Linkages between various land
uses and their effects (e.g., traffic congestion, business development,
compatibility of adjacent uses) are indirect, inconsistent, and
occasionally obscure.  Land is not a one-dimensional resource.
 
<P>
* Comprehensive planning underestimates, and cannot account for,
the uncertainties of the land-use market.  While land-use plans
tend to be static, the real market forces for land use are highly
dynamic.
<P>
<B>Population Projections</B>
<P>
 At the outset of any comprehensive planning, there must be long-range
population projections.  These must be segmented both demographically
and geographically.  In other words, the planner needs to know
not only the socio-economic status of the new population (to match
income and household size), but also exactly where this growth
is going to occur.
<P>
 California has a very poor track record with projections of this
kind.  Department of Finance (DoF) projections for growing areas
of the state have underestimated population growth by as much
as 10 percent within five years of the date of the projection.
 For example, DoF's 1977 projection for Riverside County underestimated
actual population growth for 1980-three years out-by 40,000. 
By 1990 this projection was off by nearly 400,000.  The 1981 revised
projection was still off by nearly 200,000.  In San Bernardino
County, DoF's 1977 projection for 1990 was off by 500,000, bringing
the cumulative error for the Inland Empire to 900,000.
<P>
 DoF projections are revised annually, but growth plans and urban
limit lines based on them are not.  This may have severe consequences.
 Consider:  Population projections for the greater-Los Angeles
area for the year 2010 differ by as much as 1.5 million.  The
use of an inaccurate projection of this magnitude in a growth
plan will lead to a mix of higher housing prices, overburdened
infrastructure, diminished opportunity (especially for the young
and the poor), and the displacement of growth to other regions.
<P>
 Had the state imposed a 20-year land-use plan in Riverside and
San Bernardino Counties in 1980 based on DoF population projections,
this growing region would have suffered dramatic constrictions
of land use, causing higher housing prices, inadequate infrastructure
capacity, and diminished economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
 Given that our ability to project population growth accurately
is limited to five years at best, most 20-year comprehensive land-use
plans (which require about five years to develop) <I>will be obsolete
just as they are implemented.</I>
<H2>Land-Use Judgments</H2>

<P>
 Even with reliable demographic information, long-range comprehensive
planning is highly problematic, given the difficulty of comprehending
all of the linkages among land use (e.g., traffic generation,
housing, and infrastructure usage).  In this, comprehensive planning
suffers on a larger scale the defects of traditional zoning. 
For instance:  A piece of land that is suitable for a particular
use one day may not be a year later, because of the uses to which
other landowners have put their property.  
<P>
 If a comprehensive plan lacks the flexibility to allow the market
to adapt to such changes, it will clog up the market, imposing
unnecessary and inefficient costs on the economy.  If the plan
allows such flexibility, on the other hand, it will necessarily
be less &quot;comprehensive.&quot;
<P>
 States with comprehensive regional planning, such as Florida
and Oregon, try to solve this dilemma with a rigorous plan-amendment
process.  Although in principle this provides a degree of flexibility
and local autonomy, in practice there is no flexibility.  All
plan amendments must be consistent with the comprehensive statewide
or regional goals.  The documentary requirements for a plan amendment
in Florida can stack up to six feet high.  This cumbersome and
time-consuming process imposes costs far in excess of benefits,
and imposes a heavy burden on local jurisdictions.
<P>
 The deeper point is this:  it is impossible for <I>any</I> system
of long-range planning to comprehend all of the factors that compose
the market for land-use transactions-lease rates, land prices,
shifting consumer demand, commodity prices, changes in the competitive
mix of the local economy, etc.
<H2>Does SB 377 Overcome these Limitations?</H2>

<P>
 If poor predictions, bad land-use judgments and lack of adequate
information for decisionmaking are problems inherent to long-term
land-use planning efforts, Californians must wonder whether SB
377, the highly-touted growth management legislation authored
by State Senator Robert Presley (D-Riverside), overcomes them.

<P>
 SB 377 requires regional agencies (e.g., councils of government
and air quality districts) within each urbanized region to propose
a regional growth management strategy by January 1, 1995.  These
strategies will be guided by state-mandated goals contained in
SB 377.  Underlying these goals is the Legislature's desire to
establish &quot;fundamental principles of resource conservation
and sustainable conservation and development to guide public policy&quot;.
 
<P>
 In fairness, it must be said that SB 377 attempts to avoid some
of the obvious pitfalls of central land-use planning.  For example,
it does not seek to create a new state land-use agency to direct
land-use decisions from Sacramento.  Also, it supports market-based
transportation pricing mechanisms, which would presumably include
peak-hour road pricing.  And it states that among its goals are
<P>
 (ii) reductions in development fees and other development requirements;
(iii) expedited project review procedures; (iv) reduction and
simplification of review, approval, and appeal criteria. . . .
<P>
 These nods to the market are laudatory.  But even a cursory reading
of SB 377 reveals the same problems that have doomed other central
land-use planning schemes.
<P>
 First , SB 377 adopts a typical long-term baseline:
<P>
Policies and actions to achieve this objective shall include,
but are not limited to, establishment in each region of land designation
system clearly identifying areas proposed for planned compact
development over areas proposed for <I>20-year period</I>, and
areas proposed for long-term or permanent protection from urban
development.<B> </B>[emphasis added]
<P>
 To repeat:  land-use plans that adopt 20-year base periods are
guaranteed to misproject the actual growth of the area in question.
 SB 377 would force such predictions to be made for all parts
of California.  Every city and county in the state would be forced
to live with the potentially disastrous effects of an off-target
projection.
<H2>SB 377 and the Misguided War on &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot;</H2>

<P>
 Despite the appearance of flexibility, SB 377 will lock land
into certain uses.  Its overriding goal is &quot;compact development,&quot;
a pattern of development &quot;with average residential densities
higher than those prevailing in the region in 1992.&quot;<B> 
</B>In other words, the bill seeks to force Californians to live
in more crowded urban areas.
<P>
<B> </B>SB 377 would break down all California land into four
categories: (1) existing communities suitable for maximum feasible
redevelopment, (2) communities suitable for infill growth that
will meet density standards for compact development, (3) urban
reserve areas that are not developed, but could be suitable for
development after 20 years, and (4) agricultural and other productive
lands and environmentally sensitive areas suitable for maximum
long-term conservation or permanent protection.<B>  </B>The idea
behind these categories is to increase density where people are
currently living and prevent other areas from being developed.
<P>
 Why force people to live closer together?  According to SB 377
it is to combat &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; i.e., the suburbanization
of housing patterns that has occurred since the 1950s.  The evils
that stem from &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; according to its enemies,
include increased traffic congestion and air pollution (both due
to longer work commutes) and inefficient use of land resources.
<P>
 Empirical evidence, however, clearly demonstrates that these
and other claims against suburbanization are false.  For instance:
 According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation,
most of the increase in peak-hour traffic congestion during the
1970s and early '80s came from <I>non</I>-work-related travel.
 As people have become more affluent, an increasing number have
been taking discretionary trips, especially during peak-hours.
 The survey also found that any growth in work-related commuting
has occurred during <I>non</I>-peak hours.  Urban sprawl, therefore,
is not the primary cause of increased peak-hour congestion or
air pollution.
<P>
 Ironically, increased densities of the sort sought by SB 377
will itself lead to increased congestion.  Why?  Because increased
densities will lead to more discretionary commutes in more densely
developed areas.
<P>
<B> </B>Like most central land-use plans, SB 377 also seeks to
increase the use of public mass transit-specifically light rail.<B>
 </B>What it doesn't detail is the enormous cost to the public
of mass transit systems.  Miami's rail system, for example, costs
a staggering $16.77 per passenger.  And according to a study by
the Congressional Budget Office, light rail is the most expensive
form of mass transit on a per-passenger-mile cost basis.
<P>
<B> </B>Another myth about urban sprawl-enshrined in the fourth
land category defined in SB 377-is that it is depleting beautiful
land and vital agricultural land.  But the facts show that urban
development constitutes less than 3 percent of the land in the
United States.  In California, there are now more acres under
agricultural cultivation than in the 1950s, even though the state's
population has doubled.  This is because irrigation and other
technologies have allowed more unused land to be converted into
farm land.
<H2>The Economics of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 Although SB 377 offers rhetoric about economic development, its
words ring hollow.  By attempting to counter urban sprawl by reducing
the supply of land that can be developed, the bill will almost
surely raise the cost of land.  Reduced developer fees and expedited
review procedures will not be enough to offset the fact that less
land means higher prices.  
<P>
 In Southeast England, which has its own version of &quot;compact
development&quot; and land categorization, an acre of urban land
is an unbelievable 235-times more expensive than an acre of agricultural
land.  In California, where land prices are already high, more
rising costs will cause another round of business flight, not
to mention misery to home-buying families who can barely afford
current government-distorted housing costs.  
<P>
 Already businesses cite California's high land prices as a prime
reason why they are relocating or thinking about relocating. 
SB 377 would only exacerbate this serious problem.
<P>
 SB 377 fails to recognize that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is actually
an important factor in business expansion and profitability. 
For instance, as urban ecologist John Kasarda has pointed out:
 &quot;Regarding cost effectiveness, it is well documented that
many modern industries operate more efficiently in outlying locations
than in densely built-up centers, and that the costs of living
and costs of local government soar in large population concentrations.&quot;<B>
 </B>This view is echoed by USC professors Peter Gordon and Harry
Richardson, who say that business and industry has followed people
out to the less expensive suburbs.  They warn:  &quot;Problems
are most likely to arise when restrictive zoning measures prevent
industrial deconcentration or when 'slow growth' or 'growth centers'
policies limit it.&quot;<B>  </B>What this amounts to is that
job-creation will be undermined severely by the imposition of
&quot;compact development.&quot;
<P>
 Gordon and Richardson's USC colleague Richard Peiser makes the
point that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is, over time, self-correcting.
 That is, in a freely operating land market, suburban areas promote
higher-density development and are converted eventually into high
density areas.  Central land-use planning of the sort envisioned
by SB 377 is therefore unnecessary.
<H2>The Wide Net of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 What is most troublesome about SB 377 is the wide net it throws.
 Through its planning mechanisms, it seeks to address public infrastructure
investment, social equity considerations, environmental quality,
natural resource protection, housing affordability, and a myriad
of other goals and subgoals.  And despite all its soothing talk
of &quot;coordination,&quot; &quot;consistency,&quot; and &quot;cooperation,&quot;
the bill admits the problem:
<P>
[C]onflicts may occur between one or more goals or objectives
referenced in this section.  Therefore, it is the intent of the
Legislature that these conflicts be resolved by locating the development
and infrastructure necessary to accomodate planned levels of growth
within more compact development patterns within designated urban
areas established through a local regional planning process. .
. .
<P>
<B> </B>A clue to the nature and intensity of the conflicts inherent
in the bill's far-reaching goals can be seen in the provision
to &quot;ensure that the decisionmaking process regarding growth
and economic development reflects the ethnic, racial, gender,
and occupational diversity of California&quot; and &quot;that
substantive decisions provide for a fair and equitable sharing
of benefits and burdens among all ethnic, racial, gender, and
occupational groups.&quot;  SB 377 offers only vague generalizations
about how these goals will be implemented, e.g., it speaks of
&quot;measures to ensure enhanced representation of and accountability
to the state's diverse population in the decisionmaking process.&quot;
 Would .......such measures include subsidies to certain groups
or quotas in housing and quotas on government land-use planning
boards?  It is ominous in this context that a laundry list of
activist pro-affirmative action organizations (e.g., MALDEF and
the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans) have lined up in support
of SB 377.
<P>
 In sum, SB 377, for all its good intentions, will not achieve
its goals and will dangerously impair intelligent land-use planning
by cities and localities.  It incorporates many of the worst features
of central planning.  If Californians wish to achieve the goals
contained in SB 377-economic development, cleaner air, less congested
roads, etc.-they would do well to turn instead to the many market-based
solutions on the table.
<H2>Market-based Solutions</H2>

<P>
 Instead of comprehensive land use planning, our goal should be
a growth-management framework that allows the market to be largely
self-regulating.  
<P>
 A more direct and effective state strategy for growth management
would work through changes in the state Standard Zoning and Enabling
Act, the basic charter for local land-use planning authority.
 Through amendments to this act, the state could establish the
following guidelines:
<P>
*  Allow the building of accessory units in or on the property
of single family housing.  This would generate additional density
in suburbs without radically altering their character.  The Kemp
Commission on Affordable Housing estimates that this policy would
result in over three million affordable housing units nationwide.
 That is larger than the whole stock of publicly owned housing
in the nation.
<P>
*  Require that all residential land be zoned at up to eight units
to the acre, or some other moderate density standard.  This too
would generate additional density in places where there is demand
for it.  And it could encourage the private provision of open
space by allowing a reduction in minimum lot size.
<P>
*  Adopt an effective measure to reduce planning delays.  In Massachusetts,
local planning bodies have 120 days to rule.  If they do not,
approval is automatic.  Extensions are allowed under extraordinary
circumstances that are tightly defined.  Approvals may not be
appealed.  Refusals may be appealed to a judicial body established
by the state.  That body, too, has a strict time limit under which
to operate.
<P>
*  Restrict the use of impact fees, especially for &quot;infill&quot;
development.  We should fund our roads, which are the most costly
component of the infrastructure problem, with tolls and user charges,
as mentioned above.
<P>
 In addition, we should pass legislation allowing direct user-charges,
especially in the form of variable-rate or peak-hour pricing.
 A direct road pricing scheme will be a powerful incentive, in
the form of spontaneous price signals, for infill development
and rural land conservation.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
 As Californians wrestle over what our state should like in the
years to come, the keen observation of Nobel laureate economist
Frederick Hayek in his <I>Constitution of Liberty</I> should serve
as a warning to policy-maker who seek further centralization of
the planning function:
<P>
We must not overlook the fact that the market has, on the whole,
guided the evolution of cities more successfully, though imperfectly,
than is commonly realized and that most proposals to improve upon
this, not by making it work better, but by superimposing a system
of central direction, show little awareness of what such a system
would have to accomplish, even to equal the market in effectiveness.

Trends Point To Chaos:<BR>
California's Budget And California's Future
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
When the 1993-94 state budget compromise was reached, a collective
sigh of relief arose from the Capitol.  The dread possibility
of a repeat of last year's budget stalemate was avoided.  But
this relief is shortsighted.  The fiscal and budgetary trends
of the past several years, taken with projections for the rest
of the decade, suggest strongly that unless dramatic steps are
taken to revive the state's economy, California is headed toward
an economic Armageddon.
<H2>Declining Revenues</H2>

<P>
For three years California's government has overprojected revenues.
 In 1990-91, the state's initial revenue estimate was $5 billion
too high.  In 1991-92 the overestimate was $7 billion.  In 1992-93,
it was high again by about $5 billion.  In other words, the aggregate
miscalculation of revenue projections over the past three years
was $17 billion-or 11 percent of that period's aggregate budget
total.
<P>
Why were these forecasts so grossly inaccurate?  Because they
were based on false predictions of a statewide economic recovery.
<P>
It is worth emphasizing that the decline in state revenues is
not the result of low taxation.  Indeed, in 1991-92 California
experienced the biggest tax increase in its history.  Still revenues
fell.  As the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded, &quot;Most
of this weakness in the performance of state revenues can be attributed
to the weak performance of the state's economy.&quot;  It continued:
 
<P>
The state's revenue forecasting models, which are based primarily
on historical relationships between economic variables and tax
receipts, are currently subject to greater-than-normal error margins.
 In part, this reflects the fact that the state has no relevant
historical experience to guide it in forecasting revenues under
severe recessionary conditions.
<P>
We must conclude:  The urgent question for the Governor and the
Legislature is <I>not</I> how to increase taxes, but how to revive
the state's economy.  Unfortunately, despite a lot of rhetoric
about making California competitive again, little positive has
been done to revive the state's business climate.
<P>
Early this year, California's Department of Finance (DoF) forecast
modest economic gains following the third quarter of 1993 and
continuing through 1994.  But its recent survey of state revenue
figures revealed June 1993 sales tax revenues of $121 million,
7.3 percent below its own earlier projections.  Reporting general
fund revenues through June to be $65 million below its forecast,
DoF acknowledged:  &quot;California's recession entered its fourth
year in June, with few signs of any sustained turnaround....&quot;
 
<P>
Independent experts agree.  Consider a May 1993 study by Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric:  &quot;California shows very few signs of
immediate recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.&quot;
 According to PG&amp;E projections, state unemployment in 1994
will remain between 9.0 and 9.5 percent, or 2.0 to 2.5 percent
higher than the national unemployment level.
<P>
If such independent analyses are accurate, one can expect another
state budget shortfall in 1994, in addition to the $2.7 billion
deficit rolled over as part of the 1993 budget compromise.
<P>
Since the end of fiscal year 1989, the state has had to borrow
money-despite the existence on paper of positive budget balances-because
of a hidden cash-flow problem.  It is estimated that this cash
flow &quot;gap&quot; will total $1.7 billion at the end of 1993-94.
 More ominously, the state has been borrowing money against future
revenues.  By the end of 1993-94, it will be saddled with a $2-billion
liability that does not show up in the normal budget numbers.
<P>
Furthermore, even with the state's optimistic economic forecast,
the Legislative Analyst's Office projects a budget shortfall for
1994-95 of another $5 billion.
<P>
In brief, the underlying ills of California's economy, as outlined
in last year's Council on California Competitiveness report, have
yet to be addressed by state policymakers.  Overregulation, high
taxes, and a Byzantine legal system continue to drive jobs and
industry out of the state.
<H2>Spending Growth</H2>

<P>
At the same time economic stagnation reduces revenues, state spending
continues to rise.
<P>
It is often said that 85 to 90 percent of the budget is &quot;locked
in.&quot;  This means that most of the programs in the budget
(such as education and welfare) are automatically fully funded.
 Thus, for instance, under Proposition 98 spending formulas, K-12
education must not only receive a minimum 40 percent of the budget,
it also receives an inordinate share of extra revenues.  Because
such programs are run according to automatic spending formulas,
any increase in the number of program recipients requires the
state to spend more money, regardless of whether it has any money.
 That is, as the numbers of public school students, welfare recipients,
Medi-Cal recipients, etc. continue to increase, spending must
increase regardless of the state's funding resources.  Alarmingly,
these increases are projected to accelerate for the rest of the
decade.
<P>
In the aggregate, there are now six taxpayers for every five tax
recipients in California.  By 1995, it is estimated that the state
will have more tax recipients than taxpayers.  And by the year
2000, the imbalance will worsen to the point where there will
be only four taxpayers for every five tax recipients.
<P>
The consequences are clear:  &quot;After 1993-94, the shortfall
continues to widen because of the on-going disparity between baseline
spending growth and the rate of revenue growth.&quot;  In other
words, deficits will worsen.
<P>
Consider education:  The K-14 student population will increase
by 85,000 from 1993 to 1994.  This represents an added funding
responsibility of more than $300 million.  Longer term, student
population is projected to increase 40 percent (three times faster
than the working and taxpaying population) through 2000.  Even
assuming that state spending remains at $4,200 per student, this
would translate into an additional cost of $5.8 billion.  Nor
does this include the cost of building new schools to accomodate
the additional students, which could add another $1.1 billion
to the total.
<P>
The fact is, in California, education has become an entitlement
program.  According to Prop 98 funding formulas, today's $4,200-per-student
state spending rate has become an effective spending floor.  Although
Governor Wilson has thus far prevailed over the public school
establishment in interpreting Prop 98, state spending per student
has not declined.  Also under Prop 98, when economic conditions
force the state to limit increases in education spending, drastic
increases are required when the economy recovers-regardless of
whether the public and its representatives believe such increases
are warranted.  Such requirements have placed the budget on automatic
pilot, in effect guaranteeing increased spending and widening
deficits.
<P>
Or consider welfare:  In 1992-93, approximately 2.46 million Californians
were on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the state's
principal welfare program.  This will increase by 114,000 to 2.57
million in 1993-94.  By the year 2000, it will have increased
to almost 3 million.  Costs to the state's general fund would
rise from $2.9 billion this year to $4-4.5 billion in 2000.  According
to 1992 DoF estimates, in 1980 there were 6.9 taxpayers for each
AFDC recipient.  By 2000, this ratio will be 2.94-1.
<P>
Medi-Cal is another entitlement program that is headed toward
unprecedented caseload growth.  In 1993-94, Medi-Cal will cost
the state's general fund $5.5 billion, with 5.4 million people
qualifying.  By the end of the decade, the number of recipients
is projected to rise to 6.8 million, costing the state general
fund $12.3 billion.
<P>
Finally, conservative estimates are that 100,000 foreigners per
year enter California illegally to join the 1.3 million illegal
immigrants already here.  The State Auditor General estimates
the net cost of the services provided by state and local governments
to illegal aliens to be a whopping $3 billion a year.  Nor does
this take into account the infants born to illegal aliens in the
state, who are then classified as U.S. citizens.  In California's
public schools, 866,000 students (17 percent of the total public
school population) are the children of illegal and noncitizen
immigrants.  These students cost the state and local school districts
$3.6 billion a year.
<P>
Although it is difficult not to feel real sympathy for the hardships
that these people are forced to endure in their homelands, the
cold, hard fact is that the costs they impose on state taxpayers
are just as real and are growing exponentially.  With guaranteed
spending formulas in place for education and other social services,
illegal immigration threatens to break the bank.
<P>
These spending trends, added together with declining revenue trends,
indicate that fiscal chaos lies just around the corner.  In fact,
state finance experts have openly discussed the possibility of
a $20-billion state budget deficit by the year 2000.
<H2>Dead-end Reforms</H2>

<P>
California's recurring budget deficits have spawned a couple of
proposed solutions.  One is multi-year budgeting.  Instead of
trying to balance the budget every year, multi-year budgeting
allows for the deficit to be spread over a two-or-more-year period.
 This is the so-called &quot;rollover'' of the deficit that was
agreed to in the 1993 compromise.  
<P>
Unfortunately, multi-year budgeting fails to address the real
budget trends described above.  It does nothing to revive the
economy or increase revenues.  Nor does it reduce caseload growth
in entitlement programs or government spending in general.  Multi-year
budgeting is a stopgap measure that only delays the day of reckoning.
<P>
The second idea to solve the state's budget problems is reducing
the legislative vote requirement for budget approval from two-thirds
to a simple majority.  The argument here is that by allowing a
simple majority to approve a budget, the majority party in the
Legislature will have to shoulder full responsibility.
<P>
Although this proposal is theoretically appealing from a democratic
point of view, it has several problems.  First, from a practical
perspective, it would give the current big-spending liberal majority
carte blanche to exacerbate the budget problem beyond repair.
 Second, it does not address the so-called &quot;trailer bills&quot;
which set specific spending totals for state programs.  Unless
these latter (which currently require a two-thirds vote) are also
subject to majority approval, a majority vote on the budget resolution
would be useless.
<P>
Finally, as with rolling over the deficit, this reform does not
address the root problems:  declining revenues and rising expenditures.
<H2>Radical Reforms Needed</H2>

<P>
Is it possible to avert fiscal chaos in California?  Yes.  But
several painful and difficult steps must be taken.
<P>
What is required is nothing less than a radical overhaul of the
tax-spend-and-regulate status quo in Sacramento.  In brief, the
state's economy must be revived through tax cuts and a wholesale
rollback of regulations.  
<P>
On the spending front, Proposition 98 must be amended or suspended
and parents should be provided vouchers to send their children
to more cost-effective private schools.  Whole bureaucracies should
be eliminated, either through privatization or by recognizing
that they are not needed.  Welfare should be cut significantly.
 The state should eliminate all services to illegal aliens, even
if it means challenging the federal government and the courts.
<P>
These steps are painful and difficult indeed.  But only such a
radical prescription will steer us clear of economic chaos.

REGULATING THE AMERICAN DREAM:<BR>
THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA
<H1>Conference Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I>To examine and evaluate California's current housing crisis,
the Claremont Institute and the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) sponsored a conference on June
1-2, 1993 in Newport Beach, entitled &quot;Regulating the American
Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California.&quot;  This is a brief
report on its major speeches, discussions and conclusions.  </I>
<P>
California's population continues to grow as the construction
of reasonably priced housing units is sharply declining.  The
state's housing is among the least affordable in the nation. 
What accounts for this?  Some say &quot;too much growth.&quot;
 Others point to regulation of the home building industry.  On
June 1-2, leaders from state and local governments, the academy,
the building industry and environmental organizations gathered
in Newport Beach to address this disagreement on panels dealing
with growth and demographics, regulatory barriers, environmental
regulation, impact fees, the credit crunch, and growth management.
<P>
&quot;Regulating the American Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California&quot;
featured luncheon addresses by Thomas Sayles, Secretary of the
California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and Anthony
Downs of the Brookings Institution.  Secretary Sayles demonstrated
that housing regulation is responsible for preventing development
in the inner-cities.  Builders who might consider financing larger
and more affordable projects are being driven away by over-regulation
and the huge costs associated with the approval process.  Mr.
Downs seconded this argument, explaining how those most hurt by
regulations are often those whom the regulations are intended
to help.  
<P>
A discussion of the Endangered Species Act dominated the first
afternoon.  Douglas Wheeler, Secretary of the California Resources
Agency and one of the original architects of the legislation,
argued that the law's original intent was to protect endangered
species on public lands.  Gradually the law came to include private
lands as well.  Mr. Wheeler suggested that governmental &quot;takings&quot;
of private property be eliminated in favor of a program that purchased
private lands inhabited by endangered species.  Claremont Institute
President Larry Arnn warned that if there were insufficient funds
for such a program, development would likely be stopped.  Property
owners would then be forced to pay the entire cost of species
protection.
<P>
On the second morning, Richard Sybert, Director of the California
Office of Planning and Research, presented Governor Wilson's Strategic
Growth Plan.  He noted that the plan purposefully avoids the phrase
&quot;growth management&quot; in order to reflect the fact that
better planning and regulatory reform would result in job creation
and economic development.  The Governor's plan does not arbitrarily
limit growth, but would enable the state to adjust to inevitable
population increases.
<P>
Most attendees expressed caution regarding state involvement in
land-use issues.  While the state should advocate reform of local
regulations hindering housing development, it should not replace
local government as the authority on land-use decisions.
<P>
The conference concluded with a plenary session moderated by HCD
Director Timothy Coyle and Claremont Institute President Larry
Arnn.  Its overwhelming conclusion was that immediate action is
needed to reverse the troubling trend toward over-regulation.
 Six adverse polices that should be reformed and four positive
actions to be taken by state and local governments were identified:
<H2>ADVERSE POLICIES TO BE REFORMED</H2>

<P>
1. CEQA REVIEWS-Under the California Environmental Quality Act,
construction reviews are concluded when the project is in progress.
 Mandated changes customarily involve enormous expense that is
passed on to the consumer.  It would be more reasonable for these
reviews to be conducted in the planning stage.
<P>
2. IMPACT FEES-As things stand, impact fees can exceed $25,000
per housing unit.  In addition to decreasing the number of affordable
units, these fees place a heavy and inequitable burden for public
works and local government services on new home buyers-primarily
the young and the poor.  These fees should be reduced in number
as well as amount and brought into line with the cost of the actual
service provided.
<P>
3. UNCOMPENSATED TAKINGS-Through regulation, state and local governments
are unjustly reducing the worth of private property.  The state
should develop means to ensure enforcement of the takings clause
of the Fifth Amendment.
<P>
4. DOWNZONING-Zoning ordinances which limit the number of units
built on a piece of property force home builders to overbuild
the high-price end of the housing market.  Inevitably, when that
surplus is realized, crashing property values have a severe economic
impact.  Downzoning should be discontinued through the adoption
of minimum-density standards.
<P>
5. DELAYS AND FEE INCREASES-A largely unrecognized problem faced
by home builders is the length of time required to obtain the
necessary permits and approvals.  Time is money, and the new home
buyer or renter is the one who will end up paying for that time.
 In addition, regulatory changes are sometimes made and fees increased
in mid-project.  The  permit process should be streamlined and
fees should be guaranteed at the project inception.  
<P>
6. FEDERALIZATION-Broad national standards fitting a certain theoretical
model are increasingly applied without exception to the many,
diverse communities of the country.  At best these regulations
are unnecessary or irrelevant.  At worst they are contrary to
their intended purpose.  The principle of allowing local people
to decide local issues should be revived.
<H2>POSITIVE ACTIONS</H2>

<P>
1. FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION-The state should shift its priorities
to focus on housing production rather than regulation.
<P>
2. UNIVERSAL 8 UNITS/ACRE-The state should adopt the recommendation
of the HUD Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing
to allow up to 8 housing units per acre.
<P>
3. TIME LIMITS-The state should set strict limits on delays, guaranteeing
that unless permits are denied within a set period of time, development
may proceed as planned.
<P>
4. USE OF AVAILABLE FUNDS-State and local governments should use
existing funds to compensate for unjust takings.
<P>
California's population will continue to grow and the demand for
housing in the state will increase.  It is time to recognize that
life in California will be different than it was in the 1950s.
 This is not to say it will be bad.  Market forces should be given
latitude in helping California adjust to changing demographics
and economic forces.  We cannot afford to stifle opportunity.
 We must encourage the private initiative that has always made
California great.

Environmental Protection through Market Incentives:
A Strategy for the Future
</h1>

</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental Protection
Agency sponsored a major conference, entitled &quot;Environmental
Protection Through Market Incentives: A Strategy for the Future,&quot;
at the Los Angeles Biltmore on January 20-21, 1993.  This conference
addressed the promise of market-based solutions to environmental
problems, as opposed to the command-and-control strategies of
the past.  The following two essays are adapted from the luncheon
speeches delivered at the conference.</I>
<P>

<CENTER>
*     *     *
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>&quot;That We Should Fix The Roof While The Sun Is Shining&quot;</B>
<P>
James M. Strock, California Secretary for Environmental Protection
<P>
 There are just a couple of points I'd like to make.  The first
concerns where this market incentive issue fits into what Cal/EPA
is trying to do overall to meet the Governor's agenda.  The Governor
made it clear from Day One that a key goal of his in creating
Cal/EPA was to help reconcile environmental improvement and economic
activity and also to change the dialogue in this area.  Clearly
market incentives are key opportunities for us in these very difficult
times.
<P>
 There are three key priorities: (1) reform and simplification
of the permitting process, (2) taking advantage of environmental
technology, and (3) moving toward better market incentive policies.
<P>
 Today, government <I>truly is</I> looking at market incentives,
because it simply cannot meet all of the mandates, much less the
expectations now before it, through traditional means.  Public
support will not be there when you look at some of the implications
of continuing along the lines of the past.  That's not to discredit
the past; it is merely to keep growing and go beyond it.
<P>
 The areas of market incentives which we are focused on at this
conference over these are very important, and we hope to leave
here with one or two proposals that, working with key legislators
and with the Governor's leadership, we might be able to be put
into practice in the next few years.  That includes tradable permit
systems.  And I'd remind people that there is a real potential
for a national debate on this concept in conjunction with the
Clean Water Act reauthorization this coming year.  Also, we intend
to continue to help in the RECLAIM efforts, and to look at the
use of market incentives in transportation areas and in informational
areas like Prop 65 and the toxics release inventory.  Finally,
state procurement efforts are already occurring for alternative
fuel vehiclesthe &quot;Green Lights&quot; program and others.
<P>
 That being said, why is this so important?  Why does this matter
to us so much right now?
<P>
 First, I think it's because market incentive programs, if they
work, empower people.  They give people more choicesthat is, better
choicesin how to produce things and how to meet environmental
standards.  They also lead to better informed decisions by consumers,
as will occur when Prop 65 meets its purpose.  
<P>
 A second reason market incentives are desirable is that they
hold the promise of reducing the number of middlemen or middlewomen
in the process.  There are two types of these that are most important.
 One is government itself involved in permit decisions.  The other
is the myriad of lawyers and consultants who now have to get paid
several hundred dollars an hour to figure out how to do these
things.  We all know that this is not value-added activity.  Here
is a key area where we can make progress on transaction fees consistent
with the need to protect the environment.
<P>
 So what are the implications of market-incentive programs that
we have to think about as we move ahead, particularly if we want
to get public support?
<P>
 First, it is very important that the early efforts be made to
work and be seen to work.  That, of course, is a big issue with
the very strong leadership moves by the South Coast Air Quality
District on RECLAIM.  There are very tough questions with respect
to the inventories being considered, and the baseline numbers
that result, and the enforcement and monitoring that will result.
 But these are not reasons to give up.  They are reasons to press
on very hard.  
<P>
 Second, we need to look at integrated pollution control.  The
existing divisions between air and water and waste and pesticides
really only make sense because of the way these laws were created.
 If we were starting today, for either environmental or economic
reasons, we would not proceed based on these divisions.  The fact
is that if market incentive programs are done totally without
regard to the effect of, for instance, air programs on water programs,
or programs in one geographic area on another geographic area,
we will not be doing a service but merely recreating the kind
of trouble we have had in the past. 
<P>
 Finally, there are very tough distributional issues among businesses
and among people in general.  But again, we can make these things
work and make progress.  The key is to work together now and to
focus on this very directly within the next few months.
<P>
 We all know there is very strong public support-as there ought
to be-for environmental protection.  But it is important, given
the tremendous resources California is putting into environmental
protection, that we fix the roof while the sun is shining and
improve the system.  We're being driven toward it by competition
both here and, of course, abroad.
<P>
 When The Claremont Institute was putting together parts of this
conference, it turned out that some international journalists
were going to come and cover it.  This is because market incentive
programs are something their countries might adopt.  They don't
come and cover our decisions on permitting because they don't
want to adopt our permitting system.  That ought to tell us something.
 What we are doing today is going to be a very real economic and
environmental benefitif it's done right.  The choice lies with
people like those at this conference and their willingness to
work with leaders like the Governor who seek to move forward in
this area.
<P>
 Finally, a personal point.  David Sive, of the Environmental
Law Institute, has made the point that the whole first phase of
environmental protection in this country was unique in being a
social movement driven by law and lawyers.  And so it was.  And
what a remarkable achievement it was.  But I think the next phase
will not be so dominated by laws and lawyers.  Now there are tremendous
opportunities to bring together the environment and the economy,
including the people who are creative in business and the people
who work in science.  
<P>
 In the future, we should keep the benefits of a legal approach
while also being mindful of at least one negative: lawyers tend
to get paid to go through a big document or a big problem and
come back with a whole list of more problems.  That is very useful
in its place.  But we can't let this kind of attention to detail
limit the greater vision or opportunities we have.  And I hope
that with strong leadership we can get to the next phase and do
something quite productive.

<B>Market Incentives and Market Opportunities:</B>
<P>
<B>A Fresh Look at Environmental Regulation in California</B>
<P>
Julie Meier Wright, California Secretary for Trade and Commerce
<P>
 At the heart of the long-term solution needed to strengthen California's
economy is the need for dramatic changes in our current method
of environmental protection.  While we recognize the need to safeguard
our environment, there also exists an opportunity for California
to benefit from our expertise as innovators in a $200 billion
annual worldwide market for environmental technology.
<P>
 If it is true that past is prologue, then we should look at recent
events in planning for the future.  An underlying dynamic in the
collapse of Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the
dramatic changes in the nations of Eastern Europe was the utter
failure of the command-and-control economic system in those nations.
<P>
 A command-and-control system cannot compete with a free market
system.  The economies of Eastern Europe and Soviet Union collapsed
because of their inability to meet the fundamental needs of their
people.  The free market economies of the West and the Pacific
Rim won an economic victory over communism.
<P>
 There is a lesson for us here.  The same is true for a command-and-control
based method of environmental protection.  The Wilson Administration
is proposing to move to a market incentive based system of environmental
protection.  We believe such a move will make California's economy
more efficient and competitive, while simultaneously providing
us with a cleaner environment.
<P>
 This conference has included some fabulous presentations on the
specifics of establishing a market incentive based program of
environmental protection.  I want to touch upon the economic advantages
for California and the opportunities to create California jobs
in both market-incentive based environmental protection and cutting-edge
environmental technology.  I also want to provide a business perspective
on the ways in which Governor Wilson and his Administration are
working to streamline California's environmental regulations to
make our state more competitive and on some of the initiatives
we are supporting to nurture our state's environmental technology
industry.
<P>
 California is a major player in the global economy.  Were we
an independent nation, we would have the world's eighth largest
economy.  Trade plays a vital role in our state's economy.  Since
1990, California has suffered a loss of 800,000 jobs.  It would
have been far worse if not for our growing international trade.
 During this period, California exports grew by $4.7 billion,
creating nearly 50,000 new jobs.  These jobs are just the beginning.
 California is ideally situated to take advantage of the explosive
increase in global commerce.
<P>
 At the turn of the century, American diplomat John Hay said,
&quot;The Mediterranean is the ocean of the past, the Atlantic
is the ocean of the present, the Pacific is the ocean of the future.&quot;
 For California, Hay's prophecy is coming true.  Today eight of
our top ten trading partners are Pacific Rim nations.  The importance
of this is illustrated by the fact that U.S. trade with the Pacific
Rim is greater than our trade with Atlantic Basin nations.
<P>
 In addition to looking west to the Pacific Rim, we must look
south to Mexico and ultimately, I hope, to all of Central and
South America.  A study by KPMG Peat Marwick estimates that the
North American Free Trade Agreement will mean the creation of
3,800 jobs per year and an additional $2.3 billion annually for
our state's economy.  
<P>
 Clearly, trade and the global economy are vital to our state.
 When Governor Wilson named me Secretary of the newly-created
cabinet-level Trade and Commerce Agency, he gave me a mandate
to expand California's role in international trade.  He recognizes
the inexorable linkage between trade and job growth, and the absolute
necessity for California to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
 For California businesses to compete in this global marketplace,
they must be what I call &quot;competitive at the bottom line.&quot;
 They need a cooperative relationship with California's regulators
to replace the adversarial relationship that too often exists
today.  Let me stress that I'm not talking about reduced environmental
standards-California's strong health and safety standards are
vital to our quality of life.  They are part of the reason we've
been able to attract a high-quality workforce.  And, for the most
part, it's not the standards that create the Excedrin-sized headaches
for our state's business community.  The problem lies in the command-and-control
regulations with which businesses must comply.  Our environmental
standards should be descriptive, not prescriptive; results-based,
not rules-based.
<P>
 Californians are the most innovative people in the world.  What
we need are clear standards that allow businesses flexibility
to meet them in ways best suited to their businesses.  We should
set limits, not mandate how businesses reach those limits.  I
think we would be pleasantly surprised at the results.  This approach
offers two clear advantages.  First, it makes our businesses more
competitive.  Second, it enables us to deploy cutting-edge technology.
<P>
 What is the competitive issue?  Primarily that for business time
is money.  The game of regulatory roulette some of our businesses
find themselves playing can quickly turn into a game of Russian
roulette: you never know when you may find yourself looking down
the barrel at a job-killing regulatory delay.  Sadly, but understandably,
we in the Trade and Commerce Agency find that some businesses
refuse to play this game.  They find it safer to move their jobs
and capital to other states or nations.  Not so they don't have
to comply with high standards, but so that they can have confidence
that they can bring their investments on-line in a timely way.
 The result for California is lost jobs.
<P>
 For this reason, Governor Wilson asked Secretary Jim Strock of
Cal/EPA and me to work together to streamline our system of environmental
regulations.  This state permit reform effort has been an inclusive
one, and several state agencies are exploring the feasibility
of market-based incentives.  The market-incentive program that
has been undertaken by the South Coast AQMD evolved from such
a process.  We support this program and are convinced that it
will provide us with an important body of knowledge as we seek
to apply market-based incentives to other environmental regulatory
programs.
<P>
 The Governor's Council on California Competitiveness found that
72 different agencies-local, state and federal-have environmental
authority in Los Angeles County alone, with a typical business
requiring a dozen or so permits.  A new business might have successfully
filed 12 permits, and then have their opening delayed due to problems
with required permit number 13.  For large companies, this means
overhead in the form of experts to work a complex process.  For
a small company, this could mean an inability even to get off
the ground-at a time when new small companies are key to bringing
California out of the recession.
<P>
 At a meeting with Sacramento business leaders earlier this month,
one entrepreneur told Governor Wilson, &quot;I'd rather get a
'no' in two months than a 'yes' in two years.&quot;  I can tell
you that if all we can promise is two years, we won't even have
the chance to try.  And more California jobs will disappear.
<P>
 What are we doing about it?  We're pushing through permit streamlining
and one-stop permitting.  In addition, we're working with Cal/EPA
to assign an environmental compliance specialist to each of the
Trade and Commerce Agency's four regional offices, as front-line
business assistance.  The Red Team approach I brought to state
government works, but it's only a temporary solutionand it's not
a substitute for sound public policy reform that makes compatible
a clean environment and a strong economy.
<P>
 Eliminating the command-and-control approach also enables us
to bring cutting-edge environmental technology to the marketplace
far more quickly.  The very nature of a command-and-control system
of regulation means that environmental technologies are often
obsolete by the time they travel through the regulatory gauntlet.
 We will all benefitin high environmental standards and in developing
new marketsif we create a system that gets cutting-edge technology
into the marketplace as soon as possible.  We will enable businesses
to better meet their environmental obligations and to do so more
quickly and less expensively, and we will create California jobs.
<P>
 As you may have detected by now, the California endangered species
that concerns me most is the high-wage job.  Nothing has a greater
adverse effect on one's immediate environment than losing one's
job.  The beauty of the regulatory reforms we're discussing at
this conference is that they will positively affect both our physical
environment and our economic environment.
<P>
 In announcing the creation of the California Environmental Protection
Agency, Governor Wilson said: &quot;Environmental protection and
economic progress should not be viewed as competing goals but,
to the greatest possible extent, as complementary.  Where traditional
command-and-control regulation can be effectively supplemented
or supplanted by protective and legally enforceable market incentive
arrangements, we should do so.&quot;
<P>
 Just as a market-incentive based economy enabled us to win the
Cold War, so too will market-based environmental regulation enable
us to win the economic battles we are now fighting.  The command-and-control
economic system of the Soviet Union couldn't compete with free
market economies.  By taking the global lead in moving away from
a command-and-control regulatory system, we will have the competitive
advantage we need to successfully compete for jobs and industry.

<P>
 In addition to making our existing industries more competitive,
moving California into the forefront of new environmental technologies
helps us to grow an exciting new industry in which we already
have a strong foothold.  At present, there is a $200 billion annual
worldwide market for environmental technology.  California's share
is $25 billion.  When I look at a $25 billion industrial base
for California, I see a lot of jobs.  I also see opportunity for
even more growth.  Just by maintaining our market share, we would
see some growth due to an increasing demand for environmental
technologya demand that has the market growing at a sustained
7-8 percent per year.
<P>
 One of the things I learned in the private sector is that you
never stop marketing.  And you don't just maintain market share,
you gain share or you lose it.  
<P>
 There are some other reasons why the environmental technology
field is well-suited to providing the jobs our state needs.  Environmental
jobs are first and foremost technology jobs.  California is blessed
with a rich technology heritage and a technologically capable
workforce that is a national asset.  Many of these high-skilled
workers have been hurt by the defense budget cuts.  We have lost
more than 90,000 direct jobs, and their ripple effect on our overall
employment is 200,000 jobs-nearly 25 percent of our job loss since
the recession began.  For environmental technology business growth,
this shrinking defense base is a good source of skilled professionals-managerial,
engineering, and manufacturing.  A number of our aerospace companies
have already moved into the environmental control area by, in
some cases, adapting space technology and, in other cases, bringing
to the challenges of environmental cleanup their strong systems
engineering talents.
<P>
 Technology jobs demand a strong educational base, and our public
and private universities will continue to produce the scientists
and engineers needed to help us keep our technological edge. 
This is a high growth industry, just what we need to provide the
jobs for a rapidly growing population.  Today's $200 billion market
doesn't come close to providing the environmental protection and
mitigation our globe needs, and I believe that the steady growth
rate of the past few years will escalate as countries have the
opportunity to do it right the first time. 
<P>
 Earlier this century, California enjoyed tremendous spurts of
growth as we assumed world leadership in technology-intensive
industries such as aviation and electronics.  Today, there are
more than a million jobs associated with the high-technology industries
in our state.  When we are in a position to apply technology,
and when we create a regulatory environment that will let us retain
manufacturing jobs, we can create large numbers of jobs in California.
<P>
 Our high environmental standards have created a strong local
market for technology solutions.  Combined with our understanding
of world markets, this places us in a good position to compete
on a global basis.  There is a worldwide market for environmental
technology.  International trade is going to play a major role
in California's economic recovery, and this industry is becoming
one of our most important exports.
<P>
 These competitive advantages in and of themselves are not enough
for California's environmental technology industry to reach its
full potential.  Government has an important role to play.  After
all, government-mandated environmental standards created this
market for environmental technology.
<P>
 Governor Wilson identified environmental technology in his State
of the State address as a major area for economic growth and job
creation, and outlined a series of business incentives that will
spur the growth of this and other 21st century industries.  These
incentives will be particularly helpful to small businesses, start-up
businesses, and technology-based businessesthree categories into
which many of our environmental firms fall.
<P>
 These proposals include: (1) Increasing the research-and-development
tax credit from 8 percent to 12 percent, and doubling it to 24
percent for university-based research.  (2) Last year, Governor
Wilson signed legislation which makes it easier for small companies
to issue stock.  This year, he is calling for a small business
investment tax credit, one which encourages patient capital. 
The investment tax credit would be on a sliding scalefour percent
for investments held two years up to 16 percent for longer-term
investments.  (3) Restoring the Net Operating Loss carry forward
provision in 1993.
<P>
 The Governor has also asked his newly formed Council of Economic
Advisors headed by former Secretary of State and Secretary of
Treasury George Schultz to determine how a sales tax exemption
or investment tax credit on manufacturing equipment purchases
can be implemented in a way that will create the greatest number
of new jobs and the highest return to the General Fund.  At a
time of continuing budget crisis, the decision to call for these
tax incentives was not easily reached.  However, the Governor
believes the answer to California's economic ills is jobs-and
that incentives to create job growth are vital.
<P>
 Finally, to lead our state's efforts in marketing environmental
technology, the Governor created a blue-ribbon task forcethe California
Environmental Technology Partnership-composed of business leaders,
environmental groups and research institutions and the continuing
partnership of Cal/EPA and the Trade and Commerce Agency.
<P>
 Regulatory reform and business incentives require the support
of the Legislature, and they need to hear from you.  I hope each
of you will support our efforts towards market incentive-based
environmental regulation, towards regulatory reform and permit
streamlining, towards a government-industry-academic-environmental
partnership, and towards the implementation of the kind of business
incentives which will provide a dynamic boost to the environmental
technology industry and other emerging companies in our state.
<P>
 We also need your help in supporting real workers' compensation
reform.  Our best efforts at creating new industries will be for
naught if our scandalous workers' compensation system drives the
jobs out of state.
<P>
 This is an exciting time in California.  Today we have the opportunity
not just to move toward market-based incentives to allow California
companies predictability and creativity to respond, but we also
have the opportunity to take the fruits of that creativity and
market it around the world.  Then California's high standards
will have paid off in not only a cleaner environment, but in sustained
economic growtha real win-win situation for the Golden State.

<TITLE>How California Can Lead the Way Against Illegal Immigration</TITLE>

<h1>How California Can Lead the Way<BR>
Against Illegal Immigration</h1>

</CENTER>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<hr>
<p>

In a 1992 Roper Poll, 86 percent of Americans
said that illegal immigration is an important issue.  Yet with
a few notable exceptions, our political leaders have been silent
on the issue.  Why?
<p>

Part of the reason lies in the reluctance of
many of our leaders to violate the taboos of &quot;political correctness.&quot; 
 According to the standards of this code, law and common sense
are no excuses for opposing the growing tide of Mexicans flooding
into California each day.  Thus Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and
others have found that standing against this tide invites charges
of racism in the liberal media.
<p>

In addition, state officials
often dismiss illegal immigration as a federal problem, saying
that there is little they can do about it.

<p>

In this paper, we will
show, first, that the problem of illegal immigration is so dramatic
that the &quot;politically correct&quot; position is economically,
not to mention constitutionally irresponsible.  Second, we will
show that while <I>border control</I> is a federal responsibility,
there is a whole range of actions that California can take on
its own, now, to discourage illegal immigration.

<h3>The Economic Cost of Illegal Immigration</h3>

When confronted with
the immense scale of illegal immigration, opponents of get-tough
policies often claim that it represents an economic boon; that
illegal immigrants work and pay taxes, and that their net impact
on America's economy is positive.  In fact, illegal immigration
places a massive financial burden on California's taxpayers. 

<p>

In a recent report, the State Auditor General's Office has calculated
the costs of illegal immigration on San Diego County alone.  While
acknowledging that illegal immigrants lower the cost of locally
produced goods and services because of the reduced wages they
receive, and contribute $60.5 million in taxes to state and county
government, the report makes it abundantly clear that these benefits
are offset by staggering costs.

<p>

For one thing, more than half of
illegal immigrants do not have taxes withheld from their wages,
and only 19 percent file income tax returns.  For another, illegal
immigrants enjoy many expensive taxpayer-supported government
benefits.

<p>

Consider education.  In San Diego County schools, there
are between 11,000 and 13,000 illegal immigrant children.  The
annual average cost of their education is $49.2 million.  Add
the costs of General Education Grants, Limited English Proficiency
Grants, and tax-subsidized higher education services, and the
total annual cost to county and state taxpayers for educating
illegal immigrants in San Diego County comes to $60.6 million.
 This alone offsets the aforementioned tax revenues.

<p>

Illegal immigrants also enjoy various health-care benefits, including indigent medical
care at specified clinics, maternal health care, Medi-Cal-provided
emergency and pregnancy services, and ambulance and paramedic
services.  The price tag for delivery of these health services
to illegal immigrants living in San Diego County is a hefty $26.6
million per year.

<p>

Social services, especially welfare, represent
a third significant cost.  There were nearly 4,000 cases of illegal-immigrant
use of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)the state's
main welfare programin San Diego County during the course of the
Auditor General's study.  The annual cost runs to $11.7 million.
 Furthermore,

<blockquote>

<P>
It is thought that certain undocumented immigrants gain entry
into the United States illegally <I>for the express purpose of
giving birth to a child on United States soil. </I> Once born
in the United States, the child becomes eligible for a variety
of programs as a United States citizen, including AFDC. . . . 
Technically, under AFDC, it is the United States citizen child
who receives the aid, but the <I>de facto</I> recipients may be
undocumented immigrant parents or family members in guardianship
of the child. 

</blockquote>

<p>
The final large-cost area is the criminal justice
system.  In San Diego County, an average of 16,000 felony and
misdemeanor cases involving illegal immigrants pass through this
system every year.  Add police costs, court costs, district attorney
and public defender costs, probation investigation costs, and
incarceration costs, and the annual price tag amounts to an astounding
$105.7 million.  Of course the larger social costs are inestimable.

<p>

If one adds up the costs of state and local government services to
illegal immigrants in San Diego County, and subtracts illegal
immigrant tax revenues, the annual net cost to taxpayers is a
whopping $145.9 million.

<p>

Again:  this is just San Diego County.
 In Los Angeles County, it is estimated that the net cost of providing
health, education, and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants
rose by almost $70 million (a 34-percent increase) over the past
two years, to a total of $276 million.

<p>

Consider too that California's
state prisons currently hold some 15,000 illegal immigrant convicted
felons.  The cost of feeding and housing them comes to $300 million
per year.  This figure will no doubt increase given the fact that,
according to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, nearly one-third
of the hoodlums who looted and pillaged Los Angeles in the May
1992 riots were illegal immigrants.

<p>

What, then, is the total annual
net cost to Californians of illegal immigration?  By the Auditor
General's conservative estimate, a breathtaking $3 billion.

<p>

Although he was criticized by the liberal media for his comments, the cold,
hard facts support Governor Wilson's observation that illegal
immigration is a significant cause of California's fiscal woes.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

Illegal immigration is not exclusively a federal
problem.  Indeed, the root of the problem in California lies in
the incentives to illegal immigration which exist in the state
and which can be largely eliminated at the state level.  Below
we list the most important areas in which incentives exist and
numerous specific reform measures which should be taken.

<H4>Government Benefits</H4>

<P>
<B>1.  Implement the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement
computerized data system (SAVE) in all state agencies that grant
benefits.  </B>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service maintains
SAVE, which lists all legal residents in the United States.  The
federal government now uses SAVE to prevent illegal immigrants
from obtaining welfare and other cash benefits to which they are
not entitled:  If a person's name does not show up on the computer
lists, he or she does not get the benefit.  At this time many
state agencies in charge of supplying benefits do not use SAVE.
 They should be required to do so by executive order and/or legislation
without delay.
<P>
<B>2.  Employ SAVE to screen public housing applicants.</B>
<p>
State
government funds public housing, both by operating public-housing
facilities and by making grants to builders and others for the
construction or rehabilitation of homes and rental units.  Unfortunatelylike
the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington,
D.C.the state does not screen public housing applicants to determine
their residency status.  The officials and agencies involved should
be required to do so.
<P>
<B>3.  Employ SAVE at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </B>
<p>
Obtaining
benefits often requires valid identification such as a driver's
license.  Procuring such identification is far too easy.  The
Department of Motor Vehicles, for instance, rarely asks about
residency status when issuing a driver's license.  It should be
required to verify such status before any license is issued.
<P>
<B>4.  Require information-sharing between state agencies and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</B>
<p>
As things stand,
there is precious little sharing of information among different
agencies at different levels of government.  Procedures should
be established to require state and county agencies to notify
each other and the INS when they have information that illegal
immigrants are applying for benefits.


<H2>Education</H2>

<P>
<B>1.  Restrict admission to state universities to citizens and
legal residents.  </B>
<p>
Currently, qualified applicants are being
turned away from the public universities of their choice because
of budget limitations and overcrowding.  Yet these tax-supported
schools admit illegal immigrants.  In the Auditor General's report
mentioned above, it is estimated that the cost to the California
taxpayer of illegal immigrant students just at San Diego State
University and California State University-San Marcos is $635,000.
 This situation is absurd.  It can and should be stopped.
<P>
<B>2.  Challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Pyler
v. Doe, requiring the states to provide public education at the
elementary and secondary levels to illegal immigrant children.</B>

<p>
In California's ongoing budget crisis, rising education costs
represent the biggest problem.  To a large extent, the bloated
education bureaucracy is at fault.  Still, the fact is that a
new school has to be built each day to meet demand.  In this light
it makes no sense that California taxpayers are forced to finance
the education of children who are in our country illegally.  
The Supreme Court decision behind this requirementone of the oddest
and potentially most destructive decisions in the history of the
Courtpassed a decade ago by a slim 5 to 4 vote.  There is now
new blood on the Supreme Court, and this issue screams to be revisited.
 California taxpayers, school districts, county governments and/or
the Attorney General should initiate legal actions to bring the
matter back before the courts.


<H2>Employment</H2>

<B>1.  Initiate a statewide policy to transfer jobs from illegal
immigrants to unemployed American citizens and legal residents
who are now receiving welfare.  </B>
<p>
Unemployment in California
is nearing 10 percent and welfare costs are skyrocketing.  Cooperative
efforts should be established between county welfare departments,
the State Employment Development Department, and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to ensure that when illegal immigrants
are apprehended and removed from worksites, legal workers (particularly
those on welfare) are referred to the employer to fill the vacancies.
 Incentives, such as reduced fines, can be given to cooperating
employers.  Such action on the part of the Governor and/or the
legislature will at once reduce welfare costs, unemployment, and
the blackmarket job pool which represents a significant incentive
for illegal immigration.
<P>

<B>2.  Require the California Employment Development Department
to employ SAVE to screen out illegal immigrant job applicants.
</B>

<p>
Currently, while applicants for unemployment insurance are
screened to ensure that they are citizens or legal residentsand
while federal law requires private employers to screen applicantsan
illegal immigrant can walk into a state EDD office and receive
job-placement assistance.  EDD should be directed by the Governor
and/or legislation to remedy the situation immediately with strict
screening procedures.
<P>

<B>3.  Require similar screening practices at city job centers.</B>

<p>

Many cities operate their own tax-funded job centers to assist
people in finding jobs.  Like EDD, many of these do not screen
their clients to determine if they are illegal immigrants.  The
legislature should act now to require them to do so.  

<P>

<B>4.  Increase penalties for employers who fail to withhold taxes
from illegal immigrant workers.  </B>

<p>

As noted above, over half
of those employing illegal immigrants in California do not withhold
taxes from their wages.  Penalties for this practice should be
increased and the back-taxes collected should be forfeited to
the state.

<H2>Criminal Justice</H2>

<P>

<B>1.  Deport illegal immigrants currently in our court system,
jails, and prisons.  </B>
<p>

Illegal immigrants often pass through
our court system without ever being identified as illegal.  In
Orange County, the Superior Court recently invited the Immigration
and Naturalization Service into the courtrooms to identify and
process illegal immigrant defendants.  This approach worked and
should be initiated statewide.  The initial costs will more than
be repaid in a short period through increased deportations.Likewise,
state and county governments should work with the federal government
to provide hearing space and staff to conduct deportation hearings
for all illegal immigrant convicts now in California jails or
prisons.  Upon the end of their terms, these convicts should be
immediately deported.   
<P>
<B>2.  Pass state legislation to override so-called &quot;sanctuary
laws.&quot;</B>
<p>
In a number of cities such as San Francisco, local
laws have been passed which forbid local police from cooperating
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  State legislation
should be passed to prohibit and override these laws.  Federal,
state, and local law enforcement must be allowed to cooperate
to uphold immigration law as they do other kinds of law.


<H3>Conclusion</h3>

Human beings respond to incentives.  Current policies
in California that make it easy for illegal immigrants to enjoy
government benefits, receive free or tax-subsidized education,
gain employment, and take advantage of our criminal justice system
serve as incentives to illegal immigration.  Change these policies
to remove these incentives and illegal immigration will decrease.
 It's that simple.California must not hesitate to make these changes.
 Illegal immigration is exacerbating the state's crime problem
and represents an increasing drain on its financial resources.
 What is more, despite the new euphemism for illegal immigrants-&quot;undocumented
immigrants&quot;-these people are in our country illegally.  We
are a nation where law is king, and to openly allow and even encourage
a class of people to exist above the law is to subvert one of
our dearest constitutional principles.  Illegal immigration at
its current high levels is an economic disaster in the making
and a national disgrace.  California should take the lead in acting
to stop it now.

<H1>The Verdict Is In:</h1>

<h3>California's Public Schools Are Miserably Mismanaged</h3>

</CENTER>

IntroductionOver the past several years, no issue in Sacramento
has generated as much heated rhetoric as education spending. 
K-12 education represents the largest chunk of the state's budget.
 This makes it one of the obvious places to look for ways to save
money, given the urgency of addressing the state's growing deficit.
 But as soon as anyone even ventures to take a peek, the education
establishment comes out swinging.In defending their turf, education
bureaucrats and union leaders have resorted not only to the emotional
appeals we have seen on television, but to pure and simple disinformation.
 Consider:  In recent testimony to the Little Hoover Commission,
State Superintendent of Education Bill Honig characterized the
administration of public education in California as &quot;lean
and mean.&quot;  Indeed, he said that California schools could
use $4 billion more than the record $27 billion now being spent.1But
far from being &quot;lean and mean,&quot; gross waste and mismanagement
are fast becoming inherent characteristics of California's education
system.  Last year's revelations about the Richmond Unified School
District were just the tip of the iceberg.2  In recent months,
three separate grand juries have issued scathing reports on the
management practices of California school districts.  These reports
have wide implications for our public education system as a whole,
in which nearly half of the 1,068 school districts ran deficits
in 1990.
<P>

The Sacramento County Grand Jury ReportThe Sacramento County
Grand Jury's investigation of the Grant Joint Union High School
District (GJUHSD)-the fourth such inquiry in ten years-found an
array of questionable fiscal and management practices.[The District's]
problems were manifested in an almost complete breakdown of community
support and confidence; in poor business practices, especially
the management and oversight of legal counsel and consultant service
contracts; in questionable personnel practices; in the deterioration
of employee morale; and in routine, but essential, business not
being completed in a timely manner or not being completed at all.3
Just how bad were Grant's business practices?  In a special audit,
it was discovered that the District lacked bids or quotes for
contracted services; did not keep requisitions or purchase orders;
paid for services before they were completed; and issued inadequate
policies regarding business operations.4 Furthermore, the grand
jury found that the District maintained a slew of legal counsel
contracts &quot;involving many hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;
Some had no backup documentation such as signed contracts or board
minutes.  Some involved retired former District employees, which
may have violated sections of the state education code.  Others
did not indicate the specific source of District funding for the
contract.5With regard to the legal counsel contracts in particular,
the grand jury noted that in the past decade &quot;the GJUHSD
has had at least seven legal firms representing it, some in duplicative
or redundant capacities.  An audit stated, '. . . the District
had extraordinarily high expenditures for legal services.'&quot;6
How high?  In one instance, the District paid $700,000 to a law
firm for 15 months of work.  A subsequent audit found that this
amount was probably double what the work was worth.7   In another
example, the District was billed $297,773 by a law firm whose
contract had been terminated.  After an investigation by another
law firm, the District settled the bill for $16,326.  Yet despite
this outrageous overcharge of $281,447, the law firm in question
was subsequently rehired to do more work for the District.8 Additionally,
it was found that the District has hired, fired, promoted, and
demoted personnel without following established procedures.  These
actions resulted in embarrassing financial consequences:

<P>

<i>In 1986, GJUHSD paid $300,000 for a wrongful dismissal.  Currently,
there are tens of millions of dollars of 'wrongful' dismissal
or demotion lawsuits filed against GJUHSD.9 In sum, while it is
true that people are hurting in the District, the cause of this
hurt lies not with stinginess on the part of the taxpayer.  Rather,
it has been directly caused by the immoral waste of untold millions
in tax monies.
</i>
<P>

The Santa Cruz County Grand Jury ReportDown in central California,
the Santa Cruz County Grand Jury has issued a report detailing
the troubles of the Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD).
 Although this District has complained that declining state aid
has forced it to lay off teachers, the report suggests other causes:
 sloppy and incomplete record-keeping, gross cost overruns, and
poor management decisions.10 Some of the grand jury's specific
findings were incredible.  For example, it discovered that although
the elected school board has ultimate authority over the budget,
many budget decisions were simply &quot;relegated to the Administration
and the unions&quot;-the groups most interested in increasing
the District's budget.11 The District budget frequently omitted
information such as the amount of money actually spent at a school
site or at District headquarters.  Indeed, the grand jury found
that it &quot;reflected the amount the Trustees believed was spent
the previous year and what they thought should be spent the next
year, with no basis in fact.&quot;12.

<P>
Still lacking is any substantive information about which departments
are exceeding their budgets and which are within their budgets.
 Without detailed budget information, the Board of Trustees will
continue to be unable to control costs or make realistic reductions
in its budget as required by the State Education Code.13In other
words, teacher layoffs would likely have been unnecessary if the
District had been administratively prepared and willing to adopt
a rational plan to reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenditures.Where
might the PVUSD have looked to make some cuts?  For starters:

<P>
The Administration claims its costs have been cut by 400 percent
over the past two years.  Yet expenditures for the Superintendent's
and Business Services' budgets have far exceeded the amount budgeted.
 Actual cuts are not as great as they appear to be on paper. 
While the District office is exceeding its budget, many school
sites have been prudent with their money and actually spent less
than their budget.14Also, the grand jury found several large transfers
of funds between budget accounts, raising the question of &quot;whether
the funds are being appropriately spent for educational purposes.&quot;15
 This suggests that the instincts of the average citizen have
been right all along.  Bureaucratic fat at the district level
comes at the direct expense of the classroom.  The PVUSD also
wasted tens of thousands of dollars on its employee benefit package.
 Instead of joining a less costly plan with other county school
districts, it operated a self-insurance fund which covered medical,
dental, and vision benefits for employees and dependents.  And
the school board abdicated its oversight responsibility:
<P>

Until recently, the Trustees had no control over this fund.  It
was administered solely by the Business Services Director and
a group of union members who decided what benefits would be covered
and how much money would be set aside by the District to cover
claims.16Poor office management was another serious problem. 
Because the District consistently failed to complete its fiscal
paperwork on time, it was often late in receiving state education
reimbursements.  This caused cash-flow problems every June, forcing
the District to take out short-term bank loans to meet its payroll.
 These loans &quot;cost the District tens of thousands of dollars
in interest.&quot;17 Additionally, state and federal funds earmarked
for migrant and low-income students went unaudited, in violation
of requirements.  Questionable expenditures resulted.18  The grand
jury report concludes that &quot;an educational institution should
not operate in this manner.&quot;19   It is painfully obvious
that the PVUSD has been cheating the children in its charge, all
the while whining about the parsimony of the California taxpayer.

<P>

The San Diego County Grand Jury ReportFinally, in Southern
California, the San Diego County Grand Jury has just issued explosive
findings on the San Ysidro School District (SYSD).  For example,
like Grant, San Ysidro &quot;has paid out at least $1 million
in judgments and legal fees arising from the ill-conceived and
often illegal personnel actions of the Trustees.&quot;20More tax
dollars were wasted in the District's bilingual education program:

<P>
The Board has failed to direct or support proper use of funds
provided for bilingual education.  In several instances, students
were placed in the Bilingual Program or English-Only Program,
based on space availability, with no regard for parental request
or children's needs.21Worse was the grand jury's finding that
the program's goal-the assimilation of non-English-speaking children
into the schools and into American society in generalis being
ignored in the interest of a politically correct segregation:
 &quot;Currently, proficiency in Spanish with the preservation
of Mexican culture, at the expense of English learning, is the
governing philosophy [of the District].&quot;22Under this philosophy,
the prospect of English proficiency becomes a very dim possibility:

<P>
The almost universally Hispanic ethnicity of the student population
makes the English language transition a most difficult objective
for the school system.  The opposition of the majority of the
Trustees to this objective virtually guarantees its failure.23
It should come as no surprise that the test scores of San Ysidro
students are the lowest in all of California and that &quot;the
net result has been and continues to be children unable to communicate.&quot;24Nor
does the District brook dissent: 

<P>
Non-conformists are demoted, fired, or otherwise eliminated from
the system.  With very few exceptions, non-Spanish speakers are
purged from the system, regardless of qualifications or performance.
 So are those bilingual teachers who consider English proficiency
a matter of urgency.25 The response of SYSD's elected trustees
has been anything but forthcoming.  For instance, in the face
of evidence that one trustee's son was promoted from vice principal
to principal in violation of established selection procedures,
another trustee responded:  &quot;Favoritism, yes; nepotism, no.&quot;26
It is little wonder that Richard B. Macfie, foreman of the San
Diego County Grand Jury, concluded that:

<P>
At the current pace of irresponsible leadership, the San Ysidro
School District will soon be bankrupt financially.  Educational
bankruptcy appears already to have been achieved.27

<H3>Conclusion &quot;Lean and Mean&quot;?</h3>

These recent grand jury
reports supply further proof that although California is spending
more than ever on education, much of that money continues to be
wasted on special-interest programs or squandered through poor
decision-making.28 Governor Wilson's recent decision to put the
brakes on the spiraling education budget by limiting spending
to the minimum amount allowed under Prop 98 is a recognition that
fiscal discipline-not more tax money-is the critical first step
to fixing our education system.  In the long run, however, true
reform will require implementing school choice of the sort being
promoted by the Bush administration, restoring parental control
and injecting competition into the current centralized, monopolistic
education market.

<H1>The Deeper Lesson of Californias Budget Crisis</H1>

</center>

<I>

California faces an unprecedented fiscal crisis:  The 1991-92 state budget finds itself 
with a shortfall of at least $14.3 billion, out of a total budget of about $55 billion.  And 
the gap between reality and what is being said about this crisis is huge.
<P>

<LI>The state is said to face a Hobsons choice between spending cuts and tax increases.  
Even the Governor has proposed some $6.6 billion of the latter.  But we must resist the 
steady drumbeat of pressure for higher taxes, understanding that the working people of 
our state are already overtaxed, and that justice requires that they retain as much as 
possible of what they earn.  
<P>

<LI>There is an urgent requirement to stop the incredible waste of the taxpayers dollar in 
California.  The Governor and his Working Group have come up with ideas that 
represent a good beginning.  The Little Hoover Commission and various private-sector 
groups have proposed others.  No stone should be left unturned.
<P>

<LI>The deeper lesson to be drawn from this crisis is that there is a systemic problem with 
our states budgeting process.  In short, centralized administration and the 
increasingly common practice of earmarking portions of the budget have rendered 
Californias government essentially unaccountable, not only to the people, but even to 
their elected officials.  
<P>

<LI>In addition to the spending cuts proposed by Governor Wilson and others, then, 
dramatic reform of the budgeting process is necessary, if future such crises are to be 
averted.   

</ul></i>

<P>

It is amazing that California is confronting a $14.3-billion budget deficit, even allowing 
for the severity of the recession.  One way of gaining perspective on the situation is to recall the 
words of Governor Ronald Reagan in 1973:  Unless something is done to curb the governments 
unlimited power to tax, this years $9.3billion budget will grow to a staggering $47 billion by 
1989.  Californias 1989 budget, of course, came in at more than $50 billion, with subsequent 
budgets jumping quickly to the $55-billion neighborhood.
<P>

What makes this amazing in light of Governor Reagans prophecy is that Californians did 
do something about the governments power to tax:  they passed Proposition 13 (with its two-
thirds vote requirement for tax increases and a property tax limit) and the Gann spending limit.  
Of course, supporters of taxes say that this is precisely why we face such a massive shortfall:  
that we are undertaxed.  Yet inflation-adjusted government spending per capita still increased 
dramatically during the 1980s.  And tax revenues as a proportion of personal income have 
increased from 4.8 percent in 1962 to about 8.5 percent today.  
<P>

The early 1960s, we might recall, was the heyday of Governor Pat Browns great building 
programs, with huge investments in schools, state colleges, highways, and the state water 
projectthe very sorts of public works that our government today is unable to deliver.  
Ironically, Pat Brown, the bete noir of fiscal conservatives in the 1960s, could be held up today 
as a model of fiscal responsibility.
<P>

This is all to suggest that previous attempts at tax-and-spending limitations have not been 
sufficient to control big government, or that they have not reached the heart of the matter of 
public spending.  The real lesson of the budget crisis is that the states bureaucracy, in tandem 
with powerful narrow interests, has been able to subvert the budget process to break the bonds of publicly mandated limitations on the size and scope of government.
<P>

There are three key factors at work:  Increased social-spending mandates, budgetary 
earmarking, and centralized administration. 


<H3>Shifting Budget Priorities and Earmarking </H3>

In California over the last 15 years, relative spending has shifted away from those basic 
public works necessary to accommodate population growth, e.g., transportation, and toward such rapidly increasing-cost items as health, education, and welfare (see Chart A).  In other words, the ordinary taxpayer is getting less and less for his or her money.  

<P>
Additionally, over 90 percent of state spending is earmarked by prior statute, judicial 
decree, or federal mandate, and rises inexorably without either legislative deliberation or rational relation to revenue growth.  Only about 8 percent of state spending is discretionary; that is, only about 8 percent is controlled by the governor and the legislature (see Chart B).  
<P>

<! -- whereis chart B?>

Source:  State Controllers Annual Reports

<! -- whereis Chart A?>
<P>

If 8 percent is all there is to fight over, the people of California might very well wonder 
why they even bother to elect representatives. 
<P>

An important complement to earmarking is a procedure known as workload budgeting 
or current services budgeting.  Automatically each year, the costs of each program are notched upward; if the governor or the legislature reduces the automatic increase, the program is said to have been cut, even though absolute outlays will still be rising.  This effect is especially pronounced in social spending programs.  
<P>

The structural problem with the budget arises from the following facts:  While the 
average annual growth rate of personal income in California for the last decade has hovered 
around 8 percent per year and tax revenues have been growing at about 7 percent, spending has been growing at approximately 11 percent; and this year and next it is moving even beyond that, to about 13 percent.  If nothing is done, this trend will require endless tax increases until, in the fullness of time, the state of California would come to consume the entire income of its citizens.
<P>

The budgeting phenomena of earmarking and workload budgeting really mean that 
when it comes to budgetingthe bread-and-butter function of the legislative and executive branchesour representatives have abdicated or let slip away their responsibilities.  Missing from the current budget debate is the recognition of the extent to which government spending has ceased to be in the control of elected officials.  This is why the spending reforms proposed by Governor Wilson and others, by themselves, will not solve the problem.  

<H3>Centralized Administration</H3>

There is a third factor to be taken into account.  A broad review of the character of public 
spending and administration in California over the last two decades reveals that both have 
become increasingly centralized.  One good way to see this is to look at the shift in the relative 
share of the public dollar between state and county governments (see Chart C).  This 
centralization was accelerated by the passage of Proposition 13 and can be considered the major unintended consequence of that landmark event of the tax revolt.  
<P>

Indeed, the administration of all public spending has been centralized.  For instance, a 
special feature of Proposition 111, the gas tax increase of 1990, was a requirement that local 
jurisdictions have a stateapproved transportation management plan before their local share of 
gas tax revenue could be distributed.  In hundreds of ways like this, the administrative apparatus 
of state government subjugates local governments.

<! -- whereis Chart C?>

<H3>The Systemic Problem</H3>

There are three key observations to make about this state of affairs.  
<P>

First and most obviously, earmarking precludes deliberation by public representatives 
and diffuses the responsibility and accountability of the legislature.  The public cannot put its 
finger on who is responsible for the character of public spending.  It is difficult to hold legislators 
accountable at election time for voting to appropriate funds, when the appropriation is done 
automatically as a part of a formula.
<P>

Second, earmarking enables special interests to organize more easily and effectively at 
the public expense.  Witness the political campaign currently being waged by the California 
Teachers Association on behalf of Proposition 98.  It is no exaggeration to say that earmarking 
has the low character of a raid on the public treasury by special, narrowly self-interested 
constituencies.
<P>

Third, in the end, the real needs of the taxpayerfor roads, schools, and other public 
worksget slighted, probably deliberately so.  
<P>

Why deliberately?  Think of it as a variation of the infamous strategy whereby the U.S. 
Department of the Interior responds to any proposed budget reduction by saying it will have to 
close down the Washington Monument.  Thus California working people, who as things stand 
pay a lot of money in taxes, are told that if they want roads, or schools, or prisons, or sewers, 
they will have to:  pay more taxes.  This is the Prop 111 gas-tax solution, the Prop 99 tobacco-tax 
solution, etc.  It becomes progressively nearer to impossible in such a regime to impose any 
discipline on public spending.  Those things which used to be the first priority of government are 
now, de facto, the last.  And no one, not even our representatives, seem to think they can do 
anything about it.

<P>

The interests of the administrative apparatus of government and of elected officials are 
increasingly connected to the interests of certain groups who might well be regarded as 
government clients:  public employee unions, regulatory bureaucracies, the business community 
(who are also invited to relate to government in the manner of supplicants), organized advocacy 
groups, and direct recipients of public aid.  Over time these combine to create the conditions 
whereby the taxpayers are forced to say uncle to new taxes, and the stage is set for a new wave of government growth.  Even fiscally conservative legislators, responding to the powerful 
incentives that now operate, have said that opposing any tax increase will mean that their districts will lose out when the budget pie is divided up.

<H3>Reform</H3>

These fundamental trends need to be understood before the budget can be sorted out in 
the long term.  And what will that require?  

<P>
n analysis of all 50 state budgets by former OMB Director James Miller and George 
Mason University economist Mark Crain found that spending in states that practice earmarking 
grew about 1.2 percent a year faster than in states whose entire budgets were subject to regular 
deliberation and appropriation. They also found that spending grew faster in states with single, 
unified, and thus very detailed budget bills, as compared to states which have separate, simple 
budget bills for each major component of government.  Here are two major reforms that should 
be considered. 
 
<P>
Above all, deliberation and accountability must be restored to the process.

<P>
In conclusion, tax-and-spending limitations are insufficient to solve Californias budget 
crisis.  What is required is control of the administrative apparatus, which can come about only 
through a coherent and forceful executive and legislative agenda.

<B>NOTE:  President Jimmy Carter was scoffed at when he proposed to institute zero-based budgeting the spending needs for each program and department of the government evaluating from scratch every yearat the federal level.  Today in California, in the aftermath of earmarking Propositions 98, 99, 111, and the lottery, the idea of the legislature deliberating about the relative merits of various kinds of spending programs seems quaint, if not medieval.</B>

<H1>California Workfare Reform and Decentralization</H1>

</center>

<hr size=4>
<P>

Traveling in the United States in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville was 
struck that, unlike our European cousins with their aristocratic airs, Americans 
found no dishonor in work.  On the contrary, work in the United States was 
regarded as positively honorable.  This attitude toward work was a major 
ingredient in Americans renowned independent character and a great boon to 
democracy (since democracy requires an independent people).

<P>
A century and a half later, Americans still regard almost any kind of honest 
work as honorable, to be sure.  What has diminished, perhaps, especially in the 
aftermath of the Great Society welfare state, is the dishonor or shame that we once 
associated with not working.  That is, in the decades after 1965, refusing to take a 
difficult or low-paying job in order to support oneself or ones family became 
increasingly acceptable and in some cases even profitable.
<P>

The ease with which the welfare system could be abused, the slothful (and 
sometimes criminal) behavior it encouraged in some who grew utterly dependent 
upon it, and its burgeoning cost to the private sector, especially during the 
inflationary late 1970s, led to frequent calls for welfare reform.  And in the next 
decade, one of the ideas most often discussed was workfare, mandatory work 
programs for recipients of welfare payments.
<P>

The idea behind workfare has deep historical roots in our country.  Long 
before America became centrally bureaucratized, the poor were routinely and 
adequately cared for by local governments and religious charities.  But except for 
the aged or infirm, those supported were required to perform useful labor, often in 
government-run factories, until they could find work on their own.  A free ride was 
definitely not part of the bargain.
<P>

Under Governor Deukmejian, California became one of the first states to 
institute workfare during the 1980s.  But from the start, Californias workfare 
programcalled Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN)has been beset with 
problems of its own, leading the Governor to call recently for its reform.
<P>

GAIN was intended to achieve a noble goal:  to wean the poor (many of 
whom were now being spoken as members of a permanent underclass) from the 
public dole and to prepare them for better-paying, private-sector jobs.  But GAINs 
track record since 1986 is unimpressive.  Over $850 million has been spent on, or 
committed to, the program, and Californias welfare caseload continues to grow
and to grow even faster than the states steadily growing population.
<P>

GAINs problems stem, in part, from the many exceptions and loopholes 
allowing welfare recipients to get around its work requirement.  For instance, one 
provision which was added at the time of its passage provided that the requirement 
be waived if the man or woman on welfare required further education.  The stated 
purpose of this exception was that welfare recipients who needed minimal 
trainingsuch as a high school equivalency degree or improvement in English 
language skillswould receive it before finding a job.  But instead, the provision 
has been interpreted broadly, allowing people to avoid work as long as they stay in 
schoolthrough college and into graduate school if they wishall the while 
receiving welfare payments.
<P>

Of course any and all attempts to close such loopholes and eliminate 
exceptions to workfare requirements are to be applauded.  But we should not be 
sanguine about the likelihood that such simple reform will fix the welfare system.  
GAIN is itself, after alllike its predecessora state program, directed by 
bureaucrats in Sacramento.  For one thing, the prevents the administration of 
welfare on a case-by-case basis; welfare policy in Temecula is the same as that in 
San Francisco, although the problems (and requisite solutions) may be altogether 
different.  For another, it means that the people in charge are not directly 
responsible to the tax-paying public for the programs success or failure.
<P>

In the 1830s, Tocqueville marveled at how most problems in America were 
handled at the local level.  (This was anything but true in Tocquevilles native 
France, where he reported that people looked immediately to Paris for help at the 
slightest sign of trouble.)  This was notable not only for its value in maintaining our 
independent, democratic spirit, but also for the fact the it worked so well.  
Especially in the 1960s, many Americans seem to have forgotten the simple truth 
(ask almost any Eastern European) that administration of policies by a distant 
bureaucracy is expensive and clumsy and inefficient, not to mention unaccountable.  
We have largely forgotten, that is, the old Yankee adage about having to do 
something yourself if you want it done right.
<P>

This is to suggest that until we decentralize the administration of social 
welfare programs, until we return the power to administer welfare to localities 
where it was and worked effectively for most of our nations history, even the best-
intentioned programs like GAIN will not likely be effective in actually reducing the 
number of people on welfare.
<P>

<H1>Why Not Criminalize Semi-Autos?</H1>
</center>

<hr size=4>

<P>

In The Federalist #46, Madison wrote that the advantage of being armed, which the 
Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation provides them with an 
almost insurmountable barrier to tyranny.  He knew, as did Americans generally, that 
potential tyrants would endeavor to disarm the citizenryunder the guise of providing 
public safetyas a first step to undermining democratic forms.  Indeed, Madisons fellow 
Virginian George Mason declared that to disarm the people . . . [is] the best and most 
effectual way to enslave them.  Mason, although an active participant in the 
Constitutional Convention and a supporter of a strong national government, refused to 
endorse ratification of the Constitution because the Convention had failed to include in it 
a bill of rights.  Richard Henry Lee, author of the widely published Letters of a Federal 
Farmer, resolutely  declared that to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body 
of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use 
them.  Lee, too, opposed ratification because the Constitution lacked a bill of rights.  
Madison, although initially opposed to this idea, became the chief architect of the Bill of 
Rights in the first Congress.  He did so, he said, in order to render [the Constitution] as 
acceptable to the whole people of the United States, as it has been found acceptable to a 
majority of them.  And second only to the amendment guaranteeing the freedoms of 
religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition stood the following:  A well regulated 
Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and 
bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

<P>

Today, California and the nation are witnessing a vigorous assault upon the Second 
Amendment in the form of regulations and legislation aimed at the importation, 
manufacture, and ownership of semi-automatic weapons.  Proponents, adapting many of 
the arguments used in the past for restricting handguns, tell us that the Second 
Amendment only protects the rights of organized militias to keep and bear arms, that 
individuals are accorded no such protection since the Second Amendment refers only to 
the people collectively.

<P>

But this all-too-common interpretation is directly at odds with federal law.  The 
United States Code [10 U.S.C. 311(a)] states that [the] militia of the United States 
consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and. . . under 45 years of age.

<P>

Moreover, such an interpretation of the Second Amendment stands in contradiction to 
the well-defined structure of the Bill of Rights as a whole.  It is beyond cavil that the 
rights adumbrated therein are individual rights.  When the First Amendment speaks of 
the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances, it obviously does not contemplate the assemblage of the whole of 
the American people; nor any ban on petition by individual citizens.  Similarly, when the 
Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of the people against unreasonable searches 
and seizures, it makes that guarantee to individuals, not to the whole body of the people.  
There is no textual evidence whatsoever to indicate that the Second Amendment, unlike 
the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, does not accord protection to individuals.  
The burden of proof rests with those who argue this to show why it is an exception.

<P>

A commonsensical reading of the Second Amendment is readily available:  Since 
militias are necessary to the security of a free state, the people must therefore have the 
right to keep and bear arms.  It is almost too obvious to point out that militias are 
comprised of individual citizens, and part of being a citizen of a free state is service in the 
militia.  Militias exist so that the people by dint of their own efforts can ensure their 
liberty; militias do not exist in order to secure the freedom of militias.

<P>

But today, so goes the response, public safety requires that the individuals right to 
possess arms be curtailed.  But regulation and legislation to this end will create only the 
illusion of safety, since the net effect will be the disarming of law-abiding citizens and the 
granting of a monopoly of arms (or of certain kinds of arms) to criminals, police, and the 
military.

<P>

Legislators have learned in recent years that it is much easier to enforce the law upon 
the law-abiding than to enforce it upon criminals.  The Constitution, as misinterpreted 
and misapplied by judges and prosecutors, is too often used as a barrier to effective law 
enforcement.  The case of Stockton killer Patrick Purdy is illustrative.  He had previously 
been arrested for robbery, selling dangerous weapons in violation of federal law, 
receiving stolen property, drug possession, and sex crimes.  In each case, felony charges 
were plea-bargained to misdemeanor offenses.  Had existing laws been enforced, Purdy 
would still be in prison.  Plea-bargaininga practice disdained by most Western 
nationshas become all too common in the criminal justice system.
<P>

A ban on semi-automatic weapons will do nothing to stop criminals; it will only make 
it easier for them to prey upon the law-abiding.  Most drug dealers do not use semi-
automatic weapons in any case; they prefer fully automatic firearms, the unlicensed 
possession of which is already a felony under both California and federal law.  At a time, 
then, when the police are either unwilling or unable to enforce the law as appears to be 
the case in Washington, D.C., and other large citiesand when individual citizens 
become almost wholly responsible for defending themselves and their families and 
propertywhich is especially true of those forced to live in the inner-cityit is 
politically, indeed morally irresponsible to impose gun control policies of any stripe.
<P>

Battles over what has been called gun control are certainly nothing new.  The 
battles of the past, however, generally focused on one particular type of handgun or 
handgun ammunition.  The campaigns to ban Saturday Night Specials, cop-killer 
bullets, and plastic guns were each the subject of prolonged debate and media 
attention.  But most of the debate was desultory at best, since the definition of Saturday 
Night Special was more than a little nebulous; cop-killer bullets proved to have no 
greater powers than ordinary ones; and plastic guns turned out to be built mostly of 
steel.
<P>

The debate now raging here in California and elsewhere, however, aims squarely at 
the semi-automatic rifle.  As almost everyone by now knows, the rifles in question 
require no manual reloading after a shot, but chamber a new round automatically, and can 
thus be fired rapidly.  In most cases, they employ technology that has existed since the 
turn of the century.  Some, but by no means all, resemble or are related to the fully- 
automatic rifles used by most nations military forces.  
<P>

But misperceptions persist about these rifles, and those who oppose private ownership 
of firearms have been quick to note, and capitalize on, these misperceptions.  One 
prominent gun control organization informs its supporters that,
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The weapons menacing looks, coupled with the publics 
confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-
automatic assault weaponsanything that looks like a machine 
gun is assumed to be a machine guncan only increase that 
chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

Furthering confusion, the major print media, having prejudiced the argument from the 
start by attaching the label assault weapon to semi-autos, have prefaced editorials with 
pat phrases that are now familiar to all:  no legitimate purpose, designed only to kill 
people, etc.epithets, interestingly enough, that were applied to handguns only a few 
years ago.  Likewise, television has offered nothing of educational substance about what 
these arms are or do, giving air time instead to footage of the effects of semi-auto rifle 
fire on melons or concrete blocks.  (Countless non-semi-automatic firearms are capable of 
splitting concrete blocks.  So what do these pictures mean?)  Often, too, to T.V. clips 
show fullyautomatic weapons being fired, thus taking advantage of the aforementioned 
confusion over the difference between semi-automatic rifles and fullyautomatic assault 
weapons.  These apparently had their effect on California Attorney General John Van de 
Kamp, who boasted to the California Assembly that he could mow them all down with a 
semi-automatic AK-47 in the space of two minutes.
<P>

Most of those appearing to defend semi-autos, on the other hand, whether on 
television or in print, have found themselves at a loss to provide any argument that would 
justify private possession.  To their discredit, they have failed to move beyond describing 
the pleasure they take in hunting, shooting cans and bottles, or the importance they place 
on having certain semi-autos in private collectionsin other words, arguments that 
simply rest on the private right to have fun.  The argument for the role of gun ownership 
to civic responsibility has been completely neglected in those upon whom the defense has 
fallen.  Clearly, if this is the best the defenders of self-loading rifles can do, the strength 
of their opponents in the public forum is hardly surprising.
<P>

The passion of this most recent gun control debate, and the failure of either side to 
give reasoned argument, is especially unfortunate.  For unlike the handgun debates of 
years past, the present case points forcefully to the very serious purpose that informs the 
Second Amendment:  While hand guns have a proper role in the defense of ones person, 
home, property, and family, their limited range and power make them of little use in 
protecting the security of a free State.
<P>

Let us be candid.  In The Federalist 57, James Madison praised the vigilant and 
manly spirit which actuates the people of Americaa spirit which nourishes freedom and 
in return is nourished by it.  This reminds us that, in accordance with our founding 
principles in the stirring opening passages of the Declaration of Independence, we reserve 
the right to revolution in perpetuity.  But if the American people reserve this right, then 
surely they reserve as well the right to revolutions means.  And these means must be 
adequate to the times.  Does the Second Amendment, in this age of superior weapons 
technology, mean that the people have only the right to possess muskets?  Despots and 
potential despots, of course, would argue so.  A free people will not be deluded.
<P>

Two events within recent memory are instructive.  Afghanistan may yet become a 
free country.  The Afghan people are a freedom-loving people with a fierce desire to 
determine their own political fate.  They are also a people who have made guns an 
important part of their national existence.  They have proven to the world that the 
possession of weapons of self-defense invokes the spirit of freedom in a people because it 
imparts the sure knowledge that their liberty is a product of their own efforts and 
sacrifice.  With their skill in firearms the Afghans were able to withstand, and in some 
measure even humiliate, the greatest force for despotism in the modern world.  They 
began their resistance with World War I vintage Lee Enfields; when their determination 
attracted the attention of the free world, their arsenal was supplemented by more 
sophisticated weapons, most notably the Stinger Missile.  But it was their expertise with 
individual weapons, primarily semi-automatic and automatic rifles, that won the day.  
<P>

In contrast, the people of Cambodia had no such tradition of gun ownership or use.  
They became easy prey for the well-armed and brutal Khmer Rouge.
<P>

Like the Afghans and the Swissall male citizens of Switzerland are required by law 
to maintain and to be proficient at using semi-autosAmericans have a tradition of 
respect for guns.  Thomas Jefferson demonstrated that he understood the relationship 
between self-reliance, liberty, and guns in a letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr:
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>A strong body makes the mind strong.  As to the species of 
exercises, I advise the gun.  While this gives a moderate exercise 
to the Body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to 
the mind. . . .  Let your gun therefore be the constant companion 
of your walks.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

In the United States, long after the Army had grown and assumed primary 
responsibility for the nations defenses, it continued to depend upon a civilian population 
trained in the use of arms from which it could draw men who would make good soldiers.  
Thus, the government of the United States in 1903 established the National Board for the 
Promotion of Rifle Practice.  The boards principal mission was to see to the training of 
U.S. civilians  in  the  use  of rifled  arms  who  might  be  called  into  service  in time of 
national emergency.  The Boards mission is reflected today in the U.S. Armys Director 
of Civilian Marksmanship, whose office sponsors formal marksmanship matches across 
the nation and offers surplus semi-automatic M-1 rifles and ammunition to marksmen and 
clubs dedicated to marksmanship.*   
<P>

But even beyond the militias vital role with respect to foreign invasions, the deepest 
object of the Second Amendment goes back to the fundamental Right of the People to 
alter or abolish [fundamentally unjust government]:  it is to serve as a free peoples 
ultimate bulwark against internal subversion of civil liberty.  The authors of our Bill of 
Rights recognized that such a people are always susceptible to enemies of liberty
particularly demagoguesand they sought some means to insure that no individual or 
faction could subvert democracy with impunity.  Retaining for the great body of 
citizensthe unorganized militiathe right to possess firearms provided that insurance.  
<P>

Consider the great Supreme Court Justice Joseph Storys remarks in his authoritative 
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States:  
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been 
considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it 
offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary 
power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in 
the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over 
them.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

This is the central point that informs the Second Amendment, and should inform the 
present discussion of semi-automatic rifles.  Remarkably enough, it has been almost 
completely overlooked.  But foreign invasion, unlikely as it may seem at any given time, 
is an ever-present possibility, as is the corruption of constitutional formsas much if not 
more so now, in an age of monstrously large and impersonal bureaucracies, as it was in 
the age of kings and queens.  (And dare we note that when Madison wrote of our manly 
spirit, he was explaining what would prevent the House of Representatives from 
unconstitutionally passing laws from which it exempts itselfas it now does routinely?)  
It has been, and will continue to be, individual Americansarmed with weapons 
comparable to those held by the statewho stand as the final guardians of civil liberty.
<P>

Semi-automatic rifles represent nothing more or less than the state of the art in 
firearms.  Among free men, and as a hedge against the corruption of government by 
freedoms enemies, their private possession by law-abiding citizens and training in their 
use ought to be encouraged rather than prohibited.  Those who use themor any 
firearmin the commission of a crime, on the other hand, should receive harsh 
punishment and no quarter.
<P>

Lately, as in years past, the media has exhorted legislators in Sacramento and 
Washington to be bold and to stand up to the NRA.  Indeed the boldness and the 
foresight of the statesman are required of our leaders now.  But boldness should not, and 
keen foresight will not, have them standing up to a lobbying group in this case.  Rather 
they must stand for the Constitutionand for the moment against a hasty and unwise 
sentiment on the part of many citizens that represents a willingness to surrender the 
keystone of American liberty.

<center>
<H1>In Defense of Proposition 13<BR>
and the Gann Limit</H1>
</center>

<P>

Proposition 13 remains as controversial today as it was 11 years ago when 
California voters approved it by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.  Indeed, the Proposition 13 
property tax cut provoked the sound and fury of the apocalypse, with liberal critics 
warning that Proposition 13 would cripple government services, and conservative 
supporters cheered by that same prospect.

<P>

A decade later, the critics of Proposition 13 are claiming vindication.  The "I-told-
you-so" critics say Proposition 13 has deprived local government of badly needed 
revenue for new schools, new roads, sewers, water, and other basic services, and the 
constitutional spending limit, better known as the "Gann Limit," is blamed for the state's 
inability to step into the breach.  Proposition 13 is now commonly regarded as a major 
factor in state and local government's inability to keep up with growth, and is therefore 
blamed by developers and much of the business community for contributing to the slow-
growth movement that is gaining strength throughout California.  Today there are calls 
from the Legislative Analyst and many other leaders in the state to repeal the spending 
limit and raise taxes.

<H3>Background</H3>

In order to judge the wisdom of Proposition 13 and the Gann limit a decade later, it 
is necessary to review briefly the extraordinary circumstances that led to the landslide 
passage of Prop 13 in the first place, and it is necessary to separate and sort out the 
various issues and arguments about the present condition of state and local government.  
When you begin to look more closely at Proposition 13, you come to discover some 
ironies and surprises.

<P>

In the mid-1970s, housing prices in California were skyrocketing far faster than the 
surging national inflation rate.  Housing prices in the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
areas were rising at an average rate of 14 to 15 percent a year.  Assessed valuations for 
property tax purposes were climbing along with prices.  Because most counties 
reassessed property values only every two or three years, many property owners were 
seeing their property tax bill suddenly double or triple.  Between inflation and the sudden 
shock of the property tax increase, many homeowners thought thing were getting out of 
control.

<P>

But this shocking increase was deceptive because of several quirks in the property 
tax system, mostly having to do with the exemption on the first $1,750 of assessed 
valuation, which exaggerated the increase in property tax bills.  It turns out that as a 
proportion of personal income, the property tax was not rising at all, but in fact remained 
steady at about 5 percent of personal income all through the 1970s-about the same 
proportion of income as in 1960.

<P>

But although the property tax was not rising as a proportion of personal income, 
other state taxes (especially the state income tax) were rising fast, resulting in a sharply 
rising overall tax burden.  The total tax burden in California had risen from 11.29 percent 
of personal income in 1960 to 15.44 percent by 1978.  The state income tax in particular 
was a very elastic tax for the state treasury;  for every 1-percent rise in personal income, 
the state enjoyed a 1.6-percent increase in income tax revenues, making the state 
government the major winner from the high inflation of the 1970s.  By 1978, California 
was among the highest-taxed states in America (see Chart 1).

<P>

Meanwhile, the state had accumulated a huge budget surplus, estimated to be more 
than $4 billion, which added to the annoyance of taxpayers.  (Governor Jerry Brown 
denied for a time that a surplus existed at all.)  The legislature fiddled with some property 
tax relief measures, but could come to no agreement.  Repeated attempts by the 
legislature to fashion a property tax relief measure floundered in partisan wrangling.  
Even the prospect of Proposition 13 could not break the legislative deadlock.

<P>

And yet, in the months before the June vote on Proposition 13, public opinion polls 
found that the voters were evenly divided over the measure, with a large undecided 
segment.  Then an extraordinary bureaucratic episode tipped the scales in favor of 
Proposition 13.  One month before the June election, Los Angeles County residents 
received their new property valuation assessments and property tax estimates for the 
following year from the County Assessor, Alexander Pope.  There was a huge outcry 
about the large increases in taxes, which made news headlines statewide and prompted 
many voters to fear that they were next.  The interesting thing about this episode is that 
the new assessments for Los Angeles County were not due to be delivered to the 
taxpayers until July, after the election.  A rare case of bureaucratic efficiency was the 
proximate cause in helping to pass the measure to deprive the bureaucracy of tax 
revenues.

<P>

Even so, Proposition 13 terrified the liberal establishment, which planned to defeat 
the initiative with scare tactics, as they had previous tax -limitation initiatives. (Voters 
had rejected previous limitation measures, including Governor Reagan's 1973 tax and 
spending-limitation initiative, because they thought those initiatives would cause higher 
local taxes and reduced services.)

<P>

<center>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="/claremont/images/gsp02-1.gif">
</center>

<H3>Chart 1</H3>

<P>

The liberal establishment mounted an all-out attack.  The Los Angeles Times said 
Proposition 13 would cause the doubling or tripling of the state income and sales tax.  
John Van de Kamp, the Los Angeles District Attorney, called it "a gift-wrapped time 
bomb."  Governor Jerry Brown called it a "rip off" and a "consumer fraud."  The state 
Democratic party chairman said it would mean "turning the state over to the current-day 
anarchists."  Teachers threatened to go on strike in response to possible staff cutbacks.

<P>

Even national organizations got in on the act.  On the eve of the election, the 
National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National Association 
of Counties called a press conference in Washington D.C., to deplore Proposition 13, 
calling it a "wrecking ball" that would cripple local government.  One economic study 
said it would cost the state 450,000 jobs.  (Just the opposite, of course, of what actually 
happened.)  Even the Communist party called a press conference to denounce Prop 13.  It 
was all for nought, as the voters were unmoved by the parade of imaginary horrors.


<H3>The Effects for the Taxpayer</H3>

<P>

The results of Proposition 13 have been rather happy for the taxpayer.  Property 
taxes fell by more than 50 percent, which has saved taxpayers over $100 billion in the last 
ten years.  The frightened legislature moved to adopt indexing for the state income tax in 
the panicky aftermath of Proposition 13, which has saved taxpayers another $23 billion 
on their income taxes in the last decade.  Most importantly, these steps reversed the 
steady increase in the state's tax burden on personal income, which, as mentioned above, 
had grown from 11.3 percent in 1960 to 15.4 percent by 1978.  With the passage of 
Proposition 13 and income-tax indexing, the tax burden dropped back to 11.8 percent, 
and has remained steady since then.  But even at this rate, California remains one of the 
highest-taxed states in the Union.

<P>

The next most important result of Proposition 13 was the 1979 vote in favor of 
Proposition 4, the "Gann Limit," which was presented as a means of completing the 
reform begun by Proposition 13.  Then Gann measure limits state spending according to a 
formula based on population increases and inflation.

<P>

California came up against the spending limit for the first time in 1987, which led to 
rebates to California taxpayers.

<H3>The Effects on Local Government</H3>

The chief area of enduring controversy about Proposition 13 concerns its effect on 
city and county government.  Whether the sky has fallen on local government, as the 
Chicken Littles predicted, is still in dispute.  An analysis of city and county budgets 
reveals that their budgets have continued to grow steadily since Proposition 13.  The loss 
of property-tax revenue has been made up through a number of means.  First of all, 
Sacramento stepped in immediately after Proposition 13 passed and bailed out local 
government with the $4.4-billion state surplus.  This aid very nearly made up for the $5 
billion lost through the property tax reduction. State aid continues to be the single largest 
source of revenue for cities and counties.  Second, cities and counties moved to increase 
the use of fees and other special assessments to maintain service levels.

<P>

What Proposition 13 did was force city and county governments to run much more 
efficiently.  Local spending for public safety and health, adjusted for inflation, has 
continued to rise; spending for general government administration has fallen.  In the city 
of Los Angeles alone, the payroll today is 4,000 paychecks smaller than in 1978.

<P>

But understand that with state financing comes state control.  Liberals had long 
wanted the state to assume greater authority for local government because liberals have 
greater influence with state government than with the hundreds of local government units.  
Shortly after Proposition 13 passed, economist Frank Levy of the Urban Institute wrote: 
"The passage of Proposition 13 has caused almost the entire liberal agenda to be de facto 
adopted.  The state now pays for most county health and welfare costs, and state support 
of public schools has increased from about 40 percent of all expenditure prior to 
Proposition 13, to 67 today."  Economist William Oakland concurred: "Local control or 
`home rule' may become a thing of past in California."

<H3>The Growth of State Government</H3>

The aggrandizement of state government is, then, the greatest irony of Proposition 
13.  It must be remembered that the property tax is a tax for local government, and that 
Proposition 13 has done nothing to restrain the growth of state government, where is 
found the most obnoxious spending priorities and bureaucracy.  When you begin to 
examine the budget trends over the last 20 years, you begin to see that Proposition 13 did 
not slow the growth of state spending at all.  Way back in 1973, Governor Ronald Reagan 
warned: "Unless something is done to check government's unlimited power to tax, 
California's state budget will grow from this year's $9.3. billion to a staggering $47 
billion by 1989."  The 1989 state budget calls for spending $47.8 billion.  The state 
budget has nearly doubled during the seven years of the Deukmejian administration.

<P>

So it become plausible to wonder whether the reason the state does not build new 
roads and school classroom is a shortage of money, or because our state government has 
become very expensive and does not do the kind of things with the budget that it used to 
do, such as building roads and schools, or providing aid for local governments to do these 
things.

<P>

Twenty-five years ago, for instance, the state government spent nearly 16 percent of 
the budget on transportation.  Today California spends less than 6 percent, and ranks last 
in the nation in transportation spending per capita.  Moreover, that 16 percent we used to 
spend was largely for new road construction.  Today the majority of our transportation 
money is simply for maintenance.

<P>

Education is the other point of contention in state government.  But again, 
Proposition 13 and the Gann spending limit are not the real culprits.  Education received 
massive funding increases under Governor Deukmejian.  Spending per student, adjusted 
for  inflation, has risen by one-fifth since Proposition 13, from $3,046 per student in 1978 
to 3,793 next year. (Amounts are in constant 1988 dollars.)  Indeed, the next budget calls 
for spending almost as much for education ($23.4 billion) as we spent for all purposes 
when Governor Deukmejian was elected seven years ago (the 1982 state budget was $25 
billion).  The mystery over the seeming shortage of funds for education disappears when 
you examine the high administrative costs for many of the state's 40 categorical 
educational programs, or when you find that California has one of the highest ratios of 
school administrators to classroom teachers in the nation.

<P>

In other words, the passage of Proposition 13 did not really derail the liberal 
bureaucracy in Sacramento, as the rise in spending for welfare and education continued 
unabated.  But the decline in spending for roads and other basic infrastructure services, 
already declining under Governor Jerry Brown, accelerated after Proposition 13.  
Proposition 13, like the Reagan tax cuts, has made California's economy more 
prosperous.  It also made local government more efficient, but waste and bureaucracy still 
abound in Sacramento as they do in Washington.

<P>

California is a lot better off for having passed Proposition 13, the Gann spending 
limit, and income tax indexing-just think of how fast government spending would have 
risen without these measures.  But we are not as well governed as we should be.  
Proposition 13 was only the first battle in the war to cut government spending and make 
the government do what it used to do.  There are many more battles still to be fought in 
Sacramento.

<h1>Foreign Investment:</h1>
<h3>Benefit or Threat?</h3>
</center>

Remember about ten years back, when OPEC was riding high, gasoline was $1.25 
a gallon, and Arab merchants were buying seemingly every farm in Iowa and Kansas, 
along with downtown London?  So extreme was the paranoia that <I>foreign interests</I> 
would end up owning Americas heartland that many politicians and business leaders 
proposed that there be restrictions in foreign ownership of American assets.

<P>

Of course, the fortunes of OPEC and the Arab oil merchants suffered a swift 
reversal, and yet, despite the salutary lesson in the vicissitudes of world markets, the 
paranoia over foreign investment is with us again.  The chief culprits are the Japanese, 
and so strong has been the backlash to Japanese and other Asian investment that the joke 
has arisen that, should we go to war again, America will have to bomb Pearl Harbor, for 
the Japanese, having failed to conquer Hawaii in 1942, have come to own nearly the 
whole of it.

<P>

At the present time, the clamor for restrictions on foreign ownership of American 
assets is not sufficiently strong to bring the sentiment to effectbut it is there.  Aside 
from the Japan-bashing chatter you hear at cocktail parties, the theme of economic 
nationalism played a prominent role in the late Presidential campaign of the Democratic 
party, and economic nationalism was the preeminent issue in the recent Canadian 
election.  If economic nationalism can prove relatively potent in a time of prosperity and 
growth, surely it can become a decisive force if there is any wind of serious economic 
downturn.

<P>

If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel,  as Samuel Johnson has it, then 
economic nationalisma mistaken substitute for patriotismis the first refuge of 
paranoid politicians.  The kind of economic nationalism that resents foreign investment in 
the U.S. is mistaken not only on the facts, but also on the principles of economic 
rationality.

<P>

First of all, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. is not very large.  In fact, 
although you can say with great effect that Japanese investment in the U.S. has increased 
six-fold since 1980, the book value of Japanese investment in the U.S. came to only $33 
billion by 1987, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Guess what?  That is 
less than half the level of investment in the U.S. by Great Britain.  When was the last time 
you heard anyone worry about the level of British investment in the U.S.?

<P>

As a proportion of total assets in the U.S.,  foreign ownership is really quite small. 
Take California, a favorite spot for Japanese and other foreign investment, as an example. 
In 1987, total foreign investment in California came to $37.02 billionabout 3 percent of 
the total assessed valuation of all property and assets in the state.  That investment, by the 
way, is credited with creating more than 280,000 jobs in the state, 45 percent of which are 
manufacturing jobs.  Furthermore, in 1986 (the last year for which figures are available), 
foreigners owned only 2 percent of the states farmland922,680 of Californias 47.3 
million agricultural acres.

<P>

To be sure, much of the emotional strength behind the paranoia over Japanese 
ownership comes from the anecdotal tales of Japanese businessmen paying huge sums
often in cashfor American real estate.  Often, it is true, these buyers are paying far too 
much for American properties, at least by the standards of the American market.  But that 
is exactly the point. Remember that real estate in Japan is frightfully expensive.  Ours is 
comparatively cheap.  Combine that relative circumstance with the strong Yen, and 
suddenly the Japanese real estate rush here doesnt look so outlandish.

<P>

The fact that Japanese investors are willing to overpay for American assets should, 
in fact, be regarded as good news.  The world presently stands in awe of, and is 
intimidated by, the Asian economies.  And yet it should say a great deal that Asian 
investors are sending substantial amounts of their capital here, rather than investing in 
their own economies.  In fact, the returns on investment are much higher here than in the 
Far East.  If the Asians really are the worlds shrewdest businessmen (a dubious 
proposition) then what does it say for the future of our economythat they see the U.S. 
as one of the best places to invest their capital?

<P>

But even if it were true that Japanese and other foreign investors were succeeding 
in buying a significant portion of Americas assets, what would it really mean?  In the 
abstract, ownership of an asset is unrelated to the performance of the asset.  Critics 
suggest that foreign ownership of our assets somehow threatens our control of our own 
destiny, or even national security.  But there is no evidence to suggest that Japanese or 
other foreign management would make worse use of assets than American owners.  And 
the outcry against Japanese investment misses a fundamental point:  When an American 
sells an asset to a foreign owner, the American gets cash with which to invest in other 
assets or in creating new assets.  Often in our nations history, periods of economic 
growth correspond with net inflows of capital.

<P>

In fact, this one of the most important, yet largely overlooked, lessons about the 
present structure of international finance.  At the beginning of the 1980s, America was 
investing about $100 billion a year overseashelping in large part to fuel the expansion 
in the Pacific Rim.  When the Reagan Administration cut taxes and improved the after-
tax yield on investment here, Americans not only stopped sending their capital abroad, 
but foreign nations found they could not  compete for their own capital, as it flowed into 
the newly attractive American economy.  The trade deficit that has ensued from all this, 
Milton Friedman has said recently, is an economic blessing.  It has enabled us to have a 
higher level of investment.  This circumstance has also led to a wave of tax reductions 
around the world.

<P>

What we have is a case of the shoe being on the other foot.  For decades, American 
investment overseas helped to foster often violent anti-American sentiments that were 
little better than a cover for envy and resentment.  Given the fact that there is no outcry 
against the much largerand growingBritish investment here, it would seem that the 
anti-Asian sentiment is motivated by the worst of reasons:  racism and envy.  Although it 
may be true that there are serious cultural frictions between Japanese investing and 
American business and labor, that is not an economic problem.  It would be regrettable if 
America, the nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,  were to 
act on ethnic frustrations and call it economic policy.

<html><head><title>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</title><body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><table border=0 width=85%><tr><td><center><h1>The Conservatism of the Declaration of Independence</h1><h5>Remarks given by Dr. Thomas G. West at a dinner for the Board of Directors of the Claremont Institute, May 10, 1996</h5></center>	The Claremont Institute seeks to restore the principles of the American founding to their former position of preeminence in American public life.  Surprisingly, some conservatives have doubts about that project.<p>	The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way:  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<p>	In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings.  On the one hand they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration.  On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is that we have too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy.  Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much they care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<p>	We at the Claremont Institute do not share the conservative ambivalence about the principles of the Declaration.  We believe that liberty and equality and rights are entirely good, as those terms were understood by our Founders.  A people that is a "good people" (as we called ourselves in the Declaration) cannot have too much of these good things.  The problem today is not that we have too much equality, too much liberty, too many rights.  The problem is that we are well along in a process of abandoning equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood.<p>	I will explain this from three points of view.<p>	First, our liberties are contracting, not expanding.  Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights.  What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past twenty-five years.<p>	Second, our liberties are also contracting in the area of government by consent--by elected officials accountable to the people.  Our country is governed less democratically now than it was in 1965.<p>	Third, our liberties are also contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom - namely, morality, family, and faith.<p>	Let me give examples to explain in each case how this decline of democracy, equality, and rights is taking place.<p>	Consider free speech.  Conservatives today sometimes complain that we have an excess of free speech.  But let us focus on the one area that the Founders regarded as the most important purpose of free speech: enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates for election.  In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office.  Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected.  This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of people with money in elections.  The idea behind this law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, the wealthy should be severely limited in what they can publish.<p>	What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest?  This is what the Revolution was all about:  government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who forbidden.  That had been the law in Old England.  Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic.  John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<p>	The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers.  What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws?  Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government,--in many cases, conservatives.<p>	Second example.  America doesn't have too much democracy, as many conservatives believe.  It has too little.  Government by the people has in a significant degree been replaced over the past century, especially in the past thirty years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate.  Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<p>	This has happened in two ways.  One, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments.  Two, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (president, governor, legislatures) to unelected officials (bureaucracies, agencies, and courts).<p>	One example.  How did we get wetlands regulation?  As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law on the subject.  The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the U. S.  Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U. S.  This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as little as 14 days a year, and land that accidentally becomes soaked by irrigation runoff or from undersized or clogged culverts.<p>	This wetlands example illustrates how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people.  This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent.  It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<p>	So much for our rights, and government by consent.<p>	Let us turn now to our third theme, the government's assault on the conditions of freedom--religion, family, and morality.<p>	The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare.  The Founders were the heirs of two thousand years of European history in which there was little or no protection of individuals rights, and little or no government by the consent of the governed.<p>	In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly.  Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another."  But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from?  The Founders' answer:  from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others.  Thomas Jefferson--the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity--was sensible enough to write in his Notes on Virginia that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<p>	Today's government is in a whole host of ways anti-religious.  When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational."  In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools.  Yet the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<p>	Government's ban on God is particularly striking in light of this fact:  the Declaration of Independence says liberty is our inalienable right only because we are "endowed" with that right by our Creator ("created equal").  Our principles (religious liberty) supposedly require us never to breathe a word to school children about where those principles come from.  But if we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on?  If liberty is not the gift of God, it must be the gift of government.  But what government gives, government may take away.  As Jefferson said: without God, liberty will not last.<p>	On the same topic of government hostility to morality and religion, consider the family.  Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem.  It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<p>	When government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood.  Government's generosity made it possible, for the time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more.  The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.<p>	At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage.  From sex education to legalized abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message:  just do it!  Sex exists for your personal fun and pleasure.  Don't worry about the consequences--if the fetus is inconvenient, kill it; if you would rather bring it to term, we'll pay you to raise it.<p>	Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<p>	America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated.  We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<p>	The Claremont Institute is devoted to the recovery of this healthy core of the older American tradition.  Let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<blockquote><b>Dr. Thomas G.

<h3>Foreword</h3>

<FONT SIZE=2>There are two reasons this booklet
is important.  One, it is immediately useful.  The majority of
Americans who favor restoring prayer to public schools will find
a way here to accomplish it.  It is a way which will pass the
muster of the courts.  It is a way which will be unobjectionable
to all fair-minded citizens.  It is a way that no one can criticize
as un-American.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second reason this booklet is
important is intellectual.  It teaches us about the key to America's
past greatness.  It warns us about the chief threat to America's
greatness today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One of the all-time best books about
our country is Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America</I>.  Written
in the 1830s, it explains the unique strength of our democracy
very simply:  In America the &quot;spirit of liberty&quot; and
the &quot;spirit of religion&quot; are intertwined.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, America's founders supported
the separation of church and state.  They enshrined it in the
First Amendment.  There would be no established religion here,
or preference by government to any particular religion.  But the
founders supported religion in general, both in speech and action.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Washington expressed the
consensus of the founders:  &quot;Of all the dispositions and
habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality
are indispensable supports.  In vain would that man claim the
tribute of partiotism, who should labor to subvert these great
pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties
of man and citizens.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for action, it is useful to recall
that Thomas Jefferson supported a bill prescribing penalities
for anyone doing business on the Sabbath.  He did so the very
same year that he wrote Virginia's Bill for Establishing Religious
Freedom, the greatest expression ever of freedom of conscience.
 Whatever any of us may think of blue laws, it is clear that Jefferson-who
also coined the phrase &quot;wall of separation between church
and state&quot;-was not anti-religious in the manner of the ACLU
and its liberal allies today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The conjunction of the &quot;spirit
of liberty&quot; and &quot;spirit of religion&quot; in America
was a two-way street.  The priests and ministers Tocqueville heard
preaching here were supporters of the rights of man.  They saw
God's will in the American Revolution.  Indeed, historically,
America's churches were the seedbeds of the Revolution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The veneration of religion by democrats
and of democracy by religious leaders in America was remarkable
to Tocqueville, because in his native France there was bitter
enmity between the Catholic Church and the supporters of democracy.
 The difference was critical to the opposite outcomes of the two
countries' revolutions in the late 18th century.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Harry V. Jaffa's understanding of
American democracy draws less on Tocqueville than on his hero
Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln spoke of an American political religion,
by which he meant reverence for the Constitution as informed by
the Declaration of Independence.  Using biblical language, Lincoln
spoke of the Constitution as a picture of silver surrounding the
Declaration, an apple of gold.  The Constitution supplies a democratic
structure with which we can govern ourselves.  The Declaration
supplies us with the understanding to govern ourselves well.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Professor Jaffa was responsible,
in the 1950s, for reviving the serious study of the Lincoln-Douglas
debates of 1858.  In those debates, Stephen Douglas defended the
Constitution as a procedural, majoritarian document.  It supported
what he called &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;-the idea that the
people in every state and territory of the U.S. have a right to
decide for themselves whether to allow slavery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lincoln understood the Constitution
to contain a moral component supplied by the Declaration.  The
&quot;laws of nature and of nature's God&quot; require that a
government be democratic to be legitimate.  At the same time,
however, they limit what democrats may legitimately choose.  The
power of Lincoln's rhetoric was always to show that extending
the definition of rights to mean the right to do wrong-as in the
right to have slaves-logically undermines the very idea of rights.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, the key to America's greatness
for Tocqueville was a religious spirit that fervently supported
liberty while guiding it clear of license.  For Lincoln it was
the Declaration, which sets forth the doctrine of rights but grounds
it in a doctrine of right.  The common element is the idea of
&quot;liberty under God.&quot;  For Tocqueville it is explicitly
the God of the Old and New Testaments.  For Lincoln it is the
God who is mentioned four times in the Declaration:  &quot;nature's
God&quot; who is the source of laws, the &quot;Creator&quot; who
endows men with rights, the &quot;Supreme Judge of the world&quot;
to whom the writers appeal for guidance, and &quot;divine providence&quot;
on whom free men must rely for protection.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just as &quot;liberty under God&quot;
is the key to America's past, the sundering of liberty from God
is the chief threat to our future.  We can see this threat in
the anti-religious attitudes among our elites that are more reminiscent
of Tocqueville's France than Tocqueville's America.  We can see
this threat in the licentious behavior that has eaten away at
the American family since the 1960s.  Restoring prayer in schools
may be only one step, but we believe it will be an important step
back from the precipice.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This booklet argues that Congress
has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation
allowing voluntary prayer in shcools.  The character of this prayer
would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the
preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions.  This would at once
recall the idea of &quot;liberty under God,&quot; and remind all
Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but
rather the formation of our unparalleled freedoms for two centuries.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We are a religious people,
whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is no better way to confirm
the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William
O. Douglas, than to take a tour through the state constitutions.
 Forty-six of the fifty stateshave preambles invoking the name
of Almighty God</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
 A joint resolution of the Congress-which would require no more
than simple majorities in both houses-could declare that children
in public schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing
only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present
in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any
of the other states.  When this resolution is signed by the President-and
it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it-it could
take effect immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that
the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution. 
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected
branches of government, but also would require it, in effect,
to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We submit herewith some examples
of the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental
laws of the states.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Alabama, in order
to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure
the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking
the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and establish
the following Constitution and form of government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of Arkansas,
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty,
and desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of California,
grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Colorado, with profound
reverence for the Supreme Ruler of the Universe . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging
with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted
them to enjoy a free government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>[Delaware] Through divine goodness,
all men have by nature the right of worshipping and serving their
Creator according to the dictates of their consciences . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Maine . . . acknowledging
with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler of the
Universe . . . and imploring God's aid and direction . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of New
Jersey, grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty
which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy, and looking to Him
for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the same
unimpaired to succeeding generations . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of
civil and religious liberty, and humbly invoking his guidance
. . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since through Divine Providence we
enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty, we the people
of West Virginia, in and through the provisions of this Constitution,
reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God and seek
diligently to promote, preserve and perpetuate good government
. . . </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This selection should be sufficient
to illustrate both the consistency in the patterns of all the
preambles, and the interesting variations that occur in some of
them.  Who could ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge
that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil and
religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant
reliance upon God to preserve and perpetuate it?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is notable that the state constitutions
have provisions equivalent to the &quot;no establishment&quot;
and &quot;free exercise&quot; clauses of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice
for present purposes is that of California.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion
without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty
of conscience does not excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent
with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From this it is apparent that the
people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees
of religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions
of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that freedom in the same
constitutions.</FONT>
<P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>*   *   *   *   *</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>American constitutions whether federal
or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration
of Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination
of a legal positivism which is simply unable to understand the
relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and
human law on the other.  Yet this relationship was axiomatic for
our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation-that
is to say, a moral duty- to obey the laws, either of our State,
or of the United States, there is only one answer.  It is because
those laws exist &quot;to secure these rights,&quot; rights with
which we have been &quot;endowed by [our] Creator.&quot;  Constitutional
governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights
whose origin is altogether independent of human will, rights which
are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in &quot;the
laws of nature and of nature's God.&quot;  Through the ages many
governments which did not respect the rights of the individual
have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But
the consent of the governed required by our republican constitutions
is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human
person.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Legal positivists deny to the Declaration
any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according
to the United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the
first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this is
not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that all
enabling acts since the Civil War have provided that the state
to be admitted must have a constitution &quot;republican in form&quot;
and that the constitution &quot;not be repugnant to the principles
of the Declaration of Independence.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States Constitution, while
guaranteeing to every state of the Union a republican form of
government, does not expressly say what that form is.  But the
Congress, in implementing that guarantee in the case of each new
state added to the Union in the last one hundred and thirty years,
does expressly define that form by the principles of the Declaration
of Independence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under this mandate from the Congress,
we find these principles affirmed over and over again in the state
constitutions.  Here for example is Alabama.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Article I.  Declaration of Rights
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>That the great, general, and essential
principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and
established, we declare:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sec. 1. Inalienable rights.  That
all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Rights of the
Constitution of the State of California has a similar provision,
which reads: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All people are by nature free and
independent and have inalienable rights.  Among these are enjoying
and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting
property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It can be seen that &quot;endowed
by their Creator&quot; and &quot;by nature&quot; are correlative
terms each implying the other.  It can also be seen that the rights
secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the
United States, are means of implementing antecedent rights whose
origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how
we can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating
in them an understanding of and a reverence for this origin. </FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>MASSACHUSETTS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The end of the institution,
maintenance and administration of government, is to secure the
existence of the body-politic, to protect it, and to furnish the
individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying in safety
and tranquility their natural rights, and the blessings of life:
 And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people
have a right to alter the government, and to take measures necessary
for their safety, prosperity and happiness.-The Body-Politic is
formed by a voluntary association of individuals:  It is a social
compact, by which the whole people covenants with each Citizen,
and each Citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed
by certain Laws for the Common good.  It is the duty of the people,
therefore, in framing a Constitution of Government, to provide
for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial
interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man
may, at all times, find his security in them.  WE, therefore,
the people of Massachusetts, acknowledging, with grateful hearts,
the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording
us, in the course of his Providence, an opportunity, deliberately
and peaceably, without fraud, violence or surprise, or entering
into an Original, explicit, and Solemn Compact with each other;
and of forming a New Constitution of Civil Government, for Ourselves
and Posterity; and devoutly imploring His direction in so interesting

in his person, Liberty, or Estate, for worshipping God in the

not Disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious
Worship.-</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Part I, Art. III.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;As the happiness of a people,

depend upon piety, religion and morality; and as these cannot
be generally diffused through a Community, but by the institution
of the public Worship of God, and of public instructions in piety,
religion and morality:  Therefore, to promote their happiness
and to secure the good order and preservation of their government,
the people of this Commonwealth have a right to invest their legislature
shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several Towns,
Parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious societies,
to make suitable provision, at their own Expence, for the institution
of Public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance
of public protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality,
in all cases where such provision shall not be made Voluntarily.-And
the people of this Commonwealth have also a right to, and do,
invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon all the
Subjects an attendance upon the instructions of the public teachers
aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on whose
instructions they can Conscientiously and conveniently attend-PROVIDED
notwithstanding, that the several towns, parishes, precincts,
and other bodies politic, or religious societies, shall, at all
times, have the exclusive right of electing their public Teachers,
and of contracting with them for their support and maintenance.-And
all monies paid by the Subject to the Support of public worship,
and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it,
be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher or teachers
of his own religious sect or denomination, provided there be any
on whose instructions he attends: otherwise it may be paid towards
the support of the teacher or teachers of the parish or precinct
in which the said monies are raised-And every denomination of
christians, demeaning themselves peaceably, and as good Subjects
of the Commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of
the Law:  And no subordination of any one sect or denomination
to another shall ever be established by law.&quot;</FONT>

<h1>On the Front Line of the Culture War:</h1>
<h3>Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America</h3>
<b>William A. Donohue</B>
</center>

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center width=85%>

<h3>Preface</h3>

On May 24, 1993, Roberta Achtenberg was confirmed as U.S. 
Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  
This was a ballyhooed "historic first" of the Clinton era:  
Achtenberg is a homosexual activist.  
<P>

Less than two weeks later, President Clinton scuttled the 
politically-disastrous nomination of his long-time friend and 
political ally Lani Guinier for the nation's top civil rights post.  
More startling to the public was that he had nominated her in the 
first place:  Guinier had built her entire reputation on 
challenging the idea of majority rule, both in elections and in 
legislatures.    
<P>

These events are related, and their connection is related to the 
theme of this booklet.
<P>

What Winston Churchill and others have admired about 
Scouting over the years is that it supports the work of family, 
church, and country, attaching boys' loyalties toin Churchill's 
words"Right and Truth, however the winds may blow."  It 
stood against the strange 19th-century philosophical view  that 
winds (or history) is all there isthat right and truth change 
with time and circumstance.  This philosophy, called 
"historicism," animated both German National Socialism and 
Soviet Communism earlier in this century.  In a more benign 
form, it came to roost in American universities and is now 
making inroads in American government.     
<P>

We know this philosophy as moral relativism.  Its adherents 
speak not of morals but of "values," none of which are 
objectively superior to any others.  For instance, one person's 
values may tell them that the best kind of family consists of a 
man and a woman and children.  Others' values may say that the 
best kind of a family consists of a man and five women and 
children, or two men and children, or two women and children 
and a rabbit.  And no one can legitimately hold that any of these is 
superior, except merely subjectively.  Nor can the government 
take a legitimate interest in promoting one arrangment over the 
others.  That would be "legislating morality."  In fact, the 
government should legislate against morality, or against the right 
of private citizens and organizations to make moral distinctions. 
This is the view of Roberta Achtenberg who, in fact, gained 
fame as a San Francisco Supervisor with her heavy-handed 
efforts to force the Boy Scouts to reverse their ban on homo-
sexual Scoutmasters.  And it is the view endorsed by the Clinton 
administration, not only by the fact of Achtenberg's appointment 
to high federal office, but also of Clinton's Interior Department's 
official endorsement of a National Park Service ban on using Boy 
Scout volunteers in America's national parks.
<P>

But homosexuals and atheists (who have also dragged the 
Boy Scouts into court, seeking to outlaw the right of private 
citizens and organizations to make religious distinctions) have a 
big problem:  Most Americans, while not inclined to snoop into 
each others' private lives, believe that sodomy is wrong and 
want to raise their children in that view.  Most Americans, while 
not inclined to talk overly-much about it, believe in God and 
want to raise their children in that view.  And most Americans 
think our country is tops precisely because its principles, based 
on "the laws of nature and of nature's God," support their views 
and their right to raise their children as they see fit.
<P>

And there's the rub.  What the majority thinks of as freedom 
isn't what organized homosexuals and atheists and their modern 
(as opposed to Jeffersonian) liberal supporters think of as 
freedomnamely, freedom from all social constraints.  The 
solution, according to Lani Guinierwhose views President 
Clinton knew perfectly well before he nominated her, and whose 
views he shares, according to her, despite his public denials 
when he cut her loose under fireis that judges and bureaucrats 
should rule us despite our druthers, according to their 
"enlightened" views.
<P>

Back in the Reagan years, Attorney General Ed Meese became 
embroiled in a remarkable running debate with Supreme Court 
Justice William Brennan, over how judges should decide cases 
involving the Constitution.  Meese said they should look to the 
original meaning of the Constitution and respect majority rule.  
Brennan, referring to the founding era as "a world that is dead 
and gone," explained why he would prohibit the death penalty 
despite its popularity and its explicit authorization in the Fifth 
Amendment:  "On this issue, the death penalty, I hope to 
embody a community striving for human dignity for all. . . ."  
With his use of the personal pronoun, Brennan suggested that 
he, an unelected judge, is better able to "embody the 
community" than Americans' elected representatives.  
<P>

The American Civil Liberties Uniona major player in recent 
attacks on the Boy Scouts, as Bill Donohue recounts in this 
bookletstood foursquare with Brennan.  In a cover letter to a 
petition calling for Meese's ouster, ACLU Executive Director Ira 
Glasser wrote:  "It is only a very small and special group of 
Americans (less than 1%) who understand the importance of 
fighting to sustain individual freedom."  A friend and I 
responded in a newspaper editorial at the time:  "What 
arrogance!  And what a threat to liberty!"  
<P>

We continued:  Vladimir Lenin once made the argument that 
representative democracy was not really democratic 
at all, because the majority of people in democracies 
do not have the requisite knowledge to vote in their 
own true interests.  Democratic majorities are much 
too concerned with their families, for instance, and 
with obtaining better working conditions and better 
pay, with utilizing their right to start their own 
businesses, etc., ever to vote to abolish private 
property.
<P>

How stupid, said Lenin.  It's a good thing I'm here to 
"embody the community," because the people 
themselves would never vote for their true 
representatives.
<P>

That is how Lenin used to talk, and how communists 
still talk.  And it appearsby his suggestion that we 
should be embodied or represented, for our own 
good, by nine unelected lawyers with life tenure on 
the Supreme Courtthat William Brennan considers 
the court to be something like an American Politburo. 
. . .  But if the "liberal" anti-democratic faction 
[represented by Brennan and the ACLU] ever gains 
full control of our government, then we will say, after 
Lincoln, that we would prefer emigrating to Russia, 
where we can take our despotism unalloyed.

<P>
What a goofy world:  Seven years later, Leninists have been 
expelled from the Kremlin and Brennanists have taken over the 
White House.  
<P>

This investigation of recent attacks on the Boy Scouts shows 
us clearly how the enemies of morality and religion operate 
pseudo-democratically, and suggests how to defeat them with 
the real thing.

<h2>On the Front Line of the Culture War:</h2>

<blockquote>
Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America

Right and Truth, however the winds may blow.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<b>Assault on the the Boy Scout Tradition</b>
<P>

"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and 
country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all 
times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and 
morally straight."  
<P>

For seven decades, the Boy Scout Oath was considered 
wholly unexceptional by almost everyone.  But in the 1980s it 
became the target of homosexuals, atheists and (to a lesser 
degree) feminists. Acting in concert with these groups is the 
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the legal arm of modern 
liberalism.  At stake is whether private organizations that 
support traditional morality are protected by the law against 
assaults by their enemies.  Despite its desire just to be left alone, 
the Boy Scouts of America has found itself on the front line of the 
culture war.
<P>

Scouting was introduced to America in 1910 by its founder, 
Lord Robert Baden-Powell.  In the first articles of incorporation, 
the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) defined its purpose:  "to 
promote, through organization, and cooperation with other 
agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and 
others, to train them in Scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, 
courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods 
which are in common use by Boy Scouts."
<P>

The Scout Oath, which was first published in 1911 in The 
Official Boy Scout Handbook, requires every Scout to obey Scout 
Law.  Scout Law provides that every Scout be trustworthy, loyal, 
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, 
brave, clean and reverent.
<P>

In addition to the Boy Scouts, for boys from 11- to 17-years-
old, there are the Cub Scouts and the Tiger Scouts, which begin 
in the first grade. There is also the Explorers, focusing on 
exploring careers, for young people of both sexes, ages 14 to 20.  
Scout troops are sponsored at the local level by churches, 
schools, and various civic organizations.  
<P>

The BSA has 4.3 million members and 1.1 million adult 
volunteers.  Approximately one-half of all American boys try 
Cub Scouting and about one in five become Boy Scouts.  
Gays, Godless, and Girls Want In
<P>

In 1980 a 17-year-old Scout named Timothy Curran decided 
to take a male date to his senior prom.  The Oakland Tribune 
published a photo of the couple and Curran was called to appear 
before the Boy Scouts' Mount Diablo Council office in Walnut 
Creek, California.  Executive Director Quentin Alexander told 
Curran that he could not continue in scouting, stating that 
"homosexuality and Boy Scouting are not com-patible."   Curran 
sued the Boy Scouts, seeking an injunction to prevent them from 
excluding him from membership and from being a troop leader.  
Curran enlisted the ACLU, which claimed that in barring him 
the BSA violated the "equal public accommodations" section of 
the state Civil Rights Act.  Similar lawsuits have subsequently 
been filed by James Dale and Chuck Merino, homosexual Boy 
Scout leaders in Monmouth, New Jersey and San Diego, 
California, respectively.     
<P>

In 1989 Elliott Welsh agreed to his 6-year-old son Mark's 
request to join the Tiger Cubs.  But when he discovered at a 
recruiting meeting in Burr Ridge, Illinois that Mark would have 
to abide by a religious requirement, he sued the BSA. Two years 
later attorney James Randall, the Anaheim, California father of 
nine-year-old twins, sued the BSA for a similar reason: he 
objected to the Cub Scout Oath for mentioning God.  He was 
assisted by the ACLU.
<P>

In 1991 an eight-year-old Florida girl, Margo Mankes, filed 
suit against the Boy Scouts for excluding her from joining.  
Though the ACLU was not active in her case, it did express 
interest in representing several girls from Quincy, California 
who sought to become Boy Scouts.
<P>

The immediate issue in these cases is whether the BSA can 
continue to function according to its own precepts or will have to 
abide by those of others.  The longer term question is whether 
traditional morality can be sustained in our democracy.  And as 
a corollary:  Can our democracy itself be sustained?    
Boy Scout Thinking on Homosexuality
<P>

At the Timothy Curran-BSA trial, a Scout official testified 
that, from the beginning of the Boy Scouts, "it was clearly 
understood that homosexuality was an immoral behavior and 
had no place in Scouting for youth or leaders."   Lee Sneath, a 
national spokesman for the BSA, explained that "as an 
organization that stresses the values of the family, we believe 
that homosexuals do not provide the proper role model for 
youth membership."
<P>

The idea that homosexuality is wrong did not originate, nor 
will it end, with the Boy Scouts of America.  As political scientist 
Harry V. Jaffa has written:  
<P>
<blockquote>
From ancientand biblicaltimes, this practice has 
been regarded by the greatest legislators and 
moralists as a vicious sexual perversion.  It is 
condemned equally by the Old and New Testaments, 
and by Plato in his Laws.  Thomas Jefferson, in a 
criminal code written during the American 
Revolution, made it a felony in the same class as rape.  
In this he only followed the common law. 
Nor is the connection between this idea and the family 
unprecedented or unreasonable:
Mankind as a whole is recognized by its generations, 
like a river which is one and the same while the ever-
renewed cycles of birth and death flow on.  But the 
generations are constitutedand can only be 
constitutedby the acts of generation arising from 
the conjunction of male and female. . . .  Equally with 
rape and incest, homosexuality strikes at the 
authority and dignity of the family.  The distinction 
between a man and a woman is as fundamental as 
any in nature, because it is the very distinction by 
which nature itself is constituted.
</blockquote>
<P>

This philosophical (and common sense) view is of course 
compatible with traditional religious views:  As has been cutely 
(and acutely) noted about the biblical account of creation, God 
made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Thus The Official Boy 
Scout Handbook explains the meaning of "morally straight" in the 
Boy Scout Oath in these terms:  "[w]hen you live up to the trust 
of fatherhood your sex life will fit into God's wonderful plan of 
creation.  Fuller understanding of wholesome sex behavior can 
bring you lifelong happiness."
<P>

Practically speaking, of course, the BSA is also concerned 
about pedophilia.  Although most homosexuals may not be 
pedophiles, as BSA spokesman Sneath pointed out, the Scouts 
"provide a natural hunting ground for pedophiles."   Thus the 
BSA has launched an aggressive anti-abuse campaign, and 
guidelines now discourage such traditional practices as skinny-
dipping and forbid boys to sleep in the tent of adults other than a 
parent or guardian.
<P>

Article VIII of the BSA Bylaws states:  "Our membership 
standards have been developed to ensure that we have the best 
possible individuals in our organization, and the enforcement of 
these standards should not be construed to suggest that any 
individual in question is not a decent citizen.  It simply means 
that the individual does not possess the requirements necessary 
for membership in the Boy Scouts of America."  
This policy is comparable to that of the American Lung 
Association, which because of its principles on health probably 
would not want to be represented by smokers.
Judge Sally G. Disco of the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court understood that exclusion of homosexuals was critical to 
the Boy Scout mission:
<P>

<blockquote>
Inclusion of a homosexual Scoutmaster who has 
publicly acknowledged his or her homosexuality 
would either undermine the force of the Boy Scout 
view that homosexuality is immoral and inconsistent 
with the Scout oath and law, or would undermine the 
credibility of the Scoutmaster who attempts to 
communicate that view.   
</blockquote>
<P>

For Judge Discowhose decision we will say more about 
belowthe case against the Boy Scouts hinged on whether 
promoting traditional morality, like promoting public health, is 
protected by the First Amendment.

<h3>Boy Scout Thinking on Atheism</h3>

About 30 percent of all Boy Scouts are sponsored by churches, 
with support coming most heavily from the Church of Latter 
Day Saints, the United Methodist Church and the Roman 
Catholic Church.  This is not surprising:  The BSA promotes 
belief in God and a sense of responsibility to God.  On the other 
hand, it is nonsectarian in its attitude toward religious training.  
Boys are encouraged to respect other religions.  Indeed, God and 
religion are understood so broadly that in practice even 
Buddhists, who do not believe in a Supreme Being, are welcome 
to join.
<P>

Still Elliott Welsh found room to carp.  Of course Welsh is no 
stranger to courtrooms:  In 1970 he achieved notoriety when the 
Supreme Court threw out his three-year prison sentence for 
claiming conscientious objection status to the Vietnam War on 
ethical (as opposed to religious, since he is not religious) 
grounds.  
<P>

At issue in the Welsh-BSA case were the Tiger Cub Promise 
and the Declaration of Religious Principle.  The former consists of 
16 words: "I promise to love God, my family, and my country, 
and to learn about the world."  The latter says in part:  "The Boy 
Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the 
best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God and 
therefore recognizes the religious element in the training of the 
member."  Elliott Welsh characterized this as "bigoted, 
outmoded boilerplate." 
<P>

The burden of proof is on Welsh.  No less than George 
Washington held the opposite view.  He said in his Farewell 
Address:
<P>
<blockquote>
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are 
indispensable supports.  In vain would that man 
claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to 
subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these 
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. . . .  
Let it simply be asked where is the security for 
property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of 
religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the 
instruments of investigation in the Courts of Justice?  
And let us with caution indulge the supposition that 
morality can be maintained without religion.    
</blockquote>
<P>

Indeed, this view has been held by all of our presidents down 
to the modern day.   It is woven deep in the fabric of our 
national life.  Alexis de Tocqueville observed in 1848:  "An 
American sees in religion the surest guarantee of the stability of 
the State and the safety of individuals."   And Justice William 
O. Douglas in 1952:  
<P>
<blockquote>
We are a religious people whose institutions 
presuppose a Supreme Being.  We guarantee the 
freedom to worship as one chooses.  [We] sponsor an 
attitude on the part of government that shows no 
partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish 
according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal 
of its dogma.  When the state encourages religious 
instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by 
adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian 
needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then 
respects the religious nature of our people and 
accomodates the public service to their spiritual 
needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in 
the Constitution a requirement that the government 
show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That 
would be preferring those who believe in no religion 
over those who do believe. 
</blockquote>
<P>

The BSA prevailed against Welsh's suit, but not James 
Randall's.  Randall has not only sued the BSA on behalf of his 
sons, but a San Diego Girl Scout troop as well, for denying 6-
year-old Nitzya Cuevas-Macias entrance into meetings for 
refusing to pledge to serve God.
<P>

As we will see below, the issue here is whether Justice 
Douglas's worst case scenario will be enacted into lawwhether 
the old liberal idea of freedom of religion will be replaced by the 
modern liberal idea of freedom from religion.  
Boy Scout Thinking on Girl Applicants
<P>

The Boy Scouts don't accept girls for the same reason the 
Girl Scouts don't accept boys.  Blake Lewis of the BSA explained:  
"The emotional, psychological and physical needs of young boys 
are very different in this age group from the needs of young 
girls."   Same sex programs and institutions have been a staple 
of youth organizations for decades.  There is no reason to 
interpret this as discrimination in the pejorative sense of the 
word.  Indeed, as mentioned above, the BSA's Explorers include 
girls.  And women now comprise three percent of Scoutmasters 
nationwide. 
<P>

This wasn't enough for Mark Rubin, the attorney who 
unsuccessfully represented Margo Mankes. "The Scouts are 
training boys to be successful," he said.  "The Girl Scouts' 
purpose is to make women better homemakers.  There is no 
alternative as good as the Boy Scouts."   
<P>

Clearly this is a less serious threat to the BSA, at least for now, 
than the threats from homosexuals and atheists.  So we will not 
belabor it except to point out that there are more reasonable 
alternatives than suing the Boy Scouts to admit girls, e.g., 
working to reform the Girl Scouts or founding a new 
organization for girls.  
<P>

That such an obviously unreasonable route was taken 
indicates an ulterior motive.  

<h3>The Culture War Against the Boy Scouts</h3>

Levi Strauss Company, Bank of America and Wells Fargo 
yanked their donations to the BSA in the summer of 1992 over 
the exclusion of homosexuals.  The United Way of DeKalb 
County, Illinois, has denied funding to the local BSA council, as 
has the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area, which used 
to donate nearly $500,000.  (Nationwide, the United Way con-
tributes roughly 25 percent of the BSA budget.)  In 1993, the San 
Diego school board voted unanimously to oust the Scouts from 
running school-day programs in the eighth-largest district in the 
nation. 
<P>

In an unusal effort, Lewis S. Albert, the western region  acting 
director of the National Park Service, told his sub-ordinates that 
they should terminate all agreements with the BSA, such as the 
use of Boy Scout volunteers in the parks.  This directive was 
overridden by the Bush administration, which told the National 
Park Service bureaucrats that it was not their business to 
interfere with the policies of private associations like the Boy 
Scouts.  But less than three weeks into the Clinton 
administration, Clinton's Interior Department rescinded the 
Bush override. 

<h3>How does one make sense of this?</h3>

Most Americans have never found the Boy Scouts to be 
anything but commendable.  Recently, however, a very 
influential group has come to find it anachronistic.  More than 
that, they want to force the BSA to change or (as they might say) 
"drag it into the modern world."
<P>
  
The term "new class," as employed by social commentator 
Irving Kristol and others, refers to modern liberals, usually 
educated at America's elite colleges and universities, who work 
in the media, the academy, government, and other non-profit 
sectors of the economy.  Ideologically alienated from 
"bourgeois" society, they are strategically placede.g., in New 
York, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, and on the faculties of most 
college campuses, particularly in the humanities, the social 
sciences and lawto undermine the traditional beliefs and way 
of life of the American middle class. This "new class" espouses 
"politically correct" thinking:  the view that any departure from 
the modern liberal agenda is racist, sexist or homophobic, and 
thus beyond the pale in modern society.  Increasingly they resort 
to the courts, in effect criminalizing politically incorrect (i.e., 
traditional or conservative) policies and even speech.
<P>

This tendency to resort to coercion to get their way is the most 
obvious behavioral trait distinguishing modern liberals from their 
classical liberal forbears.  Whereas liberals even a generation ago 
(like Justice William O. Douglas) believed deeply in the Bill of 
Rights and democracy, modern liberals use charges of racism, 
sexism, and homophobia as clubs to stifle free debate and bully 
the majority into submission.
<P>

These are the people who have singled out the Boy Scouts for 
extreme measures.  

<h3>Discriminating Discrimination</h3>

The attackers of the Boy Scouts draw some astounding 
comparisons.  Consider Jon Davidson, Timothy Curran's ACLU 
lawyer:  
<P>
<blockquote>
If the Boy Scouts claimed to espouse anti-Semitism, 
would that excuse exclusion of all Jewish Scout-
masters?  If they stated that they believed that blacks 
were inferior, would they have a 'right' to practice 
discrimination against African-Americans? 
Likewise, Elliott Welsh called the argument that the Boy 
Scouts should be able to exclude the nonreligious "every bit as 
compelling as the argument that because black players were 
excluded from major-league baseball in 1910 they should be 
excluded today."
</blockquote>
<P> 

Let us consider these points one by one. 
<P>

To compare the exclusion of homosexuals to the exclusion of 
Jews and blacksfrom any organizationis illogical.  Those 
who object to Jews or blacks joining an organization may not 
rationally assert that what they object to is related to character or 
behavior.  The opposite is true of homosexuals.  To speak of 
homosexuals without addressing sodomy, which is what 
homosexuals do, is as irrational as talking about vegetarians 
without discussing vegetables, which is what vegetarians eat.  It 
is precisely their sodomite behavior that defines homosexuals 
and that the Boy Scouts and the great majority of Americans find 
objectionable. 
<P>

Curran explained his goal as being to secure "the same kind 
of opportunities as everyone else in this country and not be judged 
differently because of whom I love" (emphasis added).   
Understood this way, homosexuality is akin to adultery and 
incest and bestiality.  It is clearly not akin to being black or 
Jewish.
<P>

Nor does the analogy of black ballplayers and atheists work.  
Blacks were excluded from baseball not for what they believed 
or didn't believe, which is related to character and behavior, but 
for their skin color, which is not related to belief or character or 
behavior and which is not therefore a rational category by which 
to discriminate between people.  
<P>

A much more logical analogy to the Boy Scouts' exclusion of 
atheists is the exclusion by Honor Societies of students who don't 
maintain a certain grade point average.  In these cases, the 
exclusion is related to the purpose of the organization.  Not so 
with baseball before Jackie Robinson.  Quite the opposite:  It was 
contrary to the purpose of baseball to exclude talented players 
who could help their teams win games.   
<P>

When asked when discrimination is permissible, Jon 
Davidson answered that it "is only permissible under the 
Constitution when without it the reason for the organization 
would cease to exist."   But this point is in favor of the Boy 
Scouts:  The BSA is a private organization that exists to form 
boys to be "morally straight," "practice wholesome sex 
behavior," and love and serve God and country.  This purpose 
obviously precludes the membership of homosexuals and 
atheists.  
<P>

By seeking in the courts to force homosexuals and atheists on 
the Boy Scouts, its enemies seek to destroy the BSA as now 
constituted.  

<h3>Stands for Diversity? </h3>

Why don't those who are excluded from the Boy Scouts 
establish their own organizations?  Isn't that the American way?  
To found the Gay Scouts or the Godless Scouts of America?  Or 
the Girl Boy Scouts?  No doubt the BSA would only greet such 
news with relief, as its resources could go again to fulfilling its 
mission rather than to paying its attorneys.
<P>

The truth of the matter is that the modern liberal "political-
correctness police" are in the business of limiting choices rather 
than offering more.  What is perverse in their case is that, unlike 
real policemen, they pose and are portrayed by the media as the 
high priests of tolerance and diversity.  For example:  A task 
force of the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area 
recommended that the BSA "adopt a local policy that is in 
harmony with the social diversity, values and spirit of the Bay 
Area."   Ditto Time magazine:  "What is most troubling in the 
Boy Scouts' new emphasis on privacy is the hint that the group 
serves as a retreat for parents who dislike the diverse and 
tolerant world of today."   
<P>
He, of course, knows that the BSA's interest in privacy 
rights is not new; it extends to its origins in 1910.  As for who 
really supports diversity and tolerance, let's be real:  it is not the 
BSA which is suing gays, the godless and girls, but the latter, 
along with the ACLU, who are suing the BSA.
Culture and Politics
<P>

More than 90 percent of Americans proclaim allegiance to 
God.  A similarly huge majority finds sodomy objectionable.  The 
Boy Scout Oath, law, and mission are highly reflective of what 
most Americans hold dear.  It follows that, to a large extent, the 
BSA's status under the law reflects the status of the American 
majority.  In this way we begin to see the culture war as 
inseparable from current political and constitutional con-
troversies in America. 
<P>

Culture reflects the higher ideas, theological and 
philosophical, that unite society and inform politics.  Moral 
precepts drawn from these higher ideas instruct not only the 
mores of society, but the legal code as well.  "Thou shalt not kill" 
is at once a biblical commandment, an expression of the natural 
law of reason, and a positive or man-made law.  Such integration 
of religion's moral prescriptions with the moral tenets of natural 
and positive law went largely unchallenged until the late 1960s, 
when those who now form America's "new class" became hostile 
to American morality and religion.  
<P>

Today it is no exaggeration to say that America's cultural 
eliteanother description of the "new class"is at war with the 
actual culture.  This was clear during the controversy over the 
NEA-subsidized photography of Robert Mapplethorpe.  
Americans' anger at having their taxes used to create and exhibit 
pornographic and sacreligious art was routinely charac-terized 
by the media, academics and "progressive" politicians as 
censorious in the worst sense of the term.
<P>

The BSA has been targeted by modern liberals precisely 
because it promotes the morality that was offended by 
Mapplethorpethe morality that upholds marriage and sees the 
family as the primary force for the elevation of character and 
thus culture.  Against this the cultural elite touts moral 
neutrality.  As we have seen, though, this "neutrality" is 
deceptive.  It claims to accept every faith and every creed, but 
tolerates no departure from its own relativism.  And to enforce 
its orthodoxy it supports big and intrusive government
especially government's least accountable, nonelected branches, 
the courts and the bureaucracy.
<P>

From the perspective of the cultural elite, then, the central 
problem with the BSA is not its penchant for exclusivity, but who 
the BSA excludes.  Indeed, the elite itself seeks to exclude 
traditional morality and religion from American society.  

<h3>The Role and Significance of the ACLU</h3>

Coercion is the means of choice of the cultural elite.  It seeks 
to seize the legal arsenal of the state and impose on society a set 
of rules and regulations that run contrary to existing mores.  
Whether the issue is speech codes on college campuses, creches 
on public property, racial quotas in the workplace, male-only 
clubs or mother-daughter dinners, the coercive thrust of political 
correctness is evident.  Its motto is not "Inclusiveness or Bust," 
but "Inclusiveness or Else."
<P>

Since the rank-and-file that constitute the American public are 
not, like the elite, alienated from the traditional American 
culturesince, in fact, they are resistant to radical social 
changethe elite must work its will from the top down, using 
the club of the law.  And no one knows better how to swing this 
club than the American Civil Liberties Union. 

<h3>A New Understanding of Liberty</h3>

In 1920, ten years after the BSA was founded, Roger Baldwin 
founded the American Civil Liberties Union.  At one level the 
organizations have something in common: they are private, 
draw heavily on volunteers, and promote freedom.  The 
overarching difference is in their understanding of freedom.  Put 
simply, the ACLU promotes rights without duties and the BSA 
promotes the two together.
<P>

In the traditional view, there is no contradiction between 
rights and duties.  Both are needed in a free society.  As political 
scientist Francis Canavan has written,
The basic American ideal, in a phrase that the 
Supreme Court regularly uses, is "ordered liberty"    . 
. . .  It is a liberty that exists within and depends upon 
an order of law, of social institutions, and ultimately 
on moral principles that are widely enough accepted 
that we can say that they represent society's 
consensus. 
<P>

A new idea held by modern liberals is quite different.  
According to it, liberty connotes "a radical individualism that 
rejects all social norms and institutions that the individual has 
not agreed to."   Subscribers to this idea defend the right of 
Nazis (who themselves despise the idea of rights) to march 
through Skokie, Illinois but not the right of Skokians and their 
elected leaders to maintain order and defend the dignity of the 
principles and customs they hold most dear.  Likewise they 
support the right of homosexuals and atheists to invade and 
destroy the Boy Scouts.

<H3>The ACLU and Statism</H3>

ACLU activists and their supporters seek to restructure 
American society using the law as their weapon.  Their contempt 
for traditional America is not new:  the ACLU was named as a 
Communist front in the 1930s by Earl Browder, the general 
secretary of the Communist Party U.S.A.   Roger Baldwin spoke 
cynically of feigning loyalty to America as he was launching the 
organization:  "We want to get a good lot of flags, talk a good 
deal about the Constitution and what our forefathers wanted to 
make of this country, and to show that we are really the folks 
that really stand for the spirit of our institutions."   The ACLU 
became a vociferous supporter of Stalin's rule in the Soviet 
Union.   There was a period between 1940 and the mid-1960s 
when the ACLU moved to the center.  But today it is as radical as 
ever.
<P>

The most direct and lasting way the ACLU impacts American 
culture and politics is by lodging lawsuits against private 
associations like the Boy Scouts.  How does this work?
America is divided into state and society, or into public and 
private spheres.  As the state grows in power, the authority 
exercised by individuals in society declines.  As the public 
sphere grows, the private sphere shrinks.  We are used to 
thinking about this give-and-take in regard to the economy, but 
it operates as well in other areas.
<P>

Private associations such as the family, schools, churches, 
businesses, service clubs, and political parties and organizations 
stand or mediate in society between the individual and the state.  
They facilitate the workings of the free market and democratic 
politics.  They form character and transmit culture.  American 
government has traditionally supported them, to the extent it has 
not just left them alone.  Tyrannical states like the former Soviet 
Union seek to subvert and/or control them.  
<P>
The autonomy of these associations is as important to a 
country's political freedom as the free market is to a country's 
economic prosperity.  As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 
Democracy in America:  "The morals and intelligence of a 
democratic people would be in as much danger as its commerce 
and industry if ever a government wholly usurped the place of 
private associations."   This is the ultimate stake in the culture 
war against groups like the BSA.
<P>

When the ACLU wins a case against one of these private 
associations in court, it crows about gaining a right for some 
individual.  But at the same time it has transferred power from 
the association, thus from American society or the private 
sphere, to the state.  In some cases, when a legitimate right is 
involved, this is warranted, e.g., when the state removes an 
abused child from the custody of its parents.  But such 
interventions should be the extreme exception to the rule.  If they 
become customary, the state has superceded the family, to the 
great detrimentnot gainof liberty as traditionally 
understood.
<P>

This reduction of traditional liberty, and its replacement with 
modern liberalism's quite new brand of liberty, is the ACLU's 
goal.  For instance, it holds the view (with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton) that minor children should have standing in court to sue 
their parents.  This would open the family to the same kind of 
arbitrary regulation by judges to which businesses are now 
subject under affirmative action lawsin the name, of course, of 
the rights of children.    
<P>

The ACLU is driven by an atomistic vision of liberty.  It 
envisions solitary individuals, armed with rights and unen-
cumbered by duties.  This vision doesn't conform with reality.  
When we look at society we do not see solitary individuals.  
Rather we see constellations of people in associationin 
families, tribes, cities, churches, businesses, clubs, etc.  These 
groups arise naturally when people are left alone.    
This explains the great paradox of the ACLU:  its atomistic 
ideal is so unnatural that its realization (if possible) would 
require a great coercive power.  Thus it is that an organization 
devoted solely to individual rights seeks in practice the total 
aggrandizement of the state.

<h3>The ACLU vs. the Family</H3>

The ACLU and its modern liberal supporters do not consider 
any one type of family to be definitive.  They believe that 
children can be raised equally well in any sort of social 
arrangement.  This relativistic approach to marriage and the 
family explains why they believe that homosexuals should be 
Scoutmasters.
<P>

The ACLU objects to laws which proscribe adultery, 
prostitution (including street solicitation), cohabitation and 
polygamy, as well as homosexual marriages.  Its New Jersey 
affiliate has advanced a definition of the family that is so broad 
that it includes halfway houses for recovering alcoholics and 
drug addicts. 
<P>

In 1986 the ACLU became the first organization in the 
country to endorse the legalization of homosexual marriages.  
Among the other rights and benefits it has sought for 
homosexuals are foster parenthood, employee fringe benefits, 
insurance benefits, income tax benefits, survivorship, and other 
economic benefits that accompany the hospitalization of a 
spouse.  And its labors have born fruit:  in 1989 New York's 
highest court held that two homosexual men who had lived 
together for a decade should be considered a family under New 
York City's rent-control regulations.  
<P>

In addition to suing the BSA, the ACLU has gone after Big 
Brothers, whose central aim is to provide fatherless boys with 
appropriate role models.  Naturally, like the Boy Scouts, Big 
Brothers reasons that homosexuals do not fit that description.  
Columnist William Raspberry, for one, has taken the sane 
view that homosexuals "could very well destroy an organization 
like Big Brothers."  He notes that between 1982 and 1987 five Los 
Angeles-area Big Brothers were convicted of sex offenses 
involving boys to whom they were assigned.  He concludes that 
we should "draw the line at accepting gay couples as foster or 
adoptive parents and in positions in which the function of role 
model is primary." 
<P>

For both the Boy Scouts and Big Brothers, as for most 
Americans, children are best raised by a mother and a father.  
This arrangement is natural, moral, healthy, and holds the 
greatest promise for happiness.  Society has a manifest interest in 
promoting it.  Likewise those groups in society that supply role 
models. 
<P>

Modern liberals disagree.  The ACLU has successfully 
challenged laws, like one in Florida, that barred homosexuals 
from adopting children.  In 1992 it persuaded a Surrogate Court 
judge in New York to approve the adoption of a 6-year-old boy 
by the lesbian partner of the child's natural mother.     
Despite such victories, the Supreme Court ruling in Bowers v. 
Hardwick, the decision that failed to recognize sodomy as a 
constitutional right, buttresses claims that homosexuals may be 
excluded from positions as role models because their sodomite 
behavior renders them morally unfit.  As we will explain below, 
however, the courts are ultimately undependable when it comes 
to defending American morality.  

<h3>The ACLU vs. Religion</h3>

Given its atomistic vision of freedom, the ACLU and its 
supporters see the relationship between freedom and religion 
(especially monotheism, the antithesis of atomism) as essentially 
inimical.  Thus they intentionally misread the First Amendment 
as guaranteeing freedom from religion, rather than what it 
plainly says it guarantees and what so many have come to 
America seeking:  freedom of religion.
<P>
To get a sense of how far the ACLU would go in purging 
from society all public expressions of religion, consider the 
following list (it is not exhaustive) of practices the Union has 
opposed as unconstitutional:
<P>

<ul>
<li>the tax exemption of churches and synagogues
<li>creches and menorahs on public property
<li>the maintenance of chaplains by Congress

<P>
The ACLU's positions on church and state have become so 
unbending that even "strict separationists" like former board 
member and professed atheist Nat Hentoff have been taken 
aback:  "When I was elected to the national board of the 
American Civil Liberties Union some years ago," he wrote, "I 
thought I would be the most anti-clerical kid on that block."  
Three years later he left with a bad taste in his mouth:  "there are 
members of that board . . . who see the separation of church and 
state as so absolute that not a single religious word must be 
allowed to pass a schoolhouse door."   Yet recall:  the ACLU 
customarily defends the most obscene and profane words, in 
schools and everywhere else.
<P>

One of the major reasons given for suing the BSA for 
excluding atheists concerns Boy Scout meetings in public 
schools.  The latter should not be open, opponents say, to 
promoters of religious faith.  The question arises:  Why should 
young atheists and/or Marxists be allowed to meet after school, 
and not young believers in God and country?  
<P>

In 1984 a "Religious Speech Protection Act" was introduced 
in Congress to ensure students the right to voluntarily engage in 
religious speech.  The ACLU opposed it.  Rev. Barry Lynn of its 
Washington Office warned the House Education and Labor 
Committee that the bill would render it "hard to tell the 
classroom from the Sunday school room."   In the end the bill 
gained a majority but fell eleven votes short of the two-thirds 
majority necessary under the special procedure chosen for 
passage.  
<P>

After considerable negotiation an "Equal Access" bill was 
introduced, requiring that if a school permitted one 
noncurricular and student-initiated (i.e., non-school sponsored) 
meeting to occur before or after school, it could not deny other 
student groups the right to hold similar meetings.  It passed the 
Senate by a vote of 88-11, and won in the House by a margin of 
337-77.  The ACLU's Washington office remained warily neutral.  
This wasn't good enough for the national board, which came out 
squarely against the bill.  It was this decision that led Nat 
Hentoff to charge that the ACLU "has become a relentless 
opponent of student religious groups trying to secure their First 
Amendment rights under the Equal Access Act."   
<P>

Wherever there is a nexus, however indirect, between the 
public sector, however broadly defined, and the promotion of 
religion, however broadly defined, the ACLU and its modern 
liberal supporters swing into action.  The state grows more 
intrusive and Americans' natural and constitutional rights fall by 
the wayside.   

<h3>The Legal Case Against the BSA</h3>

"[T]he Boy Scouts are a public accommodation" according to 
ACLU executive director Ira Glasser.   This is the linchpin of the 
case against the BSA.  
<P>

Of course, none of its enemies charge that the BSA receives 
federal or state tax money.  That would appear to make it 
private.  But, they argue, the BSA receives indirect public 
subsidies from the United Way and the public schools, which 
provide free public space for Scout meetings.  (Indeed, public 
schools sponsor 1.1 million Scouts.)  The fine legal question, then, 
is whether every private organization that is allowed to use 
public facilities free of charge is thereby converted into a public 
accommodation and subjected to government regulation and 
control.

<h3>What is a Public Accommodation? </h3>

The most important federal public accommodations act is 
Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It prohibits private entities 
from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion or 
national origin if it can reasonably be shown that such 
establishments function as public accommodations.  This has 
come to mean, essentially, that places like restaurants, hotels, 
movie theaters, and establishments covered by the interstate 
commerce laws cannot discriminate on the basis of race.  
Title II uses the terms "place of public accommodation" and 
"place of entertainment."  According to its legislative history, 
these terms should be interpreted as commonly understood.  
Thus organizations that do not have a physical site are not 
covered.  Boy Scout activities do not depend upon or necessarily 
emanate from particular facilities or locations. Meetings typically 
take place at private homes, schools and churches.  Lacking any 
court finding that suggests that an organization can qualify as a 
"place," the Boy Scouts have not been found to fall within the 
framework of Title II.
<P>

State public accommodation statutes cover more classes of 
persons and, more importantly, define public accommodations 
more broadly.  This is especially true in Californiathe state that 
delivered the ACLU its victory over the Boy Scouts in the case of 
the atheist Randall twinsdue to the uniquely worded Unruh 
Act:
<P>
<blockquote>
All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are 
free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, 
color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled 
to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, 
facilities, privileges, or services in all business 
establishments of every kind whatsoever. 
This was the crux of Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the  Boy 
Scouts of America.  Though the Unruh Act does not mention 
sexual orientation, the California Supreme Court had previously 
interpreted it to prohibit discrimination based upon sexual 
orientation as well as on the categories actually listed. The 
question remaining was whether the BSA constituted a "business 
establishment of [any] kind whatsoever" (a phrase obviously 
much broader than "places of public accom-modation").  The 
trial court ruled that it did not.  The appellate court disagreed 
and reversed.
</blockquote>
<P>

In the preliminary ruling in Curran, Judge Sally Disco 
homilized that to allow the BSA to discriminate against 
homosexuals in the name of "American values" would "send a 
stark message about what the ideals of this country really 
mean."   Nevertheless she ruled against the plaintiff on the 
grounds that the BSA's First Amendment rights took precedence 
over the Unruh Act:  
<P>
<blockquote>
[T]he issue, of course, is not whether the defendant's 
view is correct, or enlightened, or even best 
calculated to achieve the organization's broader 
goals. . . .  The Supreme Court has long recognized a 
right to 'engage in association for the advancement of 
beliefs and ideas.'  The converse, a right not to 
associate, or the right of the group to exclude 
unwanted members, is also recognized. 
</blockquote>
<P>

In overturning Disco's decision, the appellate court acted 
more in accordance with today's judiciary:  it ignored the 
Constitution, relying primarily on a series of cases that had 
interpreted the Unruh Act broadly.  The term "business" meant 
"everything about which one can be employed."  The term 
"establishment" included everything from "fixed locations" to 
"permanent commercial forces or organizations."  And non-
profit organizations had been included.  The BSA was nailed.   
Again:  Outside of California the definition of public 
accommodations is narrower.  In at least four states, courts have 
rejected the idea that membership in an organization in and of 
itself is sufficient to qualify as a "place" for purposes of state 
laws prohibiting discrimination in places of public accom-
modations.  This reasoning was critical in Welsh v. Boy Scouts of 
America. 

<h3>Law and Politics </h3>

The anomaly in the above legal account is the decision of 
Judge Sally Disco:  despite her openly stated opposition to the 
morality of the Boy Scout Oath, she ruled according to the 
Constitution.  It is far more common today for judges to rule 
according to their personal view of what the outcome of a case 
should be.  
<P>

This is no secret.  Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, the 
very model of a modern judge to modern liberals, said the 
following in a major public speech at Georgetown University in 
the fall of 1985:
<P>
<blockquote>
Those who would restrict claims of right to the values 
of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution 
turn a blind eye to social progress . . . .  For the genius 
of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it 
might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but 
in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with 
current problems and needs.  What the constitutional 
fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times 
cannot be their measure to the vision of our time.
</blockquote>
<P>

This reasoning opens the door to that new understanding of 
liberty mentioned above:  not liberty meaning that people are left 
pretty much alone to run their families and their businesses and 
their churches and to participate in other private associations, 
but liberty meaning that government (especially as composed by 
judges and bureaucrats) is left pretty much alone to regulate the 
private sector, according to the politically correct opinion of the 
day.  The converse of this is a new understanding of limited 
government:  not limited government meaning that the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches must stick to the 
powers assigned them in the Constitution, but meaning that the 
American majority must be limited in what it can do by elite 
opinion, operating again through the bureaucracy and the 
courts.  
<P>

Just how far modern liberals have departed from the 
principles of democracy has been pointed out by political 
scientist Thomas G. West:
<P>
<blockquote>
A view of judging that allows justices to consult their 
personal views of "American justice and fairness," in 
complete opposition to the majority, and without 
recurring to the Constitution except as a starting 
point, is nothing more than a return to the state of 
things that existed prior to the emergence of 
democracy in the modern world . . . .  In the medieval 
world, so-called experts unelected by the people
kings, priests, and hereditary aristocratsruled on 
behalf of the majority because the majority could not 
be trusted to rule itself.   
</blockquote>
<P>

Understood in this light, recent attacks on the Boy Scouts 
have little to do with the law and everything to do with politics.  
The same will be true of the outcome of the culture war.  
The battle to defend the Boy Scouts will continue in the 
courts.  But if left on its own there the battle will eventually be 
lost, given the trend in the law schools and among judges to 
dismiss the Constitution and the principle of majority rule.  The 
battle must be won politically if it will be won at all.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h3>Defending the Boy Scouts and America</h3>

Let us recap what is happening:  Powerful groups in America 
are attacking the Boy Scouts of America, primarily because it 
teaches boys to believe in God and to follow a moral code that 
prohibits sodomy.  Strangely, these groups launch this attack in 
the name of rights.  
<P>

These rights aren't the natural rights in the Declaration of 
Independence, which were not open-ended and which clearly 
did not include an unnatural right to sodomy.  Nor are they 
constitutional rights:  As Judge Disco saw with regard to 
homosexuals, and Nat Hentoff with regard to atheists, the 
Constitution is plainly on the side of the Boy Scouts.  In fact, to 
modern liberals, in Justice Brennan's memorable phrase, natural 
rights and constitutional rights are relics of "a world that is dead 
and gone."  The rights in whose name they attack the Boy Scouts 
are new and different.  
<P>

As most Americans are by now aware, modern liberal judges 
have transformed the constitutional and statutory prohibitions 
against unequal protection of the laws based on race into a 
mandate for unequal protection of the laws based on race, i.e., 
affirmative action.  Fewer Americans are yet aware that this 
arbitrary designation of special rights and privileges is now the 
rule rather than the exception in most areas of American life.  
That is, the rights promoted by modern liberals and widely 
enforced by the courts are special rights that attach not equally to 
people as people, but unequally to people as members of special 
groups.

<h3>Does the Majority Have Rights?</h3>

Consider this ironic sidenote:  The ACLU has itself been 
found guilty of violating the very California statute under which 
it sued the Boy Scouts:  In 1987, it was forced to pay damages to 
Richard Long, who was arbitrarily ejected from a public meeting 
of the ACLU when he was identified as an off-duty police 
officer.   The moral is clear:  Because Mr. Long was not a 
member of a special group with special rightswhether 
criminals, atheists, homosexuals, or a racial or ethnic minority
he was judged by these "civil libertarians" to have no rights.
Just as members of the majority like Mr. Long have no rights, 
the majority as a whole is deemed to have no rights under the 
modern liberal dispensation.  It is now customary for judges to 
tell American majorities that they can't do as they wish, whether 
it is putting convicted murderers to death or keeping 
pornography out of their communities or putting their kids in 
organizations which exclude homosexuals and atheists.
The culture war is being waged in the courts because it can 
not be won through elections.  It is anti-majoritarian.  It is a 
powerful elite minority against the large and increasingly 
powerless middle class.

<h3>Does the Majority Rule?</h3>

In the 1980s, ACLU activist and New York University law 
professor Sylvia A. Law succinctly captured the modern liberal 
vision of liberty.  It is regrettable, she wrote, that "the 
public/private distinction persists in constitutional doctrine" 
because in reality "the distinction between public and private is 
not sharp; it may indeed have no coherent meaning."   This is 
perfectly illustrative of what the culture war means politically.  It 
is also hogwash.  
<P>

In the American Constitution the distinction between public 
and private is very sharp and very coherent.  Government is set 
up to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness from threats foreign and domestic.  That the 
government may not become such a threat, it is limited in what it 
can do.  Within those limits, and through the institutions into 
which government is divided, the majority rules.  This 
arrangement provides for an immense private sector which has 
been the key to Americans' unprecedented personal freedom 
and unmatched prosperity for over 200 years.
<P>

It is important to remember that despite recent and even 
future setbacks, American morality and constitutional rights can 
still be defended.  This is true for a very simple reason:  The 
courts can not continue denying the constitutional rights of the 
majority without the support (whether active or passive) of the 
elective branches of government.  The so-called culture war can 
still be won by electing leaders at the local, state and national 
levels who support the traditional family, uphold freedom of 
religion, believe in limited government, and will appoint judges 
who respect majority opinion and the Constitution.
<P>

"If civil liberties are ever destroyed in this country," Midge 
Decter has written, "it won't be by boys taking oaths but rather 
by people intent on stretching the delicate and complex social 
fabric of this free society beyond its breaking point."   The BSA 
is a pawn in the culture war.  But it represents perfectly what 
modern liberals want to destroy and what Americans stand to 
gain, or save, by defending it.  
<P>

As Winston Churchill suggested in our epigraph, the Boy 
Scouts teach boys "to stand up faithfully for Right and Truth, 
however the winds may blow."  That is what Americans are 
called to do now, for the Boy Scouts and for the best in our 
tradition that the Boy Scouts upholdthe right and true laws of 
nature and of nature's God, the charter of our liberty.

<H1>Property and the Public Good: The Founders' View</H1>
<H3>By Thomas G. West </H3>
</center>

<p>
<hr size=4 width=100% align=center>
<blockquote>
<H3>Editor's Note</H3>

<P>
<I>State and local governmental regulations are increasing daily throughout the country.  These regulations often challenge traditional understandings of the institution of private property.  While it is argued that these regulations will defend something identified as in the wider interest of the public, this is not always the result.  Frequently, the property rights of some private person or entity are violated.

<P>
We today tend to look at situations like this as a straightforward contest between the public and the private, between the larger good and the selfish good.  Surely when we all gain something, the interest of only one person ought not to stand in the way.

<P>
This is the common view, but it misses something. It misses the public, as well as the private, purposes for which private property is rightly considered fundamental and unalienable. These purposes resound from the Founding of our country and from the greatest documents in it. 

<P>
In our time, the right of private property is violated in blatant ways and upon a huge scale. Bureaucratic red tape hampers nearly every activity and binds nearly every enterprise.  Officials interfere, and obstacles arise, wherever people seek to use their land productively. The effect of this is to raise costs--for example, the cost of housing--to unprecedented and unaffordable levels in many parts of the country.  

<P>
This does not affect a few people; it affects millions, millions who are not now property owners and who face insuperable obstacles to becoming property owners.  Because of this, we suffer a degradation in the quality of our lives, in our ability to be self-sufficient and therefore self-reliant citizens, in our ability to provide equal opportunity to all our people.  We violate something much more important than efficiency and good economics.  We violate the highest principles of our country.  We do not provide liberty and justice for all.

<P>
The debate over the meaning of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment will continue to miss the point, until it addresses the <I>political</I> importance of the right to property.  The right to private property was central to the founding of America.  The Founders believed that it occupied a vital place in the system of free government they built.  In our time the right to property is widely misunderstood, above all by scholars who do not share the vision of justice that animated the American Constitution.

<P>
Contrary to a common belief, the right to property meant, to the Founders, something better and higher than a protection for established wealth. It was an instrument to defend common people from the power of the establishment.  It was an instrument to protect the security of their own labor and the property it generated.  And above all it was a shield for real merit, wherever it might be found, among the rich or the poor. 

<P>
For anyone familiar with the terms of the colonial debate with Britain during the 1760s and '70s, the omission of property from the Declaration's list of inalienable rights is surprising.  The dispute between Britain and America leading up to the Revolution began with property:  parliament had passed laws "imposing taxes on us without our consent," as the Declaration says.  When the Americans of the founding era listed the rights of man, the usual triad was life, liberty, and property.  Boston's <I>Rights of the Colonists</I> (1772) was typical:  Among the natural rights of the colonists are these:  First, a right to <I>life</I>; secondly to <I>liberty</I>; thirdly to <I>property</I>.1

<P>
We can only guess at Jefferson's and the Congress's silence on the right to property.  Jefferson may have thought that the dignity of the occasion was best served by omitting the low subject of money in the new nation's statement of principle, leaving it implicit in the right to liberty.

<P>
One common misconception can be dismissed easily.  Jefferson did not omit the right to property from the Declaration because he regarded it as less than a fundamental right, as some have said.2  Jefferson was a firm adherent of that right, which he regarded as a part of the right to liberty.  In 1774 he wrote:

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own.  The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time:  the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.3</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Jefferson held this view throughout his life. Forty-two years later he wrote:  

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.4</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Today the subject of property rights makes people wary about the founding.  Protecting property, it might seem, amounts to protecting the right of the wealthy to domineer over the poor.  Does the Founders' view of equality end up cementing in place an invidious class structure?

<P>
On the contrary, the Founders thought the right to property, properly defined, was a <I>protection</I> to the poor.  To be sure, the right protects anyone who already has wealth.  But equally important, in their view, is the protection of the right to <I>acquire</I> property.  The right to property means that those who have no wealth as yet may keep the property they earn.  The Virginia Declaration of Rights names, among the rights of all human beings, "the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property...."

<P>
In the Founders' world, the laws of old Europe, and to some extent even American law, favored established wealth and made it difficult for the poor to become wealthy by their own effort.  Talent and ambition everywhere had to defer to family and arbitrary privilege.

<P>
Under colonial law, the property rights of the wealthy were superior to those of the poor.  "The older claimant's usage [of his land] would be elevated to the level of a property right and a more recent claimant would have to use his land so as not to interfere with the older right."5  Ownership of property "conferred on an owner the power to prevent any use of his neighbor's property that conflicted with his own quiet enjoyment."  This right of established property could be and actually was sometimes used to prevent development of land adjacent to a wealthy man's land.  

<P>
By the nineteenth century it had become clear that, "because this conception of ownership necessarily circumscribed the right of others to develop their land," it was inappropriate to American society and a violation of the rights of the poor.  The older conception of property derived from medieval times, when the law protected the English gentry from competition from upstart artisans and manufacturers.  Feudal law treated existing property relations as rightful and permanent.  The rich were supposed to stay rich, and the poor to stay poor.  Therefore "the anti-developmental doctrines of the [old] common law ...clashed with the spirit of economic improvement."  In the years following the Revolution, "the idea of property underwent a fundamental transformation--from a static agrarian conception entitling an owner to undisturbed enjoyment, to a dynamic, instrumental, and more abstract view of property that emphasized the newly paramount virtues of productive use and development."6

<P>
Under the old common law, for example, it was difficult to build a dam or mill on any public river.  A mill owner could be sued for damages if he obstructed the flow of water, even temporarily, in the operation of the mill.  That rule began to change in the early 1800s.  One judge who held in favor of a mill owner observed that the old common law maxim--"use your own property in such a way that you do not injure another's"--"must be taken and construed with an eye to the natural rights of all."7  He meant the natural right, as stated in the Virginia Bill of Rights, of "<I>acquiring</I>...property."

<P>
Eventually the Founders achieved their goal.  Established wealth that was passed on from one generation of the same family to another gradually disappeared in America.  Money and positions circulated rapidly, as the efforts and luck of each succeeding generation determined their place in society.  Children of the poor frequently rose to wealth, and children of the wealthy often fell back into the mass of those neither rich nor poor.  Irish and Italian, Jewish and Oriental immigrants, who arrived without money or status, and who were often disliked by Americans already living here, produced children and grandchildren whose wealth now surpasses the average wealth of Anglo-Saxon protestants.  Unlike old Europe, the American rich and poor did not develop "class consciousness."  Historically, the poor and middle class have not looked on the rich with destructive envy, but with the confidence that one day they themselves or their children may also be wealthy.

<P>
The trend of twentieth-century law has been toward a return to the feudal approach.  Those who are already well off often support government regulation that makes it difficult for the poor to develop their properties.  Environmental regulation, for example, is often used by existing homeowners to establish barriers to the building of new houses, in order to limit the traffic and pollution that come from new residents.  Government licensing requirements protect those who already own taxicabs from competition from those who would like to drive cabs but cannot afford the medallions.  Zoning laws typically forbid the poor (who cannot afford to buy buildings in commercial areas) from using their apartments and homes for productive purposes.  Big business often opposed President Reagan's deregulation efforts in the 1980s because regulation hobbles would-be competitors.  The latter cannot afford the expensive lawyers and lobbyists that enable long-established businesses to shape regulation to their interests or otherwise survive in the regulatory environment.8

<P>
The danger in such developments is not primarily that the poor remain poor.  Poverty is a condition that people can live with.  A decent and happy existence does not require great wealth.  The greater danger by far is the threat to liberty itself.  Tocqueville anticipated this danger: 

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>[The despotic government of the future] covers the whole of social life with a network of petty, complicated rules that are both minute and uniform....  It does not break men's will, but softens, bends, and guides it; it seldom enjoins, but often inhibits action; it does not destroy anything, but prevents much being born; it is not at all tyrannical, but it hinders, restrains, enervates, stifles, and stultifies so much that in the end each nation is no more than a flock of timid and hard-working animals with the government as its shepherd.9</I></blockquote>

<P>
The protection of the right to acquire property was but one aspect of a larger American purpose:  to make honors correspond as closely as possible to real natural differences among human beings.  Just as the fighter with a chin prevails, and should prevail, in boxing, so those of real merit and ability would face no legal obstacle to thriving in a country that protects the rights of individuals.  Far from lowering the standards of public life, freedom allows true merit to shine.  In the old world, merit too often remained sunk in the obscurity of the low origin of its possessor.<BR><BR><BR>

<H2>The Politics of Dependence</H2>

<P>
To understand the Founders' view of property rights and the rights of mankind generally, consider in contrast a common view of today, according to which human rights are no longer based on human nature.  Franklin Roosevelt called for a "Second Bill of Rights," which included "the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation," "the right of every family to a decent home," "the right to adequate medical care," "the right to a good education," etc.10  For Roosevelt, this call may have been somewhat rhetorical.  His legislative program, at any rate, made no serious attempt to implement such "rights."  More recently, however, Laurence Tribe, a leading liberal constitutional law theorist, plausibly suggests that current legal developments point toward "a constitutional right to a decent level of affirmative governmental protection in...health and housing, work and schooling."11

<P>
Jennifer Nedelsky, a recent scholar who is frank enough to be an explicit critic of the Founders, would replace the natural rights of Madison and the Founders with "human autonomy," which in her understanding not only accepts but fosters dependency on government.  Nedelsky argues, persuasively, that constitutional scholars have been unwilling to face the fact that the new view of rights requires the abandonment of the natural rights theory of the Founders:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The egalitarian vision [of today's liberals] is practically a reversal of this founding conception:  whether the inequality of property is the result of liberty or not, it stands in the way of liberty and justice for all.  </I></blockquote>

<P>
For only the abolition of inequality by forcible redistribution of property can achieve this vision of justice:

<blockquote><P>
<I>[D]ependence is no longer the antithesis of autonomy, but a precondition in the relationships...which provide the security, education, nurturing, and support that make the development of autonomy possible.12</I></blockquote>

<P>
What Nedelsky means is brought out in <I>Harris v. McRae</I>, a Supreme Court case dealing with the right to abortion.  In that decision the Court ruled that the government was not constitutionally obliged to pay for free abortions.  The dissenters from that decision asked, What good is such a right for a poor woman who cannot afford to pay for an abortion?  Justice Brennan wrote:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The Hyde Amendment's denial of public funds for medically necessary abortions plainly intrudes upon this constitutionally protected decision, for both by design and in effect it serves to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children that they would otherwise elect not to have.</I></blockquote>

<P>
Thurgood Marshall's dissent agreed:

<blockquote><P>
<I>If...a funded abortion is unavailable, [poor women] must resort to back-alley butchers, attempt to induce an abortion themselves by crude and dangerous methods, or suffer the serious medical consequences of attempting to carry the fetus to term....  [L]egal abortion is not a significant option for such women.13</I></blockquote>

<P>
In other words, if government fails to fund a right, one cannot be said to have the right.  Extending the argument beyond abortion, it might be asked:  how can one be said to have a right to life if one is too poor to afford a doctor?  What good is a right to pursue happiness without government-funded education from kindergarten to post-graduate work?  How can one pursue happiness if one prefers not to work and ends up poor?  This way of thinking about rights culminates, as Nedelsky openly admits, in the demand for a redistribution of wealth so that all possess sufficient property to secure their "autonomy."  In this view, the only way human rights can be secured is by socialism, or at least by the constant seizure of wealth from those who produce it.  Had the Brennan-Marshall view prevailed on the Court, it would have become unconstitutional in principle to cut back on any aspect of the welfare state.  In fact, it would have given the Supreme Court the constitutional authority to mandate indefinite expansion of government programs redistributing the entire wealth of the nation.

<P>
The Supreme Court majority in the Harris decision, says Nedelsky, understood that if there are basic rights that can be enjoyed only with state economic support, we have prepared the way for unlimited incursions on property.14 If every person has a right to plenty, whether he works or not, then necessarily those who work must support those who do not. 

<P>
Nedelsky regrets that the Court failed to repudiate what she calls the "negative liberty" of the Founders.  The Court actually came within one vote of doing so in this case.

<P>
In the new conception of rights, liberty requires much more--and much less--than protection against being injured by others. It requires affirmative action, positive aid from those who have wealth to those who do not.  At the extreme, one scholar claims a global human right to subsistence and basic material needs, which wealthy nations ought to pay for.15  John Rawls has given a sophisticated argument in support of the position that those in need have a moral right to some of the possessions of those who are well off.16  

<P>
On the basis of Rawlsian ideology, today's courts routinely force businesses and governments to pay injured individuals even when they are not responsible for the injury.  In one typical example, a small business was held legally liable for the injury suffered by a car thief, when he smashed up the car he had stolen in an accident that admittedly resulted from his own negligence.  These developments in the law have arisen from the courts' rejection of the individual moral responsibility on which the older understanding of rights rests.17

<P>
In this new view, rights are no longer derived from human nature.  Instead, a new ideal of human autonomy, in which man is liberated from the restraints and guidance of nature, holds sway.  This human autonomy, far from being something that human beings possess by nature, can only be secured on the basis of the conquest of nature by human will.  Rights do not come from man's natural gifts.  They come from an assessment of the current state of society, with a view to maximizing each person's liberation from natural limits.  Rights come from an ideal of human autonomy created by the human will.  The realization of that ideal requires that those who have intelligence, ambition, sobriety, wealth, education, etc., be compelled to support those who do not have the same talents or fortunes.  Rights derive not from what one has in common with other human beings (the same human nature), but from what makes oneself inferior to others--"victimization."

<P>
The rights of human nature, as the Founders saw it, are based on what man is and has by nature--his life, his liberty, and his ability to acquire property and pursue happiness.  For the Founders, a "right to decent housing"--let alone a "right to recreation"--would be nearly unintelligible.  A natural right, to repeat, is a just claim against someone who would deprive a person of <I>what is naturally his own</I>.  No one possesses by nature food, learning, and free access to medical care.  No one possesses by nature the kind of autonomy demanded by Nedelsky.  The lack of such things does not create a rightful claim against others to provide them with food, medicine, free education, or "autonomy."  It does nothing more than leave each person free to provide such needs for himself.  But one <I>is</I> obliged by nature to leave other people alone in their reasonable pursuit of health, education, and property.

<P>
The presumption of the Founders is that normal human beings are capable of taking care of themselves, if only the artificial weight of hereditary privilege and legal restrictions--the legacy of medieval times--is removed.  "The political philosophy behind limited government affirms that nature is more important than nurture:  that humans have a fixed nature enabling them to overcome a background of poverty and deprivation."18

<P>
Just as people have the <I>nature</I> to provide for their own well-being, so they also face the <I>necessity</I> of making <I>themselves</I> good. The Declaration says we have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It does not say we have a right to happiness.  Unlike life and liberty, happiness is not something we possess by nature.  We cannot claim it as a right whenever we are miserable.  Likewise, there is a right to acquire and possess property, but no right to be wealthy.  Everyone has the capacity to <I>acquire</I> wealth and <I>pursue</I> happiness, just as everyone has the capacity to live, be free, and worship God.  To possess a right, even to exercise it, does not guarantee that it will lead to the end desired.  Happiness is earned by talent and effort, or enjoyed unbought through grace or good fortune.

<P>
All human beings by nature do possess life, liberty, the ability to pursue happiness, the ability to acquire property, and a mind that forms opinions by reason and conviction.  These natural possessions, the "property" we all own by nature, are the principal rights of man.  Madison, writing several years later about property, said:

<blockquote><P>
<I>In its larger and juster meaning, it [property] embraces everything to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and which leaves to everyone else the like advantage....

<P>
In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them. 

<P>
He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them. 

<P>
He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them. 

<P>
In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.19</I></blockquote><BR><BR>

<H2>A Return to True Human Rights</H2>

<P>
We conclude that contemporary legal and intellectual trends
<OL>
<LI>Restrict the right to property in such a way as to prevent the poor from developing their property so as to acquire more property; and 
<LI>Treat the poor as unable to acquire wealth by their own efforts, as victims.</OL>

<P>
These two trends reinforce each other.  When we place obstacles in front of the ambitious poor, the claim that the poor are a permanent underclass becomes more plausible.  When we teach young poor people that the cause of their poverty is victimization, not absence of responsibility and work or laws that limit acquisition by the poor, we discourage the effort that it would take to overcome that poverty.

<P>
The changes we have discussed here have real consequences.  The lives of a generation of children have been blighted, and a new generation is growing up in some places in America without even the memory of the older vision of a society based on real equality of opportunity.  Consider this bitter letter responding to a newspaper article on crime committed against children in Detroit:

<blockquote><P>
<I>Detroit's children who are being victimized by crime (page one, Dec. 12) suffer from a lack of moral courage in their parents and leaders. These children are taught that their economic situations are imposed on them from the outside.  If they do not succeed in school, something is wrong with the system.  If they have difficulty getting employment, racism is involved.  If there are no jobs available at the minimum wage, dealing drugs is an acceptable alternative.  Furthermore, they are taught that if there are any solutions to their problems, they will come from city, state, or federal programs.

<P>
The tragedy in Detroit is not just that so many children are being killed and maimed by guns.  The tragedy is that these children are not being allowed to grow up into responsible adults.  Most of them will indeed grow up physically, but they will forever be looking to others as their caretakers.  They will continue to behave as if they have no personal responsibility for the choices they make in their lives, and the cycle of violence and urban decay will continue.

<P>
My family and I moved away from the Detroit area four months ago.  We are happy and relieved to be gone.20</I></blockquote>

<P>
There are remedies for this situation.  Laws that stand in the way of the exercise of the right to acquire property must be removed.  In some cases those laws are unconstitutional violations of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Supreme Court can say so.  Above all we must teach ourselves once again the lessons we have forgotten. Protecting what is private, what properly is earned by each citizen with the sweat of his own labor, is not selfishness.  It is justice. And from that justice flows a capacity for self-government that makes freedom itself possible. That is the true basis of American democracy. 

<P>
The purpose of that democracy is not wealth.  It is, as the Declaration says, happiness.  We understand happiness to mean, for most practical purposes, the decent way of life lived by the majority of Americans throughout our history.  Family, work, neighborhood, responsibility, excellence--these things are rightly prized by most citizens.  It is government's job to enable citizens to achieve them, in part simply by getting out of the way. 

<P>
Every nation--even the Soviet Union at its peak--has laws that protect the right to hold property, at least for some people. The American Constitution is unique, in that it gives that right to <I>everyone equally</I>.  Above all, the Constitution secures the right to develop and use one's property in order to acquire wealth, without having to beg permission of the established rich or of government bureaucrats.  The new system in America, with its excessive and burdensome regulations, harks back to older and darker days. It locks in place an aristocracy of existing wealth. It builds the natural counterpart of the privileged few--the despairing underclass.

   <H1>About Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership</H1>

</center>

This is to introduce readers to Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, a new project of 
the Claremont Institute.  The project is headed by Dr. Tim Wheeler, a practicing 
physician (a head and neck specialist) in southern California.  The following will 
explain who we are, why we have launched this project, and what we aim to 
accomplish.  

<H3>The Problem</H3>

The right of Americans "to keep and bear arms" guaranteed in the Second Amendment 
is under attacknow more so than ever before in our nation's history.  In any given 
year, one can expect dozens of bills to be presented in Congress, and hundreds more in 
state capitols around the nation.  All have one thing in common: further restrictionsin 
some cases proposing an outright banon the private ownership of firearms.

<P>

One of the most persuasive tactics employed by the gun controllers is the argument that 
guns present a threat to public health.  Accordingly, firearms are increasingly discussed 
by some in the medical community in terms of epidemiology.  Medical journals now 
routinely discuss firearms as if they were a type of dangerous bacteria.

<P>

Because these arguments originate with physicians and appear in respected journals, the 
media pass along their claims as undisputed facts.  They have become as well a central 
part of the strategies used by the ACLU and other anti-Second Amendment activists.  
But these arguments are contrary to the truth:  The idea that firearms are a disease to be 
discussed in pathogenic terms defies common sense.  The truth is that privately-owned 
firearms prevent more crimes and injuries than they cause, and are far more likely to 
serve the public interest than not.  

<H3>The Solution</H3>

Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownershipa group of physicians, familiar with the use 
of medical statistics and quantitative analysishas been formed to serve as an antidote 
to those who are twisting science to serve misguided ideological ends.  It will turn the 
tables on those who would control crime by managing the lives of honest citizens, 
directing attention instead to the means of crime control that is suited to a free people:  
that is to say, controlling crime by controlling (i.e. incarcerating) criminals.  

<P>

DRGO in now mounting a full-fledged assault on the poor medical scholarshipand 
the anti-gun bias behind itthat dominates the medical debate on gun ownership.  We 
have already made some headway in this project, most notably in well publicized 
testimony before Senator Howard Metzenbaum and the Senate Judiciary Committee last 
year (enclosed).  We are proceeding with policy briefings, amicus curiae briefs, and 
speaking engagements around the country.  

<P>

A word about organization and personnel:  DRGO is a project of the Claremont Institute 
for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy, a political research 
organization located in Claremont, California.  Dr. Wheeler serves as project director, 
with the help of board of advisors (most of whom are physicians) who oversee its work.  
Dr. Wheeler and the members of the board do the bulk of the writing and speaking; the 
Claremont Institute staff handles fundraising, and the publication, distribution, and 
promotion of our work.  Daniel Palm, Ph.D., a Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, 
serves as Project Coordinator.

<H3>DRGO Needs Your Support</H3>

DRGO has so far accomplished much good with the generosity of a handful of 
supporters.  But it is time to expand our work, and the only way we can do so is with 
support from our members.  We have become a nationwide organization with nascent 
influenceand now is the time for action.  Membership rates are as follows:  $100 
Sustaining membership, $500 Patron, and $1000 Presidents Club.  Please make your 
check payable to The Claremont Institute, noting that the contribution is to support 
DRGO.  The Claremont Institute is a 501 (c)(3) charitable organization, and all 
contributions to it are tax-deductible.  Contributors will receive all DRGO policy papers, 
fact sheets, amicus curiae briefs, copies of press clippings, and regular updates on 
activities.

<center><H2>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the <br>Box Office in 1995</H2>
<H3>Some see sleaze doesn't sell' trend</H3>
by Joyce Price, <i>The Washington Times</i></center>
<p>
Seven of the 10 top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, PG or PG-13, indicating they were family oriented.
<p>
"For half [or more] of the films [that grossed the most sales] to qualify 
for more general audiences is pretty encouraging, said James Wall, editor 
of the Christian Century, a historic mainline Protestant journal.
<p>
"The box-office results are a good indication that audiences are looking 
for more peaceful experiences in the theater and that they respond to 
worthwhile films," added Mr. Wall, who has testified on movie content at 
congressional hearings.
<p>
Only three films near the bottom of the top 10 were rated R, meaning 
children under 17 had to be accompanied by an adult to see those 
pictures.
<p>
No films with the NC-17 rating, meaning children under 17 are not 
admitted, were among the top 10 this year, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., a California entertainment research organization that 
tracks such information.
<p>
"This shows that, for now at least, sleaze doesn't sell and that, over time, 
the movie industry is moving toward general audiences, said Doug 
Besharov, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
<p>
Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and co-host of 
"Sneak Previews," which airs on 244 Public Broadcasting Service 
stations nationwide, put it this way: "Sixty percent of all movies that are 
released are Rated, yet only 30 percent of films in the top 10 and zero 
percent in the top six are R-rated . . . Samuel Goldwyn once said it's 
better to sell four tickets than two. That's common sense that the movie 
industry" is just now beginning to recognize.
<p>
Mr. Medved said the latest top 10 offers more evidence that a PG-13 is 
an easier rating to sell tickets on than R."
<p>
PG-13 means special guidance is cautioned because material may be 
inappropriate for ages 13 and under; PG means parental guidance is 
suggested; and G, for general audience, means all ages are admitted.
<p>
Jack J. Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, 
argues that movie grosses in 1995 rose or fell on the basis of a film's 
"entertainment value, not its rating and whether it was or was not a 
family film.
<p>
He said there was no shortage of family films produced this year, but 
there was a "shortage of family audiences." He noted there were "10 to 12 
family films released this year that failed miserably at the box office."
<p>
One of those, he said, was "The Little Princess," which he described as a 
"wonderful, tremendous film" that few went to see. "The Little Princess" 
is about a young girl whose father, a distinguished British gentleman, 
goes off to battle in World War I. The child is enrolled in a private girls' 
academy in New York, where she suffers mistreatment by an abusive 
headmistress.
<P>
"The kind of films people claim they want in the marketplace, they don't 
patronize . . . this constant reference to wanting family films is 
hypocrisy," Mr. Valenti said in an interview.
<P>
The NC-17-rated film "Showgirls" was a box-office flop not because of 
its nudity and sex, Mr. Valenti said, but because it was a "mediocre film 
to begin with" and "the word got out it wasn't a very good movie." 
"Showgirls" depicted the struggles of an ex-prostitute who becomes a Las 
Vegas lap dancer and aspires to be a highly paid stripper.
<P>
Not everyone concerned about the content and quality of movie fare sees 
cause to celebrate this year's list of the biggest grossers.
<P>
Said Ted Baehr, chairman of the Atlanta-based Christian Film and 
Television Commission; which each year makes a thorough analysis of 
hundreds of films in a report to Hollywood":
<P>
"Last year, 60 percent of the top 10 grossing films met our moral criteria. 
This year, it will be 40 percent with the list as it now exists. In other 
words, we've slipped . . . it's been a lousy year for movies."
<P>
Movies in last year's top 10 included The Lion King, rated G, and 
"Forrest Gump," rated PG-13, which both have grossed more than $310 
million. Batman Forever, this year's biggest box office smash, has 
grossed $184 million to date.
<P>
Mr. Baehr said Hollywood was clearly aiming at children" when it 
produced films such as "Batman Forever," "Ace Ventura: When Nature 
Calls" (No. 5) and "Casper" (No. 6). But he does not view those pictures 
as true family entertainment and describes "Ace, "Casper, and 
"Waterworld" (No. 9) as "irresponsible."
<P>
Of Jim Carrey's latest "Ace Ventura detective comedy, Mr. Baehr said: 
We do not consider it to be a moral movie. It's racist and 
promasturbation, pro-sex and probuggery."
<P>
In Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, Mr. Carrey goes to Africa in 
search of a great white bat. There he encounters a tribe whose members 
spit or release other bodily fluids on people to show their appreciation.
<P>
"It's clear Hollywood knows it has to broaden" its horizons and make 
more films that will attract youngsters, he said. But many of these films 
feature "covert immorality" and take "philosophical positions most 
conservatives cant accept."
<P>
Mr. Baehr charged that the movie industry is "cutting back on [true] 
family films."
<P>
If they make this a trend, they can anticipate a drop in attendance, he 
said. He added this is already being reflected in the smaller revenues that 
have been generated by this year's top 10 compared with last year's.
<P>
"People want films you can take the family to, Mr. Baehr said.
<P>
Mr. Valenti denied there is a conspiracy afoot in the movie industry, as 
Mr. Baehr suggests. "Eighty to 85 percent of all films made in Hollywood 
are put together by independent producers, who are fiercely competitive, 
he said.
<P>
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., agreed. "These 
things go in cycles. Certainly, there is no premeditated plan to make a lot 
of kids pictures, he said.
<P>
As for the films that grossed the most this year, he said, "I don't think 
you'd call 'Batman Forever' a family picture. And 'Ace Ventura' is a little 
gross. There are some questionable scenes."
<P>
Mr. Wall offered this assessment of Batman Forever": "It's a rather dark 
film, but I don't object to it very strongly. 'Apollo 13' [No. 2] was well 
done, one of the finest inspirational films for people of all ages."
<P>
Those interviewed had little enthusiasm for the movie Pocahantas. Mr. 
Wall called it "adequate," while Mr. Baehr labeled it New Age" and 
"annoying."
<P>
Mr. Medved said he "didn't like the film's political correctness."

<blockquote>
<P>
(Washington D.C., October 30, 1996) -- Empower America's Chief Economist, Lawrence A. 
Hunter released the following statement on the state of the American economy in response to 
today's report on third-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP):
<P>
"Is the economy better off today than it was four years ago?  Clearly not.  Today, the Commerce 
Department reported that the economy was growing at a paltry 2.2 percent annual rate in the 
third quarter after correcting for inflation.  Four years ago at this time, the economy was growing 
at a respectable 3 percent.  And, in the fourth quarter of 1992, real, inflation-adjusted economic 
growth leapt forward at 4.3 percent.  One must look long and hard for any economist who 
expects the economy to grow faster than 2.5 percent in the upcoming fourth quarter.
<P>
"This pessimistic assessment of the economy is reinforced by a report on declining wages issued 
earlier this week by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC).  The JEC report, which 
is based on a release of data by the nonpartisan Bureau of Labor Statistic (BLS), points out that 
inflation-adjusted ("real") median weekly earnings declined between the third quarters of 1995 
and 1996.  The current level of real median weekly earnings is below their level four years ago of 
$493 in the third quarter of 1992.
<P>
"Best economy in 30 years?  Hardly.  The truth is, we are experiencing the slowest economic 
expansion in more than 100 years."
<P>

<center><h2>Empower America's Chief Economist Warns,</h2>
<h3>Todays' GDP Numbers are a "Statistical Blip"</h3></center><p>
(Washington D.C., August 1, 1996) -- We shouldn't pop the corks on the champagne quite yet over today's reported 4.2 percent second quarter increase in GDP.  The fizz will quickly go out of these numbers as American workers realize that they do not mean an end to the treadmill economy we have been experiencing since the end of the 1980's<p>
<i>Empower America's</i> Chief Economist Lawrence Hunter said, "The American people, to whom GDP statistics are a mere abstraction, will take little solace in this report because this statistical blip in the GDP numbers is not translating into rising real wages.  During the same time period covered by this GDP report, second quarter 1996, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that usual weekly earnings of workers are at their lowest level in three years."<p>
Even before today's report was made public, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, made it clear that the expected strong second quarter report was an aberration, both by his words and by the Fed's deeds.  Greenspan said he fully expected economic growth to fall back to its more typical anemic norm of  two-something expansion in the second half of the year.  Confirmation that the Fed does not take the second quarter blip seriously comes from the fact that it has refrained from raising interest rates as one would expect if the central bank were taking this aberrant report as indicative that the economy was anywhere near this strong.<p>
"Today's report also is consistent with the expectation that this preliminary 4.2 percent increase may well be revised downward in the months to come.  First quarter GDP, which originally was reported to have increased 2.8 percent, was revised downward by almost one third in today's report, to 2.0 percent," Hunter said.<p>

<center><h2>BENNETT CRITICIZES McCURRY<br> 
AND WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY </center></h2>

<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p><i>July 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.</i><p>
  Today, Empower America co-director and former Bush "drug czar" William J. Bennett released the following statement:
<p>
"Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service agents (released by a House committee) that background investigations on White House employees found that more than 40 had used drugs; a few dozen showed drug usage had been within the last five years; and that among those few dozen people were individuals who had used cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens.  We learned, too, that the Secret Service initially rejected White House passes to an unspecified number of White House employees because they were considered a security risk -- a recommendation which apparently was unacceptable to the Clinton administration.  Instead, the administration opted for a far more lenient policy -- a twice-per-year surprise drug test.  These are very disturbing revelations -- but ones which do not seem to trouble the Clinton administration at all.
<p>
I have also read the transcripts of Mike McCurry's July 17th press briefing in which he stated that "of course" he used illegal drugs during the 1970s.  What exactly did Mr. McCurry mean by "of course"?  That every young person used drugs in the 1970s?  Or that it was no big deal?  Why didn't Mr. McCurry show any regret for having used illegal drugs?  Mr. McCurry is wrong on all counts -- and he should admit that he was wrong.        
<p>
These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined with Mr. McCurry's comments are, I think, emblematic of the Clinton administration's cavalier and indifferent attitude toward illegal drug use.  The Clinton administration doesn't seem to care about this issue.  They seem unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  And this nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's indifference, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.      
<p>
Mr. McCurry's comments are of course not helpful.  But neither are they surprising.  After all, President Clinton's record on fighting illegal drug use is abysmal.  It is worth pointing out that this is not a partisan opinion.  Democratic Senator Joe Biden has been a strong critic of the administration's anti-drug efforts.  And it was Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel who said this about the Clinton administration:  "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."
<p>
Consider the record under Bill Clinton's watch: drug use among high school seniors has risen steadily since he took office.  The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled.  Methamphetamine emergency room cases are up over 300 percent.  LSD use has reached the highest rate since record-keeping started in 1975.  Drug-related emergency room admissions are at record levels.  And these trends have occurred after real progress was made against drug use in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.    
<p>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.  The Clinton administration suffers from moral diffidence on this issue.  Policy follows attitude.  In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but he said, "I didn't like it.  I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."  
<p>
Then there is President Clinton's former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who had been one of this administration's most vocal voices on drugs and who had favorable words about drug legalization.  And of course now we have Mr. McCurry's comments. 
<p>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale" or an attitude of "of course I used illegal drugs."
<p>
I realize that Mr. McCurry, a skilled press secretary, was simply reflecting the attitude of the President and his administration.  But I would be interested in the answer to two questions:  first, what does General Barry McCaffrey think about Mr. McCurry's comments and the underlying attitude they expressed?  And second, does President Clinton have any objection if a person who has used cocaine, crack cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs during the past five years is working in his administration?  Is there any kind of recent (pre-White House) drug use or drug activity that would disqualify somebody from joining the Clinton administration?  Perhaps the president could clarify what his policy is on these matters.       

<p>
On the issue of fighting illegal drugs -- like so many other issues of national importance -- the American people deserve better from their president."

<i>May 6, 1996, Washington, D.C. </i>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, Empower America Co-Directors William J. Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber today officially announced the appointment of Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Weisel has served as acting Chairman since the Fall of 1995. 
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman, and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, one of the nation's leading securities firms.  Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery's annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million.  Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and served in the past as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. Ski Team.
<p>
Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream."  Kemp went on, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works.  He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success.  His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
William Bennett said, "Thom Weisel is wonderfully accomplished in a whole range of pursuits.  His tenure with us has brought needed stability and energy to Empower America."  
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice.  Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited Making Government Work: A Conservative Agenda for the States, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977.  In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.  
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick, and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo -- an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense, and time-honored values.  He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics.  We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Former Empower America Board Chairman Steve Forbes will remain an active member of the Board.  Forbes said of Empower America's new leadership, "I am glad to see Empower America in the capable hands of Thom Weisel and Tex Lezar.  I look forward to working closely with both of them as an Empower America Board member."  William Dal Col, Empower America's former president, will be working with Forbes while continuing informally to advise Empower America. 
<p>
Under the leadership of Weisel and Lezar, as well as the Co-Directors, Empower America plans a very aggressive, focused policy agenda for the remainder of 1996.  
<p>
<UL>
<LI>On the economic front, Empower America will expand its efforts to promote a dynamic, pro-growth, pro-family, single-rate tax system based on the recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which Jack Kemp chaired for Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich.  Additionally, Empower America will promote a plan gradually and responsibly to privatize our Social Security system, while honoring our obligation to those who have paid into the system and must be protected. <p>
<LI>Empower America is strongly supporting an urban renaissance agenda focusing on legislation proposed by members of Congress such as Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Mack of Florida, Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington D.C.<p>
<LI>Empower America will continue to make the broader argument for the need to restore decency and civility to American life.  It will continue its ongoing campaign in the area of popular culture, including the content of television and music.  It will also continue to address the issues of crime, drugs, educational choice, and adoption.  In addition, Empower America will begin systematically to address issues dealing with judicial activism and legal reform.
<p>
<LI>In international affairs, Empower America will continue its advocacy of an American foreign policy based on U.S. national interests and which reflects the need for the U.S. to exercise effective and prudent international leadership.  The support for the expansion and consolidation of new democracies, the restoration of an honest and sound money policy for America and the world, and furtherance of free- and open- global trade arrangements are of principal concern.  Empower America supports a strong national security posture and the development and deployment of a national missile defense system.

<center><h3>EMPOWER AMERICA'S WILLIAM BENNETT AND JACK KEMP
&quot;CORRECT THE RECORD&quot; WITH NEW STUDY ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION</h3></center>

<center><h4><i>Kemp and Bennett call assertions made in the GOP Presidential 
primarie regarding the impact of legal immigration &quot;naive, 
short-sighted, and now -- factually incorrect.&quot;</i></center></h4>
<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>

(Washington, DC; February 28, 1996)  Empower America co-directors William J. 
Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study today which refutes many recent 
assertions against legal immigration policy in America.  The study comes as 
immigration is becoming an increasingly contentious issue in the race for the 
GOP presidential nomination.  Bennett and Kemp said, &quot;Certainly we must put 
an end to illegal immigration.  But that message cannot be mixed up with our 
view toward legal immigration, which has been, and continues to be, a net gain 
<tt></tt>for America.&quot;<p>

Through research conducted over a period of many months, visits to high 
technology companies, background interviews with government officials, and 
never before presented data, researcher Stuart Anderson has found, &quot;The entry of 
foreign-born engineers, scientists, and other highly skilled individuals provides 
extraordinary benefits to the United States and should be facilitated, rather than 
indered, by new restrictions.&quot;<p>

The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering legislation by Senator Alan 
Simpson (R-WY) to sharply restrict American companies' ability to hire foreign-
born skilled employees.  Moreover, in March, the U.S. House of Representatives 
will vote on the largest reduction in legal immigration in nearly 70 years.  Said 
Bennett and Kemp, &quot;The study gives evidence that both measures are ill-
conceived and ultimately counterproductive.&quot;<p>


Among the study's key findings:
<ul>
<li>	There is no evidence that foreign-born scientists and engineers increase 
unemployment or undercut the wages of the native-born.<p>

<li>	There is no evidence that employment-based immigration weakens 
companies' commitment to U.S. education or to training for their workforce.  
American companies annually donate $2.5 billion to schools and colleges, and 
spend $210 billion annually on workforce training.<p>

<li>	Key employees and even founders of high tech companies enter the country 
as refugees and family-sponsored immigrants, as well as employment-based 
immigrants.<p>

<li> 	The study concludes, &quot;New restrictions on employment-based visas -- and 
immigration more generally -- will drive more companies to locate research 
and development offshore ... and will lead to less innovation, a less dynamic 
economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge industries of 
tomorrow.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Jack Kemp said, &quot;We have got to understand that we are getting some of the best 
and brightest minds from all over the world to invest their talents in America's 
economy.  We are becoming more competitive and more prosperous and, as the 
study shows, we aren't displacing or devaluing American workers in the 
process.&quot<p>  

William Bennett added, &quot;We have seen too much anti-immigration rhetoric in 
our public discourse and in our Republican-led Congress -- and unfortunately, it 
has become a centerpiece of Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign.  It's time to 
remind Americans -- and the Republican Party especially -- that legal 
immigration helps, not hurts, America.  While there is no question that American 
society has experienced serious moral decay over the last thirty years, pinning 
the blame on immigrants for our problems is a dodge and distraction.  And it 
happens to be entirely wrong.  One can make a strong argument that many new 
immigrants have been corrupted by those degraded aspects of our culture, not 
causes of it.&quot;<p>

</h3><P>October 27, 1995</center><P>Contact: Christian Pinkston, (202) 452-8200, x223<P><hr size=3 width=50%><P>Washington D.C.--Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> today congratulated House and Senate Republicans on their historic achievement in passing budget plans that will reduce the burden of government in the lives of the nation's citizens and improve incentives for savings, investment and families.  Kemp urged congressional leaders to move quickly on a House-Senate package that strengthens these incentives and called on them to seek an accord with the Clinton administration.  Such an agreement, he emphasized, can be accomplished without compromising the integrity of the plan's objectives.
 <p>
"Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and the entire Republican congressional leadership deserve great credit for their masterful job in bringing off this achievement," Kemp said.  "But none of this will matter unless Congress and the White House can find a way to resolve their differences.  This legislation is too important to the nation to be sacrificed in a fit of partisan acrimony and bickering.
                                                                                             <P>
"I would hope that Republicans in Congress and the Democratic Administration recognize that both have a lot at stake in reaching a successful conclusion.  Each should carefully evaluate options that are available.  For example, if the final package has the right mix of incentives, including a substantial capital gains tax cut with inflation indexing, there is no reason the American economy should not experience substantially higher growth with lower inflation.  In that case, the Administration's economic assumptions, though more optimistic than those of Congress, are within the range of consensus forecasts and would be entirely plausible.  The higher growth projections would mean substantially increased revenue estimates, easing the path to budget balance.
<P>
"At the same time, I would urge my former colleagues to tread very carefully before reducing the inflation adjustment for federal benefits and income tax liability.  Several economists have testified to Congress suggesting that the consumer price index overstates inflation.  However, others contend that the CPI has substantially under reported inflation over the past two decades.  It would be unconscionable to require sacrifice from the nation's retirees and taxpayers on the basis of a theoretical economic argument that has yet to be resolved.
<P>
"I would also add that, in my opinion, it is imperative that Congress go all the way toward fundamental change by following up this legislation with approval of the Abraham-Lieberman enterprise zone act. While I applaud the reconciliation bill for cutting taxes for working families and businesses, I believe there is one essential ingredient missing:  a provision to create jobs and opportunity for people who live in America's economically-distressed urban and rural communities.  The Abraham-Lieberman "Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act of 1995" would accomplish this goal by providing tax incentives to work, save, and invest in the over 100 urban and rural pockets of poverty across this Nation.  This legislation is the type of affirmative "effort" for which our party has been known for throughout history--from Lincoln to Reagan.  Furthermore, Republican-led efforts to combat the plight of poverty and unemployment in our inner-cities would begin the needed process of racial and ethnic reconciliation and give hope and opportunity to all people."    <P>

WASHINGTON, DC -- With a warning that trashy daytime talk-shows on television are debasing our aulture and harming America's children, <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joe Lieberman today launched a campaign to rid the airwaves of <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">sordid programs</a>.  Bennett, co-director of Empower America, and Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut, say they will work together and with other concerned citizens to put pressure on those who produce and own daytime television talk shows to get rid of the licentious material that characterizes many of such programs today. To illustrate their point about the condition of daytime television talk shows, Bennett and Lieberman aired a series of clips culled only from shows that aired Monday and Tuesday of this week.
<P>Bennett and Lieberman are not calling for legislation or any govemment censorship of daytime television talk shows. They are calling on the producers and owners of the programs to recognize their responsibility to Amencan society and children by setting higher standards for the programs' content. They are also calling on parents to exercise their respons bllity to simply turn the programs off. Bennett and Lieberman said that hundreds of thousands of young children, and up to a million or more teenagers watch daytime television talk shows on a daily basis.
<P><a href="pr1026a.html">Bennett</a> and <a href="pr1026b.html">Lieberman</a> said the number of trashy talk shows has increased in recent
months, while the behavior exhibited on the shows has sharply declined. They argue that
exposing children, teenagers and even adults to hours of such programming on a daily basis has, over time, a deteriorating effect on the civility of American society, and becomes one                                                                   
more contributing factor to the host of serious problems facing our country today.

	<i>Announcing A Public Campaign Against
	Select Day-Time Television Talk Shows</i><P>
	October 26, 1995<P><hr width="35%"></center><P>


First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman.  Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea.  It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure -- public pressure -- on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<P>
Earlier this year, <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Senator Lieberman</a> joined <a href="/empower/pr1026d.html">C. DeLores Tucker</a> of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc.  Today, we turn our attention to television.  Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television -- the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas.  Most of the criticisms are justified.  But this is not the worst of it.  The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified.  In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.  
<P>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment.  But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<P>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics.  The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men -- well, you get the idea.    
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about.  We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee.  The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency.  They are at the bottom of the television barrel.  Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it.  So here we are.    
<P>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed -- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote; and to petition men and women of good will -- producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers -- to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<P>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs?  In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust.  Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality?  Do the sponsors think not?  If so, why not?  
<P>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.  What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid.  This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift.  We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.  
<P>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about.  So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine.  We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.      
<P>
Let me conclude with a personal note.  Joe Lieberman is a Jew.  I am a Catholic.  Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image.  And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves.  Finally, what we are talking about is human dignity, the dignity of God's greatest creation -- and whether or not we still believe in it.

When I joined with <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026.html">Delores Tucker</a> to speak out against the vile rap music that Time Warner was helping to produce, I was trying to give voice to the thousands of people I represent in Connecticut who are angry about the degradation of our culture and <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html"> the messages</a> the media is sending to our children.
<P>
The people I talk to in Connecticut are part of a revolution that is beginning throughout the country, <i>a movement that might be called the revolt of the revolted</I>. A growing number of Americans are sickened by the morass of sex, vulgarity and violence that increasingly dominates our electronic media; and they are disgusted by what they see as the entertainment industry's abandonment of basic standards of decency, as if anything goes. The result is <i>an increasingily debased culture that rejects, rather than retlects the basic values that most Americans share</i>.
<P>
This anger is felt most deeply by parents. I can't tell you how many mothers and fathers I've talked with who <i>look at the media not as a source of information or entertainment, but as a threat to the well-being o f their children</I>. These parents feel like they are locked in a struggle with powerful forces outside of their control to 'shape their children's values, a struggle; they feel they are losing.
<P>
Bill Bennett and I are back today to focus attention on one of the worst parts of America's entertainment culture -- the daytime television talk shows. There are more than 20 nationally syndicated talk programs on the air this fall, many of which can be seen here in the Washington area, as this chart displays. Afl er watching a number of these shows, and-learning more about the behavior of their hosts and producers, <i>it is clear that talk is indeed cheap, and too often demeaning, exploitative, perverted, divisive, or, at best, amoral</i>.
<P>
Those are strong words, but it is difficult to exaggerate the willingness of some of these shows to parade any and every pathology and dysfunction into our living rooms. The nation caught a glimpse of what these shows are about last March, when a guest on the "Jenny Jones" was set up to meet a gay secret admirer, and responded by killing that admirer with a shotgun. To show you just how extreme these programs are, in a few minutes we will display a videotape showing some typical segments.
<P>
For now I would call your attention to the article from Electroriic Media that we have made available. This diary of a 20-day period during the February sweeps documents how sex saturates these programs, the more bizarre the better. Just look at some of the titles; "I Use Sex to Get What I Want"; "Sex Caught on Tape"; "Mom's Dating a Boy Toy" and "Get Bigger Breasts or Else?'.
<P>
As you will see, there's good reason why many people call these shows pornographic: during the February sweeps, viewers were treated to at least five different shows that focused heavily on porn: among them, "Rolanda" showcased porn stars reuriniting with their first loves; "Jenny Jones" had men confronting their girlfriends who want to be porn stars; and "Richard Bey" pitted "Housewives vs. Strippers."
<P>
Why should we be so concerned about the content of these shows? One of the most compelling reasons is that millions of children and voung teens are watching trashy talk TV on a daily basis. In fact, according to one report, children aged 2 to 11 comprise six percent of the national viewing audience for talk shows, which translates to 650,000 kids alone regularly watching "Ricki Lake," one of the worst offenders.
<P>
There is no real scientific evidence available yet documenting the impact these shows have on young viewers. But a number of psychologists, child development specialists and media experts have voiced serious concern about the dangers posed by these shows. The constant confrontations and emotional violence children see on talk shows teach them a perverse way to solve personal problems, and suggests to them that is the way normal adults behave. Also, because of the powerful appeal of the sexual messages being sent to young viewers, these shows have enormous potential to act as the worst kind of sex educators.
<P>
But the impact of these programs extends far beyond children. Trashy TV talk shows are wildly distorting our perceptions of what are normal and acceptable forms of behavior, adding to the alreadv overloaded cultural dictionary that is helping. in Pat Alovnihan's words. to define desiancy down. The fixation these shows have with the dysfunctional, and the way in which those pathologies are treated, is having a "destructive" effect on the nation's mental health, according to mental health professionals Jeanne Heaton and Nona Wilson, the authors of "Tuning in Trouble." The "driveby pyschology" dispensed by so-called experts and the hosts themselves serves to mislead people into believing that serious mental health problems can be cured with platitudes and the psychobabble that is so commonplace on talk TV.
<P>
The proliferation of perversion on daytime television is affecting our entire society by the example it sets, pushing the envelope of civility and morality in a wav that drags the rest of the culture down with it. It is a vicious circle, fueled by the competition among talk show hosts to be the most sensational, and one with no apparent end in sight.
<P>
We do not want to demonize any one show, to overstate their influence, or to argue that these programs are destroying America as we know it. What we do want to get across is that taken as a whole, and combined with the obscene gangsta rap music kids are listening to, the hyperviolent videogames they're playing, as well as other television shows and movies, these talk shows are surely contributing to the loss of values, and the moral decay that so many Americans are concerned about. 
<P>
Much as we did with Time Warner's involvement with Interscope records, we are launching this campaign today to impress upon the major companies who are producing the bulk of the daytime talk show the damage trash TV talk is doing, and to call on them to exercise the greater responsibility. These corporations [include] a number of communications titans, including Gannett Newspapers, Paramount, Fox, Time Warner, CBS, Columbia-TriStar Studios, and the Tribune Company.
<P>
As we have said many times before, <i>we are not calling for censorship, simply better citizenship</I>. We want to remind these producers that they are members of a larger community, to which they have certain obligations. We also want to remind them- that because of their stature and their power their decisions carry weight. They can and should do-better, and that is our appeal.
<P>                                                                                 <P>

<h2>Press Conference Statement by C DeLores Tucker<br>
Chair, National Political Congress of Black Women, Inc.</h2><P>
<i>October 26, 1995</i><P>
<br width=50% size=3></center><P>

I regret that a long standing engagement prevents me from joining <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Joe Lieberman</a> this morning at this timely and necessary press conference. However, I am proud to join with them in focusing on other segments of the entertainment industry that is constantly poisoning the cultural environment of our society. <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">Mindless television</a> shows that target young audiences are corrupting our culture and doing great harm to our children. I believe that it is time to confront the performers and companies that produce these shows. In our campaign against Time-Warner's involvement in the production and distribution of Gangsta Rap music to children we did not get results until Bill Bennett and I confronted the executives of Time-Warner. It is time now to confront those responsible for these culturally corrupt television shows.
          <P>
If we are to restore a measure of decency to the cultural mainstream of our society we must expand our efforts to the area of television. Those who produce and air these degrading and denigrating shows need to be made aware of what they are doing to the youth of America.
<P>
I look forward to working with Sen. Lieberman and Dr. Bennett and in this on-going public campaign.

<Center><i>Bennett and Lieberman petition producers to dispense with the grotesque and perverse subject
matter of some day-time television talk shows.</i></center>
<P>
(Washington D.C.; October 25, 1995) On the heels of their successful campaign against violently obscene music lyrics, Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) will hold a Washington <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">press conference</a> at 10:00am tomorrow to launch a new phase in their campaign against the cultural decomposition to which the entertainment industry is contributing. Specifically, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman will target certain day-time television talk shows which repeatedly focus on sordid subject matter, petitioning producers to acknowledge their responsibilities toward their viewers, both children and the general public, rather than just the profits they may stand to gain from them. Once again, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman are not calling for content censorship but corporate citizenship.
<P>
Daytime television talk show producers will meet this weekend in New York City for the "Talk Summit" to discuss program content.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4>SOLDIER OF THE SOUL <BA></FONT></B>
<P></center>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Kemps remarks were delivered on November 19, 1996 at the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe's Annual Dinner in New York, where he received an award named in memory of the distinguished humanitarian, Mr. Raoul Wallenberg.  Mr. Kemp was introduced by Rabbi Simcha Lyons.<BA></blockquote></blockquote></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thank you very much for this award in the name of Raoul Wallenberg, a great hero of mine.  In September of 1981 I had the honor of working with Congressman Tom Lantos to pass legislation granting honorary U.S. citizenship to this courageous "soldier of the soul."  And thank you to the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe, for whose work in the causes of education and human rights -- and in so many other endeavors to promote liberty throughout the world --  I hold a profound regard.
<P>
In 1899, Emile Zola, in his famous outcry against the anti-semitism manifest in the French Army's conspiracy to convict Captain Dreyfus of treason, spoke to the inevitable triumph of truth over prejudice when he said, "truth is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."  At the time, the French people were polarized over the controversy which presented them with a moral choice between the life of one man and the reputation of the French Army.  
<P>
As America approaches the turn of the next century, we face many similar controversies -- controversies which challenge us to make a moral choice between political expediency and the inalienable right to liberty.  Fortified by the memory of our great heritage and what is occurring at breakneck speed in the world, we can now proclaim, with equal conviction: "Democracy is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."   But the task of preserving and advancing this democratic evolution will take truth-tellers, seekers of justice, men and women of honor and courage willing to act on their convictions.  
v
It will take men and women such as Raoul Wallenberg and people like you who form this great Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe.
<P>
 Historically, every form of government or societal structure that refused to recognize the basic human right of freedom has failed.  Whether it be the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the persecution of the Christians in Rome, the oppression of the peasant class by the aristocracy in pre-revolutionary France, the lack of just representation for the American colonies by the British monarchy, the evil of slavery in pre-Civil War America, the abuse of labor in industrial England, the comprehensive manipulation and subjugation of people by the socialist systems of Eastern and Central Europe and in Asia, or the monstrous evil of apartheid in South Africa -- tyranny infallibly authors its own epitaph.   The oppressed are driven to the point of revolt.  The system collapses internally, unable to supply the hope, motivation and freedom that promotes the general welfare of a people and a nation and which responds to the Jewish and Christian ideal of freedom as an inalienable, God-given right of all people everywhere and always.
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had the historical honor of being a victim of both Nazi and Communist tyranny.  I say an honor because this persecution is the mark of a  Godly man, of a liberal man in the classical sense.  For there is only one truth, but many lies; one charity, but many forms of envy and selfishness.  To stand up for what is good, right and true often, attracts enemies from very different directions.
<P>
The world is in a similar situation today, with democracy and freedom being attacked from different angles.
<P>
Democracy is on the march, and on the surface, appears to have unstoppable momentum.  Just yesterday, Romania celebrated the triumphal election of anti-Communist Emil Constantinescu as President -- a fact which, in Constantinescu's own words, signifies that "Romania comes back now to the great concert of a democratic Europe."  In the Freedom House survey, more than half the people of the world live in countries that are democratic or somewhat democratic.  In economic terms, the worldwide trend toward democracy is even stronger.  More than 93 percent of the world's trade  comes from democratic and partly democratic countries.  (Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1989 and 1996.)  As a matter of economic and industrial output, communism and dictatorship barely exist, and where their production is rising -- Vietnam, China -- it is only because regimes are falling all over themselves to "open up to the outside" and establish economic and trade liberalization.
v
But there are threats to political and economic freedom, to democracy, from without and within.  They are not as violent, purposive, or determined as the enemies Raoul Wallenberg fought, and we may thank God for it.  But they are serious and important, and if they are more corrosive than aggressive in nature, they may nevertheless poison our civilization if left unchecked.
<P>
One is the threat foreseen by Alexis de Tocqueville more than 150 years ago.  Tocqueville called this the velvet tyranny of mindless, numbing bureaucracy.  It would not outlaw religion, but it would sap the human spirit, and set up a new pseudo-religion, the worship of the state, in place of churches and synagogues.  It would not brazenly abolish private property, but it would smother property -- and, what is equally important, human initiative -- in a well-meaning but deadly array of taxes, regulations, and stipulations.
<P>
Lincoln summed up the animating spirit of Tocqueville's velvet tyranny when he described the spirit of slavery in America -- and we may regard it as chilling that the terms would have such a resemblance.  Lincoln called this the idea of "you plant the grain, you make the bread, and I'll eat it."  Lincoln went on to say that we must not rest until this "artificial weight is lifted from the shoulders of all mankind."
<P>
In the affairs of the world that Wallenberg cared so deeply about, the force of velvet tyranny is most visible, and certainly most important, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  On the one hand, these countries have enjoyed a miraculous transformation.  On the other hand, they have endured a decline in industrial production and gross output for which it is difficult to find a parallel.  Russian, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian output dropped by more than 50 percent in real terms over five years -- a record that puts our "Great Depression" to shame.
<P>
History teaches that this kind of economic implosion often hastens tyranny, whether it be tyranny of the far left or the far right.  The rise of Nazi Germany was preceded by the Weimar Republic's tragedy of runaway inflation in the '20s followed by democratically-elected Henrich Brunning's economics of austerity in the early '30s.  This precipitated Brunning's abolishment of the Reichstag and thus a coalition government in 1933, led by Adolph Hitler.  And Soviet Communism grew out of the state-directed industrial capitalism in Russia during the confusion of World War I.
<P>
The response of the West to today's economic threat to democracy has not been encouraging.  For more than five years, going back to the Houston Summit, the United States and the West have been presented with one of the great opportunities for creative statesmanship in human history.  Instead of seizing it, as we did under Harry Truman, General Marshall, and Western Unification, we have turned it over to the International Monetary Fund.
<P>
Today, the top Russian tax rate is close to 70 percent on income from labor, and what little money a Russian worker is left with after this is taxed through high value-added, excise, and other consumption taxes.  The same is true, by the way, in Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Europe.  The tax rate on some types of labor and business activity is over 90 percent.
<P>
No wonder wages today are less than 38 percent of Russia's entire economy -- a situation which has driven one of the most talented peoples in the world underground.  Again, the pattern is nearly identical in Hungary and other countries.  (In OECD countries, wages typically account for more than 60 percent of national income.)  The people who have done some of the best reporting on the true Russian tax burden, a newsletter called Emerging Markets Watch down in Washington, have managed to cull these data out of the ridiculously secret IMF memoranda and staff reports that go by top officials there every few weeks.  But it is only by months and years of tireless digging that they've been able to uncover what should be public knowledge -- how the U.S. and the West are spending, or rather mis-spending, the billions in annual "aid" to Eastern Europe.
<P>
Somehow, the IMF and the West -- which should be leading a sweeping Russian tax, monetary and trade reform -- remain numb to the urgency of bringing economic growth to the new democracies.  Do you know that two years ago, the IMF insisted that Russia increase its taxes by 4.1 percent of GDP in one year?  To put this in perspective, both the Bush and Clinton tax increases that attracted such displeasure in the U.S. in the last five years were less than 1 percent of GDP, and these at least were not piled on the back of a crippled economy.
<P>
This is not a partisan issue.  It goes back to the Bush administration, when we encouraged the same mind-numbing austerity as is being applied to Russia, Hungary, and Poland today through the IMF's conditionality agreements and Article IV process.  In 1993, I joined with the late Ed Muskie, George Soros, Senator Joe Lieberman, and a group of nearly three dozen other leading Americans of both parties to urge the president to take the fate of Russia out of the hands of the inept and incapable economists at the IMF and devise a serious, direct program of Western aid and trade to bring economic growth to the emerging democracies of Central and East Europe.
<P>
The post-Cold-War peace must not become another Versailles settlement of pain and austerity.  America and the West must see that they cannot afford to send the common reply, "it isn't our concern."   We must dedicate ourselves to the opposite spirit, the spirit of liberal optimism and open trade with the East.  And we must resolve to include Eastern Europe and Russia at the table.
<P>
I am reminded of a famous cartoon from Wallenberg's time, in which Russia, Germany, and Hungary were at the front end of a ship that was rapidly taking in water.  The ship was labeled, "The World Monetary Crisis," and the year was about 1927, as the first signs of protectionism and deflation were making themselves felt.  In the back of the ship were three men labeled France, Britain, and the United States.  They watched with interest and a little bit of sympathy as the men bailed furiously in front.   But they were not concerned.  "Awful leak," said one of them.  "Yes, awful," said another.  "Thank goodness it's not in our end of the boat."
<P>
Today, democracy is doing much better, but the burden on us is that much higher.  We have a tremendous opportunity to secure the fruits of the Cold War victory: to build a stable and prosperous Eastern and Central Europe; to guard Russia from a new form of tyranny -- economic tyranny.  
<P>
 Indeed, we are bound by the awesome responsibility that comes with our own freedom to guard the rightful freedom of all people.  
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had a profound understanding of this moral imperative.  He refused to accept the awful conclusion that we needn't be concerned about others, or that there is "nothing we can do."  He did not believe the unpragmatic counsel that we can ignore the front of the boat because it isn't our end.   His life was an incarnate assertion of the equal and opposite imperative -- the democratic imperative, the assertion of Rabbi Hillel, the New Testament, and Hebrew Scripture, that we are our brother's keeper, and our neighbor's brother.
<P>
As President Reagan said during the Rose Garden ceremony conferring honorary American citizenship upon Wallenberg:  " . . a man makes at least a start on understanding the meaning of human life when he plants shade trees under which he will never sit.  Raoul Wallenberg is just such a man.  He nurtured the lives of those he never knew at the risk of his own."  What better example to look to as we challenge ourselves to respond to the needs of a changing world -- to plant the trees of shade, succor and democratic successes under which we might never sit, but which will surely shelter our children and grandchildren in the 21st century.  Let us resolve not that it be an American Century per se -- but a Democratic Century for all.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4> REMARKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB <BA></FONT></B>
<P>
by William J. Bennett 
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2>Given on November 18, 1996 <BA></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Now that the political season is over, let's talk about some other matters which are arguably as important -- indeed, I would argue that they are more important -- than the matters raised in the recent political debate.  Last week the National Commission on Civic Renewal was announced.  The executive director is Bill Galston, formerly Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser, and a very able man.  The Commission is co-chaired by Sam Nunn and me, and it will address issues of civic trust; our morale and national mood; the fraying social fabric; and moral decline.
<P>
Today I would like to give you my take on this -- where we are, where I think we, the American people, need to go, and what's missing in our public conversation.  Let me say at the outset that I believe that in a fundamental way, many of our conversations are missing the mark.
<P>
Here's a question to start with -- a question which implicitly runs throughout my talk and one which is, I think, an interesting question for our time: why, when we have so much material wealth, are Americans so cynical, so distressed, so angry with each other, so untrusting, so ticked off about so many things?  Why, when for so many things are so good, do we feel so bad?
<P>
The evidence is all around us: the whining and the complaining; the explosion in recent years in the use of Prozac; and alcohol abuse and drug use.   The Commission takes as its fundamental data a dramatic national increase in rudeness; in incivility; in litigiousness; in the growing belief that we are all victims; in the frequency of visits to psychiatrists; in the increased amount of suicide, particularly among the young; and in increased complaints about stress.  
<P>
Earlier this month an American Automobile Association survey showed that aggressive driving cases involving death or injury are on a record pace in 1996, and incidents of violent "highway hooliganism" have increased 50 percent from 1990 through 1995.  And last week a survey of high-achieving students revealed that among many of these high school students stress, drugs and thoughts of death fill their lives.  This is a report from out youngest people in this, the most successful country in the history of the world.
<P>
Well, judging from mountains of interviews and stories from the political debate that we just concluded, many in politics still give an answer to this question that has economics at its base.  You know the litany -- and we've had a whole lot of it in the last couple of years: "economic stagnation," "flat wages," the "American Dream" is getting further and further out of reach, that sort of thing.  But is that diagnosis correct?  I don't think so.
<P>
I don't think the objective material and economic facts can explain what I'm talking about, because while it's obvious that economic things are far from perfect, the fact remains that we are the most affluent and materially prosperous people in the history of civilization.  As Robert Samuelson puts it, "By objective standards, the last half century of our national life has been hugely successful.  We have achieved unprecedented prosperity and personal freedom.  We are healthier, work at less exhausting jobs and live longer than ever."
<P>
But it seems we don't feel so great about it.  Did you know, for example, that the average American now consumes twice as many goods and services as in 1950?  Or that the poorest fifth of the current population consumes more than the average family did in 1955?  In a wonderful introductory essay for the 75th anniversary issue of Forbes magazine, James Michaels put it this way:
<P>
"When you're my age you don't have to ask: Are Americans really materially better off than they were in the recent past?  Those of us born in the 1920s and with vivid memories of the Depression simply know how much better things are today.  The improvement is implicit in almost our every memory, every experience.  Even for comfortable middle-class people life was much more difficult and insecure in the 1920s than it is today.  If he was fortunate enough to have central heating (less than one-third of the population in 1920 did), middle-class Dad had to pull himself from bed at 4 a.m. on cold winter mornings to unbank the furnace and shovel coal; if he overslept, the pipes froze.  But he usually didn't have to rake leaves or shovel snow.  Not in the 1930s.  That was done by shabby, humble men who knocked at the back door mornings, asking for a warm meal in return for doing chores."
<P>
Michaels goes on to say this:  "In 1921... the typical American workweek was 60 hours, and many people worked longer...  [A woman] worked a lot more than 60 hours in her home.  Leisure-time industry scarcely existed because few people had leisure.  For more than half the population, the family toilet was a hole in the backyard with a shack built over it.....  Senior citizens?  We called them old folks, and they were old in their 50s; if they were lucky, one of their kids had a spare room for them, maybe in the attic.  Life expectancy was about 54 years, which was just as well because there were few pensions beyond what the gold watch might bring at a pawnshop."       
<P>
My point is this: while people natter about economics, and it almost consumes many political debates, what I am talking about is not about economics.  It's about whether we can survive prosperity.  Now prosperity and wealth are certainly far preferable to poverty.  But can the human spirit survive it?  The problem is not prosperity per se; the problem is in making prosperity the object of our loves, the object of our heart's and soul's desire, thereby displacing other things.  In this connection think of Saint Augustine, who has the concept called ordo amorum, the "order of the loves."  I think that very often, for very many of us, we have the order wrong.
<P>
Now, if people want to be unhappy and angry and upset and sad, there certainly are plenty of things to be unhappy and sad and angry about.  While America is the most powerful, affluent, and envied nation in the world -- in many ways justifiably so -- America also leads the industrialized world in rates of murder; violent crime; juvenile violent crime; imprisonment; divorce; abortion; sexually-transmitted diseases; single-parent households; teen suicide; cocaine consumption; per capita consumption of all drugs; pornography production and pornography consumption.  I am told that California itself leads the entire world in pornography production.  And that's only a partial list.  Now these are serious matters, worthy of serious concern.  But these are not -- I think we can fairly say -- matters that are the consequences of an economic deprivation.  The root cause lies elsewhere.
<P>
Let me digress for a moment.  I do not want to be misunderstood; I don't mean to sound like a Jeremiah one-note.  There is genuine good news in America, and much of it is about things other than economics.  We have seen huge social advances when it comes to women and minorities; opportunity and equality have been extended to those who were once denied them.  We have witnessed extraordinary advances in medicine, in science and in technology in recent times.  Life expectancy has increased more than 20 years during the last six decades.  Studies show that if a person finishes high school, gets married and reaches the age of twenty before having a first child, the odds are less than 1 in 10 that that person will be in poverty.  The American system works: finish high school, get a job, don't get pregnant or get someone pregnant before you finish high school, and you can make it in America.  And of course, last but not least, America prevailed in the "long, twilight struggle" against communism.
<P>
Let me give you some more specific and more recent good news: we have seen what many people thought could not occur: a downturn in crime in New York and Houston -- almost a 40 percent decline in violent crime in New York (which accounts for a lot of the total crime decline in the nation as a whole).  We have seen effective welfare programs in several states across the country.  I must confess I was delighted that my beloved Western Canon of literature has now made it to Hollywood.  Jane Austen is an enormous movie success.  Now it turns out three Henry James novels are coming to the screen.  Can Anna Karenina be far behind?  We are seeing the popularity of shows on the radio and some on television that lift up the human spirit.  We are seeing a flattening out or decrease in some social indicators -- abortion, divorce, crime.  Maybe this will just flatten out at a high plateau.  Or maybe we will see a further decline.
<P>
We are seeing an emerging consensus on the importance of the "values" debate.  As Bill Galston says, 10 or even 5 years ago we would have been arguing about basic facts and basic premises.  That's not the case now.  People understand the importance of values, understand the importance of families.  For men, programs like Promise Keepers are an extraordinary event in American life.  For young women, for girls, my wife's program, Best Friends, is a tremendous success here in the District of Columbia and in other places.  This is extraordinarily important and extraordinarily hopeful.
<P>
Our popular culture campaign involving Joe Lieberman, Sam Nunn and DeLores Tucker, has had success.  People were actually willing to listen and to change some of what is on TV and what is marketed in music.  I think what we are seeing in America today, in many places, is the virus creating its own antibodies.  We are seeing people fighting back with their best, with their eyes and their sights and their standards raised.  And that is very important and very encouraging.
<P>
But the troubles we have remain our troubles; they manifestly have to do not with the pocket book, not with economics, but with the human heart, the human heart at odds with itself. 
It seems to me that almost all contemporary political campaigns miss the mark in terms of what most ails America.  The concerns which the two campaigns most sought to address were economic: things like wage stagnation, fear that our children will not have as much materially as we do, and how do we increase wealth creation.  Making a bigger pie is a fine thing to do.  We should do it, and I am for it.  But it is not everything.  Nor is it even the most important thing. 
<P>
More than ever before -- and thanks largely to affluence, to mass marketing, to television, to the nature of our political discourse, and I say this knowingly, as a Republican, thanks to the unbridled and omnipresent market, to capitalism, we are constantly pushing our children and adults to buy things which they don't need.  We are pushing goods and the idea of life as having things and having experiences.  We are making desires into needs, and as a result we are not living at the center.  We are misreading the essential human condition.  Because if we actually are moral and spiritual beings -- which a lot of us say we are -- then we ought to act in ways which are consonant with that fact, that reality.  But too often, we aren't doing that -- officially, politically, publicly, privately.  We are not living, or advertising, or talking, or even making public policy, as if we are what we profess ourselves to be.  I know often I'm not.  And maybe you're not.  Maybe a lot of us aren't.  And I think that explains, in large part, the cynicism, the anger, the drift, and the deep and pervasive sadness.
<P>
Let me conclude and then open this up to discussion.  And in conclusion, let me borrow briefly from three people who are a lot smarter than I am.  In doing a philosopher's exercise like this, I thought it was advisable for me to draw on people who thought these things through a lot longer and better than I did.  See if you think they hit it closer than what we here in Beltway Central have been obsessing about for so long.
<P>
First Walker Percy, my favorite contemporary novelist.  When asked about what issue most concerned him about the future of America, Percy said this: "Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and is defeated, not by the Communist movement ... but from within by weariness, by boredom, by cynicism, by greed, and in the end, by helplessness before its great problems."
<P>
Second, the great and prophetic Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had this to say: "In the United States the difficulties are not a Minotaur or a dragon -- not imprisonment, not hard labor, death, government harassment and censorship -- but cupidity, boredom, sloppiness, indifference." About the West, Solzhenitsyn said this simple, straightforward sentence: "the spiritual axis of life has grown dim."
 <P>
And finally, Scottish author John Buchan, writing a half-century ago, described the "coming of a too garish age, when life would be lived in the glare of neon lamps and the spirit would find no solitude."  Here is what Buchan wrote about his nightmare world:
<P>
"In such a world everyone would have leisure.  But everyone would be restless, for there would be no spiritual discipline in life...  It would be a feverish, bustling world, self-satisfied and yet malcontent, and under the mask of a riotous life there would be death at the heart.  In the perpetual hurry of life there would be no change of quiet for the soul...  in such a bagman's paradise, where life would be rationalised and padded with every material comfort, there would be little satisfaction for the immortal part of man."
<P>
This sounds right to me.  I'd love to know how it sounds to you.  Thank you very much. 
<P>
<P><HR>
<center><b>QUESTION-AND-ANSWER</B></center> 
<p>
<B>Question:</B>  How will the new Bennett-Nunn commission actually address moral decline -- through studies, surveys, academic papers, hearings, recommendations for legislative actions, exhortations and speeches?  How will you address moral decline?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</b>  All the above (laughter).  It's a commission.  The Commission members are an exceedingly interesting group: Richard Land from the Southern Baptist Convention is one member, and Henry Louis Gates from Harvard is another member, so that gives you a sense of the ideological spread of the group.  I don't want to presume ideology on the part of anybody, but I have a sense there may be differences of opinion between those two, as with others of us.  It will be interesting to tape the conversation.  And the meetings, I believe, are open to the press, so we welcome members of the press to come.
<P>
We'll have witnesses.  We will hear from people about problems and about solutions.  We very much want to profile what works, what's effective.  We want to see programs that address some of the hardest issues in American life and are finding a way to ameliorate them, if not always solve them.  If there are grounds for this anger and this lack of trust and this grousing that seems to be so increasingly prevalent, we want to know what it is.  But if there are grounds for others, as St. Paul says, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, we'll think on those things, too.  And so we will want to do both.
<P>
What Bill Galston has stressed -- and one of the reasons I so much admire Bill Galston and was so sorry to see him leave the Clinton White House -- was that he doesn't think we should speak on these things until we have established an absolutely unassailable factual basis for anything we have to say.  And so I think we will have a solid empirical basis for talking about these things.  These are difficult concepts, and some people might say, what is all this about trust and sadness and all that?   Well, we're going to get a hard empirical basis for it, so people who need that sort of thing to believe it -- who need to touch something before they believe it's there -- will be satisfied.  There will be a lot of social science, I will admit.  You know what one person called social science?  The elaborate demonstration of the obvious by methods that are obscure (laughter.)  
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The National Endowment for the Humanities, at the beginning of the Clinton administration, launched a national conversation on what it means to be an American.  Little has been heard from that since.  Isn't this similar to that you are doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  No, you'll hear from us (laughter).  I don't know what happened to that conversation.  They may still be building toward it.  They may still be footnoting it.  I don't know what happened to the National Endowment for the Humanities conversation.
<P>
I don't think there are too few conversations in American political life.  I don't think anybody can go through campaign season and say, you know, we're not talking enough about politics.  It's that I don't think we have a sufficient number of conversations that are focused on things that I think we ought to focus on.  And what I was trying to do today -- and what we will try to do in the Commission, I think -- is to bring some other kinds of things into the conversation, some of the most important things are not getting talked about.
<P>
<B>Question</B>:  Perhaps you answered your own question, perhaps wealth is at the core of our hollowness.  In short, do we have too much of a good thing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, the philosophers worried about this.  Again, I don't think prosperity per se is the problem, I don't think wealth per se is the problem.  I think the problem is, as I read some of these other people whom I've quoted, is when the pursuit of these things leads to the displacement of other things.  It's when they become the idol, the actual object of the pursuit, rather than simply a way in which one lives.
<P>
Look, one of my arguments with the market is that it makes people think their desires are needs.  And this is a very, very important distinction.  When I was chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first budget we did -- I remember submitting to Congress a huge document -- talking about the "needs" of the humanities community.  Well, as I read through the "needs" of the humanities community, these weren't needs, these were desires.  It's important to make the distinction.  They said, "we need summer seminars in warm climates." (Laughter.)  Well, they wanted summer seminars in warm climates, and I understand that.  Other people get summer seminars in warm climates; why shouldn't professors?  By the way, we took it away from them and gave it to elementary and high school teachers because I thought they were more deserving of summer seminars in warm climates.  But there was the substitution of the word "need" for what was actually the desire.
<P>
Maybe the smartest thing ever said about this was by Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, "Human desires grow with the means of their gratification."  And I think that just turns out to be a truth of human nature.  One of the ironies of this tremendously successful commercial machine which we have made in this country is that we now regard deprivation relatively much higher than we used to.  It's at a much higher threshold.  Consider what people have now and what they regard as deprivation.  The machine is constantly trying to transmute desires into needs, so that we think of those things in that way, and we ratchet ever higher and pursue it ever the more.
<P>
So, unbridled capitalism is a problem.  It may not be a problem for production and for expansion of the economic pie, but it's a problem for human beings.  It's a problem for that whole dimension of things we call the realm of values and human relationships, because it distorts things.
<P>
The other thing to keep in mind is that with the interest in selling, people have now decided to sell by way of philosophy.  You just don't sell a beer or sell a cigar or sell a piece of furniture; you sell a style of life and a philosophy of life.  Now, this is a free country and anybody can practice philosophy.  But when the young are around and are listening, they may take it seriously in the absence of the real stuff.
<P>
For example, when I was growing up I remember the commercial from the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.  It made a tremendous impact on me, and maybe on other people.  It said, "You only go around once in life, so grab for all the gusto you can."  Now Schlitz produces pretty good beer.  I still buy it occasionally.  But I don't buy the philosophy.  How much of that philosophy is getting across?  Now Schlitz might make good beer, but where did they do their philosophy?  How do they know you only go around once in life?  (Laughter.)  I mean, is that part of the brewing process?  This was not a claim about beer.  And if you spend time with undergraduates, you spend time in high school and you talk to young people about life, and what the Good Life is, you will find that what you're hearing very often -- not all the time but very often -- is an echo and a translation through their own internal systems of what they are picking up from the most successful and omnipresent marketing and philosopher's machine ever invented: television.  Television is telling people what to think, and what to believe, and what to feel, and what to buy. And that creates a different view of the world.
<P>
Again, it's a free country.  I'm not even in favor of the v-chip.  I don't want government regulating television; I don't want government legislating about the content of television. I think these are matters best left to individuals.  But what we can't say, it seems to me, is these matters have no consequence; or that television has no consequence; or that advertising has no consequence; or that a relentless market has no consequence.  These things have an enormous consequence.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  More Americans are regular church-goers than in any other developed country. Are you saying that somehow religious organizations are failing to stimulate this spiritual renewal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, I guess I am.  I've looked into this, because it's a very interesting fact, the number of Americans who go to church. The question is what goes on there, what are the consequences, what's the carryover, and what's the impact?
<P>
Maybe the more interesting thing is to see the shift in church-going, the shift from some of the old established Protestant sects, for example, to some of the newer, more evangelical ones. That seems to be a more interesting, a more revealing direction.  Also, there is still an increase, I think, in registrations in the Catholic Church.
<P>
This is the country which in many ways is the nicest, the most generous, the most considerate, the most sensitive to the needs of people in the world and its citizens.  And yet the kinds of things that go on every day in America, cited in my litany, suggest that we're of two minds on this. I don't think that going to church does it any more. I think that for a lot of us -- and again, I put myself in this group, I don't exempt myself from the charges -- I think that sometimes all it amounts to is going to church.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think America's cultural decline is irreversible? And what nation would you point to as historic precedent for such an about-face?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, there is none. There is no precedent. I've found lately -- we've spent a lot of time talking to cultural anthropologists and historians, trying to find a precedent for this. There are so many things going on in America that are unprecedented.  For example, I was reading a book the other day in which Lawrence Stone, formerly at Princeton (I don't know where he is now), points out that we are in entirely uncharted territory in this country in terms of the disintegration of the family.  There has been a relentless assault on marriage as the central cementing institution of society; it has been going on for decades now, and in its place we see the substitution of the idea of individual self-fulfillment with or without commitment.  This is unprecedented, certainly in the West, and we don't know where this goes.
<P>
Nobody's ever done this before; nobody's ever tried to sustain a society with this level of familial disintegration, and we're not sure whether we can or not. I think that the familial disintegration is a corollary of the larger point here -- that is, the focus and the order of the loves.  Because if you regard yourself as, let's say, a moral and spiritual being on the one hand -- and I'm not saying you have to -- but if you say you do, or if on the other hand you're a "Schlitzian" and you believe you only go around once in life and you should grab for all the gusto you can -- well, one thing you can't say is it doesn't matter which you believe.  Because if you believe one or believe the other -- or if you have a foot in both camps, which a lot of us do -- it makes an enormous difference.
<P>
There is no precedent for the United States in so many ways.  I do not think there's any example that's even close.  We could look to Britain, I suppose, in the 19th Century.  Some historians have suggested that you had a kind of revival occurring which changed things.
<P>
If it happens, it will happen on our own terms by our own people. Regeneration comes from within, I'm pretty sure of that.  And the things I cited as grounds for hope I think are very, very important, because if you go through that list -- if you go through Best Friends, if you go through Promise Keepers, if you go through the successful programs in drug treatment, or the successful welfare programs -- I think you find that there's a common basis to many of them. There's something that they are all share, and that is they all tend to raise people sights up, they tend to lift people up, to look beyond where they've been looking. If you want the quick version of my speech, it is that country Western song, "Lookin' for Love in all the Wrong Places."  
<P>
Marvin Olasky has taught us, I think, in this whole discussion of contemporary charity and compassion, that if you're looking at welfare problems, people who have been on welfare generation after generation, if you're looking at people with serious drug problems, alcohol problems, this requires a refocusing of one's life.  It's not simply a matter of getting a job, or getting a message from the government.  It's a matter of refocusing your life, and refocusing your life requires more than the kind of fooling around with the details, messing with the details of bureaucracies and incentives.  I'm for welfare reform, but unless we offer something to people by way of other agencies or institutions for them to focus on, they will fall back. That's why I think the role of churches is so crucial in this whole welfare debate, and indeed beyond the welfare debate.
<P>
But there are people -- I should say this in fairness to some pretty sophisticated literature out there -- there are people who think we are going through a great spiritual reawakening right now in this country.  I don't see it.  There are people who say we are going through it.  It would be nice if it occurred -- provided it was American in tone, provided it was open and tolerant and not vindictive, not authoritarian -- then it would be a good thing. But I'm not sure I see it.  I see all the signs, the interest of people in religion.  I see the New York Times Best Sellers list, and all the books on religion.  I see movies getting quasi-religious. The latest thing in Hollywood seems to me, from what I can tell, is objective immortality. They can't quite say we have souls yet but you may -- you're to be measured by the impact you have on other people's lives.
<P>
It may also be the case, as demographers have pointed out, that this is not a religious revival, this is simply the yuppies turning 50 and getting nervous (laughter.)  After putting the nation through granola and jogging and marijuana and weight machines, they are now going to make us pray because they're approaching 60.  Maybe so.  I don't know for sure.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Does the gap between the richest Americans and the poorest Americans likely affect public discontent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  I think it's very troubling to Americans to see the gap between an overclass and an underclass, to take both ends increase and increase dramatically.  We've got what people have called "cognitive stratification" to a degree we have never had before.  It's always better to be smart, and it's always better to be well-educated, and it's always better to have an economic base.  But the gap now widens because the sheer value of an education; the sheer value of intelligence matters more, in today's complicated world, than it ever did.
<P>
So yes, I think that's troubling.  But the other side of that is the good news.  The other side of that is a society in which we now find that if you play by certain basic minimal rules -- if you graduate from high school, get a job, keep your nose clean, don't have a child before you get out of high school -- the odds that you will succeed in American society increase dramatically.  But you need to observe certain basic rules.
<P>
The problem is -- and I think now there's a lot of agreement among social scientists who have studied poverty -- that poverty is behavioral in nature,  And that's not a different malady -- except when a malady hits the poor, it knocks them out.  When a malady hits the wealthy suburbs, they can absorb it.  I remember when I was "drug czar" and we went to Hollywood and talked about the drug problem.  The people in Hollywood told me that they were not doing drugs any more.  Out in Hollywood, whenever somebody gets a drug problem, they go to the Betty Ford Clinic and they're fine.  Well, when it hits Beverly Hills, people had the money and resources to be able to do that.  But when it hit Watts, it knocked Watts on its ear.  How bad is the earthquake?  Well, how strong is the foundation of the building in which you live?
<P>
It's never good to be poor, it's never good to be without material resources.  But the resources I'm talking about are perhaps the ones that are missing the most across the board, and they raise the question as to whether this country, and the things for which it stands, the hopes it has for itself and its children, can continue without some fairly significant change.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think Bob Dole made a serious mistake in his campaign by stressing the 15-percent tax cut?  What moral and ethical issues should have he raised, beyond just calling President Clinton immoral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, he did more than that.  If you just stand there and say "You're immoral," that's not persuasive, it's not a very good argument, it's not persuasive when one needs to make one's case.  But as I said during the campaign, I think issues of public character and public trust are central to public confidence.
<P>
Look, one of the things that distressed me -- I don't want to make this a political talk -- is that 55 or 60 percent of the people in exit polls said that they didn't have the trust in the president, that they didn't think he was a trustworthy person.  Mario Cuomo said, well, if that's what they thought of Clinton, then what did they think of Dole, if Clinton got elected?  Well, I guess in some ways less, in terms of electability.  But that's not good, that's the point I would make.
<P>
It's perfectly fine to talk about a 15-percent tax cut if that's what you truly believe is essential to the well-being of the country and will spark an economic recovery.  I have no objection to it.  Other things can be talked about and were talked about -- the drug problem, the education problem.  But let me make two points: first, we could be more explicit and talk about real-life issues in ways that are broader than we usually talk about it.  For example, talk about education not just about SAT scores, but talk about education as the architecture of the soul, which is how we used to talk about it, and which why I think many schools are so successful and others are not.  Some schools address students as moral and spiritual beings, and that makes a difference.  I think that helps, when it's done by people who genuinely care for the children.
<P>
We can talk about welfare as life-refocusing effort.  And we can talk about crime as arising not from what I think the usual root-cause argument is but, as we argue in Body Count, the root cause of most crime is moral poverty, kids who are not taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age.  When I traveled as drug czar and talked to wardens and police chiefs and judges, this is what we heard over and over again: nobody's teaching these kids the basics of right and wrong.  Now that's an interesting way to talk about crime, and we could do that.
<P>
Now sure, we could all broaden and deepen our debates in this way.  But at the end of the day, it's not a matter of saying to politicians, "Take all this stuff about the soul and right and wrong and put all that into your political speeches and your political debates."  The point is about the limits of politics itself.  We can't get where we need to get by politics.  The secularization of so much of what matters to us has become so complete that we think of politics as the vehicle of national self-recovery.  And it is not.
<P>
Samuel Johnson said, in his great lines, "How small of all that human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause or cure."  And I think that's right.  But we have now, unwittingly, created a situation in which people are unhappy and so the government needs to do something about it, the president needs to do something about it.  Of course, they can't do something about those things which laws or kings can't cause or cure.  And so we have gotten into a cycle of frustration and unhappiness.
<P>
It is the limits of politics.  It is not as if I'm saying we need to step forward and transform American politics and get into all these things more explicitly.  Politics is a very limited activity, if you think of men and women in the ways that I have been talking about.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  As the story goes, when Bob Dole queried you about interest in running for vice president, you suggested Jack Kemp.  Why didn't you want to run?  Is that because of the limitations of politics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Because of the limitations of politics, plus my own.  And I thought Dole-Kemp would be a better ticket.  I thought it would have more lift than Dole-Bennett.  And there were other reasons.  Yeah, I thought Dole-Kemp was a good idea, and that was my recommendation.
<P>
I did not grow up in the soil of politics.  A thought that has occurred to me recently that to run for president in our time one needs to be obsessed with running for president, and I do not have that, I don't seek it.  I don't come from that soil.  I don't think this is something I will do.  And my relationship with campaigns has always been a little bumptious, a little difficult.  It's never a smooth fit.  So, yeah, I made that recommendation in good conscience, and I thought it was the best call at the time.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think the world of the Internet is helping to form caring communities by linking people beyond their geographic boundaries, or isolating them from person-to-person contact?  If the latter, what as a society can we do about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>   I don't know.  I'm no expert on the Internet.  But I'll tell you it seems to me to be a very mixed blessing.  I read that chilling New York Times story.  It was about a little town in Minnesota and about this network on the Internet on a topic I don't want to get into -- one of the worst and most grisly aspects of American life.  The Internet has made it possible for lots of really horrible things to happen, and it's made it possible for lots of obviously wonderful things to happen.  Here, again, the technology outruns or outpaces the ability to legislate against it, to regulate it, to keep control of it.  What's important are internal constraints, a sense of responsibility, a sense of involvement, participation on the part of parents and others.  I don't know where this is going to lead, but we are going to have a big debate on this.  It's a very mixed blessing indeed.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  California voters recently passed Proposition 209 which ends affirmative action and racial and gender preferences in government and public education.  Do you back this as a national improvement?  And do you believe this would be appropriate for federal hiring programs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Yes, I was a supporter of Prop. 209 and went out there a few times, campaigned for it.  And I think it is one of the more interesting consequences of the elections.  It does not end affirmative action.  What it ends is preference by race or gender in hiring and in college admissions and so on.  And I think that's right.  I think finally there is only one way to live in this society, which is to lift the burdens of discrimination from the shoulders of every man, woman, and child in the country, and to have a level playing field, and to give opportunity where opportunity hasn't been given before.  And I think this is the way to go.
<P>
Yes, I would like to see it on the federal level.  And I am very encouraged, as I think other Americas should be, by the results of the recent election in which when those redistricted districts were redistricted once more, and black members of Congress, incumbents who were now running in majority white districts, were still elected.  It was encouraging for this reason: it shows that the American people, the vast majority of them, can look past race and want to look past race.  And I would hope that Proposition 209 will be given a sympathetic hearing across the country and a full discussion.  I hope that this issue, like so many other important issues, doesn't get decided for us by the courts.  The courts must enter if they think it appropriate.   But these are vital issues of democracy, and people must be encouraged and invited to speak.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The rise of dual-income families explains some of the affluence you describe.  Is there an antidote that would give parents more time with their children to impart values?  What do you propose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  It really all depends. Some people say that two parents have to work to keep body and soul together.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes two parents work to keep the boat together -- you know, the boat for the summer vacation.  You pay your money, you take your choice.
<P>
The two statistics I am still trying to get together are the one that says people, the average American adult, has very little time to spend with his family and with his children because of the demands of work with the statistic that tells us the average American adult watches 21 hours of television a week.  Now, it seems to me that if it's as easy as that we can just answer what people ought to do: turn off the TV -- at least during the week -- and check the homework or something.  But this is a matter of people's priorities.  As I've said, it's a free country and people can do what they want.  But every parent -- and I'm a parent -- knows that how you spend your time and where you spend your time has consequences for your children.
<P>
Years ago there was this nice idea of quality time.  "Quality time" is all you need.  Well, maybe there's something true about quality time, but you don't know when it is, and you've got to log a lot of quantity time in order to get the right quality time, because you can't say to your son, "This is our time, buddy.  We're together now for two hours -- what's on your mind?"  It may turn out there isn't anything on his mind.  Then there's some other time he wants it, and it's nice if you were there as opposed to not being there.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How to you feel about your regular appearances on CNN's "Late Edition" with Mario Cuomo?  Is there any convergence of liberal and conservative ideas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Oh yeah.  I think he would agree with a lot of this.  Yes, we had some good moments.  One of the reasons I like Governor Cuomo is he's a liberal and he's not embarrassed to be a liberal.  He and Paul Wellstone, you know, "Here we are, we are liberals, we can do no other."  I don't agree with them, but I admire their guts, because it's two versus everybody in the Republican Party, and virtually everybody in the Democratic Party.  Today liberal is an epithet, and people run from it.  You know, if you call somebody a conservative they say, "Thank you, come to dinner."  But if you call somebody a liberal, they say, "Not me" -- unless you're Paul Wellstone or Mario Cuomo.  So I admire that.
<P>
The other things is we have somewhat similar backgrounds -- two New York Catholics -- although he has pushed that a bit far.  During one of the CNN shows I answered, then he answered, and then he said to Frank Sesno, "What you had in our two answers is the respective perspectives of the Dominicans and the Jesuits."  And that's not good TV.  That is not good talking-head journalism (laughter).  Thank you.<br>

Dear Friend:
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to give you information about <I><B>Empower America</B></I> and our ongoing internship program. 
<P>
<B><I>Empower America</I></B> is a conservative non-profit grass-roots advocacy organization.  We were founded on three main principles which include the beliefs of democratic capitalism, economic growth through entrepreneurship, job creation, lower taxes, sound money, less government regulation, and developing new approaches to cultural and social issues.
<P>
We conduct extensive research into public policy and laws that are being made in Congress.  With this valuable information, we then take positions on the issues.  At that point, we begin to educate our membership on the details of the current policy topic and our positions, and encourage them to become involved in the political process.  We have worked on such issues as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Welfare and Healthcare reform, the California School Choice Initiative and the Washington "Three Strikes Your Out" initiative, to name a few.
<P>
The internship program consists of "hands on" working experience with a leading national grass-roots organization.  We also invite leaders from the political community to participate in our internship program's speakers series which focuses on current government and political issues of the day.  Educational tours of federal and historical buildings will be provided, as well.  This is an exciting, interesting, and educational internship for any college student.
<P>
If you have any questions, or would like to apply, please contact me at (202) 452-8200 or write me at:

<TITLE>Jack Kemp Biography</TITLE>

<P>
<br>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">JACK KEMP<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
Jack Kemp currently is on leave
of absence as co-director of Empower America, a public policy
and advocacy organization he co-founded in 1993 with William Bennett,
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. Empower America is
dedicated to three founding principles: expanding freedom and
democratic capitalism; promoting policies to expand economic growth
and entrepreneurship for our nation; and advancing social policies
which empower people, not government bureaucracies.<BR>
<P>
Prior to founding Empower America,
Mr. Kemp served for four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, and proved to be one of our nation's most innovative
leaders in that role. He was the first and strongest advocate
of Enterprise Zones to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation
in urban America and of expanding homeownership among the poor
through resident management and ownership of public housing.<BR>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Senator Bob Dole
and Speaker Newt Gingrich put Jack Kemp at the center of the tax
and economic debate for the `96 campaign by naming him chairman
of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to
study how major restructuring of our tax code can help unleash
the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow the economy without
inflation and create opportunity for people to escape poverty.
<BR>
<P>
 Before his appointment to the Cabinet,
Mr. Kemp represented the Buffalo area and Western New York for
18 years in the United States House of Representatives from 1971
to 1989.  He served for seven years in the Republican Leadership
as Chairman of the House Republican Leadership Conference.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
 Jack Kemp came to Congress after
13 years as a professional football quarterback.  He was captain
of the San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1962 and also of the Buffalo
Bills, the team he helped lead to the American Football League
championship in 1964 and 1965 when he was named the league's most
valuable player. He also co-founded the AFL Players Association
and was five times elected president.<BR>
<P>
 Mr. Kemp, born and raised in Los
Angeles, is married to the former Joanne Main of Fillmore, California.
 Both Jack and Joanne are graduates of Occidental College. They
have four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James, eleven
grandchildren, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR>

<H1>Effective environmentalism uses a new shade of green</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>GALLATIN GATEWAY, MONT.--  Last week, 17 federal judges gathered at the Gallatin Gateway Inn.  This inn, the last of its kind, was built by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad to attract tourists en route to Yellowstone National Park.  The judges met to hear policy analysts explain a new environmentalism.  </P>

<P>Gallatin Gateway is a perfect setting for meetings.  It's on the geographic margins between Yellowstone National Park and Montana's &quot;Big Sky&quot; country, and on the cultural margins between the new and the old West.</P>

<P>The lecturers were diverse, but a coherent new vision emerged from their training and their shared desire to protect the environment while respecting other values.  The unifying theme was the rejection of top-down, command and control environmentalism.  All favored more flexible, decentralized approaches.  Guest lecturers came from academic institutions, such as the <A HREF="http://www.puaf.umd.edu/Faculty-Staff/nelson.html">University of Maryland</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cc.colorado.edu">Colorado College</A>, and the private sector, like <A HREF="http://www.battelle.org">Battelle Institute</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>.  </P>

<P>The first speaker, Lynn Scarlett, Vice President for Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and a Board Member at the <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/gallatin">Gallatin Institute</A>, set the tone for the conference.  She introduced a &quot;new environmentalism&quot;.  This new shade of green emphasizes the importance of incentives and the imperatives of dispersed information.  The value of market coordination and decentralized decision making is critical to guiding environmental reform.  </P>

<P>Ms. Scarlett led the judges through multiple cases of toxins and pollutants like NOXs, VOCs, and SO2.  For that churning cauldron of sludge, she sees no grand &quot;solutions&quot; to environmental woes -- only trade-offs.  The hundreds of pages in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will not contain &quot;the answer&quot;.  Instead, she claimed, complex and confusing regulations contain the ingredients for error and confrontation.</P>

<P>She described a recent example where <A HREF="http://www.hispanic.org/coors.htm">Adolph Coors Company</A> in Golden, Colo. voluntarily conducted a self-audit of its environmental impact.  The 17-month audit which cost Coors $1.5 million discovered previously unknown emissions in the brewing process.  These emissions were not covered by environmental regulations but far exceeded all of the company's other emissions.  When Coors disclosed this information as a step to obtain permits (which would have been required if environmental quality were the goal), the Colorado Department of Health and the Environment fined Coors more than $1 million for their troubles.  The message of these incentives was perverse: don't be a good citizen -- hide, don't divulge.</P>

<P>This story tells us a lesson.  Antagonistic environmental regulators stifle voluntary cooperation for environmental ends.  Nearly half of the companies recently surveyed by Price Waterhouse expressed reluctance to conduct self-audits because they feared possible punishment.  Slapping fines on firms that investigate their environmental impact, at their own expense and initiative, will effectively deter environmentally sound business practices.  Poorly designed regulatory schemes thwart environmental gains.</P>

<P>Voluntary activities like Coors' clearly foster environmental quality.  Since 1988, Coors has lightened its bottles, cans, and packing by 21% and reduced its contribution to landfills by 850,000 tons.  In 1994 alone, Coors re-used 964,359 tons of packaging materials.  And they saved money in the process.  As the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD">President's Council on Sustainable Development</A> recently reported, &quot;Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive.&quot;</P>

<P>Coors' environmental innovations came in spite of the punitive orientation of state and federal agencies.  Lynn Scarlett reminds us of the critical importance of incentive compatible environmental enforcement.  Coors' observation that &quot;voluntary initiatives are more effective than mandated actions because they create flexible solutions, foster innovation and promote collaboration rather than adversarial relationships&quot; merits the close attention of reformers.</P>

<P>Another speaker at the conference, Felix Romero, told a compelling story about old values of the West.  His story takes us just down the road from Golden, Colo. to a small village of <A HREF="http://www.rmii.com/slv/sanluis/sanluis.htm">San Luis</A>, Colo.  A Spanish land grant dating from the Mexican-American war settlement of 1848, the community owned the valley land in common until the Taylor Ranch cleared title for the land in the 1970s.  With the loss of community property, San Luis' livelihood is threatened by ecological degradation upstream on the Taylor Ranch and by the increasing pressures on what little land they retain.  To remedy this, the La Sierra Foundation of San Luis is attempting to buy the ranch and return property rights to the community.</P>

<P>The new West is one of protected spotted owls, subdivisions, and clashing values.  Each of these forces combine to threaten the rich heritage of Mr. Romero's community.  A strong and sustainable future demands that our &quot;new environmentalism&quot; finds a place for their traditions and practices.  The alternative is subdivided ecosystems, clearcut mountainsides, and dislocated farmers.</P>

<P>The conference brought disparate yet coherent voices to federal judges concerned with environmental values and legal traditions.  The speakers advocated a new paradigm, a different shade of green.  They emphasized property rights, market processes, and responsible liberty as key components of an effective environmentalism.</P>

<P>The judges realize that their role is to interpret the law, not to champion innovative policy changes.  They recognize the need for political entrepreneurs, people with the intellects and statures of U.S. Sens. like <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/senator/bond.html">Kit Bond</A> or <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~bradley/">Bill Bradley</A>.  Such leaders can encourage opportunities for harmonizing our environmental and economic goals.  They would find great support from the many Americans who value environmental quality, responsible liberty, and modest prosperity.</P>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<H1>Liberating National Parks from Political Dependency</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>"By establishing a nonprofit trust to manage the Presidio's property, it gives us a blueprint for national parks that one day will be able to sustain themselves without government funds,"</FONT> President Bill Clinton announced last month.
</P>
<P>
He was in part referring to legislation he signed which turned over management of the Presidio National Park in San Francisco to the Presidio Trust, a quasi-independent public trusteeship charged with making the park sustainable (in the green and in the black).
</P>
<P>
Clinton was also referring to a new chapter in the history of public lands management: public, nongovernmental trusts.  Since the early 1980s, a few scholars have argued for public endowment trusts to run our parks.  These places are too precious to be spoiled by politics.  In 1982, a colleague and I wrote "Endowment Areas: A Clearing in the Policy Wilderness."  In 1984, we proposed park and wilderness management by endowment trusts as "the opportunity to link conservation with fiscal conservatism."  In 1988, I asserted in the <I><A HREF="http://wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A></I> that, "to achieve ecological integrity in the parks, we need to buffer them from transitory political forces" using nonprofit conservation managers.  And, just this last July in the <I><A HREF="http://www.seatimes.com">Seattle Times</A></I>, I again urged employing trusts to "ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics."  Was somebody listening?
</P>

<P>
Public, nongovernmental "trusts" present sensible alternatives.  Endowment boards, like those running museums, hospitals, and private schools, would operate under a legal charter to steward individual parks.  After receiving a one-time Congressional endowment, each park's individual trust would be "on it's own".  The board, established by local environmental groups, business leaders, and citizens, would promote ecologically sensitive economic activities as part of their trustee responsibility.  Creative mechanisms such as a "Friends of Mt. Ranier" program could entice membership, dues, and democratic feedback from park lovers everywhere.  Park trusts would free our parks from their precarious dependency on national politics, encourage long-term planning, and reintroduce accountability in management.
</P>

<P>
Other innovative policies are being discussed.  Park supporters are beginning to see that the only way to ensure the long-term health of our parks, both financially and ecologically, is to make them dependent on their users and supporters -- not Congressmen in Washington or political appointees.  Some advocate charging businesses that using parks' features in their advertising, ending decades of free lunches for Madison Avenue.  Others advocate charging market prices for recreation in the park, and then letting the individual parks keep the bulk of the revenues.  Park managers would then have the incentive guarantee their park offers what the public wants, protected from politicians plundering their budget.  They would nurture the parks' highest values: scenery, preservation, recreation, and heritage.
</P>

<P>
No system is perfect, and some failures are expected.  Not all parks created by Congress truly deserve that label.  Parks like Steamtown (Penn.) and the Presidio face monumental challenges in paying their own way and proving their unique value.  The Presidio Trust hopes to make the park self-sufficient in 15 years.  This means cutting costs and finding $25 million in annual revenues to offset the federal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
But the reality of politics and parks probably won't let that happen.  First, the Presidio Trust isn't independent of the government.  The Park Service can still undertake construction on the land -- and it plans a whopping $611 million in improvements.  More subsidies to the Trust permit it to borrow from the U.S. Treasury and use the Justice Department's legal services.  Politics enter the fray because Clinton appoints the Trust's board members rather than having them elected by at-large supporters.
</P>
<P>
With subsidized rents, the costs of running the Presidio as a glorified office park may simply be too high.  Office rentals today cover just one-tenth of the park's operating budget, and recreation fees on the 740 undeveloped acres are unlikely to cover the rest.  When Trustees complain about the required restoration work, can Uncle Sam resist coming to the rescue?  If a waiting list for renters forms, we predict that politically "correct" groups like the Thoreau Center for Sustainability will go to the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that American politicians have the discipline and restraint to permit the Presidio to sink or swim on its merits.  However, the Omnibus Parks bill puts us on the learning curve.  Persistent failures, like the ecological and political problems so common with the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> (elk overgrazing, fire buildup, decaying infrastructure and buildings, radical simplification of ecosystems, etc.), demand alternatives to the political Park bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
There is a compelling need to divorce the national park system from federal budgetary politics.  Clinton declared that our parks should "be able to sustain themselves without government funds," and he pledged to "put our national treasures beyond partisan politics and put the people of America, their future and their environment above that."  Fiscal conservatives and environmentalists alike can support this movement and cheer our progress in harmonizing sound ecological and economic ideas.

<H1>Economics Help for Santa</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Here is my gift to you for this Christmas season and the ones to follow.  If you have friends and relatives for whom it's hard to buy holiday gifts, you'll find economic thinking helpful indeed.  
</P>
<P>
But you may wonder how economists, followers of the "dismal science," can contribute to the holiday season?  Surely not by calculating changes in retail sales and the like.  Though economics is perceived as calculating not compassionate, economic analysis can offer great insight into even the warmest, most spiritual holidays, like Christmas.  This logic applies to all occasions meriting meaningful gifts.
</P>
<P>
Gift-giving presents challenges to friends, family, co-workers, and business associates.  What to get someone who has everything or the ability to buy themselves far more than you could possibly afford?  Or someone who says "anything would be fine, it's the thought that counts"?  Everyone gets stumped over gift ideas, whether you are a child giving to your parents, an employee shopping for your boss, or giving to wealthy friends.  Economics can help with those hard choices which plague us each time of gift giving.  
</P>
<P>
A well known economist at the <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu:1180/">University of Washington</A>, Robert Thomas, recommends to give cash.  Then, everyone could buy that which they value most.  But unless it implies genuine sacrifice, cold cash from cold calculists demeans the Christmas spirit, so I recommend a different approach.
</P>
<P>
Giving cash is not stupid, but a bit insensitive and definitely sub-optimal when the recipient is not genuinely poor.  While convenient, giving cash neglects a key economic principle dear to economists, "comparative advantage".  Everyone has their own niche, something that they are just much better at than anything else.  Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman reminds us, "we should concentrate on doing those things we do best, those things where our superiority is the greatest."  It could mean cross-stitching a pillow, or getting excellent tee times at a favorite course.  That in which you have an advantage makes for ideal gifts, because they cost you much less than other, comparable gifts would.  The Microsoft employee has a huge comparative advantage in getting discounted software, so we'll expect "<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/default.asp">Win 95</A>" in his friend's stockings.
</P>
<P>
If your comparative advantage wouldn't make a good gift, then look towards the "comparative disadvantages" of the receiver.  If the recipient has a relatively tough time doing something, then their disadvantage can be turned into great gift ideas.  Applying this principle requires knowing the recipient's interests and tastes.  Fortunately, these are exactly the people we want to please, those we know and care about.  This could mean setting up your technologically inept parents' home computer with all the bells and whistles, or sending Levis to friends overseas.  These gifts, while quite easy for one person, can be extra valuable to others.
</P>
<P>
Economists also recommend taking advantage of knowledge differences.  Friedrich A. Hayek notes that "practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made."  For example, an old friend and business associate had long wanted a certain antique China pattern, but always thought it was no longer available.  I knew better, and tracked down what became a very memorable Christmas gift for him.  Some of the best presents are gifts that others wouldn't have thought of getting themselves, either because they weren't aware of them, or because you have a particular expertise in that field.  Giving someone with similar tastes a book you've already read and enjoyed takes advantage of this technique.
</P>
<P>
Comparative advantages, disadvantages, and knowledge differences are things that successful parents and businesspeople use every day, usually unconsciously.  In doing so, they increase their wealth and the goods and services available to others.  By thinking about these principles and applying them to gift giving, their tasks will be easier and their friends and loved ones more pleased.

This special issue of FREE Perspectives is focused on "managing the commons."  
<BR>This anticipates FREE's upcoming book of the same name, published 
<BR>by Indiana University Press.  Co-contributing editors John A. Baden and 
<BR>Douglas S. Noonan bring the classic literature on the "tragedy of the commons" <BR>together with recent insights to the theory and practice of managing the commons.  <BR>The book builds upon the twenty years of scholarship that has evolved since <BR>Garrett Hardin and John Baden originally produced Managing the Commons in 1977.  
<BR>Look for the second edition of Managing the Commons in 1997.</B></I>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT"  Vspace= 8 HSPACE=12 WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=151 ALT="John Baden" SRC= "/free/Images/John.gif"> The <I>Tragedy of the Commons</I>  is probably the world's best-known commentary on the political economy of natural resources.  
<BR>Garrett Hardin, its author, linked ecology and economics, our environment and our institutions.  The key insight is straightforward and profound:  tragedy strikes the commons when self interest andsocial interest diverge.  For example, without social constraints, a strictly self-interested rancher would overgraze his cows on the commons at the expense of the community.  A 
fundamental problem of social organization is to design effective, efficient, 
and resistent constraints.  It's a never-ending task.
<P>
The logic of the commons is evident throughout the world.  Ocean fisheries, 
national parks, and ground water are examples of commons.  Overexploited 
fisheries exemplify this tragedy of the commons.  Similarly, congestion in 
national parks arises from individuals taking advantage of unmanaged 
(and underpriced) access, even when the optimal number of visitors is 
much lower.  Highway rush hours also display classic symptoms of the 
commons tragedy.
<P>
Recent discussions have turned to more esoteric examples of commons.  
Computer processing capacity may be a commons for network users.  Users 
will demand processor energy because the cost to them is negligible, but 
too many individual requests will overload the system.  The national 
budget is a commons of sorts, where individual interest groups vie for 
greater benefits, even if it's over-allocated and we are running a deficit.  
Opportunistic politicians view government as an engine of plunder.  They 
see elections as struggles for the levers that control the flow.
<P>
Managing the commons is a persistent and pervasive challenge because: 
(1) implementing long-enduring management institutions is difficult, and 
(2) continual innovation leads appropriators to new common-resource 
pools.  Innovative technologies and entrepreurial ingenuity create new 
resources and make previously marginal ones profitable.  In avert to the 
tragedy, management institutions must evolve around the newborn 
resources.
<P>
One particularly complex, abstract, and problematic commons involves 
biological-evolutionary resources.  Consider the human capacity to resist 
disease.  Mankind's increasing resistance to environmental pathogens is a 
very valuable resource to society as a whole.  For instance, as a gene pool 
evolves a resistance to smallpox, its members benefit immensely.  The 
biological process of developing resistance, however, necessarily remains 
at least one step behind the pathogen.  The resistance is reactive.  This 
means that individuals are frequently adversely affected by the 
beginnings of epidemics before resistances are developed.  When 
individuals become infected by a life-threatening pathogen, their rational 
alternative is medical technology.  Today we seek "magic bullets" in the 
form of antibiotics.  
<P>
But this individual benefit imposes social costs.  The use of some antibiotics 
and anti-malarial drugs cause pathogens to evolve in a very short period 
of time.   The pathogens respond with ever-greater resistance; their 
version of armor.  Eventually, they can pose a growing threat.  Our 
resistances and drugs are considerably less effective against the "super-
pathogens".  Like ranchers putting too many cows out to pasture, the 
common "resistance" of society is degraded as some individuals benefit.
<P>
Another example of the "biological-evolutionary resource" commons 
relates to agricultural pesticides.  Spraying DDT in small quantities once 
had remarkable success.  Insects, however, have notoriously short 
reproductive cycles.  This allows micro-evolution to quickly reduce the 
usefulness of DDT and other pesticides.  Thus, in a very, very short period 
of time, increasing dosages were required to achieve constant results.
<P>
The pesticide-resistant bugs reflect a commons logic.  Any farmer can 
benefit in the short term from spraying.  But pesticides eventually create 
super-pests.  This divergence in interests, between the individual and 
society, is the key to the tragedy of the commons.
<P>
Bio-engineering increasingly poses another example of a new commons.  
Genetically altered crops like corn and cotton have been bred with 
resistance to pests, a resistance that could save farmers billions of dollars 
in crop losses each year.  But bio-engineered crops, like pesticides, may 
hasten the evolution of super-pests.  The emerging science of "resistance 
management" aims to optimize yield from these crops by diluting super-
pests with "unresistant" pests and other techniques.  It remains to be seen 
if the science of behavioral ecology and the restraint of farmers are 
sufficient to avert another potential tragedy.
<P>
The biological-evolutionary weakness of mankind's predators is a tricky 
common-pool resource.  Biological dynamics imply that the attributes of 
mankind's biotic enemies always change while our technology always lags.  
Often, the benefits of self-restraint, of not using high doses of antibiotics or 
pesticides, would be gained by future generations.  It is naturally very 
difficult to design institutions that value the varied and unknowable 
interests of the distant future.
<P>
This issue of <CITE>FREE Perspectives</CITE> introduces classic and new problems of 
"managing the commons". First, <A HREF="/free/FP/TragedyCommons.html">Hardin</A> and <A HREF="/free/FP/EconomicsEcologyExchange.html">Robert Taylor</A> each introduce 
the nature of the commons.  Following that are thoughts from the <A HREF="/free/FP/ViewfromAirlie.html"><CITE>View 
from Airlie</CITE></A>, a ground-breaking examination of <A HREF="/free/FP/ConservationPerformance.html">community-based 
conservation</A>.  They discuss the relationship between the community and 
public-owned resources.  <A HREF="/free/FP/NationalisationofLand.html">Matt Ridley</A> also examines the importance of 
secure property rights and the pathologies of state-encroachment on 
property.  Lastly, <A HREF="/free/FP/CostsofInnovation.html">Douglas Noonan</A> explores the role of entrepreneurs as both a 
trigger of and a solution to the "tragedy of the commons" in fisheries.  In sum, these essays clarify the dangers of the unmanaged commons and offer insight into some possible solutions. <center><img WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=163 src="Cows.gif"></center>

<H1>Wolf and Man in Montana</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden

<p>
<P><CODE>DATELINE:  ENTERPRISE RANCH, GALLATIN VALLEY, MONTANA</CODE></P>

<P>Our ranch lies in the northern reaches of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.  Calving has started, lambing will shortly follow, and soon we'll put the livestock out to range.  And wolves have just arrived in Yellowstone Park.</P>

<P>In Montana, and in Idaho as well, few issues are more complex and emotional than those concerning wolves.  For three generations people vilified, mythologized, and killed wolves.  More recently, many environmentalists, myself included, have sought to restore this ancient predator to Yellowstone Park and wilderness areas.  Returning the wolf replaces an important part of the ecological tapestry that humanity has unwoven.  But, given people's divergent values, it is not surprising that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) recent reintroduction of the gray wolf has fostered great fears and extravagant hopes.  </P>

<P>The controversy surrounding reintroduction is demonstrated by the 170,000 public comments received on the project's Environmental Impact Statement.  Lawsuits opposing reintroduction have been filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation and the American Farm Bureau Federation.  They indicate significant rural resistance despite widespread public support. </P>

<P>But wolves are already returning to Montana.  Seventy five arrived naturally, migrating from the Canadian Rockies.  Like glaciers of the last ice age, they are slowly expanding southward.  They are drawn by the dramatic increases in ungulate populations, primarily elk and deer, created by clear-cutting in public and private forests.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service's decade-long effort to reintroduce 100 wolves into the Greater Yellowstone area and central Idaho (which contains the largest unroaded wilderness in the lower 48 states) accelerates a process well underway.  </P>

<P>Wildlife biologists consider wolves one of the easiest species to manage.  Established wolf packs stay in well defined and fiercely guarded territories.  Thus they have low population densities and are easily located.  Wolves are also afraid of new things and tend to avoid them.  And if there is any doubt about who holds the upper hand in human-wolf coexistence, we might remember that wolves, once one of the most broadly distributed large mammals in North America, have been exterminated wherever they competed with man.  A decade ago, only remnant populations existed in wilderness areas or at the sufferance of humanity.  </P>

<P>With careful management, humans and wolves can coexist.  Even with 75 wolves in northwestern Montana, only two cow calves were killed last year.  None were killed in 1993.  Like members of religious groups, wolves learn what is appropriate to eat.  At Nine Mile Ranch near Missoula, wolves live with livestock and deer.  The trick is to keep them from learning to eat livestock.  At Nine Mile, radio collars allow researchers to monitor the animals' locations.  If a wolf kills livestock its punishment is swift and harsh:  It is shot with a tranquilizer gun and transported far away.  The trauma usually dissuades the wolf from future livestock predation.  Second offenses are punished by death, lest a problem animal teach others the joys of beefsteak and lamb chops. </P>

<P>The trials of Nine Mile Ranch hold another important lesson:  Coexistence requires experience, intensive management, and ongoing effort.  Reintroducing wolves is not a magical, effortless restoration of fairy tale ecosystems.  Yes, wolves will restore some balance to an ecosystem burdened by destructive numbers of deer, elk, and buffalo.  Without predators and Indian hunting, these animals are over browsing the land and eroding its beauty, diversity and health.  Nevertheless, wolves bring difficulties of their own.  </P>

<P>In spite of biologists' confidence in their ability to manage wolves and environmentalists' enthusiasm, ranchers and residents in the reintroduction areas have legitimate fears.  Wolves pose both a practical and a symbolic threat.  They do attack livestock and pets.  They also represent a shift in control of Western lands orchestrated from Washington, DC.  In short, people fear that the costs of this exercise in nostalgic ecotopianism are unfairly concentrated on their families, their stock, and their land values.   </P>

<P>Nor are their fears groundless.  On January 30, a few days after the release of the first 25 wolves, a dead wolf and a dead calf appeared.  The wolf was shot after eating the calf.  But this was no surprise, the Fish and Wildlife Service's environmental impact statement predicted wolves will kill several dozen cows and sheep each year, and several hundred elk and deer.</P>

<P>To address some of these concerns, Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group, has created a fund to compensate ranchers whose stock is killed by wolves.  But these funds are neither limitless nor eternal.  They do not cover lost pets, reduced opportunities for hunting, or the hurt associated with losing an animal to the brutal rending of a wolf pack.  To minimize these effects, ranchers should be free to shoot problem wolves and otherwise deter them from developing a taste for cattle and sheep. </P>

<P>Restoring wolves is a worthy project that reflects well on our evolving sensitivity to nature.  We are now wealthy and educated enough to afford such magnanimity.  But it will be hard.  Pretending these problems away is irresponsible.  It is also poor environmental policy to ignore ecological realities.</P>

<H2>Resource Politics Miss the Forest for the Trees</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John Baden and Pete Geddes</P>

<P>BOZEMAN, MONT.-  Snow is still ten feet deep on the Spanish Peaks just south of town, but summer is coming to the Gallatin Valley.  Greening fields and the sudden emergence of kayaks and mountain bikes tells us the annual crush of tourists will soon arrive in the region's national parks and forests. </P>

<P>Recreation is serious business in Montana. Locals aren't pleased with the U.S. Forest Service's latest proposal to sell timber in Bozeman's backyard.  The Forest Service plans to sell 4.7 million board feet of timber from the Gallatin National Forest, which borders Yellowstone National Park.  If the sale goes forward, approximately 1,175 18-wheelers full of dead trees will roll down Hyalite Canyon, one of the most heavily used recreation areas in the state. </P>

<P>The Forest Service first tried to offer this sale in 1990.  Planning proceeded until a 1995 judicial injunction stopped it.  But the Forest Service offered the sale again under a legal provision called the Salvage Rider, an amendment to the 1996 budget designed to speed the harvest of dead trees.  The Salvage Rider insulates sales like this one from citizen appeals and mandates the Forest Service offer almost 5 billion board feet of &quot;salvage&quot; timber this year.</P>

<P>The Hyalite sale exemplifies how Congress misses opportunities to harmonize sound economics with ecological values.  Freshman Republicans, who claim to favor markets over bureaucracies, instead require command-and-control agencies to mandate flows of commodities.  The laws treat Forest Service officials as if they are commissars of a socialized factory producing trees.  And Democrats offer nothing more constructive than the standard orthodoxy of &quot;improved&quot; regulation and oversight.</P>

<P>The Gallatin National Forest is one of the nation's premier recreation areas.  The Hyalite sale faces massive local opposition over aesthetic, economic and ecological concerns. As in typical, this sale will cost taxpayers far more than the timber is worth; even the agency's creative accounting describes the sale's profitability as &quot;marginal.&quot;</P>

<P>Increasingly, the highest economic use of national forests lies in recreation rather than commodity production.  In the Gallatin National Forest according forest economist Randal O'Toole, of the Oregon-based <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>, it costs taxpayers $50,000 per year to maintain a single timber-related job.  Mr O'Toole found that the recreation industry directly employed 1,200 people; timber jobs only 50.  By requiring the Forest Service to sell goods at far below their true costs, Congress undermines the region's natural transition from a commodity-based to service- and information-based economy.  What's more, government &quot;dumping&quot; of cheap timber makes the market unpredictable for private-sector commodity suppliers, reducing their incentive to manage land responsibly.</P>

<P>Such policies represent the last gasps of Progressive Era resource management identified with Teddy Roosevelt.  His well intentioned but naive idea that benevolent centralized bureaucracies would protect the nation's natural resources and provide a measure of economic stability has proved a failure.  </P>

<P>In 1905 Roosevelt's boxing buddy, Gifford Pinchot, created the Forest Service to protect vast tracts of Western lands.  The agency developed the image as a tough white-hat in a still untamed region.  Pinchot promised efficient, responsive and scientific management; the agency still poses as the model of bureaucratic efficiency.  But over the next 90 years the Forest Service mutated from a small, idealistic bureau of scientific managers into a growth-addicted agency intent on protecting and perpetuating its own budget and power.  Well intentioned and hardworking professionals are caught in a pressure cooker of conflicting values: central planning, changing social values, strict environmental regulations, new ecological science and an increasingly amenity-based Western economy.</P>

<P>In today's West the irony of the Progressive legacy is starkly clear.  Remote bureaucrats, allied with subsidized production interests, establishh mandates both insensitive to local values and insulated from market processes.  The results devastate both communities and ecosystems.  Meanwhile, Western senators and representatives, addicted to subsidies,  perpetuate the myth that the region is a land of rugged individualists.</P>

<P>It's time for the Forest Service to abandon its role as a producer of commodities.  Instead, the agency should focus its considerable expertise on the protection of wilderness and wildlife and the promotion of recreation and research in national forests.  Commodity production is best left to the private sector.   Rethinking Progressive Era approaches to natural resource management challenges politicians of all stripes.  Successful reforms must encourage harmony between ecology, sound economics and responsible liberty. These intellectual foundations are well established.  The politician who builds on them will earn the mantle of conservationist, in the best tradition of TR.  </P>

<H1>Lessons in a Supermarket</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Ramona Marotz-Baden

<p>
     Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, contains a
modest supermarket that offers valuable lessons.  This store has
tens of thousands of items of various sizes and brands, generic
labels, and bulk products.  Competition for the consumer's dollar
occurs among this and other stores, brands within the store, and
different products within individual brands.

<p>
     Among the stores in Bozeman, as elsewhere, the shopkeepers
compete in offering differing mixes of service and economy.  Each
grocer seeks to attract and satisfy consumers holding varying
degrees of wealth, economic sophistication, nutritional
knowledge, and body-type preference associated with differing
food groups.

<p>
     Competition responds to differing consumer preferences for
health, economy, convenience, and vanity.  In these stores we see
people as diverse as ranchers who survived the dust bowls of the
1930s, refugees of the counter-culture of the 1960s who look like
they are in a time warp, Park City blondes from Dallas summering
at Big Sky, and neo-Spartan hedonists of all ages who bounce
among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain
trails.  We find them all in Albertson's at the University Mall.

<p>
     Individuals representing all of these types shop cheek to
jowl, sample ice cream and fajita strips in the aisles, and
peacefully shuffle through the check-out lines at the supermarket
located between the Bonanza Steak House and Yogi's Vegetarian
Bakery.  Stores and suppliers who fail to satisfy are passed by
in favor of those who offer more attractive products.

<p>
     In this setting offered by a free and open market system,
each can satisfy his wants without imposing his preferences on
others.  In this manner, diversity, freedom of choice, and
innovations are all encouraged.  In this imperfect world, we can
hardly ask for anything more.  Yet, there is another huge
advantage we normally take entirely for granted.

<p>
     Surely the store in the mall provides a model for
efficiently responding to diverse and rapidly changing
preferences.  But this efficiency, marvelous though it is, is
only the minor miracle.  The benefits of harmonious interaction
fostered by market exchange in accordance with the rule of
willing consent is the greater benefit.

<p>
     Market exchange, subject to willing participation by fullfacultied 
individuals, permits people with radically differing
views to peacefully coexist.  In Bozeman there are a substantial
number of hard-core vegetarians.  They can shop peacefully and
amicably with rancher and logger meat-eaters who consume
vegetables only as a concession to their health.

<p>
     Bozeman is also a national center for teetotaling SeventhDay 
Adventists.  The supermarket accommodates their preference
for nonalcoholic wine, and they shop harmoniously with those
whose nightly ritual includes a bottle of French wine.  This
peaceful interaction occurs only because all transactions are
voluntary.  Imagine the uproar if the decisions to permit the
selling of wine were determined in the political arena!

<p>
     Nearly all analysts who have seriously studied the free
market agree that the market promotes efficiency, diversity, and
innovations which respond to consumers' changing preferences.
Few, however, appreciate the degree to which private property
rights and free exchange foster harmony and peace.  This set of
social arrangements renounces coercion as a means for making
choices.  These arrangements enable people who feel strongly
about such issues as vegetarianism or prohibition to coexist
constructively with people holding antithetical views.

<p>
     What if the stocking of a grocery store were determined
politically?  Think of the fights between vegetarians and meateaters; 
the teetotalers and those who enjoy wine with dinner; the
granola organics who argue against pesticides and the farmers who
find chemicals useful; the populists who are strongly opposed to
corporate agriculture and those with an interest in these firms;
employed mothers who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be
closed on Sunday.

<p>
     Fortunately, most of these decisions have been kept out of
the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their
consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the
force of law.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the
predictable results of a free market economy.

<H1>Taking the Folly Out of the Act</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan
</P>

<P> 	Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Regulations that generate poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P>

<P>	Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could freely use their land, even if endangered species habitat was harmed.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P>

<P>	While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences. The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species without compensation.  Even the Armed Forces during wartime cannot do this.  The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights protects us from being forced to shelter soldiers by requiring the military to pay its way.  Landowners get compensated when Green Berets invade, but not when spotted owls do.</P>

<P>	Forcing landowners to maintain habitat has made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P>

<P>	We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P>

<P>	They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P>

<P>	In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1,560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pay taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P>

<P>	Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevents them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P>

<P>	The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.  </P>

<P> [see chart data as appearing in <CITE>Different Drummer</CITE>]</P>

<P>	The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P>

<P>	Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P>

<P>	&quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P>

<P>	Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P>

<P>	Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P>

<P>	Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co. agreed and found dens for wolves.  As a reward, the Defenders of Wildlife paid them a cash bounty.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P>

<P>	With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species. </P>

<H2>Al Gore's Newest Horror Story</H2>

<P>As appearing in <CITE>The American Enterprise</CITE>, July/August issue.</P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>



<P><CITE><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> </CITE>  portrays a frightening world where synthetic chemicals assault our fertility, intelligence, and survival.  But instead of delivering substance, it capitalizes on hype.  It hit bookstores just in time for Earth Day and on the heels of the National Academy of Sciences' investigation of synthetic estrogens.  Thanks to the big behind-the-scenes boost given to the book by Fenton Communications-the same PR firm that ginned up the 1989 Alar-on-apples scare-the book received coverage in nearly all national media, and backing from hip cultural figures like Robert Redford.  </P>

<P>The book's message is dramatic, urgent, and personal:  In a terrible &quot;Faustian bargain,&quot; we have bought technological progress at the price of the environment, the well-being of our children, and perhaps even our survival.  Touted as a &quot;scientific detective story,&quot; the book combines suspenseful narrative and apocalyptic overtones into a real page-turner.  Ambiguous prophecies of &quot;fates worse than extinction,&quot; of terrible forces that are &quot;slow, invisible, and indirect,&quot; are bandied about darkly.</P>

<P>The villains are chemical manufacturers and profiteering corporations.  Synthetic chemicals, the authors say, are disrupting human hormones and causing widespread developmental abnormalities.  The authors suggest that synthetic chemicals could potentially be responsible for nearly every prominent social ill.  Poverty, educational breakdown, crime, homosecuality, deteriorating family life-these may all be the fault of corporations like DuPont and Dow Corning.</P>

<P>Actually, hormones disruptors are poorly understood, and there is no conclusive evidence linking developmental problems and environmental chemicals.  The science behind <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  is also unorthodox.  It indicts causality and other basic tools of the scientific method that have been used to challenge envirnomental claims.  Indeed, it rejects the scientific method itself as Enlightenment arrogance.  That kind of thinking, the book argues, is what got us into this mess in the first place.  A new wave of thinking, &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; is now required.</P>

<P>This brings to mind the debate over global warming.  Problems in human reproduction and development, like climate change, can only be reliably observed over long periods of time.  Links between plastic lining in beer cans and illiteracy are about as tenuous as links between chlorofluorocarbons and the 1996 blizzard in New England.  But the authors are very clever.  They display short-term tragedies and augur long-term catastrophes.  So none of their claims can be disproved in the near future.  </P>

<P>The marketing appeal of the synthetic chemical scare far surpasses that of global warming alarmists.  It is racy and anecdotal:  Synthetic chemicals affect our sexuality; they are so prevalent no one can escape them.  Painful, personal experiences pile up.  One couple's dreams of a family are ruined by DES, another sees their children's future spoiled by DDT, a third is rendered infertile by declining sperm counts.  Al Gore, who wrote the introduction for this book, invokes children three times.</P>

<P>Fortunately, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  Reputable responders trash the book for all manner of scientific and logical flaws.  And after repeated wolf-calling, the public has become more jaded and cynical about predictions of ecological catastrophe. </P>

<H2>Flying Blind or Running Scared?</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.LibertySoft.com/liberty"><CITE>Liberty Magazine</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>

<P>	In its foreward, Vice President Al Gore announces that <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> &quot;raises compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  The book has been promoted as the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>, Rachel Carson's 1962 book that spawned much of the environmental movement.  More likely, it marks the end of an era of gullibility, hysteria, and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and rhetoric are becoming pass&eacute;.</P>

<P>	The book was written by Theo Colborn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a journalist.  Their &quot;scientific detective story&quot; - provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot; - alleges that synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, Tide, etc.) disrupt hormones.  These hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, they claim, ranging from domestic violence to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  The cure?  Ban them.</P>

<P>	The book's timing was perfect.  The National Academy of Sciences had just convened to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrived on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day - and just as Congress was being taken to task over environmental issues.  It had a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It was, and is, a PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>	Yet it's flopping.  It has been thoroughly trashed by the <A HREF="http://www.nyt.com">New York Times</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com">Los Angeles Times</A>, Washington Post, and Washington Times for all manner of flaws, including panic-mongering, junk science, and poor writing.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> falls into a trap common to conventional environmentalism:  it ignores trade-offs.  Abandoning the 100,000-plus chemicals that play a role in the 45% of the world's economic activity would be extraordinarily costly.  The authors demand &quot;eliminating the use and release of hazardous compounds,&quot; setting standards to protect those most vulnerable, reducing the numbers of chemicals on the market and in given products, using only easily detectable and well-understood chemicals, and phasing out synthetic chemical manufacture.  Such &quot;broad government action&quot; doesn't come cheap.  Mandatory monitoring and disclosure laws for chemical manufacturers, water companies, grocers, and distributors will ultimately impose sizable costs on consumers.</P>

<P>	Implementing <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>'s recommendations would close off many valuable opportunities.  Immense benefits to food production and delivery systems would be lost.  The benefits of plastics, medical drugs, and synthetics would cease to be available.  According to Dr. Lorenz Rhomberg of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, &quot;a crash program of [hormone disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.  This could divert regulatory and research attention away from other, true causes of breast cancer, birth defects, and wildlife toxicity.&quot;  These lost opportunitites would be costly indeed.</P>

<P>	Costs alone do not invalidate a policy option, of course.  The costs and benefits of any policy must be acknowledged and reconciled.  We know that reckless proliferation of synthetic chemicals may bring reproductive ruin to affected wildlife.  Conversely, a ban may bring unbearable costs to economies and ecosystems worldwide.  Competing interests must be reconciled.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> fails to do this.</P>

<P>	Except once.  The authors do make an exception to their absolutist position when they acknowledge that breast-feeding is a primary source of contamination.  Breast-feeding &quot;exposes infants to disturbing levels of chemical contaminants ... levels ten to forty times greater than the daily exposure of an adult.&quot;  </P>

<P>	So the prime culprit in &quot;stealing our future&quot; is the sacred practice of breast-feeding.  It is easy, trendy, and politically correct to recommend organically growing one's own foods, avoiding animal fats, and giving babies unpainted toys.  It is not acceptable to bash breast-feeding.  In a rare instance of prudence, the authors write, &quot;We know too little to judge how the undeniable benefits of breast-feeding balance against the risks of transferring hormonally active contaminants.  While we have great concern, it is premature to advise women against breast-feeding.&quot;  The authors would do well to consider trade-offs in all their recommendations.</P>

<H3>Pseudoscience and Pseudo-Rights</H3>

<P>	Sifting through the morass of conjecture, innuendo, and propaganda in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is nearly impossible.  Its backwards methodologies and hysterical biases betray what might be valuable evidence.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> rejects classic ideals of scientific proof for failing to address the alleged hormonal threat.  Out with hypothesizing explanations for observations; in with &quot;eco-epidemiology.&quot; The weight of the evidence now depends on &quot;value judgments&quot; such as &quot;how much risk we are willing to entertain.&quot;  Of course, value judgments can't be disproven.  They are sovereign decrees, not testable hypotheses.</P>

<P>	Colborn, a leader in &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; tells us that chemicals, unlike people, must be judged guilty until proven innocent.  Basic logic dictates that one cannot prove a negative.  Unicorns may well frolic in the forest.  We cannot disprove that possibility, because someone can always claim we haven't looked hard enough.  Conversely, we could readily prove it if we saw them.</P>

<P>	Similarly, a presumption of chemical guilt places the burden of proof on chemical manufacturers, even though proving that their chemicals don't disrupt hormones is logically and technically impossible.  One could always claim that the manufacturer hasn't looked hard enough.  No harm to the first generation doesn't prove no harm to the second, or third, or tenth.  The infinite combination of varying chemicals, circumstances, and levels of susceptibility render the task absurd.</P>

<P>	Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers also offer a declaration of inviolable rights, starting with &quot;children have a right to be born chemical-free.&quot;  This epitomizes the book's irresponsible and naive rhetoric.  They authors do not identify who has the responsibility for guaranteeing those rights.  The judicial system is responsible for ensuring a right to due process.  Who can have responsibility for &quot;chemical-free births?&quot;</P>

<P>	To be born free from synthetic chemicals, the authors tell us, requires that mothers are themselves free from chemicals.  This requires &quot;that women minimize the consumption of animal fat from birth until the end of their childbearing years.&quot;  They must also avoid exposure to plastics, pesticides, and detergents.  Little girls playing with painted or plastic toys as infants, the authors note, may be violating their future children's right to chemical-free nativity.  </P>

<P>	Obviously, this &quot;right&quot; is for bumper stickers, not serious analysis.</P>

<P>	Another unequivocal right advocated in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is the &quot;right to know&quot;what chemicals are in one's food, water, and other consumer goods.  This is echoed by Al Gore, who writes, &quot;All of us have the right to know and the obligation to learn.&quot;  </P>

<P>	In practical terms, this &quot;right to know&quot; is an exceedingly expensive entitlement.  Its costs would first be brone by chemical manufacturers and distributors.  The costs would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher price tags and burdensome instruction manuals detailing the biochemistry of lettuce and businesswear.</P>

<P>	The authors want us to pay for this right by imposing a duty on manufacturers and distributors, because they have deeper pockets.  In this, they neglect the superior power of market forces.  With proper incentives, competition - not mandated disclosure laws and high transaction costs - will drive the market to satisfy customer preferences.  If the consumers really want to know, they can purchase that knowledge like they purchase organic lettuce.  And lettuce producers will find ways to communicate that knowledge flexibly, effectively, and inexpensively via certification.  The market rewards those who please customers.</P>

<P>	To be fair, there is one useful prescriptive message of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>: the admonition that we move beyond &quot;the cancer paradigm&quot;.  Too much research has been driven by the cancer scare of the 1970s, the War on Cancer, and hype over cancer rates.  In a way, our past experience with cancer helps explain why this book takes such a hysterical tone.  The politics of funding research pushes money toward trendy scares.  The mysterious role of natural and synthetic estrogens in the development of animals and humans does needs explaining, and a prudent, cautious, and scientific response to the important questions of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is definitely in order.  A &quot;War on Synthetic Chemicals&quot; is most definitely not - but the success of the War on Cancer, in attracting funding if not in curing cancer, speaks volumes about why Colborn and company might call for one.  </P>

<H3>Flying Blinded</H3>

<P>	Modern chemistry has brought benefits to society too numerous to list.  But this better living has had its costs.  </P>

<P>	DDT and CFCs prove that not all good things go together.   When DDT first arrived, Paul M&uuml;ller won the Nobel Prize for his seemingly miraculous chemical compound.  As Silent Spring and recent history have shown, DDT is not unambiguously wondrous.  It carries severe consequences for much wildlife and some humans.  Chlorofluorocarbons, similarly, were heralded as &quot;one of the safest substances ever invented.&quot;  Half a century passed before CFCs were blamed for imperiling life on this planet.</P>

<P>	So technological progress, while beneficial, is neither free nor without risks.  Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers take this observation much farther.  They find civilization plunging arrogantly into the future with &quot;dangerous ignorance&quot; and risky &quot;hubris&quot;.  The risks and realities of progress have always existed, they admit, but the scale of mankind's impact now encompasses the entire Earth.  The stakes have become too high.  The risks and trade-offs of advancement are now intolerable.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> claims that we are, in essence, &quot;flying blind&quot; towards our destiny.  What do we do when we see a dark, nebulous shape ahead?  Will we race through it, hoping it is a cloud and not a mountainside?  Will we slow down?  Or will we &quot;land the plane as quickly as possible&quot;?  The technophobic authors embrace the last option.  Phase-outs, bans on new chemicals, and safer ways to &quot;meet basic human needs&quot; are &quot;the only way to opt out of the experiment.&quot;  </P>

<P>	We are flying blind to the future, and the authors want off the plane as soon as possible. They long for an idyllic past, when synthetic chemicals didn't exist and mankind only satisfied its basic needs.  But renouncing modernity and stifling progress will mean taking away most of the twentieth century's benefits.  It takes a much more convincing argument than <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> to cajole a full plane to land, just because someone with a window seat sees a cloud and feels some turbulence.  Responsible analysts and policy makers will advocate policies based on sound science and the broad interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of crisis entrepreneurs.</P>

<CENTER><H2>NOTABLE QUOTABLES OF 1995</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<center><h3>The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting</h3></center>
<P>
<center>December 18, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 26)</center>
<P>
<br><P>
Welcome to the Media Research Center's annual awards issue, a 
compilation of the most outrageous and/or humorous news media 
quotes from 1995. To determine this year's winners, a panel of 57 
talk show hosts, magazine editors, columnists, editorial writers 
and media observers each selected their choices for the first, 
second and third best quote from six to ten quotes in each 
category. First place selections were awarded three points, second 
place choices two points, with one point for the third place 
selections. A list of the judges appears on the back page. (This 
issue covers quotes from December 1994 through Nov. 1995.)
The first quote under each award heading is the winner, followed 
in order by the top runners-up.
<P><br><p>
<center><h3>The Contract's Not Done Until Every Child Is Dead Award</h3></center>
<P>
"When you look at the reality of cutting people off, of saying you 
can't have more benefits if you have children while you are on 
welfare, you're talking about putting children on the street who 
are hungry and naked, and that's a sin." -- Washington Post writer 
Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang, March 25.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Public antagonism toward government has been one of the principal 
themes of American political discourse for nearly two decades, 
growing in shrillness in the past year. This sentiment has been 
voiced and amplified by the new Republican House, which just this 
month completed its 100 days of action, much of it aimed at paring 
back the growth of the federal government. But now that an attack 
on a government building has left scores dead, including children, 
the allure is coming off the anti-government rhetoric." -- Boston 
Globe Washington Bureau Chief David Shribman in a front page "news 
analysis," April 25.
<P>
"The new Republican majority in Congress took a big step today on 
its legislative agenda to demolish or damage government aid 
programs, many of them designed to help children and the poor." -- 
Dan Rather, March 16 CBS Evening News.
<P>
"This is some of the greatest redistribution of income I've ever 
seen, from have-nots to the haves...This is enough to put Robin 
Hood to shame." -- Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt on CNN's Capital 
Gang, March 18.
<P>
"The Republican Congress, of course, is not likely to embrace 
raising taxes and cutting defense spending. It is beholden to 
three constituencies: The corporations, whose lobbyists finance 
politicians and then finagle billions in bizarre subsidies for 
clients. The rich, who write campaign checks and simply ask to be 
left alone. And many hard-working, middle-class men and women -- 
mostly white -- who resent handouts to the needy....About the best 
[the Democrats] can do is temper excesses of Republican plans -- 
excesses that could lead to class warfare or race warfare, 
excesses that will widen the already widening gap between rich and 
poor." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA 
Today column, May 30.
<P>
"In practice, personally, I think it will destroy the future 
competitiveness and security of the country, in terms of 
education, infrastructure, and medical practice as we know it 
today." -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on the GOP budget proposal, 
May 13 Inside Washington.
<P><br><p>
<center><H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3></center>
<P>
"These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make 
black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and 
Jesse the crank -- Helms, that is, not Jackson. But the scariest 
of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since 
George Bush chose him to fill the `black seat' vacated by Thurgood 
Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive 
advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. 
The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the 
kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate." 
-- Time National Correspondent Jack E. White in a June 26 column 
"Uncle Tom Justice."
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Even your sister concedes, although some supporters might like 
what you have to say about the economy and these very specific 
issues you just mentioned, they're very turned off by some of your 
social policies. And you know you've got political enemies out 
there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and 
some even go as far as saying that your social stands are 
reminiscent of Nazi Germany. How are you to win them over?" -- CBS 
This Morning co-host Paula Zahn to Pat Buchanan, July 5.
<P>
"Its story line could be a Republican parable about 1995 America: 
A marvelous vessel loses its power and speeds toward extinction, 
until it's saved by a team of heroic white men. I can imagine the 
political commercials in which Hanks morphs into Phil Gramm. 
Although the movie's publicity trumpets its historical accuracy, 
the movie itself celebrates the paradisiacal America invoked by 
Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan -- an America where men were men, 
women were subservient, and people of color kept out of the damn 
way." -- John Powers writing about Apollo 13 in The Washington 
Post Arts section, July 9.
<P>
"Unless Gingrich and Dole and the Republicans say `Am I inflaming 
a bunch of nuts?', you know we're going to have some more events. 
I am absolutely certain the harsher rhetoric of the Gingriches and 
the Doles...creates a climate of violence in America." -- 
Columnist Carl Rowan, April 25 Washington Post story.
<P>
"The conservatives' agenda, if it goes through, is going to 
depress the quality of cultural and educational life for everyone 
in America, young and old, black, brown, male or female. This is 
one of the most ill-conceived, profoundly anti-democratic ideas 
ever to get loose in Congress. Private philanthropy will never be 
able to restore what seems about to be taken away. Some will not 
notice it; others won't care; given the shortness of American 
social memory, perhaps the next generation won't know what 
happened. Partial lobotomies work that way. They favor Beavis and 
Butt-head. Is that the business of American government?" -- Time 
art critic Robert Hughes, concluding August 7 story on plans to 
cut NEA and NEH funding.
<p><br><P>
<center><h3>Republicans Make Us Sick Award (for Irrational Fear of Less Regulation)</h3></center>
<P>
"Next week on ABC's World News Tonight, a series of reports about 
our environment which will tell you precisely what the new 
Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment 
in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?" -- Peter Jennings in 
an ABC promo during the July 9 This Week with David Brinkley.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"This is deregulation madness! We're gonna have dirty water, dirty 
air. OSHA regulations are being rolled back. There's gonna be no 
competition in the telecommunications industry. And between local 
cable and local phone, there's not gonna be competition at the 
present time. It's gonna take awhile and there's gonna be no 
regulation in the meantime. And so no, he [Clinton] can't go along 
with this. And the people, the public isn't going to go along with 
this. They don't want E. coli bacteria in their drinking water." 
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, August 5 CNN's Capital Gang.
<P>
"Safe food, safe water, safe air, safe transportation. You have 
this protection now, but you might be about to lose it. Why? Watch 
a special In Depth report on NBC Nightly News tomorrow." -- July 
17 NBC promo.
<P>
"There will be change, but most hope the original intent of the 
law will not be lost. Because if the plants and animals can't 
survive, what future is there for the human species?" -- NBC 
reporter Roger O'Neil concluding a story on proposed changes to 
the Endangered Species Act, July 28 Nightly News.
<P>
Afraid of the Competition Award (for Impugning Talk Radio)
"Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to 
the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usually robust, 
sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left 
with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for 
information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may 
be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful 
listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." -- Marvin Kalb, 
former CBS and NBC reporter and current Director of the Center on 
Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, reviewing three 
books on talk radio, May 21 Washington Post.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Some people are very concerned about talk shows, radio talk shows 
in general, of course. Most of them around the country have a 
decidedly conservative bent. The rap that some people give them is 
that they reflect the views of a very vocal minority, the 
extremists in this country, and don't really reflect the true 
nature of political debate in the United States. And, as a matter 
of fact, they tend to be quite divisive and sort of have a bad, a 
negative impact on the country." -- Katie Couric to Oliver North, 
March 13 Today.
<P>
"The issue is whether what's going out over the airwaves here and 
elsewhere is fanning the flames, is making the situation worse, 
that talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run 
amok." -- NBC reporter Bob Faw concluding a January 3 Nightly News 
story.
<P><br><P>
<center><h3>Purveyors of Hate and Division Award (for Post-Oklahoma Talk Radio 
Bashing)</h3></center>
<P>
"In a nation that has entertained and appalled itself for years 
with hot talk on the radio and the campaign trail, the inflamed 
rhetoric of the '90s is suddenly an unindicted co-conspirator in 
the blast." -- Time Senior Writer Richard Lacayo, May 8 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runner-up</H4>
<P>
"The bombing in Oklahoma City has focused renewed attention on the 
rhetoric that's been coming from the right and those who cater to 
angry white men. While no one's suggesting right-wing radio jocks 
approve of violence, the extent to which their approach fosters 
violence is being questioned by many observers, including the 
President....Right-wing talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Bob 
Grant, Oliver North, G. Gordon Liddy, Michael Reagan, and others 
take to the air every day with basically the same format: detail a 
problem, blame the government or a group, and invite invective 
from like-minded people. Never do most of the radio hosts 
encourage outright violence, but the extent to which their 
attitudes may embolden and encourage some extremists has clearly 
become an issue." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, April 25.
<P><br><p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes 
a Cut)</h3></center>
<P>
"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved 
federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion 
more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and 
the poor, to pay for that `pouting sex kitten' mistress of their 
dreams -- tax cuts." -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer 
Gerald Parshall, March 27 story.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"When NBC Nightly News continues: in Washington, if they cut food 
stamps, who doesn't eat?" -- Tom Brokaw, March 22.
<P>
"The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have 
advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show 
an elderly person in a hospital bed, ringing for a nurse who 
doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be." -- 
Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, September 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
"March madness has begun on Capitol Hill, and almost as 
predictable as a B horror film, the slashing has begun. House 
Republicans have made a small down payment on their plan to make 
massive budget cuts." -- CNN anchor Judy Woodruff on Inside 
Politics, March 16.
<p><br><P>
<center><h3>The Embodiment of All Evil Award (for Newt-Bashing)</h3></center>
<P>
"The election returns start with a stark fact so disturbing that 
no one in the media wants to state it plainly: The U.S. House of 
Representatives is now to be led by a world-class demagogue, a 
talented reactionary in the vengeful tradition Gov. George Wallace 
and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Like Wallace before him, Newt Gingrich 
evokes the nation's boiling anxieties as a rancid populism of `us 
vs. them,' though he is too shrewd to make the racial resentments 
explicit. Like Joe McCarthy, Gingrich depicts his adversaries not 
simply as mistaken in their political views but as sick, 
traitorous people who are invidiously subverting the national 
character....We shall soon find out if there is a kinder, gentler 
Newt lurking beneath the rock. Somehow I doubt it. His hatred 
seems to be from the heart." -- William Greider, past producer of

Editor, in the December 29, 1994-January, 12, 1995 Rolling Stone.

"Newtie has gone too far. When you take food out of the mouths of 
babes and claim it is in their best interests, as Gingrich did in 
defending his Draconian budget cuts, you cross the line from mere 
heartlessness to dangerous demagoguery. It is one thing to play 
the mean-spirited reactionary, gutting one social program after 
another while pandering to the greed of the more affluent voter. 
That is a morally wrong but logically consistent position. Taking 
$500 from a child on welfare and giving it to one whose parents 
earn more than $200,000 a year is a loathsome but defensible 
position to advocates of a social Darwinism that holds that only 
the strong deserve to live." -- Former Los Angeles Times reporter

"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one

blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the wilder 
impulses of one very scary white man." -- Time National

his campaigning or were they led into ways they wanted to go? Was 
Reagan sort of a modern Pied Piper? It's my instinct about it that 
he very successfully delayed the apprehension of reality by this

"It's one of the great political myths, about press bias. Most 
reporters are interested in a story. Most reporters don't know 
whether they're Republican or Democrat, and vote every which way. 
Now, a lot of politicians would like you to believe otherwise, but 
that's the truth of the matter. I've worked around journalism all 
of my life, Tom Snyder has as well, and I think he'll agree with 
this, that most reporters, when you get to know them, would fall 
in the general category of kind of common-sense moderates. And 
also, let me say that I don't think that `liberal' or 
`conservative' means very much any more, except to those kind of

"The Republican jihad against the poor, the young and the helpless

budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of 
Congress at the beginning of the year and has spent all its time 
since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and 
compassion in government....If anything is funny in this dismal 
period, it's that the Republicans are touchy about being called 
heartless and cold. That's a riot. Has anyone listened to Newt

"So perhaps the weekend of World War II commemoration was somewhat

was a mistake, and those who answered without a second thought

"In the post-Oklahoma City debate over the links between violent 
rhetoric and violent action, some social critics have begun 
looking beyond talk radio, focusing instead on the metaphors and 
imagery that have helped to define America from the earliest days

disgruntled -- who have already made up their minds to kill or 
terrorize -- can lean on a slew of cultural icons to legitimize 
their feelings of aggression. After all, these theorists say, the 
United States is a nation founded in rebellion and riddled with 
mottos, slogans and images grounded in battle and aggression. 
`Live free or die,' says the New Hampshire license plate. `With 
the sword we seek peace, but under liberty,' goes the less-known 
Massachusetts state motto. And what schoolchild cannot recite 
Patrick Henry's stirring words, `Give me liberty or give me

two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums:

It's the job of the parent to teach the child to control the anger 
and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of 
uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum

"The American Spectator broke the story, as Gwen mentioned,

really happened was there was a conspiracy, in my opinion, by 
right-wingers, including some right-wing journalists, to press 
this newspaper [the Los Angeles Times] into running this story 
before it was ready to, trying to get it out, and so they spread 
the rumor all around town that I had threatened to resign if it 
did run...I know one of the guys who was spreading it: Brit Hume

covers the White House, Fred Barnes, who's on the editorial board

people who suffered off-screen. Forrest had bankrupt shrimpers, 
martyred Vietnam buddies, and his wife, whose death was remarkably 
demure, considering her ailment. Reagan scored points off 
America's poor; somehow managed to cloak himself in heroism while 
apologizing for a needless screw-up that killed 241 servicemen in 
Beirut; and avoided tarnishing his reputation for optimism by 
spending too much time on AIDS." -- Essay by Time Associate Editor

"Both Greedy and The Ref find comic pay dirt in the spectacle of

"A liberal bias? I don't know what a liberal bias is. Do you mean 
we care about the poor, the sick, and the maimed? Do we care 
whether people are being shot every day on the streets of America? 
If that's liberal, so be it. I think it's everything that's good 
in life -- that we do care. And also for the solutions -- we seek 
solutions and we do think that we are all responsible for what 
happens in this country." -- UPI White House correspondent Helen

"In an essay on turning 60, Steinem writes: `I'm looking forward 
to trading moderation for excess' -- which is good news. And 
there's a precedent. In 1895 [Elizabeth Cady] Stanton finally 
published a book she had been planning for many years: a roaring 
attack on the Bible for its misogyny. The book was a best seller, 
the horrified suffrage association voted to censure her and to 
Stanton's pleasure, `the clergy jumped around...like parched peas 
on a hot shovel.' She was 80. Now that's a feminist." -- Newsweek

"Everyone is applauding, I think, in the health care community, 
the emphasis on universal access, because they know that unless 
they're going to let some people just die in the streets, it makes 
sense to get medical care early, when it's going to be more 
effective and less costly....the insurance companies are the focal

"Most of the riders saw themselves as missionaries spreading the 
word about how the current health care system had failed them. 
Some were Republican, others Democrat; some were against abortion, 
others supported abortion rights. Most said they were not

covered by health insurance. In their view, the Health Security 
Express was a nonpartisan effort to persuade Congress to pass 
legislation that provides universal coverage." -- Washington Post

coverage, the closest thing to universal coverage, which the

workers and the state to cover the unemployed."

"Well, it may seem the sheerest act of heresy to say so, but far 
from being pathologically dishonest, Bill Clinton has been more 
faithful to his word than any other chief executive in recent 
memory. He may have skirted the truth about the draft, Gennifer 
Flowers, Paula Jones, and so on. But Clinton has kept his contract 
with voters. On policy issues, he has done almost exactly what he 
said he was going to do, despite setbacks and enormous obstacles. 
And by so doing, he has made himself an excellent President." --

"In less than two years, Bill Clinton had already achieved more 
domestically than John F. Kennedy, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and 
George Bush combined. Although Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan 
often had their way with Congress, Congressional Quarterly says 
it's Clinton who has had the most legislative success of any 
President since Lyndon Johnson. Inhale that one....The standard 
for measuring results domestically should not be the coherence of 
the process but how actual lives are touched and changed. By that 
standard, he's doing well." -- Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan 
Alter, October 3 magazine story.

"One standard conservative argument against antipoverty policies 
is their cost: taxes burden the affluent and thus, by lowering 
work incentive, reduce economic output. But if one goal of the 
policy is to bolster monogamy, then making the affluent less so 
would help. Monogamy is threatened not just by poverty in an 
absolute sense but also by the relative wealth of the rich. This 
is what lures a young woman to a wealthy married or formerly 
married man. It is also what makes the man who attracts her feel 
too good for just one wife. As for the economic consequences, the 
costs of soaking the rich might well be outweighed by the 
benefits, financial and otherwise, of more stable marriages, fewer 
divorces, fewer abused children and less loneliness and 
depression." -- From August 15 Time cover story on infidelity, by

"To his fans, David Brock, the writer who ruined the Clintons' 
Christmas, is a hard-hitting investigative reporter. To everyone 
else, he is a smear artist with a right-wing agenda. But a reading 
of Mr. Brock's oeuvre in the conservative journal The American 
Spectator suggests that his motives are at least as twisted as his 
facts. It's women, not liberals, who really get him going. The 
slightest sighting of female sexuality whips him into a frenzy of 
misogynist zeal. All women are the same to Mr. Brock: terrifying, 
gutter-tongued sexual omnivores." -- New York Times columnist (and

"There is very little in the press accounts to suggest that he is, 
above all, a sophisticated propagandist, an avatar of the politics 
of meanness and envy....Limbaugh is defending the successful 
against the impudent demands of the poor; by making all that 
funny, he gives the comfortable a way to think that greed and a 
cold-hearted wit comprise a cohesive ideology....his style is pure 
demagoguery. Just as Reagan talked of welfare queens in Cadillacs, 
Limbaugh seizes on the absurd detail, gives it an absurdist twist 
of his own, and sends it out into the world under the guise of 
analysis and principle....
It is not enough for him to oppose liberalism. He must, like all 
demagogues, scare his listeners, get them to believe in 
conspiracy, rumor....Like Reagan, Limbaugh is neither curious nor 
brave; he would rather tell his audiences fairy tales than have 
them face the world; he would rather sneer at the weak than 
trouble the strong." -- Former Washington Post reporter David 
Remnick in the Post's Outlook section, February 20.

"Why does anyone take Rush Limbaugh seriously?....He's 
entertaining. But, come on, he is to truthfulness as President 
Clinton is to faithfulness -- he has but a passing acquaintance 
with it. He's toying with you, folks, getting you all riled up 
with a stew of half-truths and non-truths. He's making fools of 
you, feeding you swill -- and you're taking it in....So keep

Welcome to the Media Research Center's annual awards issue, a 
compilation of the most outrageous and/or humorous news media 
quotes from 1993. To determine this year's winners, a panel of 39 
members of the media and media observers each selected their 
choices for the first, second and third best quote from six to ten 
quotes in each category. A list of the 1993 judges appears on the 
back page. (This issue covers quotes from December 1992 through 
November 1993.)
The first quote under each award heading is the winner, followed 
in order by the top runners-up.
The I Am Woman Award (for Hillary Rodham Hero Worshipping)
<P>
"As the icon of American womanhood, she is the medium through 
which the remaining anxieties over feminism are being played 
out....Perhaps in addition to the other items on her agenda, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will define for women that magical spot 
where the important work of the world and love and children and an 
inner life all come together. Like Ginger Rogers, she will do 
everything her partner does, only backward and in high heels, and 
with what was missing in [Lee] Atwater -- a lot of heart." -- Time

"I saw a Hillary Clinton that I'd never seen before. She was 
funny, charming, sexy -- yes, gang, sexy. We are both Scorpios, 
which tells you a lot. She's informal -- called me `Larry' and 
told me to call her by her first name...Meanwhile, she's earned 
the respect of everyone (except the wackos) with her handling of 
the health care issue. Indeed, she has gotten everyone (except the 
wackos) to agree that we need health care for everyone. This is a 
very formidable idea, ladies and gentlemen." -- CNN/Mutual 
Broadcasting talk show host Larry King on his October 2 interview 
with the First Lady. October 4 USA Today column.

"She's ecumenical but prefers Italian and Mexican. The President 
fixes her eggs with jalapeo peppers on the weekends. One 
Christmas she served black beans and chili as part of a buffet. 
She carries Tabasco sauce wherever she goes....Valentine's Day at 
the Red Sage restaurant. Even at a romantic outing, the President 
can be the date from hell, talking to everyone but the girl he 
brung....Finally alone, they have `painted soup' and the lamb 
baked in herbed bread. They exchange gifts and touch each other 
more in two hours than the Bushes did in four years." -- Time 
reporter Margaret Carlson in the June Vanity Fair.

"In the midst of redesigning America's health care system and 
replacing Madonna as our leading cult figure, the new First Lady 
has already begun working on her next project, far more 
metaphysical and uplifting... She is both impersonal and poignant, 
with much more depth, intellect and spirituality than we are used 
to in a politician...She has goals, but they appear to be so huge 
and far off -- grand and noble things twinkling in the distance-- 
that it's hard to see what she sees." -- Washington Post<M>'s

"Clinton's campaign, conducted with dignity, with earnest 
attention to issues and with an impressive display of 
self-possession under fire, served to rehabilitate and restore the 
legitimacy of American politics and thus, prospectively, of 
government itself. He vindicated (at least for a while) the honor 
of a system that has been sinking fast. A victory by George Bush 
would, among other things, have given a two-victory presidential 
validation (1988 and 1992) to hot-button, mad-dog politics -- 
campaigning on irrelevant or inflammatory issues (Willie Horton, 
the flag, the Pledge of Allegiance, Murphy Brown's out-of-wedlock 
nonexistent child) or dirty tricks and innuendo (searching 
passport files, implying that Clinton was tied up with the KGB as 
a student)." -- Time Senior Writer Lance Morrow in Man of the Year

<P>
"So Clinton is right to back off his plan for a middle-class tax 
cut and right again to `revisit' the proposal to increase gasoline 
taxes, regressive levies he routinely dismissed as unfair during 
the campaign." -- Time Chief Political Correspondent Michael 
Kramer, January 25.
<P>
"Unlike the Santa Ana winds fueling the flames in California, look 
what the wind blew in here today in Texas. It may not be much, but 
it's the first snow of the season, and record cold dropping into 
the Texas panhandle. Down here we call it a blue northern, nothing 
between Houston and a barbed wire fence -- the North Pole." -- Dan 
Rather on the October 29 CBS Evening News.
<P>
"In 1981, Ronald Reagan lowered my income rate, terrific, my tax 
rate. Then he indexed my taxes. He didn't explain to me how 
government could index what it bought. The way it worked under 
Ronald Reagan was I couldn't creep into a higher bracket and pay 
more in taxes....It's time that people like me start paying more 
of a fair share, and it's time that people started giving up their 
subsidies, and I agree we need more cuts. And we will return to 
fiscal responsibility and away from the la-la land of the 
Reagan-Bush era." -- ABC reporter Sam Donaldson at the 
Conservative Political Action Conference, February 20.
<P>
"Thanks to a cartoon character called Col. Oliver North, scandal 
hit Ronald Reagan, too, but it didn't hurt him either. Though 
North obligingly took the fall, many said that Reagan was the true 
culprit because he must have known. But they were the same people 
who had already made Reagan famous for not knowing anything. They 
couldn't have it both ways. So all Reagan had to do was look as 
vague as usual and he was invulnerable....But there was only one 
phrase for the way the two famous men [Reagan and Gorbachev] got 
on: they got on famously. Incredulous observers said that although 
their double act looked like Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, the real 
comparison was with Francis and his talking mule. The 
sophisticated world laughed when the suave Gorbachev and the 
bumbling Reagan met at Reykjavik." -- BBC journalist Clive James 
narrating his PBS series Fame in the 20th Century, July 10. 
<P>
"You do, though, Mr. Brock, have some innate biases, don't you? I 
mean, The American Spectator is an ultraconservative magazine. And 
it seems as if you are an advocate for Justice Thomas in the book. 
Is it really fair to call yourself an objective journalist?" -- 
Today co-host Katie Couric to American Spectator contributor David 
Brock on his book The Real Anita Hill, May 3.
<P>
"There are some who say he would have been more comfortable in the 
5th century, but some theologians say that really, some of the 5th 
century Popes were more progressive than John Paul II." -- CBS 
reporter Jerry Bowen on visit of Pope John Paul, August 15 Sunday 
Morning.
<P>
"For the poor, though, and those without health insurance, choice 
is meaningless without the means to choose. Only 13 states 
voluntarily fund abortions for those who can't afford them; the 
poor elsewhere are looking to Clinton to save them from the back 
alley." -- Time Chief Political Correspondent Michael Kramer, 
September 27.
<P>
"Emboldened by a cultural sea change during the Reagan-Bush era, 
conservatives scolded, `It's all your fault.' Dismissively, this 
camp insisted that what blacks need are mainstream American values 
-- read: white values. Go to school, get a job, get married, they 
exhorted, and the family will be just fine." -- Newsweek General 
Editor Michele Ingrassia, August 30.
<P>
"The very cheapness of gas, however, makes it an ideal target for 
a government bent on stopping a runaway deficit....Yet while 
jacking up the gas tax might make good economic and ecological 
sense, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon." -- Time Associate 
Editor John Greenwald, February 15 issue.
<P>
"It's really remarkable because the American people now do 
associate Bill Clinton with higher taxes, and...he hasn't made the 
case of what they're getting in return. The fact is that this is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do 
something about deficit reduction and to take on health care, and 
he's somehow not selling that. He's still being perceived as an 
old-style Democrat." -- NBC White House reporter Andrea Mitchell, 
May 2 Meet The Press.
<P>
"It was interesting that Senator Michelle [sic], House Minority 
Leader, addressed Ross Perot's supporters as a separate group." -- 
Reporter Denise Richardson on Rep. Bob Michel's Republican 
response to the President in a question to a man on the street, 
February 18 Good Morning America.

<CENTER><H2>THE LINDA ELLERBEE AWARDS FOR DISTINGUISHED REPORTING</H2>
<H3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1992</H3>
December 21, 1992 (Vol. Five; No. 26)<p>
       <A HREF="#judges"><small>Judges</small></A></center>  
<P>
Welcome to the fourth annual Linda Ellerbee Awards for 
Distinguished Reporting, a compilation of the most outrageous 
and/or humorous news media quotes from 1992. The awards are named 
after the ABC and NBC veteran who earned the distinction for a 
Cable News Network commentary which won the 1989 "Award for the 
Silliest Analysis." Ellerbee had wondered about the sanity of 
Vietnamese boat people: "Why would any Vietnamese come to America 
after what America did for Vietnam? Don't they remember My Lai, 
napalm, Sylvester Stallone? Clearly they have no more sense over 
there, than say, Mexicans who keep trying to get into this 
country even though this country stole large parts of their 
country from them in the first place."              
To determine this year's winners, a panel of 40 members of the 
media and media observers evaluated over 125 quotes.  A list of 
the 1992 judges appears on page 8. [This issue covers quotes from 
December 1991 through November 1992.]
First under each award heading is the winner, followed in order 
by the top runners-up.

"It's not a big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley 
sided with the white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the 
blacks in downtown Los Angeles rioted and people 
died....Politicians have fanned these flames with code words 
about `welfare queens,' `equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' 
Language designed to turn whites against blacks. With two-party 
politics that favored the rich and hurt everyone else." -- NBC 
commentator John Chancellor, April 30 Nightly News.

"We hold accountable Republicans who have savaged our urban 
schools, our housing, our health care, our social services. We 
hold accountable Democrats who have collaborated in this 
butchery....We hold accountable those who waste our billions on a 
military with no enemy to fight." -- Osborn Elliott, Newsweek 
Editor-in-Chief from 1961-76, in his speech as co-chairman of the 
"Save Our Cities" rally, May 16.
<P>
"We should avoid focusing exclusively on the rage and 
inappropriate behavior of oppressed and frustrated people who 
started these riots." -- Hugh Downs on ABC's 20/20, May 1.
<P>
"Increasingly, people are saying that all of the violence had 
very little to do with Rodney King. Instead, it was the desperate 
call of a community fighting for change." -- ABC reporter Tom 
Foreman, May 3 World News Sunday.

"On the road I travel to the mall in Wheaton, Md., two white men 
severely beat two black women Tuesday. One was doused with 
lighter fluid, and her attacker tried to set her afire. Both men 
cursed the women for being black. I couldn't help but shudder: 
That could have been me. This heinous act happened only hours 
after Pat Buchanan voters gave him 30 percent of the vote in the 
Maryland GOP presidential primary." -- USA Today columnist and 
former "Inquiry" page Editor Barbara Reynolds, March 6.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"[Bush] is about to make matters worse by hauling out Ronald 
Reagan at the Republican convention. Reagan has become a symbol 
of what went wrong in the '80s. It's like bringing the Music Man 
back to River City, a big mistake." -- Newsweek reporter Eleanor 
Clift on The McLaughlin Group, August 1.
<P>
Anchor Lisa McRee: "What's the difference between your message 
and the message of David Duke?....In terms of fairness, you've 
said things that have angered Jews, that have angered gays, that 
have angered women, that have angered minorities. In fact, just 
the other day, you said that there are certain groups that 
assimilate more easily into what is basically an American society 
which is of European derivation. As a woman, if I was a minority, 
why shouldn't I be scared of you?"
Buchanan: "....No nation of God's Earth has done more to fight 
discrimination, or has made greater progress in doing so, than 
the United States of America."
McRee: "But you want to turn that around!" -- Exchange on ABC's 
World News Now, February 26.
<P>
"For three decades, it was an aggressive guardian of individual 
liberties. But the Supreme Court's new conservative majority is 
demolishing that legacy, beating an ideological retreat from its 
activist role in deciding critical social issues." -- From 
Newsweek's table of contents, July 6 issue.
<P>
<H3>Festival of Hate Award (for Republican Convention Coverage)</H3>
<P>
"The whole week was double-ply, wall-to-wall ugly...the 
Republican Party reached an unimaginably slouchy, and brazen, and 
constant, level of mendacity last week...[Bush] is in campaign 
mode now, which means mendacity doesn't matter, aggression is all 
and wall-to-wall ugly is the order of battle for the duration." 
-- Senior Editor Joe Klein on the Republican convention, August 
31 Newsweek.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The only excited, demonstrative delegates any of us could find 
were the ones from the religious right, Pat Robertson's God and 
Country rally. They remind me of those Goldwater delegates of 28 
years ago, far more interested in imposing ideological purity on 
this party than they are on winning the election. They were happy 
today. They got the platform they want. No room for a pregnant 
woman to make any decision at all, even if she was raped. It's a 
platform tough on welfare, tough on taxes and guns and gays and 
pornography, tough even on public radio and public television. 
They cheered Dan Quayle this afternoon and they will cheer Pat 
Buchanan and Ronald Reagan tonight, but will they help elect 
George Bush? It's almost as if they haven't thought of that, 
Dan." -- Charles Kuralt during August 17 CBS Republican 
convention coverage.
<P>
"Very frankly, I am very puzzled by one paragraph, one sentence 
in the Vice President's speech on page six. In a very petulant 
voice, and listen to the words: he said, `To Governor Clinton I 
say this: America is the greatest nation in the world and that's 
one thing you're not going to change.' Implying that Clinton is 
some kind of guerrilla, saboteur, or what have you. That's my 
reaction to that line Ken Bode, I don't know about you. It 
implies something that, it seems that he's saying you're not as 
American as I am, your blood is not as red as mine." -- CNN's 
Bernard Shaw after Vice President Quayle's speech, August 20.
<P>
"Bush, the exponent of a `kinder, gentler' approach to government 
at the 1988 convention, was presented with a 1992 platform loaded 
with puritanical, punitive language that not only forbade 
abortions but attacked public television, gun control, homosexual 
rights, birth control clinics and the distribution of clean 
needles for drug users." -- Boston Globe reporter Curtis Wilkie, 
August 18 news story.
<P>
<H3>Clinton Camelot Award</H3>
<P>

"While George Bush -- all whiteness -- talks about `family 
values,' the Clintons demonstrate them by confessing to 
adultery." -- Former Washington Post reporter Sidney Blumenthal 
in The New Republic, Feb. 17.

"I must say I was struck by the expanse of their chests. They may 
have to put out their stats." -- Newsweek reporter Eleanor Clift 
on Clinton and Gore, CNN's Inside Politics, July 10.
<P>
"It would have been outrageous if he [Clinton] had been done in 
by the draft thing because that was a bum rap. The word `draft 
dodging' does not belong in any sentence with Bill Clinton's name 
in it." -- Time Editor-at-Large (and Clinton friend) Strobe 
Talbott, March 7 Inside Washington.
<P>
"When they appear with their wives, Hillary Clinton and Tipper 
Gore, they look like two suburban couples, perhaps old college 
friends, out on the town for a good time. And whether they are 
playing miniature golf with their wives, tossing a football 
around or gleefully backslapping each other at campaign rallies, 
the images and the message are always the same: Youth, vigor, 
energy. And change." -- Washington Post reporter Edward Walsh, 
July 23.
<P>
<H3>The I Am Woman Award (for Hillary Rodham Hero Worshipping)</H3> 
<P>
"When you hear yourself held up, as you were at the Republican 
convention, some people have used the word `demonized,' does it 
make you hurt or make you mad?....What was the worst thing you've 
heard said about you?....Alright, what was the grossest 
distortion of your record?" -- Jane Pauley's questions to Hillary 
Clinton, September 8 Dateline NBC.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"You might think Hillary Clinton was running for President. 
Granted, she is a remarkable woman. The first student 
commencement speaker at Wellesley, part of the first large wave 
of women to go to law school, a prominent partner in a major law 
firm, rated one of the top 100 lawyers in the country -- there is 
no doubt that she is her husband's professional and intellectual 
equal. But is this reason to turn her into `Willary Horton' for 
the '92 campaign, making her an emblem of all that is wrong with 
family values, working mothers, and modern women in general?" -- 
Beginning of Time cover story by Deputy Washington Bureau Chief 
Margaret Carlson, September 14 issue.
<P>
"Do you think the American people are not ready for someone who 
is as accomplished and career-oriented as Hillary Clinton?" -- 
Today co-host Katie Couric interviewing Hillary Clinton, August 
24.

"During the darkest days of the tax battle, did you have the urge 
to tell the state residents `Oh, grow up?'" -- Time reporter 
David Ellis interviewing Connecticut's tax-hiking Governor Lowell 
Weicker, April 13 issue.

"Put an international tax on emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases....Find a way to put the brakes on the 
world's spiraling population, which will otherwise double by the 
year 2050....Give the United Nations broad powers to create an 
environmental police force for the planet." -- Time list of "What 
They Should Do But Won't" at the United Nations "Earth Summit" in 
Rio de Janeiro, June 1.
<P>
"Increase taxes on gasoline and other fuels. This would help 
finance cuts in other taxes -- each penny-per-gallon increase in 
the gas tax would generate $1 billion in new revenues -- and 
would also encourage energy conservation, cut down pollution and 
traffic congestion, and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. A good 
start would be an increase of 25 cents per gal. -- less than the 
amount by which prices rose during the Gulf War -- with further 
increases of five cents a year." -- Time suggestion for a tax 
package, Dec 9, 1991.
<P>
<H3>Willie Horton Award (for Sophisticated Political Analysis)</H3>
<P>
"The racial dimension flows naturally into the political, where 
the uglier side of Quayle's mission begins to become apparent. 
One of Quayle's amazing but unlikable feats last week was 
metaphorically to transform old Willie Horton into a beautiful 
blond fortyish WASP has-it-all knockout." -- Time Senior Writer 
Lance Morrow on the Murphy Brown controversy, June 1.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The Republicans, for 25 years, have seldom avoided the 
temptation to play the race card politically in this country. It 
goes back to the '60s, when Richard Nixon ran as a law-and-order 
President. In the '70s, Ronald Reagan, and the late '70s, he ran 
for President in 1980 talking about welfare queens, associating 
the Great Society programs with minorities, and with waste, and 
with crime in the streets. There has been a consistent impulse, 
Willie Horton was just a continuation of that, to use this issue 
to divide people." -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer 
Steven Roberts on Washington Week in Review, May 8.
<P>
"Senator, you told Tim that you thought the White House 
suggestion that the Great Society programs were to blame for what 
happened in Los Angeles was ludicrous. Was it also a racial code 
word -- a code word to appeal to racial fears? Is it the Willie 
Horton of the 1992 campaign?" -- NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell 
interviewing Sen. Bill Bradley on Meet the Press, May 10.
<P>
"It would help, too, if the man who sanctioned the infamous 
Willie Horton ad during his 1988 run for the White House would 
admit his complicity in developing the images and code words that 
encourage whites to demonize blacks." -- Time special 
correspondent Michael Kramer, May 11 issue.
<P>
"Many are afraid the L.A. riots are going to be the Willie Horton 
of this campaign. Are you afraid they're going to have a very 
divisive effect? Does that concern you or are you playing that 
up?" -- Today co-host Katie Couric interviewing Pat Buchanan, May 
6.
<P>
<H3>Award for the Silliest Analysis</H3>
<P>
<P>
"NATURE HAS A CURE FOR EVERYTHING, EXCEPT THE SPREAD OF WESTERN 
CIVILIZATION. Until recently, cultural genocide has been a 
quietly accepted practice. But times change and so does TIME." -- 
Time advertisement in the April 27 Sports Illustrated promoting 
their "Lost Tribes, Lost Knowledge" issue.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The [House] bank had no written standards; hopeless accounting 
procedures made it impossible to determine when overdrafts 
occurred except by painstaking check-by-check reconstruction of 
individual accounts....None of this was anyone's fault." -- 
Washington Post reporter Guy Gugliotta, April 17. 
<P>
"After watching the first week of his new syndicated series, one 
must logically conclude that Limbaugh is the lead component of an 
insidious left-wing conspiracy to make conservatives look like 
clowns....Rushie tried to disguise his true liberal feelings by 
constantly referring to Bill Clinton as `Slick Willie.' Funny, 
wouldn't you say, that Mr. Conservative neglected to mention that 
`Willie' was also the nickname of William Shakespeare, whose 
plays were performed in the Globe Theatre by men who played the 
female roles. Thus, it's obvious that despite being a 
right-winger, Limbaugh endorses TRANSVESTITES!" -- Los Angeles 
Times TV critic Howard Rosenberg, September 21.
<P>
"There is an understandable reluctance on the part of many women 
to venture into a building already occupied by Jesse Helms or Bob 
Dornan, a building that was designed, for all we know, without a 
single ladies' room in the floor plan. Plus there has been the 
chilling effect of male politicos like former Republican Party 
chairman Clayton Yeutter, who reportedly addressed a high-powered 
donor as `little lady' and inquired as to whom she `belonged to' 
-- thus sending a generation of Republican women out to join 
militantly separatist rural communes." -- Time essayist Barbara 
Ehrenreich, June 22.
<P>
"Texas...another of the so-called big enchiladas, or if not an 
enchilada, at least a huge taco." -- Dan Rather during CBS News 
election night coverage.
<P>
<H3>Ross Perot Award (for Sensitivity to Criticism)</H3>
<P>
"My reaction to that button [`Rather Biased'] and others, in 
part, is a button I bought yesterday that says `Yeah, I'm In The 
Media, Screw You!'....I do understand why a lot of people are 
upset with us, why we rank somewhere between terrorists and bank 
robbers on the approval scale. We do criticize. That's part of 
our role. Our role is not just to parrot what people say, it's to 
make people think. I think that sometimes I want to say to the 
electorate `Grow up!'" -- Newsweek reporter Ginny Carroll on 
C-SPAN's Journalists' Roundtable, August 21.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"I think there are reporters around Clinton who are baby boomers 
who are drawn to him. I think there are a lot of reporters in 
Washington who just wish for a new story. But I watch probably as many talk shows, and as many interview shows, what George Bush 
calls the professional talking heads on Sundays, as anybody else. 
I actually think the bias, in the overall system, is from the 
center to the right." -- PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers on CNN's 
Larry King Live, November 2.
<P>
"I don't think there is [a bias] at all. I think anyone who 
accuses the press of bias is acting in desperation, I think. I 
think the press has been much more aggressive and fair, in being, 
in going after both sides, and looking, than ever before." -- New 
York Times reporter Richard Berke on CNN's Larry King Live, 
October 16.
<P>
"I am shocked when people say that [the media were pro-Clinton], 
I really am. I mean, people forget January and February, when the 
media was on Clinton's case with Gennifer Flowers, all the draft 
stuff. I'm amazed at the public's selective memory." -- ABC 
anchor Carole Simpson at Women of Washington forum shown by 
C-SPAN, November 10.
<P>
<H3>The Real Reagan Legacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"You place responsibility for the death of your daughter squarely 
at the feet of the Reagan Administration. Do you believe they're 
responsible for that? -- NBC reporter Maria Shriver interviewing 
AIDS sufferer Elizabeth Glaser, July 14 Democratic convention 
coverage.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"The boom years following World War II saw the U.S. economy take 
off, giving rise to the growth of the great American middle 
class. The rising standard of living meant homes, cars, TVs, 
college for the kids -- all in all, a piece of the American 
dream. But in the Reagan years, economic erosion set in, so much 
so that the middle class now finds itself in ever-deepening 
trouble." -- Bryant Gumbel on Today, January 22.
<P>
"[Reagan's] good-natured pre- and post-surgical quips so endeared 
him to the nation that practically nothing, including the deaths 
of 241 U.S. Marines in a Beirut barracks, stuck to the Reagan 
presidency. As a result, the nation smiled benignly when....He 
burdened the working poor and middle class by raising Social 
Security taxes while calling for cuts in the capital gains tax. 
Such policies widened the gap between rich and poor and 
contributed to the psychological chasm between haves and 
have-nots. In this atmosphere, Wall Street stock manipulator 
Michael Milken earned $550 million in 1987, and ghetto teens 
unable to find jobs joined gangs instead." -- Houston Chronicle 
reporter Steven Reed, August 16 news story.
<P>
"The amazing thing is most people seem content to believe that 
almost everybody had a good time in the '80s, a real shot at the 
dream. But the fact is, they didn't. Did we wear blinders? Did we 
think the '80s just left behind the homeless? The fact is that 
almost nine in ten Americans actually saw their lifestyle 
decline." -- NBC reporter Keith Morrison, February 7 Nightly 
News.
<P>
"We are seeing a public recoil from formal politics, from the 
active, reasoned exercise of citizenship. It comes because we 
don't trust anyone. It is part of the cafard the '80s induced: 
Wall Street robbery, the savings and loan scandal, the wholesale 
plunder of the economy, an orgy released by Reaganomics that went 
on for years with hardly a peep from Congress -- events whose 
numbers were so huge as to be beyond the comprehension of most 
people." -- Time art critic Robert Hughes in his cover essay "The 
Fraying of America," February 3.
<P>
<H3>James Carville Award (for Mean & Nasty Campaign Reporting)</H3>
<P>
"Ever since the Clarence Thomas hearings last fall, the 
Republican Party has been struggling to overcome the perception 
that its regard for women is only a notch or two higher than that 
of the Navy Tailhook Association." -- Time reporter Michael 
Duffy, August 24 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Al Gore won it for taking the high road with his cool command of 
the facts, and Jim Stockdale gets the runner-up trophy for the 
best one-liners. Dan Quayle lost for the hate-mongering that 
turned off much of the nation at his party's convention in 
Houston. It wasn't that he made any gaffes. He looked poised and 
spoke with great energy. But he played dirty while the other two 
candidates played clean." -- Boston Globe columnist and former 
Washington bureau reporter Susan Trausch, October 14.
<P>
"Fred [Barnes], you've said time and again that character is an 
important issue in the campaign. Clearly, that red-baiting junk 
didn't work for the President last night. What's he going to try 
next?" -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, October 12.
<P>
"What are your expectations? How nasty do you expect George Bush 
to try to be?" -- Bryant Gumbel to John Chancellor on NBC's 
Today, October 9.
<P>
"Are Democrats willing, even anxious, to be as nasty as the 
President is going to be?" -- Bryant Gumbel to Clinton consultant 
Bob Squier, August 10 Today.

Connie Chung: "In formerly communist Bulgaria, the cost of 
freedom has been virtual economic disaster. Peter Van Sant 
reports."
Van Sant: "Thousands of socialists rally in Sofia, Bulgaria. It 
may look like a rally from communism's glory years, but it's not. 
It's an expression of frustration, a longing for the bad old days 
when liberty was scarce but at least everybody had a job." -- CBS 
Evening News, December 29, 1991.
<P>
"In the old Soviet Union, you never saw faces like these. The 
poor, the homeless, and the desperation of the Russian winter. 
Their numbers are growing. Tonight -- Is this what democracy 
does? A look at the Russia you haven't seen before....The people 
of Russia are learning this winter that the price of freedom can 
be painfully high." -- Barbara Walters opening Nightline, January 
14.
<DD>                     
"The economic and political turmoil that has swept the former 
Communist East Bloc has hit women the hardest. There's been a 
strong backlash against the idea of women's equality...Under the 
communists, women in the workplace were glorified. And if they 
needed time off to give birth and raise families, they got it at 
full pay." -- ABC reporter Jerry King, April 6 World News 
Tonight.

"You talked, Anita, about some of the very supportive letters

fifty years from now, when people look back at these hearings,

questions to Anita Hill, October 7 Today.

"Greenpeace, the public interest organization, believes that the 
Iraqi death toll, civilian and military, before and after the 
war, may be as high as 198,000. Allied military dead are counted 
in the low hundreds. The disparity is huge and somewhat 
embarrassing. And that's commentary for this evening, Tom." --

"Al Gore leaned against his orthopedic back pillow, drank bottled 
water and reflected on the human spirit and his newfound sense of 
self. How is it that the wooden-tongued policy wonk of 1988 has 
emerged as a spokesman for the inner child, an icon of the new 
manhood?...But when Vice President Dan Quayle derides Gore's 
notions as `pretty bizarre stuff,' he may not be aware that 
millions of people attend support groups every week in the U.S." 
-- Time Chicago reporter Elizabeth Taylor, October 12 issue.
<P>
"[Columbus] sailed just as Jews and Muslims were being expelled 
from Spain, the persecution of those peoples and the riches 
robbed from them paying for his small armada of ships, the Nina, 
the Pinta, and the Santa Maria, to set sail for new plunder. For 
Native Americans, the people who hardly felt discovered, 
Columbus' landing commenced a Holocaust. There's really no other 
word for the death delivered by settlers, as they scattered, 
enslaved, and obliterated Indian nations on their own sacred 
lands." -- NBC weekend Today co-host Scott Simon, October 11.
<P>
"But for the simple folk of Uzbekistan, people like Kurban 
Manizayov, these are mind-wrenching times. Their simple wants

nobody even bothered to ask if it was all right." -- CNN Moscow

<P>
<P>
Welcome to the third annual Linda Ellerbee Awards for 
Distinguished Reporting, a compilation of the most outrageous 
and/or humorous news media quotes from 1991. The awards are named 
after the ABC and NBC veteran who earned the distinction for a 
Cable News Network commentary which won the 1989 "Award for the 
Silliest Analysis." Ellerbee had wondered about the sanity of 
Vietnamese boat people: "Why would any Vietnamese come to America 
after what America did for Vietnam? Don't they remember My Lai, 
napalm, Sylvester Stallone? Clearly they have no more sense over 
there, than say, Mexicans who keep trying to get into this 
country even though this country stole large parts of their 
country from them in the first place."              
<P>
To determine this year's winners, a panel of 36 members of the 
media and media observers evaluated over 125 quotes.  A list of 
the 1991 judges appears on page 8. [This issue covers quotes from 
December 1990 through November 1991.]
<P>
First under each award heading is the winner, followed in order 
by the top runners-up.

"Remember all the chatter about a short war? Well, forget it."  
-- Time Senior Writer George J. Church, March 4 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Well, they [U.S. soldiers] really didn't risk that much, number 
one. And second, to honor people who believe in violence is to 
honor the ethic of violence. And if you believe violence solves 
problems, you overlook quite a lot of morality. You overlook what 
Gandhi said: `An eye for an eye and we all go blind.' So why 
celebrate that? Why honor these people?....Instead of 
celebrating, we ought to have a national month of mourning for 
what we did in that area of the world. We supplied them weapons 
endlessly and they used them. And then after we mourn, we ought 
to ask them to forgive us for what they did." -- Washington Post 
columnist Colman McCarthy on CNN's Crossfire, April 19.
<P>
"Certainly a lot of Americans would die, an estimated 2,500 of 
them in just the first ten days of battle. American troops would 
do most of the fighting and thousands, perhaps tens of thousands 
of them would be casualties along with countless thousands of 
Iraqis, soldiers and civilians." -- CBS News reporter Richard 
Threlkeld on war prospects, January 4 Evening News.
<P>
"And why do they do these unnatural, unhuman things, these 
soldiers? Not for God or country or freedom or even because 
they've been ordered to. They do them, finally, as James Jones, 
the author put it, because they don't want to appear unmanly in 
front of their friends." -- CBS reporter Richard Threlkeld on 
U.S. soldiers, February 8 Evening News.
<P>
<H3>Peter Arnett Media First Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
Pat Buchanan: "If there was information you could have gotten out 
that could have saved scores, hundreds of American lives, you 
wouldn't have transmitted that information?"
Peter Arnett: "I wouldn't have transmitted that information. I 
would not have gotten that information in the first place. But I 
would not have transmitted it. I was in Baghdad because I was a 
correspondent for CNN, which has no political affiliations with 
the U.S. government, thank goodness." -- CNN's Crossfire, August 
2.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"[After World War II] Many of the Germans came to us after the 
revelations of the horrors of the concentration camps. They said 
`We didn't know, we didn't know' -- the tears were rolling down 
their cheeks. They claimed they couldn't be held responsible, but 
they were. They accepted with cheers, and great enthusiasm, 
Hitler's clamping down on a free press...Today we're in the same 
position."-- Walter Cronkite quoted on Gulf War coverage in the 
October 22 Philadelphia Daily News. 
<P>
Reporter Arthur Kent: "Saddam Hussein is a cunning man and 
nowhere does he show that more clearly than on a battlefield when 
he's under attack."
Anchor Faith Daniels: "And that, Arthur, really seems to be this 
Administration's greatest miscalculation."
Arthur Kent: "That's right, Faith. He is ruthless, but more than 
ruthless. In the past 11 days, he's surprised us. He's shown us a 
capable military mind and he still seems to know exactly what 
he's doing." -- Exchange from NBC special America: The Realities 
of War, January 27.
<P>
"Allied military units are on the move. Their positions, 
movements, and plans must be carefully safeguarded. We must 
assume that the enemy is confused about what is happening on the 
battlefield and it is absolutely essential that we not do 
anything inadvertently ourselves to clarify the picture for him." 
-- Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in a press conference at the 
start of the ground war, February 23.
vs.
"As part of our CBS News live coverage of the beginning of the 
ground war offensive, we're talking to Bob McKeown, a CBS News 
reporter who's one mile from the Kuwaiti border. Bob, any 
indication of how far up you the think the Allies are now?" -- 
Dan Rather, 21 minutes later.
<P>
<H3>Bring Back the Iron Curtain Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Ten months after the new Germany merged, women in the eastern 
sector are coming to the stunning realization that, in many ways, 
democracy has set them back 40 years." -- Los Angeles Times staff 
writer Tamara Jones, August 6.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Inefficient as the old communist economy was, it did provide 
jobs of a sort for everybody and a steady, if meager, supply of 
basic goods at low, subsidized prices; Soviet citizens for more 
than 70 years were conditioned to expect that from their 
government. Says a Moscow worker: 'We had everything during 
[Leonid] Brezhnev's times. There was sausage in the stores. We 
could buy vodka. Things were normal.'" -- Time Associate Editor 
George J. Church, September 23.
<P>
"Like many other women in what used to be the German Democratic 
Republic, she worries that political liberation has cost her 
social and economic freedom...The kindergartens that cared for 
their children are becoming too expensive, and West Germany's 
more restrictive abortion laws threaten to deny many Eastern 
women a popular method of birth control....East Germany's 
child-care system helped the state indoctrinate its young, but 
also assured women in the East the freedom to pursue a career 
while raising a family." -- U.S. News & World Report special 
correspondent John Marks, July 1 news story.
<P>
"But most of his fellow countrymen do not share John Paul's 
concept of morality...many here expect John Paul to use his 
authority to support Church efforts to ban abortion, perhaps the 
country's principal means of birth control. And this, they say, 
could deprive them of a freedom of choice the communists never 
tried to take away from them." -- CBS News reporter Bert Quint on 
the June 1 Evening News.
<P>
<H3>Which Way Is It? Gulf War</H3>
<P>
<P>
Peter Arnett: "While we were there [at a bombing site], a 
distraught woman shouted insults at the press and vented anger at 
the West."
Woman: "Mea culpa! Mea culpa! All of you are responsible, all of 
you! Bombing the people for the sake of oil! Hunted as if we are 
Iranian! We are human beings! Who made this area like this? The 
flames in the area, it's the West! Mea culpa, the blood, she is 
on your head!" -- CNN live from Baghdad, February 1.
vs.
"Iraq has been polishing up its propaganda game for years. A 
woman wailing in TV-perfect English about civilian casualties 
turned out, as CNN later reported, to be an Iraqi official [aide 
to the Foreign Affairs Under- secretary]. She also showed up on 
French TV wailing in French." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Feb. 
25.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"I saw various plans that the manufacturers had left behind 
talking about its use as a shelter and I can tell you that I saw 
no sign of military equipment on that lower level and I looked 
into all the main rooms." -- BBC reporter Jeremy Bowen on the 
"shelter" bombed by the U.S., February 14 NBC Nightly News. 
vs.
"Intelligence sources told Newsweek that only the top two levels 
sheltered senior military commanders and Baath officials, along 
with their families. Beneath them was a secret basement filled 
with equipment for communicating with Army leaders at the front. 
Last week the Iraqis flooded the secret basement to prevent 
reporters from seeing it after the bombing." -- Newsweek defense 
reporter John Barry, February 25.
<P>
"The message that came from them very strongly in Baghdad was 
that they're pretty sick of Saddam Hussein. They don't like the 
man, they don't like what he's done to their country, and they'd 
like to be rid of him." -- BBC Baghdad reporter Jeremy Bowen on 
NBC News at Sunrise after reporters were kicked out of Baghdad, 
March 8.
vs.
"But the air war itself, as it goes on, has shown no sign of 
diminishing Saddam's support here....all the people that we talk 
to with the television cameras say that the continuing air 
attacks have in fact strengthened their desire, their will to 
resist the Allied coalition." -- Bowen on the NBC Nightly News, 
Feb. 16.
<P>
<H3>Media Hero Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"And then there was Anita Hill, the poised daughter of so many 
generations of black women who have been burned carrying torches 
into the battle for principle. The cause of civil rights and 
social justice has so often fallen to them to defend. Harriet 
Tubman and Sojourner Truth were slaves by birth, freedom fighters 
by temperament. Rosa Parks was a tired seamstress who shoved 
history forward by refusing to give up her seat on the bus....The 
latest to claim her place in line is Anita Hill, a private, 
professional woman unwilling to relinquish her dignity without a 
fight." -- Time Associate Editor Nancy Gibbs, October 21 issue.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Once, long ago, he was the Prince Hal of American politics: 
high-spirited, youthful, heedless. He never evolved, like Prince 
Hal, into the ideal king. Instead he did something that was in 
its way just as impressive. He became one of the great lawmakers 
of the century, a Senate leader whose liberal mark upon American 
government has been prominent and permanent. The tabloid version 
does not do him justice. The public that knows Kennedy by his 
misadventures alone may vastly underrate him." -- Time's Lance 
Morrow, Apr. 29.
<P>
"And finally President Carter, you are now considered one of the 
world's foremost statesmen. You've been called the best 
ex-President this country has ever had. Your reputation has been 
bolstered tremendously since you left office. How does that make 
you feel?" -- Today co-host Katie Couric to Carter, Nov.13.
<P>
"Elizabeth, his wife of 56 years, applauds him as a good family 
man. Indeed, how can anyone think ill of Hall when he beams so 
about cooking pancakes for his grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren, or shares his secret for making tasty beef 
stew. (It's the apples.)" -- Time reporter Michael Riley in 
September 9 profile of Communist Party USA leader Gus Hall.
<P>
<H3>Willie Horton Award (for Sophisticated Political Analysis)</H3>
<P>
"Demagogues don't yell `nigger' or `Jew boy' anymore. They've 
learned better...[Duke] traded in his bigoted rhetoric for a 
slick new glossary of coded appeals to racial resentment, market 
tested over the past two decades by mainstream conservative 
politicians." -- Time Washington reporter Dan Goodgame, November 
25 news story.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"[Lee Atwater] was a scoundrel, one of the darkest figures to 
dominate our recent politics, a man with a comprehensively 
cynical view of his fellow creatures....He made it in the most 
improbable way, learning to dress at Brooks Brothers and keep his 
funky white trash wickedness too....In running campaigns that 
played on racial divisions, he was something worse than a bigot; 
he was a man who pretended to be a bigot in hope that it would 
sell." -- Washington Post op-ed by reporter Marjorie Williams, 
March 30.
<P>
"I think that he [Thomas] had the advantage of prime time on 
Friday night. He had everything going for him. The Democrats did 
not ask him tough questions about the facts of her charge and 
they did, the Republicans did a great job of hammering her. It's 
basically what happened in the '88 campaign. The Republicans know 
how to fight dirty." -- NBC congressional reporter Andrea 
Mitchell, October 15 Today.
<P>
<H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"You big [expletive]....You are so full of [expletive]. You are 
an evil man....I don't have to listen to this [expletive]. You're 
a bitter and evil man and all your colleagues hate you." -- NPR's 
Nina Totenberg to Senator Alan Simpson after Nightline, as 
Simpson told The Washington Post, October 9.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Twelve million American children who do not have enough to eat, 
who lack adequate health care, and who are behind in schools and 
being left behind in life. Much of our broadcast will be 
dedicated to that. Which makes the major news in Washington today 
seem even more of a contrast. The President's Chief of Staff, 
John Sununu, is at the center of attention again having to do 
with his use of limousines and corporate jets." -- ABC's Peter 
Jennings opening the June 18 World News Tonight.
<P>
Hays Gorey, Senior Correspondent: "Well, (Republican Sen. John) 
McCain has got this ad hoc group of superpatriots that he's 
organizing."
Jerome Cramer, NASA & Technology Correspondent: "They wear brown 
shirts and march around. Small potatoes." -- Exchange from 
February 8 Time Washington bureau meeting aired on C-SPAN. 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Armand Hammer Memorial Award (for Foreign Reporting)</H3>
<P>
"It's short of soap, so there are lice in hospitals. It's short 
of pantyhose, so women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so 
babies stay home in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody 
even talked about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
-- NBC's John Chancellor on the Soviet Union, Aug. 21.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"If nothing else, the Cuban revolution has eliminated abject 
need. The cost may be generalized poverty and zero political 
pluralism, but, even with shortages, there is no starvation here. 
Education and medical care are assured for all. And, unlike in 
most of Latin America, you don't see naked or even shoeless 
children in the streets. When Castro speaks of the need to defend 
the gains of revolution, he means a level of social welfare rare 
in the underdeveloped world." -- Washington Post Asst. Foreign 
Editor Don Podesta, April 28 "Outlook" article.
<P>
"Young Cubans increasingly see themselves as the last idealists 
in a world that cares only about money....Ninety miles away in 
Miami, Cuban emigres wish for Fidel's imminent collapse, but the 
island's university students who volunteer to take a two-week 
'vacation' in the fields don't see trouble brewing in Paradise." 
-- Time reporter Cathy Booth, August 12 issue.
<P>
<H3>The Real Reagan Legacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"In the 1980s, a time when wealth accumulated and men decayed, 
the superpatriots entered Gloryland. They were the anointed Moral 
Majority. They stood foursquare for God, Reagan, and the bombing 
of abortion clinics....We could only wince when the President 
called the Contras 'freedom fighters,' when Oliver North became a 
national hero, when the pledge of allegiance became -- with 
sinister embellishments -- a campaign issue...We winced -- and 
some of us wept in shame -- when George Bush, wearing the white 
flower of a blameless life, won the 1988 election with tactics 
only a Mafia don could admire." -- Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
television critic Harriet Van Horne in The Nation's "patriotism" 
issue, July 15/22.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"Tonight, the NBC News program Expose looks at incidences of 
sexual harassment in [federal low-income] housing. It's reported 
by correspondent Michele Gillen....Well, I guess that's where the 
problem began. Actually, it was when the budget was taken out of 
the affordable housing market during the Reagan years and thus, 
the problem came about." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, 
September 20. 
<P>
"Cannon starts off by proclaiming that Reagan is not a dunce, a 
point that can be questioned by the very fact that it has to be 
made, a point we all want to believe but a point that Cannon 
tends to undercut every few pages....Acting might be all right if 
you're a king, but it just won't work for a President...the 
nation needed more than inspiration in the 1980s. It needed 
leadership -- moral leadership, intellectual leadership, 
political leadership. It needed a manager, not a cheerleader. It 
needed a statesman, not a star. It needed answers, not anecdotes. 
It needed ideas as well as ideals. And Ronald Reagan wasn't up to 
that task." -- NBC News President Michael Gartner reviewing Lou 
Cannon's book on Reagan, April 21 Washington Post.
<P>
Reporter Lea Thompson: "The Consumer Product Safety Commission 
can stop manufacturing; it can fine; it can even seize clothes 
right off the rack if PJs don't meet flammability standards. None 
of that's happened. So far the agency has only hoped a 
manufacturer will take its advice. So you can't depend on 
government to police this for you. We did find this flammable 
sleepwear everywhere we went."
Bryant Gumbel: "Lea, Lea, real quick. Why is the government 
abdicating its responsibility on this? Is this another holdover 
from the Reagan years and the cutbacks?"
Thompson: "Absolutely. And somebody's gotta do something." -- 
Exchange on Today, November 13. 
<P>
<H3>Long Dong Silver Award (for Exaggerated Indignation)</H3>
<P>
"The days of Simpson Chic are over. Now he is more often compared 
to Red-baiter Joe McCarthy. The image of Simpson flinging open 
his jacket and declaring he had lots of `stuff' against Anita 
Hill -- while revealing nothing -- was the lowest of many low 
points in the Clarence Thomas hearings. Any Senator with a sense 
of history should have said, as attorney Joseph Welch eventually 
did to McCarthy, `Senator, have you no shame?'....[Simpson] is 
writing a book about the media -- a little like Stalin discussing 
intergovernmental relations." -- Newsweek Washington reporter 
Eleanor Clift, October 28 news story.  
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"I've been in this town for 21 years, and they play a vicious 
brand of politics in Washington. Washington can be a mean town. 
This was as vicious a fight as I've ever seen except it was 
totally one-sided....When you had Alan Simpson standing up there 
like Joe McCarthy, reaching in his pockets and saying `I'm 
getting stuff through faxes, and all over the country,' he 
sounded just like Joe McCarthy, let's face it. And you had Arlen 
Specter, who was a prosecutor at one time, saying that she 
committed perjury, when probably you couldn't find another 
prosecutor in the country that would tell you that she had 
committed perjury." -- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief 
Jack Nelson on Washington Week in Review, October 18.
<P>
"Arlen Specter accused her of perjury. If you read the record, 
Arlen Specter was the one who distorted what she said. Orrin 
Hatch even suggested that she got one of her charges by reading 
The Exorcist, I mean that she was besieged by demons. Orrin 
should really stick to talking dirty. He does that better. Alan 
Simpson, for those of us who were too young to know what Joe 
McCarthy was really like, Alan Simpson showed us. `I have in my 
pocket two dozen card-carrying smearers against this awful 
woman,' and then he produced those smears, those bombshells, and 
they were duds." -- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief 
Al Hunt on CNN's Capital Gang, October 19.

<H3>Thurgood Marshall Award (for Judicial Activism)</H3>
<P>
"The genius of the Constitution is that it sides with the citizen 
against the state. That's why it's such a worldwide success. But 
today's Supreme Court tends to favor the state over the 
citizen....In this Supreme Court, the state wins more often than 
the citizens. Something to keep in mind when they give you the 
old malarkey about the Court being true to the spirit of the 
Constitution. This Court isn't." -- NBC commentator and former 
anchor John Chancellor, July 23 Nightly News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"What was astonishing here was not that the Court opposes 
abortion. What was astonishing was its absurd view that medical 
personnel paid with government money lose their right to free 
speech. The Constitution says no law shall abridge freedom of 
speech, no law. Could it be that the Court hasn't read that part? 
....Was [David Souter] able and willing to read the Constitution 
as a member of the Court? Would he abide by it? Well, now we know 
the answer. It's no." -- David Brinkley ending ABC's This Week, 
May 26.
<P>
"Under Rehnquist, the Supreme Court no longer sees itself as the 
defender of civil rights and civil liberties, the champion of the 
individual. Gone is the Court majority that breathed new life 
into the Bill of Rights, dismantled Southern segregation, 
disciplined police who violated the rights of citizens, removed 
religion from the public schools, pushed a President into 
resignation, and swept aside the laws forbidding women to end 
their pregnancies." -- Los Angeles Times Supreme Court reporter 
David Savage in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, September 29.
<P>
"On the same day major groups announced their opposition, Thomas' 
friends from Georgia showed up on Capitol Hill. But Thomas has 
taken controversial positions, such as suggesting that natural 
laws may supersede individual rights." -- NBC congressional 
reporter Andrea Mitchell, September 9 Nightly News.
<P>
<H3>Borking Award (for Character Assassination)</H3>
<P>
"Clarence Thomas is the best only at his ability to bootlick for 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush....They didn't pick him because he 
was black. They picked him because he's a black conservative. And 
the thing that bothers me about his appointment -- if they had 
put David Duke on, I wouldn't scream as much because they would 
look at David Duke and reject him for what he is. If you gave 
Clarence Thomas a little flour on his face, you'd think you had 
David Duke talking." -- Columnist Carl Rowan on Inside 
Washington, July 7.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
"It may sound bigoted; well, this is a bigoted world and why 
can't black people be allowed a little Archie Bunker 
mentality?....Here's a man [Thomas] who's going to decide crucial 
issues for the country and he has already said no to blacks; he 
has already said if he can't paint himself white he'll think 
white and marry a white woman." -- USA Today "Inquiry" Editor 
Barbara Reynolds in The Washington Post, September 10.
<P>
"Who is this guy, Clarence Thomas, and why should we want him on 
the Supreme Court? I can't think of any good reasons. The man is 
not distinguished and he doesn't seem to have a heart...Let's be 
straight about this. Clarence Thomas is a tool of the rich and 
powerful. His supporters include Dan Quayle, Strom Thurmond, 
Jesse Helms. Even David Duke, former Ku Klux Klan leader, is 
crazy about Clarence Thomas. Make no mistake, old people, poor 
people, black people, women, forget about it. Clarence Thomas is 
not your friend."  -- NBC News reporter Bob Herbert in Sunday 
Today "Viewpoint" segment, September 8.

<H3>Wilson-Weicker Tax Hike Advocacy Award</H3>
<P>
"American tax rates today are, relatively speaking, low. Repeat, 
low. About half the top rate in the rest of the industrialized 
world. Our sales taxes are equally low. Fact: the United States 
is a tax bargain, believe it or not. The difference, of course, 
is that in other countries, people see their tax money coming 
back to them to make life more agreeable and secure. In Western 
Europe, health care for everyone. In Scandinavia, day care 
centers for mothers and children. In Japan, modern, efficient 
cities that work." -- NBC Nightly News anchor Garrick Utley on 
October 19, Taxpayers Action Day.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

<P>
"Every Governor in America last year could have recited the Jim 
Florio rule of political survival: never mount an honest attack 
against a state deficit. The New Jersey Governor, who combined 
service cuts with the highest tax hike in the state's history, 
was all but tarred and feathered for his efforts. But now, with 
at least 29 states facing potential deficits, Florio's approach 
is beginning to seem almost prescient." -- Time Associate Editor 
Priscilla Painton, March 4.
<P>
"If you're going to raise a child who escapes this cycle [of 
poverty], you're going to have to start a little earlier. And 
that requires money -- M-O-N-E-Y. Read my lips. And it's 
something this nation still isn't ready to commit to...without 
the hard billions of dollars, lots of money which must come from 
you dear taxpayers, we're not going to do this." -- Sam Donaldson 
on This Week with David Brinkley, June 23.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The earth is home, and all its refugees, its homeless, sometimes 
seem a sort of advance guard of  apocalypse. They represent a 
principle of disintegration -- the fate of homelessness 
generalized to a planetary scale....The flesh is home: African 
nomads without houses decorate their faces and bodies instead. 
The skull is home. We fly in and out of it on mental errands. The 
highly developed spirit becomes a citizen of its own mobility, 
for home has been internalized and travels with the homeowner. 
Home, thus transformed: is freedom. Everywhere you hang your hat 
is home. Home is the bright light under the hat." -- Time "Essay" 
by Senior Writer Lance Morrow, December 24, 1990.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>

"Politicians led a victory parade of ga-ga worship, with people 
hugging tanks that have vacuumed billions from social programs. 
The Supreme Court ordered family planning centers to help keep 
women barefoot and pregnant by not telling poor women about 
abortion, while Congress refuses to appropriate enough funds to 
feed poor children. And the President says his big-deal domestic 
programs are highways and executions. Meanwhile, the S&L and 
banking fiascos flash around the country Willie Horton-style, 
raping not only women but men and children yet unborn." -- USA 
Today "Inquiry" Editor Barbara Reynolds, June 14.
<P>
"Oh say, we've seen too much. The Star-Spangled Banner pushes 
like a cough through America's mouth and the twilight's last 
gleaming is just that, a sickly flash above our heads as we ride 
unsuspecting in the bellies of sleek trains, plop to our knees in 
churches, embracing truths that disgust us." -- Boston Globe arts 
critic and "poet" Patricia Smith in The Nation's "Patriotism" 
issue, July 15/22.

<CENTER><H2>Quote of the Year</H2></CENTER>
<P>
"There is a `logic' too to Dahmer's crime. Raised in a culture 
that condoned racial prejudice and despised homosexuals, Dahmer 
appeared to believe he could preserve a place in mainstream 
society -- with all its furtive hopes of family, friends, and 
future -- by destroying the evidence of his homosexuality. He 
killed his 'lovers' -- mostly blacks -- dismembered them, and in 
some cases, may have devoured their remains. Crime is a logical, 
if messy, quick fix to the shortcomings of society. Is that the 
lesson then? That we get the criminals our societies deserve? 
Yes, of course." -- Time Associate Editor Howard G. Chua-Eoan in 
the magazine's "Essay," August 19.
<P>
<H4>Runners-up</H4>
<P>
<P>
"How can you who protest abortion be so certain that we aren't 
swimming toward a fate worse than death? Is homicide in the womb, 
swift and merciful, not better than the slow death that lies 
ahead for some of us once our lives begin?...Better to die now, 
before we can feel real pain, than to enter a world where life is 
so painful it's criminal to be born." -- USA Today "Inquiry" 
Editor Barbara Reynolds, August 16.
<P>
"It's a morbid observation, but if everyone on earth just stopped 
breathing for an hour, the greenhouse effect would no longer be a 
problem." -- Newsweek Senior Writer Jerry Adler, December 31, 
1990 issue.
<P>
"Tanks could crunch grass and other vegetation, knock down dunes 
and kick up sandstorms, said Ken Nagy, who teaches about deserts 
at the University of California at Los Angeles. `Plants and 
animals there are already living on the edge,' he said, 'and this 
insult could be enough to push them over the edge.'" -- Boston 
Globe reporter Larry Tye on impact on war upon Iraq and Kuwait 
desert life, January 18.

<H3>Bring Back the Iron Curtain Award</H3>

"This is Marlboro country, southeastern Poland, a place where the 
transition from communism to capitalism is making more people more 
miserable every day....No lines at the shops now, but plenty at 
some of the first unemployment centers in a part of the world 
where socialism used to guarantee everybody a job." -- CBS News 
reporter Bert Quint on the April 11 CBS Evening News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Communism is being swept away, but so too is the social safety 
net it provided....Factories, previously kept alive only by edicts 
from Warsaw, are closing their doors, while institutions new to 
the East, soup kitchens and unemployment centers are opening 
theirs...Here are the ones who may profit from Poland's economic 
freedom. A few slick locals, but mostly Americans, Japanese, and 
other foreigners out to cash in on a new source of cheap labor." 
-- Reporter Bert Quint on CBS This Morning, May 9.
<P>
"These refugees have been told little about the realities of life 
in the West, including the fact that some people sleep on the 
street...They will soon learn that jobs are hard to find, consumer 
goods expensive, relatives in Albania will be missed. Many 
refugees, according to experts, will suffer from depression, and 
in some cases, drug abuse." -- ABC's Mike Lee on what's facing 
fleeing Albanians, July 14 World News Tonight.
<P>
<H3>Kevin Phillips Tax Fairness Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"[C]ountless liberal analysts over the last five years have 
documented time and again how Reaganomics delivered a feast to the 
greedheads and starvation to the poor....[The Gilded Age and The 
Roaring Twenties] were marked by the same kinds of excesses as the 
1980s -- gross concentrations of wealth in the hands of a tiny 
privileged elite, achieved primarily by deliberate Republican 
policies that left most Americans behind while debt, greed, and 
conspicuous consumption soared out of control." -- Robert Rankin, 
national economics correspondent for Knight-Ridder Newspapers, in 
the July 22 Philadelphia Inquirer.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>

"For ten years Ronald Reagan taught us there was a free lunch. 
Folks, he said, we're going to cut your taxes and we're going to 
spend like there's no tomorrow and you don't have to pay for it. 
Folks, we're now paying for it and it's bitter medicine....we're 
going to have to raise taxes to get some sort of fairness 
here....For ten years the great wizard sold us that idea, that we 
could grow our way out of the deficits and we bought it, and we 
didn't." -- Sam Donaldson on This Week with David Brinkley, 
October 7.
<DD> 
"The tax package hammered out last weekend continues a Washington 
policy established in the Reagan era: It takes a heavy bite out of 
the paychecks of working-class Americans." -- Beginning of front 
page story by Boston Globe reporter Charles Stein, October 2.
<P>
<H3>Bring Back the Gas Lines Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"We have allowed this country to be held hostage by an industry 
that produces a product vital to our national interests. This 
makes about as much sense as having the military services or the 
nation's water supply controlled by private corporations....In the 
long run, what would make the most sense would be to nationalize 
the oil industry to protect the economy." -- Washington Post 
columnist Judy Mann, August 8.
<P>
<H3>Runner-Up:</H3>
<P>
<P>
"The hottest new proposal was a broad-based tax on sources of 
energy -- gasoline, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power. In all, 
it would raise about $20 billion. Everybody seemed to agree it was 
a good idea except, of course, the transportation lobby." -- 
Unbylined box in Newsweek, July 16. 
<P>
<H3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"If you're miffed because the Cold War's over, Ceaucescu's dead, 
the Sandinistas lost the election in Nicaragua and it seems like 
here's no one around to hate any more, then maybe The Hunt for Red 
October is just the thing....This is a Reagan youth's wet dream of 
underwater ballistics and East-West conflict." -- Washington Post 
film critic Desson Howe in the "Weekend" section, March 2.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"In a year that has had some of the dirtiest, the sleaziest, the 
most misleading ads ever, it's hard to pick the very worst, but 
here are a couple that the experts chose. North Carolina's Jesse 
Helms, who battled a black opponent, last week overtly introduced 
the most divisive issue of the contest, race....The truth is Gantt 
supported the vetoed civil rights bill which he argued 
specifically warned against quotas." -- ABC reporter Jackie Judd 
on Nightline, November 6.
<P>
"What Helms has done is taken the words 'North Carolina values' -- 
a beautiful phrase that evokes the small-town, good-hearted sense 
of place that one feels when one travels the state -- and 
redefined them as the values belonging to a certain group of North 
Carolinians, mostly white, mostly male, mostly unhappy with the 
changes of the last 30 years. To Helms and his supporters, 'North 
Carolina values' seems to translate into a status quo view of the 
world in which blacks, women, and poor people know their stations 
in society." -- Reporter Juan Williams in The Washington Post 
Magazine, October 28.
<P>
"Are you not also in danger of people looking at the Republican 
Party after this whole experience, and saying, 'Oh, now we do know 
what they stand for that's different. They stand for helping the 
rich and at the same time, the President's talking about vetoing 
the civil rights bill, so helping the rich and white guys?'" -- 
ABC and NPR reporter Cokie Roberts to Richard Darman, October 21 
This Week with David Brinkley.
<P>
<H3>Paul Ehrlich Ecological Panic Award</H3>
<P>
"If nothing is done to reverse ozone damage, scientists predict 
hundreds of millions of skin cancer cases in the U.S. alone, not 
to mention increased global warming that would turn much of the 
planet into a desert." -- Reporter Mark Phillips on the January 16 
CBS Evening News.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The missteps, poor efforts and setbacks brought on by the Reagan 
years have made this a more sober Earth Day. The task seems larger 
now." -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel, April 20.
<P>
"Clean air and water, pure food and natural beauty, which most 
Californians were all for a few months ago, have been made to seem 
a radical and expensive idea that has to be rejected at the polls 
on Tuesday. The stakes are very high in California because 
environmentalists know that if the Big Green initiative happens to 
pass there, the idea of cleaning up the air and water could spread 
like wildfire to all the other states. The forces opposing it know 
that too." -- Charles Kuralt on America Tonight, October 31.
<P>
<H3>Good Morning Morons Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"We would like to believe the State of the Union address is a time 
when the President tells the American people the way it is. But no 
one really wants to hear that, so the President keeps reality down 
to a minimum. The President was remarkably upbeat for a man who 
runs a country with a monstrous national debt, huge balance of 
trade problems, a crumbling infrastructure, dirty air, countless 
homeless people, a coast-to-coast drug epidemic, and a faltering 
self-image." -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, February 2.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed. Just how 
much will be the primary issue on the agenda when Congressional 
leaders meet with the President later today, Wednesday, May the 
9th, 1990. And good morning, welcome to Today. It's a Wednesday 
morning, a day when the budget picture, frankly, seems gloomier 
than ever. It now seems the time has come to pay the fiddler for 
our costly dance of the Reagan years." -- Bryant Gumbel opening 
NBC's Today, May 9.
<P>
Bob Squier, Democratic Strategist: "I think that it was a game of 
chicken. I think what you had was Gingrich, who is supposed to be 
part of the leadership, leading people literally out of the deal."
Bryant Gumbel: "Acting irresponsibly."
Gumbel: "....Is this the legacy of Ronald Reagan politics, I mean, 
feel-good politics of the '80s, no-responsibility politics of the 
'80s?"
Roger Ailes, Republican Strategist: "I think that's a misnomer..."
Gumbel: "But weren't the '80s about spending what we didn't have? 
And that was Ronald Reagan." -- Exchanges on Today, October 5.
<P>
<H3>Most Honest Confession Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as objective reporting...I've become even 
more crafty about finding the voices to say the things I think are 
true. That's my subversive mission." -- Boston Globe environmental 
reporter Dianne Dumanoski at an Utne Reader symposium May 17-20. 
Quoted by Micah Morrison in the July American Spectator. 
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"I think that when abortion opponents complain about a bias in 
newsrooms against their cause, they're absolutely right."
"Opposing abortion, in the eyes of most journalists...is not a 
legitimate, civilized position in our society." --  Boston Globe 
legal reporter Ethan Bronner in Los Angeles Times reporter David 
Shaw's series on abortion coverage, July 1. 
<P>
"After seeing our footage, she told us that Frontline doesn't 
co-produce anti-communist programs." --Cinematographer Nestor 
Almendros on a Frontline producer's reaction to his anti-Castro 
documentary Nobody Listened, quoted by Don Kowet in the August 8 
Washington Times.
<P>
<H3>Gorbasm Award*</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has probably moved more quickly than any person in the 
history of the world. Moving faster than Jesus Christ did. America 
is always lagging six months behind...I think we can get by easily 
with a $75 billion military budget. Those bombers and all of this 
stuff is an absolute waste of money and a joke." -- Ted Turner, 
"TV chieftain with an outspoken conscience," celebrated in the 
January 22 Time.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The supreme leader of an atheistic state was baptized as a child. 
Now, in a sense, Gorbachev means to accomplish the salvation of an 
entire society that has gone astray...Much more than that, 
Gorbachev is a visionary enacting a range of complex and sometimes 
contradictory roles. He is simultaneously the communist Pope and 
the Soviet Martin Luther, the apparatchik as Magellan and McLuhan. 
The Man of the Decade is a global navigator." -- Time Senior 
Writer Lance Morrow, January 1.
<P>
"He has, as many great leaders have, impressive eyes...There's a 
kind of laser-beam stare, a forced quality, you get from Gorbachev 
that does not come across as something peaceful within himself. 
It's the look of a kind of human volcano, or he'd probably like to 
describe it as a human nuclear energy plant." -- Dan Rather on 
Mikhail Gorbachev, quoted in the May 10 Seattle Times.
<P>
<H3>Thurgood Marshall Judicial Reporting Award</H3>
<P>
"Supreme Court nominee David Souter wants the world to stop 
viewing him as a nerd. Senate Democrats want to know if, instead, 
Souter is a neanderthal -- a mean-spirited conservative bent on 
wrecking constitutional protections for women, minorities, and 
accused criminals." -- Beginning of September 13 USA Today cover 
story by legal reporter Tony Mauro.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"Chief Justice Rehnquist had the kind of image problems that might 
be expected of a jurist who habitually rejected constitutional 
equality for women, approved the execution of allegedly insane 
prisoners without a hearing, denied constitutional equality to 
aliens and bastards, asserted that the public did not have a 
constitutional right to attend court trials, said prisoners had no 
rights to practice religious freedom, and spoke warmly of the 
legendary Isaac ('Hanging Judge') Parker, who cheerfully ordered 
eighty-five executions." -- Former CBS News law reporter Fred 
Graham in his book Happy Talk.
<P>
"Senator Simon, is there any doubt in your mind that [Souter's] 
views pretty well parallel those of John Sununu's which means he's 
anti-abortion or anti-women's rights, whichever way you want to 
put it?" -- Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News, July 23.
<P>
<H3>Jim Florio Tax Advocacy Award</H3>
<P>
<P>
"The overall tax burden for Americans, local, state and federal, 
is actually quite low....The fact is Americans could pay more 
taxes and the country wouldn't go down the tube. Taxpayers don't 
believe this because they are being conned by the 
politicians....The truth is that the United States needs higher 
taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders are now starting 
to say that, but until more say it, the country will remain in 
trouble." -- Commentator John Chancellor on the NBC Nightly News, 
April 17.
<P>
<H4>Runners-Up:</H4>
<P>
<P>
"The fact is that most government spending cannot be cut. The way 
out of the mess is for the government to raise some money through 
taxes and at last that's being done. And there's encouraging news 
in the returns from yesterday's elections. Six states from 
Massachusetts to California rejected measures designed to limit 
taxation. Can it be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is 
coming to an end? If true, maybe the country can get on with the 
business of balancing its books in a sensible and logical way." -- 
John Chancellor on NBC Nightly News, November 7.
<P>
"[Except] for capital gains, it is certain the President won't 
mention the T word, and yet taxes are very much at the heart of 
what all our potential solutions are. How long can both sides 
pretend that a hike's not needed?" -- Bryant Gumbel on Today, 
January 31.
<P>
<H3>Media Hero Award/Abroad</H3>
<P>
<P>
"Ortega's defeat is something American Presidents had sought for 
ten years. Yet Ortega's statesman-like acceptance of the voters'

"We talked to one observer who told us that if he were awarding 
the Nobel Prize, he would nominate Mikhail Gorbachev and Daniel 
Ortega. What do you think of that?" -- one of Norville's questions

"Mandela leaves as a principled man, with all but the dullards 
understanding why he would embrace the Palestinians, whose 
children are being killed and family homes bulldozed in Israel 
just as black families' are in Soweto....Moreover, if Mandela is a 
terrorist -- as conservatives have called him -- he would fit 
right in with U.S. patriots such as George Washington, Patrick 
Henry, Nat Turner, and Harriet Tubman. If it had not been for 
those terrorists, what would we have to wave our flags about on

"Let Ronald Reagan ride off into the sunset untroubled by fleeting 
memories of astrologers, smoke-and-mirrors budget arithmetic, and 
arms-for-hostages swaps. Dwell instead on those political tall 
timbers still standing, the heirs of Jefferson, Madison, and 
Lincoln....Only Jesse Jackson, still an acquired taste for most 
white Americans, can strike the kind of inspirational pose that 
one could imagine being immortalized in granite." -- Time Senior

"[Justice William Brennan] loved the flag clearly, and the 
Constitution, too...Maybe the way to remember Brennan's years on 
the Court is with some words he spoke to another Georgetown 
University event back in 1979. 'The quest for freedom, dignity, 
and the rights of man will never end,' he said. The quest, though 
always old, is never old, like the poor old woman in Yeats' play. 
'Did you see an old woman going down the path?' asked Bridget. 'I 
did not,' replied Patrick, who had come into the house just after 
the old woman had left it. 'But I saw a young girl and she had the 
walk of a queen.' William Brennan loved and served two young girls 
who walked like queens -- his country, and its highest court." --

who lies to Congress and to the people will be hailed as a hero

short, that lies to Congress and to the people is the accepted

tentacles reaching into all aspects of Soviet life. But keep in 
mind the KGB is like a combination of the CIA, the FBI, of the 
National Security Agency, the Secret Service, and the Coast Guard, 
too. From Lenin to Stalin to Gorbachev, its members have been a 
proud corps of the national elite, intelligent, talented, and

was necessary long before Gorbachev came to power." -- Diane

who saw him as an instrument of Moscow. The Contra rebels were the 
blunt instrument in Ronald Reagan's attack on Daniel Ortega. 
Reagan's dogged support for the Contras forever marked and 
ultimately scarred his foreign policy....Many of the Contras were 
former members of the Nicaraguan National Guard, Somoza's

ludicrous example....There is little more logic to Lithuania being 
permitted to unilaterally and unlawfully declare its independence 
from the USSR than there would be for Texas to secede from the 
USA. Both were grabbed during a war. But both owe much to their

Tom Brokaw on budget impasse, NBC Nightly News October 5.

"Devoting the bulk of future defense savings to erasing the

its health without cutting already anemic social spending." --

"Incapable of believing his country wrong, or himself wrong, 
Reagan encouraged his fellow citizens in that same belief. If he 
gave us a renewed self-respect, he led us beyond it to the

the price we will end up paying for that little lesson in

Congress would have to confront it more honestly -- raise taxes or 
gouge the Pentagon." -- Reporter Dale Russakoff on the Moynihan 
Social Security tax cut plan, January 18 Washington Post.

"But Congress is not solely -- or even primarily to blame. For a 
decade the Reagan and Bush Administrations have been submitting 
fraudulent, free-lunch budgets that promised huge tax cuts, a 
social 'safety net,' a 'kinder, gentler' nation, improved 
education, a war on drugs, the greatest military buildup in

"For a long time they [taxpayers] accepted the conventional wisdom 
that if you cut taxes for the rich the benefits would trickle down 
to everybody. But all the latest polls now show that most 
taxpayers have finally come to suspect otherwise....So if and when 
they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going 
to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they 
avoided in the '80s." -- Reporter Richard Threlkeld, October 16 
CBS Evening News.
<P>
"The Brennan departure has also caused concern about the 
survivability of affirmative action programs. In civil rights 
circles, there is fear that a Supreme Court, with a philosophical 
scale weighted to the right, will no longer be a force for social 
change...Also seen at risk in a court without Brennan, the limits 
of individual freedom." -- CNN reporter Candy Crowley on 
PrimeNews, July 21.

"It's hard to get the world psyched up for a summit when the 
stakes keep going down. It used to be the future of all mankind 
hung in the balance every time the Soviets and Americans talked. 
That's all changed since our respective leaders finally figured 
out the expensive and dangerous race to build more and more 
nuclear weapons was pretty much a waste of everyone's time and 
resources. There's a limit, after all, to how much of the world 
you can wreck and still feel good about yourself." -- CBS This 
Morning co-host Harry Smith in his weekly "Record of Who We Are" 
commentary, June 1.

"It took twenty years for the world to come Ronald Dellums' way. 
Widely viewed as what he calls a 'radical Commie pinko' when he 
came to Congress in 1971, the Democrat from Berkeley, Calif., has 
emerged in 1990 as a principal player on defense policy." -- USA 
Today reporter Richard Wolf, March 15.

"There seems to be a longing for something that is just more 
real...In the final analysis, we all knew the '80s society wasn't 
real. The Wall Street finances, the yuppies, the Perrier, the 
opulence, all of that was not real and after 10 years, maybe we're 
starving for a good plain meal." -- Jane Pauley describing her new 
NBC series Real Life in USA Today, July 17.
"Jane Pauley needs a reality check. Real life for her is living in 
Manhattan and a million-dollar salary. Stop trashing the '80s, 
Jane. It's the decade that made you rich and famous." -- Letter 
responding to Pauley's remarks, July 19 USA Today.

"The fact of the matter is that everybody you're looking at here 
is a reporter, and the fellow in Moscow [Dan Rather] as well, and 
we report about other people. There's not a commentator on this

simply don't do what you're saying." -- 60 Minutes correspondent 
Mike Wallace defending a panel of CBS reporters against charges of 
liberal bias, especially on abortion coverage, on the May 18 
Donahue.

"It was an extraordinary performance, almost as sensational and 
ruinous as the acts of Buddhist monks in Saigon who once set 
themselves on fire in front of cameras in an ultimate statement of 
protest. By reaching a white-hot intensity, Silber probably 
frightened away voters who represented his last possibility to win 
new support." -- Boston Globe reporter Curtis Wilkie five days 
before Silber won primary.

"The price of gas today in the United States has gone up -- $1.40, 
$1.50, maybe even $1.60 some places, but around the world the 
price is $3 and $4 a gallon, and people pay it gladly. Senator 
Lieberman, do you think we have some God-given right to low 
prices?" -- Sam Donaldson on Nightline, October 17.
<P>
"Jimmy Carter the President wasn't particularly well liked. Carter 
the prophet was right on the money. The gas lines of the Arab oil 
embargo apparently left little lasting impression, though....Just 
this week, the Senate killed a bill that would have forced car 
makers to significantly improve gas mileage. Maybe we just don't 
care that much." -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith,

Many of these quotes have already appeared in previous<a href="../reality/../cyberalert"> CyberAlerts</a>, 
but I urge you to check out the quotes beneath the<b> "U.S. News Under Jim Fallows: More Liberal Bias
More Often"</b> heading. It's a very illuminating contrast caught by <a href="../news">MRC news</a> analyst Jim Forbes.

"A federal jury in North Carolina ordered ABC television today to
pay the Food Lion supermarkets five and a half million dollars in
punitive damages. That's in connection with an undercover news
investigation that proved to be true...Important to note that the
truth of the report was never at issue in the lawsuit, not even
challenged, only the journalistic techniques." 
<br>-- Dan Rather on
the CBS Evening News, January 22.
<p>
<b>Reality Check:</b>
<br>
<dd>
"Food Lion claimed 'the unedited footage provides an extraordinary
look at how a network news magazine can create false impressions,'
and that 'ABC producers and editors used a combination of staged
events and selective editing to fit a preconceived story line and
systematically fabricate a story to deceive the public.' In one
specific instance, Food Lion claims that when ABC used
hidden-camera footage of a Food Lion employee talking about how
she had cooked a batch of out-of-date chicken, it edited out the
part where she says she brought the matter up with her manager,
who directed her to throw the chicken away." 
<br>-- New Republic media
columnist William Powers, January 20.

"But there's another reason why all but nine of the 225 House
Republicans backed Gingrich: deep reservations about the man next
in line, the hard-right majority leader, Dick Armey. Just as Dan
Quayle's lack of gravitas led many Republicans to pray for the
health of George Bush, Armey's ideological stubbornness and
hot-headed rhetoric inspire in his colleagues protective optimism
about Gingrich....In a House brimming with mean-spirited rhetoric,
Armey stands out." 
<br>-- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writers Kent
Jenkins Jr. and Paul Glastris, January 20 issue.

"Gore's commitment to the world of big ideas is no pose. Unlike
John F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson, who became darlings of the
highbrow set without fully earning the honor, Gore is truly
engaged in the life of the mind...Had the younger Gore not become
a Congressman at 28, a Senator at 36, and Vice President at 44, he
might have become the sort of essayist who aspires to membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Letters." 
<br>-- U.S. News Senior Writer Timothy Noah, January 27 issue.
<p>
<center><b>Absolving Clinton</center></b>
<p>
<dd>
"There's been a lot of talk lately, as you know, printed and so
forth, about the Lincoln Bedroom and the people who stay here. And
obviously a lot of them are your friends. And I don't think
anybody would begrudge somebody having guests in their own house.
Some of them, though, it seems apparently you didn't know quite as
well. And we're wondering if you might feel let down a little bit
by your staff or by the DNC in their zeal to raise funds?" 
<br>--Question from Washington Post reporters in interview published
Jan. 19.
<p>
<center><b>Hillary's White House Hell</center></b>
<p>
<b>CBS reporter Martha Teichner</b>: "Health care was just the beginning.
She has been the subject of a non-stop, ceaseless litany of
investigations. Three at the moment being conducted by Whitewater
special counsel Kenneth Starr. Speculation she may be indicted
continues."
<br>
<b>Hillary Clinton</b>: "I expect this matter to drag out as long as it
is to anyone else's advantage to drag it out and then it will end.
I mean no one likes to be accused of having done anything improper
or wrong. It becomes frustrating when you know that people are
saying things that aren't true, but you just learn to live with it
and you just go on day after day and..."
<br>
<b>Teichner</b>: "But how do you do that though in the climate of a
non-stop four- or even eight-year bashing?"<br> 
-- January 19 CBS Sunday Morning. (Teichner and Hillary were classmates at Wellesley
College.)
<p>
<center><b>Illegal Taping? Don't Let It Distract from Nailing Newt</center></b> 
<p>
<dd>
"I'm not trying to minimize the offense here, though I would have
to suggest that the ones of Speaker Gingrich look considerably
more severe than Mr. McDermott's." 
<br>-- Chicago Tribune reporter
Ellen Warren on CNN & Company, January 16.
<p>
<dd>
"As a political matter, the Republicans managed brilliantly on the
last two weekends of television talk shows to keep the focus where
they wanted....Of course, they could not have done it without the
Democrats' giving them a clear field. The first weekend the
Democrats had available a Time magazine article suggesting that
the leadership, possibly waving campaign money, put pressure on
two ethics committee members to write an extraordinary letter
telling colleagues to vote for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. The
Democrats hardly brought it up. Then last weekend the Democrats
effectively failed to make their case that the taped conversation,
whatever its ancestry, showed that Mr. Gingrich had broken his
promises to the ethics committee." 
<br>-- New York Times reporter Adam
Clymer, who first reported the contents of the GOP cellular phone
conversation, in a January 16 "news analysis."
<p>
<dd>
"The New Republic points out this week that the book [To Renew
America] leans heavily on copyrighted materials developed for
Newt's college course by the tax-exempt group that is at the
center of his current problems. That could well be a violation of
IRS rules that prohibit tax-exempt organizations from transferring
assets to private individuals. It also calls into question
Gingrich's claim that he's no Jim Wright -- the Democratic Speaker
whose ouster he spearheaded -- because he never sought to line his
own pockets. After taxes, his royalties would have stuffed his
pockets with something like $300,000 -- the amount of his fine.
Maybe he should hand it over. If nothing else, it would prove that
even when you can't count on the rule of law in Washington,
there's always poetic justice." 
<br>-- Conclusion to Time Senior
Editor Richard Lacayo's story, January 27 issue.
<p>
<center><b>Shaw Fawns</center></b>
<p>
<dd>
"A very, very special day for this President when you recall that
four years ago he came to this city, he was expecting so much. His
mother was at his side there at the Inaugural. She passed away a
year later. And when you look at what was besetting the United
States, a four trillion dollar deficit, budget problems, foreign
policy problems. The budget deficit now has decreased. There seems
to be relative peace in Bosnia. The Middle East, the breakthrough
of the Hebron agreement, a lot has gone on in four short years."
<br>
-- Bernard Shaw during CNN Inauguration coverage, January 20.
<p>
<center><b>God, I Admire You</center></b>

"Tribe's detractors think his arrogance is finally catching up
with him. 'He was his usual glib self,' one veteran practitioner
sniffed after the argument. But Tribe has a lot to be arrogant and
glib about. There is still no one better on his feet, no one
better able to respond to questions from the justices with a fully
developed and usually persuasive response. But sometimes he seems
too nimble, too cerebral, too able to see contradiction and
ironies and nuances light-years before the justices and other mere
mortals are able to. Especially coming in the last quarter of a
two-hour argument, he seemed to make the justices' heads hurt.
Baryshnikov probably has had the same effect on dance aficionados
-- too much dazzle to take all at once. Maybe Tribe needs to slow
down and simplify his routine the next time out -- and dance the
macarena instead of Swan Lake." 
<br>-- USA Today reporter Tony Mauro
in the January 13 Legal Times.
<p>
<center><b>CBS: Clueless Broadcasting System</b></center>
<p>
<b>Larry King</b>: "I'm told by our producers, that a lot of calls, so
rather than make it microscopic here, are complaining about
advocates being hired by television stations. [Robert] Shapiro was
on one side in the Simpson trial, he's hired. [George]
Stephanopoulos is now at ABC -- that we're not getting balance."
<br>
<b>Dan Rather</b>: "I think that's a valid criticism. I'm concerned about
it. Look, a Bill Moyers came out of the Lyndon Johnson White House
and became one of the great journalists of all time."
<br>
<b>King</b>: "But a major liberal, self-confessed."
<br>
<b>Rather</b>: "Ah, is he? I don't want to get into that, but he was
terrific. I do think, personal opinion, it's gone too far."

<CENTER><B>Gumbel's Parting Shocker: I'm Not Conservative!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>
"I don't know if I have a liberal bent...But it is fair to say it's very difficult for a black man in this country to be of a conservative bent. That's a fair statement. It's very difficult to be an African- American male, and have an African-American son who is going to be 18 years of age, and hear things like cops want to crack down and send more to prison, to hear calls for tougher statutes, less welfare, less programs for the poor, and less things for people of color. If that says I'm not conservative, so be it."
<BR>
-- Bryant Gumbel in the January 2 USA Today, the day before his last morning as co-host of NBC's Today.
<P>
<CENTER><B> Gingrich the Assassin</B></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>
"Newt Gingrich's problem, I've always thought, he's like Lenin. They both made a revolution by shooting people -- Newt shot Democrats, Lenin shot everybody -- and then they didn't have enough sense to stop shooting once they won. So, I mean, once you win, you say, 'Okay, now I've shot all your relatives, but you're a good guy, let's work together.' Instead, Newt shut down the government and kept on trying to shoot Democrats."<br>

-- ABC's Sam Donaldson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, January 8.
<P>
<DD>
Margaret Carlson, Time: "If we didn't have Newt Gingrich having brought down Jim Wright on, on, I think, picayune, as picayune as this, then I think there would be less hostility towards him at this moment." 
<BR> 
Andrew Ferguson, The Weekly Standard: "Jim Wright was trying to line his own pockets in the most sordid, squalid sort of way...." Carlson: "But he [Gingrich] was lining his own personal power pockets, which is just as bad."
<br>
-- December 28 Capital Gang on CNN.
<P>
<DD>
"Not just maybe from a technical point of view, but you had the Speaker, somebody who led the assault on Jim Wright, he never ended up getting prosecuted, he never broke the law. Doesn't the Speaker's credibility kind of get diminished by this and doesn't he become a symbol of somebody who broke the rules as opposed to somebody who followed the rules? Doesn't this give you a credibility problem?"
<br>
-- CBS reporter Rita Braver to U.S. Rep Chris Shays (R-Conn.), December 29 Face the Nation.
<P>
<CENTER><B> Cronkite the Censor</B></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>
"It's [the Internet] at the moment highly dangerous; I hope that we pacify it in the near future. A three-page, very slickly done presentation alleged that I was drunk in an Orlando restaurant and spit in a man's soup. And no way to trace it whatsoever. It seems to me that these sources of so called information should have to identify themselves. There should be a sense of responsibility placed upon them to stand behind what they report. I just abhor any form of censorship, but I do not think there's anything wrong at all with banning anonymous information."
<br>

<P>
Biggest Winner: "Loretta Sanchez who toppled Bob Dornan, the scourge of all thinking people. And also awakened us to the power of the Hispanic vote, even in Republican stronghold Orange County." 
<br>     
Most Decisive Campaign Moment: "Sadly, the flap over the Indonesian campaign contributions. The only thing that moved the polls all year. Probably cost the Democrats control of the House." 
<br>
Turncoat of the Year: "Sherrie Rowlands, the lady of the night who ratted on Dick Morris and tarnished what would otherwise have been a big win for him."

Fairest Rap: "My fairest rap is like Clarence's [Page], that Ken Starr is a partisan Republican. True, true, true."

<CENTER><B>Alter's Tumescent Analysis</B></CENTER>
<P>

"Overlaying this structure was a national politics heavily conditioned by nearly half a century of cold war. Strength and toughness trumped everything else. At one military briefing during the 1980s, Reagan was shown models of American missiles. The American power phalluses were long and white; the Soviets', shorter and black. We were still safely ahead, but only by the margin of our machismo."

<P>
<CENTER><B>Criminal Welfare Reform Will Bring Starvation</B></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>
"The most shameful act of '96 was welfare reform....welfare reform became a political football in '96, an easy way to kick around the poor and especially poor children and immigrants, even legal immigrants. Bill Clinton thought the GOP had a hot issue, so he closed his eyes and signed a bill that punishes children and people who want to work, but can't find a job in a tough market for entry level employment. This was a criminal act, further dividing us as haves and have nots. It was shameful."
<br>
-- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang, December 29.
<P>
<br>
"Welfare Ends. Acknowledging that the new law was 'seriously flawed,' President Clinton signed it anyway, ending welfare as we know it....Supporters said the new law would get people on their feet, but criticism came from many quarters: from states that said they couldn't meet the deadlines, from social workers who said the new system will plunge more people into poverty, from three top federal officials who resigned in protest. 'I think a lot of people will start starving,' said Shawn Cornett, a 22-year-old welfare recipient in Kentucky."

<CENTER><B>Bombing Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>

"Robert Dornan. B-1 Bob went ballistic after narrowly losing his House seat in Orange County, California, to Hispanic financial analyst Loretta Sanchez. Threatening to sue her for election fraud, Dornan called Sanchez a 'liar' and said 'the whole thing stinks to high heaven.' Of course, sour grapes were to be expected from the former fighter pilot who once grabbed a fellow Congressman by the collar and called him a 'draft-dodging wimp.' Sanchez's campaign manager, John Sullivan, spoke for many when he said of Dornan, 'He's been, and continues to be, a national disgrace. All we can say is Adios.' The bad news is that Dornan will now have more time for his second job as Rush Limbaugh's substitute host."

 <P>
<CENTER><B>Media Bias: A Ditsy Notion</B></CENTER>
<P>

"The latter [Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes] has made his fervent mantra the ditsy notion of the media having perverted the United States by being a cesspool of lefty ideologues. Sure, as in ABC's David Brinkley publicly calling President Clinton a bore."

<B>Editor's Note:</b> January 3 will be Bryant Gumbel's last day after 15 years as co-host of NBC's Today.  By my count Bryant Gumbel has co-hosted Today just seven mornings in December, but I assume he'll be back most of the December 30-January 3 week, his last.  USA Today "Inside TV" columnist Peter Johnson reported December 23 that CBS and ABC and are fighting to land Gumbel: "ABC News is considered the front-runner, but ABC News chief Roone Arledge says not to count out NBC, which he predicts will make "a major move to keep him.' Gumbel ' is terrific. Anybody would love to have him.'" Anybody, that is, interested in promoting liberals and denigrating conservatives. 
<p>
A special good-bye salute to Bryant Gumbel, our bountiful Babylon of biased bombast. Here are highlights from 1989 through 1996. 
<p>
<center><B>1989</B></center>
<p>
<DD>
"Blacks have looked at the past eight years and seen this administration retreat from civil rights, retreat from affirmative action, make South Africa no priority, continue to see a greater disparity economically between blacks and whites, foster a spirit of racism that hasn't been seen in 20-plus years."
<br>
-- To Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, January 19 Today. 
<p>
<DD>
"Largely as a result of the policies and priorities of the Reagan administration, more people are becoming poor and staying poor in this country than at any time since World War II."
<br>
-- July 17 Today. 
<p>
<DD>
"This test is not going to tell you whether you're a racist or a liberal."
<br>
-- Previewing his prime-time special The Racial Attitudes and Consciousness Exam, September 5 Today. 
<p><p>
<center><B>1990</B></center>
<p>
<DD>
"It is certain the President won't mention the T word, and yet taxes are very much at the heart of what all our potential solutions are. How long can both sides pretend that a hike's not needed?"
<br>
-- January 31. 
<p>
<DD>
"The missteps, poor efforts, and setbacks brought on by the Reagan years have made this a more sober Earth Day. The task seems larger now." 
<br>
-- April 20 Today. 
<p>
<DD>
"The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed....It's a Wednesday morning, a day when the budget picture, frankly, seems gloomier than ever. It now seems the time has come to pay the fiddler for our costly dance of the Reagan years."
<br>
-- Gumbel leading off  Today, May 9. 
<p><p>
<center><B>1991</B></center>
<p>
<DD>
"Tonight the NBC News program Expos, looks at incidence of sexual harassment in [federal low-income] housing....Well, I guess that's where the problem began. Actually, it was when the budget was taken out of the affordable housing market during the Reagan years and thus, the problem came about."
<br>
-- To reporter Michele Gillen, September 20 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>
Reporter Lea Thompson: "...So you can't depend on government police to do this for you. We did find this flammable sleepwear everywhere we went."<BR> 
<dd>
Gumbel: "Lea, Lea, real quick. Why is the government abdicating its responsibility on this? Is this another holdover from the Reagan years and the cutbacks?" 
<dd>     
Thompson: "Absolutely. And somebody's gotta do something."
<br>
--Exchange on Today, November 13. 
<p>
<p>
<center><B>1992</B></center>
<p>

"The boom years following World War II saw the economy take off, giving rise to the growth of the great American middle class. The rising standard of living meant homes, cars, TVS, college for the kids -- all in all, a piece of the American dream. But in the Reagan years, economic erosion set in, so much so that the middle class now finds itself in ever-deepening trouble."
<br>
-- January 22 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>     
"We keep looking for some good to come out of this. Maybe it might help in putting race relations on the front burner after they've been subjugated so long as a result of the Reagan years."

"It's early yet, but for at least trying to address the deficit in a more serious fashion than anyone in 12 years, what kind of early marks do you give Bill Clinton?"
<br>
-- To author Gerald Swanson, March 17 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>"In the greedy excesses of the Reagan years, the mean income of the average physician nearly doubled, from $88,000 to $170,000. Was that warranted?"
<br>
-- To the AMA's Richard Corlin, March 31 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>
"If I'm a young black man in South Central L.A., where poverty is rampant and unemployment is skyrocketing, I see that Washington's promises of a year ago have gone unfulfilled, I see that perhaps for a second time, the court's inability to mete out justice in a blind fashion, why shouldn't I vent my anger?"
<br>
-- To U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), April 15 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<center><B>1994</B></center>
<p>
<DD>
"It's been written that being black in America is like being a witness at your own lynching. Why didn't your experience make you more resentful than you are today?"
<br>
-- To criminal-turned-Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, March 22 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>
"We've got an awful lot to talk about this week, including the sexual harassment suit against the President. Of course, in that one, it's a little tough to figure out who's really being harassed." 
<br>
-- Today, May 10. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>
"You're aligned to a party which owes many of its victories to the so-called religious right and other conservative extremists who are historically insensitive to minority concerns. That doesn't bother you?"
<br>
-- To U.S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), November 9 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<center><B>1995</B></center>
<p>
<DD>
"You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, 'trickle-down terrorists who base their agenda on division, exclusion, and fear.' Do you think middle class Americans are in need of protection from that group?" 
<br>
-- To about-to-be House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, January 4 Today. 
<p>
<p>
<DD>
"Janet Reno has asked for an independent counsel to investigate charges against HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is being investigated. Questions have been raised about Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy resigned under pressure, as did Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders. The Clinton White House seems to be having a hard time retaining high-profile minorities particularly. Do you think, Senator, they are being held to a higher standard in Washington than their white predecessors?"

"This comes at a time when Republicans are looking to gut the Clean Water Act and also the Safe Drinking Water Act. What are our options? Are we now forced to boil water because bottled water is not an economically feasible option for a lot of people?"

"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is still being treated as if he were guilty."

<center><b>Gumbel's Morning Devotions</b></center>
<P>
Bryant Gumbel: "You write that you prayed more during your four years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the more ineffective Presidents of modern times." 
<br> 
Jimmy Carter: "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have a right to your opinion." 
<br>          
Gumbel: "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view. What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of prayer?"
<br> 
-- Exchange on Today about Carter's new book, Living Faith, November 18. 
<P>
<center><b>Time Does DNC Damage Control</b></center>
<P>
<dd>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White House behind them." 
<br>
-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs, November 11. 
<p>
<dd>          
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make anybody blush."
<br>
-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page. 
<p>
<dd>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?)"
<br> 
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue. 
<P>
<center><b>Eleanor "Sybil" Clift</b></center>
<P>
<dd>
"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very seamy circumstances. That's fair game."
<br> 
-- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group. 
<center>vs.</center> 
<br>
<dd>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth this investigation." 
<br>
-- Clift, later in the same show. 
<P>
<center><b>Fabulous Clinton Cabinet</b></center>
<P>
<dd>
"Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who is the Treasury Secretary?" 
<br>
-- Tom Brokaw during NBC News election night coverage. 
<P>
<center><b>Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever</b></center>
<P>
<dd>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures, liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character."
<br> 
-- New York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's memoirs, October 20. 
<P>
<center><b>It's Her Ideas, Stupid</b></center>
<P>
CBS reporter Rita Braver: "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
<br> 
Hillary Clinton: "So it's a kind of difficult position and I think the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and see how it turns out."
<br>
-- CBS Evening News story, November 25. 
<P>
<center><b>Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria</b></center>
<P>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died. Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country, but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives, saying that Hiss had never been a spy."
<br> 
-- Tom Brokaw, November 15 NBC Nightly News. 
<br>
On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian General admitted he didn't have access to all records." 
<br> 
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last year we reported that the Russian President  Boris Yeltsin said that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim."
<br> 
-- Peter Jennings, November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a "clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr. Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive." 
<br>          
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the communist threat."
<br> 
-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15. 
<P>
<DD>
Reality Check: 
<DD>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March 1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable, there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss."
<br> 
-- Meet the Press host Tim Russert, November 24. 
<P>
<centerr><B>Very Questionable Sources of Information</b></center>
<P> 
<DD>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways, but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of this nutty stuff."
<BR>
 --  Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington. 
<br>
<dd> 
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question. Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with historically large deficits, why would we do it again?"
<br> 
-- Peter G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People, November 3 New York Times Book Review.

"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession." -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30

<P>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." -- <i>World News Tonight</i>, October 27, 1992.
<P>
"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." -- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS <i>Evening News</i>.

"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." -- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS <i>Evening News</i>. The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." -- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC <i>Nightly News.</i>

"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.
<P>
"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." -- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21.

"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." -- Actress Blair Brown narrating <i>Frontline</i> on PBS, 
October 8.

"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues

"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
utrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts

<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,

enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"

"Elections, like actions, have consequences. Sometimes it's hard
to know what they might be. Did Americans know that electing
Ronald Reagan would send the deficit through the roof? Do we
know that electing Bob Dole would lessen drug use?" -- CNN

"Kenneth Starr, the supposedly non-partisan independent counsel

<CENTER><H3>Really Helping Dole Make It A Close Race?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Reporters want nothing more than, this year and four years ago,
to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the
fight, the close call....So it's in our best interest to make it
look close, to make Bob Dole look good." 
<DD>-- <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reporter Ellen Warren on CNN's<I> Crossfire</I>, September 20.
<P>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<P>
"The former Senator argued that voters have a choice between two
different visions of government... The ex-deficit hawk returned
to the centerpiece of his campaign, a 15 percent tax cut.
Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing President
Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason for this
attack. But between now and election day the Republican nominee
has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole plan."
<DD>-- Reporter Phil Jones, September 24 CBS <I>Evening News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
NBC reporter David Bloom: "So now Dole, who's complained about
Clinton's campaign of fear, is taking a similar tack."
Bob Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to
the White House."<BR>
Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame."<DD> -- September 24 NBC
<I>Nightly News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
"The same cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton seems to
work directly against Bob Dole, with many voters here calling his
15 percent tax cut idea a political gimmick....Many of the voters
we spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government
shutdown, for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for
attempts to trim Medicare specifically." <DD>-- ABC's Dean Reynolds
in Michigan, Sept. 23 <I>World News Tonight</I>.

"Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
<P>
"Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal, most
white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's out
walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?" 
<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran in part one of
three day interview series, September 30 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
Gumbel: "Do you think if those two victims had been, say,
Marguerite, his first wife, and Al Cowlings, his best friend,
that there would have been the same amount [of media attention]?"
Johnnie Cochran: "Absolutely not. And I think any person who
wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."
Gumbel: "Why? Because America doesn't care about black victims?"
<P>
"Most white Americans still charge that O.J.'s jurors didn't do
their job. You talk about a rush to judgment. They would claim
the same. They would claim the verdict was race-based. Do you
think their judgment of those jurors is race-based?"
<P>
"Do you think O.J. will ever get a fair shake in this country?
Will people ever let him live out his life and accept the fact
that he was acquitted?" <DD>-- Some of Gumbel's questions to Cochran,
October 2.

"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives

to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." <DD>--
<I>Chicago Tribune</I>, September 5.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Tax Cuts: Crazy Candy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Pollsters, pundits, look at these numbers and they'll say this
thing is locked....There is no way Dole can overcome this. Why
doesn't he just accept it and be himself? Try to hold the
Republican Congress and get rid of this book, and get rid of
these crazy 15 percent tax cuts and speak from the heart?" <DD> -- NBC
Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to Dole campaign manager
Scott Reed on CNBC's <I>Tim Russert</I>, September 22.
<P>
"Americans are forever grumbling about high taxes and big
government. You'd think promising a tax cut would be like giving
away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a
terrific theory! And so what if Democratic doctors say they are a
couple of quacks. Gene [Randall], have some candy!"
<DD> -- CNN analyst Bill Schneider on <I>Inside Politics</I>, September 14. 
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Welfare Reform: Hate That, Too</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the
bill is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under
the new bill a 60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy
families will end. It's been estimated as many as a million
children will go hungry. What are you going to do about that?" <DD>--
Barbara Walters to Bill Clinton, September 20 <I>20/20</I>.
<P>
"In light of the new welfare reform bill, do you think the
children need more prayers than ever before?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to
Children's Defense Fund leader Marian Wright Edelman, September
23 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Rapping the Republicans on Rape</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"I think, generally speaking, most people would agree that the
partisan, that the smear tactics -- I mean, the going after the
family, and since when has President Clinton said anything about
Elizabeth Dole? It hasn't happened, and yet you see the
Republicans attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, who I agree has
made mistakes, but they [Republicans] have no boundaries, and I
think that yes, both parties are guilty of using smear tactics --
it goes back to as I said the origin of American politics -- but
I think the Republicans are quite frankly, better at it than the
Democrats, and I think most people see that and believe
that....Why don't you recognize some of the hypocrisy on the part
of the Republicans?....Well, for starters, a rape victim up on
the podium in San Diego when the Republicans oppose abortion." <DD>--PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe responding to conservative
criticism on Westwood One's <I>Jim Bohannon Show</I>, August 30.
<P>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>I Thought White People Were the Paranoid Anti-Government Wackos</CENTER></H3>

"As Dick [Gregory] was saying, a conspiratorial thing, something
that is genocidal that many African-Americans whisper and talk
about that, or was it simply an economic situation that they
thought this was a quick way to make money to send to the
Contras?" <DD>-- MSNBC <I>InterNight</I> host Ed Gordon to activist Joe
Madison on the San Jose Mercury News report that the CIA sold
crack to fund the Contras, September 19.
<P>
"[CIA Director John] Deutch reiterated last week that he has
asked the agency's inspector general to review the Mercury's
charges. The Justice Department has also launched a probe. But if
Deutch thinks anyone in black America is going to take the wordof those two organizations, he's mistaken. Black Americans have
been the targets of so much hostility that many of them would not
put it past their own government to finance the war against
communism by addicting thousands of people."

"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his
campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement: `Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with
Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in reinvigorating his Republican base. But
a top Clinton campaign official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him thanks for
me.'"<DD>-- NBC's David Bloom, September 14 <I>Nightly News</I>.

"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd
[at the NAACP convention]. That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak
at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning
and the All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an
insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial
divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential
campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<DD>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 <I>Nightly

"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman? Probably so. From Primary Colors
to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in the World. Bill Clinton has
suffered when judged on the age-old standard of masculinity: military service. But female
observers, from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a catty ferocity they
would not apply to men. A man with a prim exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter
could testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a woman is an emasculating

be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private, intensely competitive Al Gore has managed
the contortionist's feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's re-election
without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both brainy, moderate Southerners with an
abiding interest in the plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each other like
competitive brothers."<DD>-- <I>Time</I> Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss does, tonight he is next door in
the Old Executive Office Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity theory,
open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific metaphors in modern society. He's writing a
speech, and the elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet Coke

"On paper it shouldn't hurt him [Clinton]. This is about one goofy guy. We don't even know if
the story is true. The picture that I saw in the New York Post looks very much like it was

<P>
"Here in Chicago, the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the speech he will be giving
to this convention and to the country tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very
upbeat convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll numbers to accompany it.
And a very important set of statistics about the economy today, which he will certainly point to
as evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along comes a nasty little scandal to
take the edge off the good news, at least for one day." <dd>--Peter Jennings opening the August 29

"Nancy pushed Ronnie into an arms treaty with the Russians because she wanted him to win a Nobel
Prize. So maybe astrology was healthier than whatever the rest of the nuke-Managua globo-cops
were smoking in the Reagan White House. That Hillary should talk to Eleanor Roosevelt bothers
some of us less than the fact that her husband obviously doesn't....Isn't it amazing that women
have invented or designed or discovered the prototype computer, nitrate fertilizer, penicillin,
integral calculus, food refrigeration, space helmets, atomic parity, automatic flight control,
pulsars and even DNA, not to mention square-bottomed bags, ice cream cones, vacuum canning and
the gardenia. And yet we're still afraid of what they'll whisper into the ears of their powerful
husbands. Might we at least concede that the people we'll marry say more about us than the
people we select for the second place on the ticket of our glory-hounding selves; nobody elects
vice presidents, either. Our pathological fear of Hillary and any other uppity woman, whatever

"Did anyone else find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette, Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms...As Jesse Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a conservative Republican." <dd>-- <I>Time</I> National Correspondent Jack E.

"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the needs and cares of the people.

<P>
"But the Democratic Party for sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that.

"If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real shills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next two years?" <DD>Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala during <I>PBS-NBC Democratic convention coverage</I>, August 26.

"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet, late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other welfare experts are saying is going to throw a million children into poverty. Does that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked for over the years?....Eleaonr Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?"<DD>--Questions from CNN's Judy Woodruff to Hillary Clinton, August 26 <I>Inside Politics</I>.

"Any time the Doles play the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was 17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and staying married gets you an inquisition." <dd>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson, September 2 issue.

"Women have not responded well to a message that at times has been considered too harsh, too

<P>
"The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this
fight within the Republican Party has many women questioning how far this party will go to limit
their rights." <DD>-- ABC's Peter Jennings on the Republican convention, August 13 <i> World News

<P>
"There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say.
Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it, or quite
the contrary?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, August 14
<i>Today</i>.
<P>
"You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive party, one that can
embrace the views of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out vis-a-vis
abortion, and the fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking because they
felt as if they were being censored, do you still believe you can call the Republican Party an
inclusive party?" <dd>-- One of seven abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 <i>Today</I>.

Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We
can expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."--<dd> <i>Today</i> co-host Bryant Gumbel.

"It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily designed for a broadcast image of
tolerance and diversity that's starkly at odds with reality." <dd>--ABC's Jim Wooten on Powell,
August 13 <i>World News Tonight</i>.
<P>
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that they don't think
this ticket, or perhaps this party, is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"

conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton." <dd>-- <i>Time</i>
contributor George J. Church, August 19.
<P>
"If he signs the measure as it is, President Clinton will appear to have fulfilled his famous
pledge about ending welfare. In truth, he will have abandoned the vision that animated the
slogan. Having sought office with the aim of a redefined social contract -- health care for
every American -- he will be seeking re-election with a bill that begrudges poor infants their

<H3>Chaplain-in-Chief?</H3>

"Mr. Clinton is clearly more and more comfortable now in the role these  
times have forced on our Presidents -- first mourner and  
chaplain-in-chief. But his moments with the families must have struck  
him as especially
poignant today, for when he left them in the hotel and entered his car,  
he buried his head on Mrs. Clinton's shoulder."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim  
Wooten on the TWA crash aftermath, July 25 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>Republicans Have Zero Tolerance?</H3>

"We begin tonight with what you could call zero tolerance....Today by  
the time Mr. Dole spoke by satellite to his party delegates, who were 20
already gathered in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject  
of abortion had disappeared from the party's platform." <BR>
<DD>-- Peter  Jennings, August 6 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
"The Republican Party platform committee has forced abortion rights  
advocates to walk the plank, the abortion plank. The committee handed  
Robert Dole a defeat, by turning down language endorsing tolerance 20
of abortion rights supporters."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas, August 6  
<I>Good Morning America</I>.
<P>
<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and  
sometimes differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source  
of strength."<BR>

<P>
<H3>On Top of the Big Stories</H3>

"Quite honestly, I haven't looked at whatever tolerance language they  
allegedly have in their platform." <BR>
<DD> -- Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman  
when asked by a caller about the Democrats' platform abortion language
on CNBC's <I>Politics</I>, August 6.
<P>
<H3>Wrestling Reaganomics to the Ground 20</H3>

"The old joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a  
ditch gets out of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there  
are a fair amount of assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan  
that are really, I think, under intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." <BR>
<DD>--U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer immediately after  
Dole's tax cut address on <I>CNN</I>, August 5.
<P>
"Americans might remember that the last time we tried to grow our way  
out of the deficit that the tax cut happened, the growth didn't happen,  
and the deficit was huge at the end of it. How are they going to explain  
this new version of supply-side?"<BR>
<DD> -- PBS<I> Washington Week in Review</I> host Ken Bode, July 26.
<P>
"Now [Dole]'s embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career -- so late in the campaign  
-- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that
the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a  
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."  
<BR>
<DD>-- <I>Newsweek </I>reporter Howard Fineman, August 12. 
<P>

<H3>Tom Brokaw: Hillary Still the Victim of Sexism</H3>
<P>
"Some of it, obviously, has to do with legal questions, as well,  
obviously. She's had to testify before a grand jury, but all that aside,  
and those are serious issues, do you think that this country is not as  
far along as we'd like to believe when it comes to dealing with gender  
equality?"<BR>

on MSNBC's<I> InterNight</I>, July 25.

<H3>Linda Douglass Shakes Her Pom-Poms</H3>

"The President again has had sort of an amazing week. The Democratic  
Party, which used to function like a herd of cats, has now very tamely  
crafted a very centrist Democratic platform that emphasizes crime 20
fighting. It talks about stemming the tide of violence on TV that is  
influencing our children, talks about school uniforms, talks about the  
death penalty, talks about tolerance for people who oppose abortion, for  
example. So, the President who was being abandoned by 20
his party just two years ago now has managed to oversee a party that has  
crafted this platform very much in his centrist image. Even though the  
background noise of what is loosely being called Whitewater continues, 20
none of it seems to stick to the President."<BR>
<DD> -- CBS reporter Linda Douglass, July 14 <I>Sunday Morning</I>.

<H3>We Lied: We Really Hate New Democrats</H3>

Sam Donaldson: "Congress had suddenly realized there's an election  
coming up, so all right, they're going to pass a bunch of legislation--"
Cokie Roberts: "Concentrates the mind."
Donaldson: "Like hanging, and in Congress's case, in my view of what  
they did, perhaps hanging would have been better. Because the welfare  
bill, we're going to regret as a country. It's not just anyone in  
poverty, it's the children. Throwing women and the children off the  
rolls. Everyone's for workfare, everyone's for changing the welfare system. Bill Clinton promised it. He said, however,  it would take $10 billion more to ease people down the ramp off this train. Instead, we just throw 'em off now and said [sic] `Good luck'!"  
<BR>
<DD>-- Exchange on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I>,  
August 4.
<P>
"[Clinton] knows that he is consigning helpless people to terrible  
hardship, and some to premature burials. He called the press conference  
to announce that he will sign the bill anyway....
Mr. Shumyatsky is in the U.S. legally, but is not a citizen. Thus his  
SSI checks will cease when the welfare bill becomes law. He will have no  
money at all. Perhaps he will set up light housekeeping in a park. Maybe  
he'll curl up on a grate. Maybe he'll do the
politicians a favor and just die."<BR>
<DD> -- Former NBC News reporter Bob  
Herbert in his <I>New York Times</I> column, August 2.
<P>
"Secretary, you find yourself now in the position of being praised by  
Newt Gingrich, at the same time that Senator Pat Moynihan calls this the  
most brutal piece of social policy since the Reconstruction. Doesn't  
that make you the slightest bit nervous?
"...You know far better than I do that you are rewriting the social  
policy of this country that has stood for the last 61 years, albeit with  
a lot of problems. Do you worry at all about the consequences? Do you  
worry at all that with a change this enormous,
people are going to get hurt?"<BR>
<DD> -- Two of substitute host Chris Wallace's  
six liberal questions to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, July 31 <I>Nightline</I>.
<P>
"The new landmark welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign  
won't be law for a while yet, but there is already a great deal of fear  
and anxiety all over the country about the impact it will have."<BR>
 <DD>-- <I>CBS Evening News</I> substitute anchor Paula Zahn, August 1.
<P>

<H3>Speaking of Formulaic Hagiography of S&L Cheats...
</H3>
"And don't labor to make heroes of the nonheroic. Air-brushing swimmer  
Gary Hall Jr., the spoiled grandson of savings and loan cheat Charles  
Keating Jr., by not mentioning that he was a major goof-off, 
blowing up mailboxes and tearing up golf courses, is formulaic  
hagiography." <BR>
<DD>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson complaining NBC's  
Olympic coverage was featuring too many personal stories, August 5. 
<P>
"Friends of Hillary Clinton would have you believe she's an amalgam of  
Betty Crocker, Mother Teresa, and Oliver Wendell Holmes...The former  
Hillary Rodham grew up in Park Ridge, a Chicago suburb, where her father  
owned a textile company. She earned every Girl 
Scout badge, pulled a wagonful of sports equipment to her job at the  
park every summer, was elected president of her high school class and  
earned so many honors that her parents recall `being slightly  
uncomfortable at her graduation.' She organized circuses and amateur  
sports tournaments to raise money for migrant workers."<BR>

<H3>Donaldson's Dole Strategy: Go Left</H3>

"I want the Bob Dole who saved affirmative action in the Nixon  
administration. I want the Bob Dole whose civil rights record is  
excellent when it comes to his voting record in the Senate. I want the  
Bob Dole who is moderate, who wants the big tent idea, who doesn't want  
to punish all those people who don't believe abortion is like a certain  
wing of his party does [sic]. And I want the Bob Dole who wants to  
balance the federal budget rather than give huge tax cuts in a  
pie-in-the-sky, let's follow this supply side mumbo-jumbo. But that Bob  
Dole can't seem to get out. And if it doesn't get out, I would agree,

<H3>MSNBC: Not Much of an Alternative</H3>

"I was just looking at draft platforms, Republican platforms, from South  
Carolina, Kansas, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Michigan, Kentucky, Texas, and  
Mississippi, and all of them are uncompromising, all of them written by  
the religious right, all of them uncompromising on this [abortion] and  
other issues. Are you really comfortable in a party where there are a  
lot of theological imperatives being imposed upon a political platform?"  
<P>

"If Republicans are the party of opportunity for most Americans, the  
fact of the matter is that you Republicans have occupied the White House  
for 20 out of the last 24 years and the economic inequalities in this  
country have grown. There seems to be a failure of correspondence

<DD> -- Questions from Bill Moyers to Steve Forbes on MSNBC's  
<I>InterNight</I>, July 19.
<P>
"But if that platform in San Diego contains the very strong  
anti-abortion plank that it presently contains, aren't women still going

<H3>Keep Moms on Welfare: That'll Help the Kids a Lot</H3>

"Mr. President, before we get back to the Internet questions, I wanted  
to follow up just for a moment on welfare if I can. If in fact you sign  
the Republican bill that's likely to come down from the Hill, all the  
projections show that that will push, at least short term, more than a  
million youngsters in this country below the poverty line. That's a high  
risk for youngsters in this country who are already in peril." <BR>
<DD>-- Tom Brokaw to President Bill Clinton, July 15 <I>InterNight </I>on MSNBC.
<P>
"There is something very creepy about the welfare debate....The  
politicians have gotten together and decided it's a good idea to throw a  
million or so children into poverty. But they can't say that. The  
proponents of this so-called `reform' effort have gone out of their way  
to avoid being seen for what they are -- men and women of extreme  
privilege who are taking food out of the mouths of infants and children,  
the poverty-stricken elderly, the disabled....Old women, small children,  
the disabled. A country that would single out such individuals for  
deliberate harm falls somewhere well short of greatness."<BR>
 -- <DD>Former <I>NBC News </I>reporter Bob Herbert in his <I>New York Times </I>column, July 22.
<P>
<H3>The More You Know, the More You Believe in Nothing</H3>

"One reason the disaffection of moderate women has looked like such a  
sore thumb this summer, experts say, is that the moderates make up a  
disproportionate share of the party's highly visible elite. Many were  
activists who built the party before forces on the right took it over in  
the 1980s. Most are better educated than average Republicans, and higher  
levels of education tend to go hand in hand with more flexible stances  
on issues like abortion."<BR>
<DD> -- New York Times reporter Michael Wines, July 21<I> Week in Review</I> section.
<P>
<H3>The Religious Right Ruins Another Country</H3>

"Bar-Ilan Street has become a symbol of the religious right's power in  
the new government of Prime Minister Netanyahu....Added to the fears  
that the ultra-religious minority will be freer under the Netanyahu  
government to try to impose its views on the majority of Israelis are  
the fears of the Palestinians. They see the struggle for Bar-Ilan Street  
in a wider context. They fear the religious right will doom any  
meaningful negotiations over the future of Jerusalem."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Bob Jamieson on protests by Orthodox Jews over a major Jerusalem road not being closed for the Sabbath, July 13 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>We Should All Be Paid the Same</H3>

"Governor, a recent study of household income by the Census Bureau  
confirms that there has been, the gap between rich and poor in America  
is wider than it has ever been and it is continuing to grow. You are a  
great believer in the benefit of the free market economy, but doesn't  
something have to be done to change this picture? And what specific  
steps would you take as Senator to make sure the nation's poor and  
wealthy are more equitable?" <BR>
<DD>-- Question from <I>Boston Globe</I> reporter  
Adrian Walker to Republican Senate candidate Bill Weld during the July 2  
Senate debate in Massachusetts with Senator John Kerry (D).
<P>
<H3>Gun Control Would Really Stop Violence: Look at D.C.</H3>

"The first requirement for being nice is to refrain from killing  
someone, and there we have a problem. But isn't it possible that  
Americans murder each other at much higher rates than most other  
nationalities not because we are meaner but because we make it easier,  
through lax gun control?" <BR>
<DD>--<I> Newsweek</I> Senior Editor Jonathan Alter in a  
July 15 issue story on how the U.S. "is not as mean as people think."

<H3>Far-Right Supreme Court</H3>

Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal: "Linda, you say this has been the  
Rehnquist Court, but what effect have the Clinton appointees had on the  
Court's decisions? How have they pushed the Court?"
New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "Well, I'm not  
sure they've pushed the Court, in so far as there's any, quote,  
`liberal' outcomes at the Court these days, it's kind of a holding  
action. These two, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, are liberals  
within the current spectrum of the Court, but it's important to realize  
how far to the right the spectrum has shifted in the last couple of  
years."<BR>

<H3>No Truth in Talk Radio</H3>

"Let me talk about something that has always troubled me everytime I  
listen to talk radio as I travel. Democratic or Republican talker, it  
doesn't seem to matter, there just doesn't seem to be a standard of  
truth. I mean, it's like you're not really news media. You're media, but  
not news."<BR>

<P>
<H3>Oh Sure, Reporters Wanted to Vote for a Republican...</H3>

Margaret Carlson, Time: "This study is bandied about so much it should  
just be kind of stamped on your forehead, John. It is stamped on your  
forehead, I can read it there. The two candidates, remember, Bill  
Clinton was a New Democrat. George Bush now looks like the most moderate  
of Republicans. It wasn't even a liberal-conservative thing."
John Sununu: "And he still couldn't get more than seven percent of your  
vote!"<BR>
Carlson: "Well, I mean look at the two candidates. It could have been  
your candidate, John, and not a liberal bias. Bill Clinton was a better  
candidate. Someone suggested to me `What if the candidate had been Jesse  
Jackson and George Bush?' George Bush would've probably won. What if it  
were Jesse Jackson and Christie Whitman? William Weld? A Republican  
would win. A Republican would win!"<BR>
<DD> -- July 3 exchange on CNN's  
Crossfire about Freedom Forum poll showing 89 percent of Washington  
reporters voted for Clinton.

"Dole had been invited speak to the [NAACP] convention yesterday, but  
declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the  
All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention, this was quite a  
stretch and an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up  
here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and  
fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential  
campaign, Bob Dole might not be up to the challenge." <BR>

<H3>Margaret's Gossip Hypocrisy</H3>

"The press has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for  
the truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it. No one was  
surprised when The New York Post and The Washington Times reported wild  
allegations from a slapped-together and unsubstantiated book about the  
Clintons. But when a formerly immune host such as ABC's David Brinkley  
succumbed to the infection and gave airtime to the screed's author,  
retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich, the sickness had reached epidemic  
proportions."<BR>

"Some of the allegations, however, are anonymous. Others are conclusions

somebody in a court of law. I am certain there are people that'll look

Elizabeth Taylor, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Now she's out with her  
most difficult and explosive book yet. Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized  
Biography goes on sale this morning, and already people are running for  
cover, issuing denials from around the nation. Kitty, good morning...How

social climber who lied and faked her way through life. Is that the  
picture you set out to create?...You won't deny that's what emerges?" <BR>

<P>
"Leon Panetta's explanation is plausible to me only because back
then, in 1993, there was mistake after mistake like this. And the
reasons usually were incompetence rather than venality."
<DD> -- NPR White House reporter Mara Liasson discussing Filegate on
CNN's Late Edition, June 9.
<P>
"They are the White House and there was a legitimate reason for them
to try to get their files in order. They made a mistake, or this guy
who was a military attache whose job it was to try to put this in
order made a mistake. When it was found out that he made a mistake,
apologies were made."
<DD> -- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang,
June 9.
<P>
"I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt right now...I
really believe this was a case of general incompetence....Does this
matter? I guess the real question is, beyond an opportunity for the
Republicans to have hearings and to sort of drag out a Whitewater-
type escapade once again, does this really matter?"
<DD> -- Los Angeles Times Washington reporter Sam Fulwood, June 15 Inside
Washington.
<P>
"I think this is one especially that's going to backfire. There were
not files turned over; there were summary reports of background
checks. These were not files of top Republican operatives, the way
the stories first suggested, but alphabetical lists of people who had
access to the White House. If they look at what actually happened,
they'll find out there's nothing there."
<DD> -- New York Daily News columnist (and former Washington Bureau
Chief) Lars-Erik Nelson in The Hill newspaper, June 19.
<P>
"Hate radio and innuendo is going to put Mrs. Clinton at the center
of this, and for a party like the Republican Party that has this huge
gender gap, targeting the First Lady on every one of these issues is
not going to be effective politics."
<DD> -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on the June 22 McLaughlin Group,
reacting to the charge that Hillary Clinton protected Craig
Livingstone.
<p>
"The administration has adopted an it-was-an-innocent-
blunder defense on Filegate, and it makes sense: This White House
inspires a presumption of incompetence."

July 1 issue.

<CENTER><H3>Filegate? How Dare Republicans Mention It</H3></CENTER>

"The politics of Campaign '96 are getting very ugly, very early.
Today Bob Dole accused the White House of using the FBI to wage war
against its political enemies, and if that sounds like another
political scandal, that's the point."
<DD> -- NBC anchor Brian Williams on the FBI files, June 8 Nightly News.
<P>
"For a year and a half, the Republican-controlled Congress has been
bent on holding one hearing after another, investigating the Clinton
White House. This provides them fodder for yet another."

Evening News.

<CENTER><H3>Wiping Away the Whitewater Report</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"These two dueling reports, the Democrats are real hear no evil, see

to McCarthyism. They raise the idea of suspicious circumstances, to
almost just an assumption of guilt."

<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Hillary's Psychic Friends Network, Media Division</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Inevitably, Hillary's solarium seances will be mockingly compared to
Nancy Reagan's astrology...Still, the joking is bound to exaggerate
the depths of the First Lady's psychic revelation. As [book author
Bob] Woodward's account makes clear, Mrs. Clinton was only imagining
what it would be like to talk with Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi, not
literally trying to `channel' the spirits of the dead. A long-time
searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. Clinton had conjured
conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt before she met Dr. Houston. Mrs.
Clinton is not even the first First Lady to dabble with psychics or
mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant,
John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding all tried, in one
way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike Nancy Reagan,
Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her
husband.... "And to many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed
conspirator but a martyr. Last week, 1,200 professional women
clambered into a $250,000 fundraiser for the Democratic Party in
Boston to see Hillary speak. Women teetered on high heels standing on
precarious plastic folding chairs to catch a glimpse of the First
Lady as she worked the crowd. Is there anything to Whitewater?
`Noooo, she's just being bashed by the press,' said Joan McGrath, a
retired telephone worker. Why? `A lot of people don't like a strong
woman.' To voters like McGrath, Hillary looks just the way she does
to her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure,
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<DD> -- Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, July 1 issue.
<P>
"Such role-playing conversations are traditional counseling
techniques, and Ms. Houston describes Mrs. Clinton as beleaguered, in
pain, and seeking help...The unwritten subtext here, of course, is
that even here at the end of the 20th century there is a political
price to be paid for those in public life who seek help for their
private problems."
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim Wooten, June 24 World News Tonight.
<P>
"Though somewhat of an embarrassment, some believe this psychic cloud
may have a silver lining. It could soften Hillary Rodham Clinton's
image as a behind-the-scenes power player by revealing a
vulnerability few ever see."
<DD> -- CNN reporter Kathleen Koch concluding a June 23 The World Today
story.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Two Roberts Family Tributes to Clinton</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"That's what the Republicans did when they had the White House. They
misused the FBI. The same way the Democrats to some extent misused
the power on the Hill when they had it when they investigated all of
those Reagan appointees and it was the Republicans who were screaming
`No guilt by association! No guilt by association!' Now the
Republicans are misusing their power. That report this week,
Whitewater report, was so filled with `might have beens' and `could
have beens' and `should have beens.' They weren't able to connect the
dots except with these long loops. But that's what you do when you
have the control of these institutions. Both sides do it and both
sides do it. Both sides do it!"
<DD> -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on the Fox
Morning News, June 20.
<P>
"This has been a very clever thing that the Clinton campaign has done
on everything from '92, which is to say A, it's old news, and B, it's
politically motivated. And to be very aggressive -- and you've got to
give them credit -- to be very aggressive in going after the people
who are reporting it or the people who are leaking it, so there's a
backing off."
<DD> -- ABC's Cokie Roberts on Whitewater, June 18 Charlie Rose on PBS.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Scorching Talk Radio</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Why are there so many church burnings in South Carolina? Some people

radio, or the insecurity over jobs. But many people say it's the

<CENTER><H3>Living in Hillary's Parallel Universe</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Most reporters who covered Bill Clinton were of his generation,
identified with him, had a lot of the same experiences, were about
his age, and they were harder on him. It's the coach's son. You're
just so worried that you're going to give him favorable treatment
that it goes the other way."

Joan Lunden: "But it seems like there's more money being spent for the  
environment, or for the gun lobby, there are a lot of different groups  
together, not always in agreement. The federal government's talking  
about turning over a lot of the social programs to the states. What kind  
of programs, what do you think is the best way to approach this?"
Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund and  
organizer of the Stand for Children march: "Well the first thing is  
we've got to make a commitment and that's why...<BR>
Lunden, simultaneously: "Yeah, yeah."<BR>
Edelman: "...I've never seen 3500 groups come together across race and

net. We will not permit it...."<BR>

<P>
"There was a `Stand for Children' march in Washington today, joining  
people from all over the country who care about kids. But politically  
inspired right-wingers have assailed this gathering as a radical group,  
intent on expanding the role of government. In fact, the group includes  
the Girl Scouts, the American Academy of Pediatricians, and the Junior  
League. Only the self-centered, loony right wing would consider groups

"At his final campaign appearance tonight, Prime Minister Shimon Peres  
was every inch the elder statesman, 72 years of experience. `Trust me.'  
That's his message to Israelis. While across town today, his 46-year-old  
opponent, young and handsome, has American politician written all over  
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has  
advised conservatives like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The

negative theme: Fear."<BR>

"Right-wing hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu is declared Israel's new Prime  
Minister."<BR>
<DD> -- Dan Rather, May 31<I> CBS Evening News</I>.

"What we were all talking about yesterday was whether terrorism wins. We  
had a situation where the peace process seemed to be going along well in  
Israel. Then an assassin kills Prime Minister Rabin. Then there are bus  
bombings, well publicized, many, many people dead in Israel. And there  
is so much talk of fear in the election, and the candidate talking the  
most about it, Benjamin Netanyahu, gets elected. The question is, does  
terrorism work?"<BR>
<P> -- <I>Good Morning America</I> co-host Charlie Gibson to "The  
God Squad" (Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman), May 31.
<P>
"Let's talk about his words for a second. Because it's not that many  
months ago that a lot of people were accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning  
the flames of the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical tone for  
Rabin's assassination."<BR>

News consultant Fouad Ajami, May 31. 20
<P>
<H3>That Old Cliche: Bias Is in the Copy of the Anchor</H3>

"You know the old cliche that we've all used over the years is that  
bias, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and we're out there on  
the cutting edge of change on a daily basis. That's what news is all  
about. That's the essence of news....The people, by and large, who are  
the recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most  
part. They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they  
don't want to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame  
someone in some regard and they think therefore since we brought them  
the news of the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change  
or biased in favor of what it is that we're reporting....I think the  
fact that we're still standing, this day, 35 years after we...entered  
this business, is some, immodestly, some small tribute the fact that  
we've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."<BR>
<DD> -- Tom Brokaw at the National Press Club, June 11.
<P>
<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"Today, GOP congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and  
given a battle plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it  
is long on promises and short on sound premises."<BR>

<P>
"When NBC Nightly News continues: in Washington, if they cut food  
stamps, who doesn't eat?"<BR>
<DD> -- Brokaw, March 22, 1995.

<H3>If Only We Had Made Government Even Bigger</H3>

"Tim, curious. Would we still be having this discussion if everyone  
hadn't attacked the President's health care reform plan for political  
expediency about two years ago?" <BR>
<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to Tim Russert on a  
report showing Medicare will go broke a year earlier than expected, June  
5 Today.

<H3>Tacking Against Tax Cuts</H3>

"Often, his [Dole's] condemnation of supply-side tax cuts has reflected  
the austerity of his Dust Bowl origins. Dole dutifully helped steer  
President Reagan's tax cuts through Congress in 1981, but he spent the  
next several years trying to dam up the river of federal red ink that  
was largely created by that deal."<BR>
<DD> -- May 28<I> Washington Post</I> news story  
by Clay Chandler.
<P>
"Ross Perot has said that, repeatedly, that giving a tax cut now is like  
giving candy to the electorate right before the election. Senator, you  
were in the Senate, and Mr. Forbes, you were watching it very closely  
when Ronald Reagan was President for eight years. Cut taxes, 25 percent.  
The deficit, with a Democratic Congress I should add, went from 60  
billion dollars when he took office to 200 billion dollars when he left  
office. So we can cut taxes, but it seems to drive up the deficit as  
well."<BR>
<DD> -- Tim Russert to Steve Forbes and Senator Bill Bradley, May 26  
<I>Meet the Press.</I> Fiscal year 1989 deficit: $152.5 billion.
<P>
<H3>Cue The Battle Hymn of the Republic...</H3>

"How can anyone argue that Bill Clinton has not been a good President?  
Business should love him. The country has been in a controlled boom  
since he bludgeoned through by one vote his first economic  
package....Workers should love him. There are more jobs than  
ever....Minorities should love him. He has a terrific record of  
appointing women and minorities to judgeships and high federal posts. He  
has put civil rights back on the table after 12 years of Republican  
neglect....
"No, it makes you wonder what the President and his wife could have  
accomplished these four years if they had not been consumed by these  
scandals, these lawsuits and these clippings. By almost any measure, the  
past four years have been spectacular for many Americans. Still, if Bill  
Clinton had been a full-time President, if Hillary Clinton had been a  
full-time First Lady...
"Would the poor be a little richer? Would the old be a little healthier?  
Would the young be a little smarter? Would the nation be a little more  
prosperous? Would the world be a little less troubled? You wonder. And  
you wonder if he wonders."<BR>
<DD> -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner,  
June 11 USA Today.

<FONT SIZE=2>Wishing Away Whitewater<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of
fading away, it's kind of a shadowy thing now, it's going away.&quot;
-- PBS Washington Week in Review&lt;M&gt; moderator Ken Bode on
May 24, four days before the convictions of Clinton's business
partners.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;After all the right wing's huffing and puffing,
the Whitewater `scandal' is dying out in wisps of smoke. President
Clinton's main accuser, David Hale, is currently tangled up in
his own lies at a Whitewater trial in Little Rock. Hale has had
two years in the witness protection program to practice his story,
and it didn't survive two days of cross-examination.&quot; --
Former New York Daily News Washington Bureau Chief Lars-Erik Nelson
in an April 11 Los Angeles Times op-ed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Anybody, it seems to me, who gives a fair reading,
Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three
years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton.
The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over
again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one
example, and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate
and should be there.&quot; -- U.S. News Senior Writer Steven Roberts
on C-SPAN's Washington Journal, May 17. (13 stories on ABC, CBS,
&amp; NBC, Feb. 29-May 20.)<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Welfare -- $53 billion instead of the $100
billion in last year's Republican budget. Medicaid -- $72 billion
instead of last year's Republican figure of $182 billion. And
Medicare -- $158 billion instead of the $270 billion Republicans
wanted to save last year. A major goal of Republicans in this
election year will be to repeat over and over that they are not
cutting funds from Medicare. Republicans would increase Medicare
spending but at a slower rate then President Clinton wants, so
it infuriates Republicans when the President says they're cutting
Medicare.&quot; -- ABC reporter John Cochran on the GOP budget
proposal, May 8 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>vs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The GOP proposal would balance the budget in
six years by cutting Medicare by $158 billion, Medicaid by $72
billion, and welfare by $53 billion. Republicans also are proposing
$122 billion in tax cuts, targeted to a $500 per child tax credit.
These cuts are less severe than those proposed by Republicans
in their budget last year....And moderate Republicans believe
they have abandoned the drastic budget and tax cuts of last year's
budget that contributed to two government shutdowns.&quot; --

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Reagan was an exceedingly likeable guy, just
a heck of a nice fellow, despite his politics. He was funny and
loved a good joke, the dirtier, I'm afraid the more ethnic, the

except charisma and success.&quot; -- Walter Cronkite on Cronkite

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Moderates&quot; for Carter, Mondale, Dukakis
and Clinton<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think what you have now in the mainstream
media is a bias against power almost. It's a sense of anti-incumbency
that we in the media always zero in on people who have power and
try to hold them up to scrutiny and I think many times we focus
on only the negative and I think that's what the politicians object
to. In a book I've just written about the presidency and the press
I talk about this. And I do criticize the media for being too
cynical in dealing with politics and public life but I don't think
it's so much a liberal bias I think it's more just an engine of
anti-incumbency....I did a survey of the White House press corps.
And I found that the overwhelming number of reporters in that
press corps identify themselves as moderates.&quot; -- Kenneth
Walsh, U.S. News &amp; World Report White House reporter, on the
May 10 Fox Morning News.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton,
two for George Bush, and one for independent Ross Perot....In
1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael Dukakis, only one for
Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In
1984, ten voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting
for Ronald Reagan, and four said they had not voted for a presidential
candidate. In 1980, eight voted for Democratic incumbent Jimmy
Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven
voted for Carter and two for Republican incumbent Gerald Ford.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Dole has certainly shown understanding for
the handicapped, sponsoring legislation like 1990's Americans
with Disabilities Act....But how far does Dole's empathy extend?
He's helped the disabled but fought family and medical leave that
would guarantee employees the right to care for a disabled loved
one. He's been soft on the workplace and highway safety regulations
and gun-control measures that would prevent many disabling accidents.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like many people here in Stark County [Ohio],
a strong political bellwether for national politics, Mrs. [Judith]
Snow has been shaken enough by the Republican-led Congress to
move to President Clinton for now. In her case, it was Congress's
effort to scale back Medicare benefits. Three-quarters of all
voters questioned here in a new poll think that cutting Medicare
was wrong, including nearly two-thirds of all Republicans.&quot;

section.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;...at least the Republicans have made an effort
to position front and center this per child tax credit...as the
centerpiece of their tax proposals to kind of moderate the rhetoric
of last year which suggested that they wanted a huge tax cut for
the rich which was going to be used, paid for by big cuts on Medicare
and Medicaid in particular.&quot; -- U.S. News &amp; World Report

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The savagery is actually a throwback to an

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Just as the U.S. economy looked like it might

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The country, it now appears, may be pulling
out of the recession. If so, it is doing so very slowly. The Commerce
Department says the economy grew in the first quarter of this
year at an annual rate of two percent. That's the strongest growth
in three years, but private economists say it is hardly enough
to create many jobs.&quot; -- Rather on the April 28, 1992 CBS

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You Mean the Camera Was On When I Admitted

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There is a liberal bias. It's demonstrable.
You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long
time. There is a, particularly at the networks, at the lower levels,
among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine
I work for -- most of the people who work at Newsweek live on
the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias....[ABC
White House reporter] Brit Hume's bosses are liberal and they're
always quietly denouncing him as being a right-wing nut.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw: &quot;I think Gorbachev
is a great man in the 20th century because he forced his country
to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of communism and
to begin slowly to make a turn away from it....He can still light
up any room that he walks into. The eyes are flashy, you know,
and the great command of the language and the feel that he has,
the very physical presence of him. It's still fun to be around
him.&quot; -- From the PBS talk show Charlie Rose, May 2.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Charlie Rose: &quot;A great man?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Brokaw: &quot;I think that history will have to be
the judge of that. I think that he was the right man at the time.
I think the country was adrift and he came along with his simple,
in the best sense of the word, philosophy about what was required
to get the country back on track, to kind of give the country
a sense of itself again. You can look at the economics of Reaganism,
for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy and
look at Iran-Contra and find all manner of flaws in there. But
what he did was give this sense that this is a great nation and
we're a great people and that we've got to get on with being that
once again. So I don't think he'll be a complicated Roosevelt-like
figure.&quot; -- Exchange later on the same show.<BR>

direction, and everybody seems to be already writing the stories

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think that there is cause for paying attention,

we can't afford another round of voodoo economics....I remember
that campaign slogan one year `It's morning again in America.'

<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton is much craftier than George Bush in
avoiding the kind of `Read My Lips' vow that allows no maneuvering
room. He can rewrite his promises to adjust to reality. That opens
him up to `Slick Willie' catcalls. It also leaves him the option
to do the right thing.&quot; -- Clift in February 8, 1993 Newsweek
story.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton's giving the best evidence yet of his
approach to leadership. It's about understanding, not threats;
accommodation, not confrontation; about getting people (or at
least Democrats) to sing the same song. The style is reminiscent
of another patient, nonjudgmental figure given to hugging in public:
Barney the Dinosaur.&quot; -- Clift in August 9, 1993 Newsweek

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The public might even be tickled to learn that
the prim and preachy First Lady has a gambler's streak. Hillary's

<FONT SIZE=2>The Sinister Gas Price Conspiracy...<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Good evening. It's the question every American
driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price
of gasoline going up and up and up. Is it the free market at work,
the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even
something more sinister?&quot; -- Dan Rather, April 30.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>...But If Clinton Raises Beef Prices, It's Helpful
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;President Clinton is giving some election-year
help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action
today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their
lowest level in ten years.&quot; -- Rather, same show, same night.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;A CBS News exclusive. The hush-hush plan afoot
in Congress that could make your milk prices soar....CBS News
has been told that a secret deal is making its way through Congress
that would increase the additives in your milk and increase the
retail price of milk about 40 cents a gallon.&quot; -- Rather
on dairy-state Republicans' plans to help dairy farmers, February
2 Evening News.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Let's Raise the Minimum Wage to Cover Higher Beef
Prices<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;They need to raise the minimum wage and I don't
think the argument that some low-income people will be put out
of work will wash. I think it's long overdue.&quot; -- Los Angeles
Times senior correspondent and former Washington Bureau Chief
Jack Nelson in the weekly Washington newspaper The Hill, April
3.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Yes, it is time to increase the minimum wage....considering
the plight of the working poor, and the annual increase in the
cost of living, a minimum of five dollars an hour or so is hardly
outlandish.&quot; -- Time contributor and former Deputy Washington
Bureau Chief Laurence Barrett, same issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is a moral issue. I wouldn't pay anybody
less than five dollars and twenty-five cents an hour or fifteen
cents an hour to do anything.&quot; -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg,
April 27 Inside Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You know President Clinton said, I think it
was in the State of the Union, Alan [Murray], that the average
Congressman, in Washington, made more money during the period
of time that the government was shut down than a minimum wage
worker makes in a year. Now that's a pretty compelling political
case to make.&quot; -- PBS Washington Week in Review host Ken
Bode, April 26.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>How Many Are There?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;About 3.7 million Americans, wage-earning Americans,
are paid the minimum wage or less.&quot; -- ABC economics correspondent
Tyler Mathisen, April 23 Good Morning America.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;On Capitol Hill today, the minimum wage and
how best to embarrass your opponent. For ten million Americans,
it's a very personal issue.&quot; -- Peter Jennings, April 23
World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In fact, only about 330,000 employees, most
of them part-timers, today work for the minimum.&quot; -- ABC
reporter Bob Zelnick, April 24 Good Morning America.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;An estimated 9.7 million Americans make the
minimum wage or close to it.&quot; -- ABC anchor Carole Simpson,
April 28 World News Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Jim Wright: One Warm, Wry, Wise Crook<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like the man, Mr. Wright's book is courtly,
gentle, warm, wry, wise -- and florid. But this is not a volume
without virtue, just as Mr. Wright was not, as Mr. Gingrich portrayed
him, a man without virtue....his role in winning peace in Central
America is beyond debate....There are also some striking asides
about politics, and about the personal price of politics. More
than anything, Mr. Wright is an expert in that. He, after all,
was the man who gave back to the House, as `a propitiation for
this season of ill will,' the job he sought so lustily, enjoyed
so thoroughly, departed so tragically -- and, this book shows
us, misses so desperately.&quot; -- Boston Globe Wash. Bureau
Chief David Shribman on Wright's Balance of Power, April 21 New
York Times.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Welcome to Willie Horton Week in Review<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Judge Baer is a judge who recently ruled that
a lot of evidence in a big drug trial was inadmissible and immediately
the Republicans seized on Judge Baer, perhaps thinking he might
be another Willie Horton.&quot; -- NPR reporter Mara Liasson on
the PBS show Washington Week in Review, March 22.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He invalidated the search of a car in a drug-ridden
neighborhood and he's really become the poster child, or the Willie
Horton, if you will, of the presidential campaign so far.&quot;
-- New York Times legal reporter Linda Greenhouse on Judge Baer
 on the same program, April 5.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;So federal judges are going to become this
year's Willie Horton?&quot; -- Washington Week in Review moderator
Ken Bode, April 26. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Unabomber: One Courageous Anonymous Killer<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;It could be argued that the Unabomber at least
had the courage of his convictions. He -- again, assuming the
feds have the right man -- lived in `wild nature.' He battled
the machine.&quot; -- Los Angeles Times columnist Peter H. King,
April 10.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educate Illegal Aliens or Else<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Supreme Court has held that such children
have a constitutional right to a public education and many critics
say the Republican plan is a mean-spirited political gesture that
will throw hundreds of thou- sands of children into the hands
of violent street gangs.&quot; -- New York Times reporter Eric
Schmitt, April 9.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Saving the World<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I wanted to be a journalist because I wanted
to change the world. Yes, I came of age in the '60s. All of the
people I knew had a social conscience, and wanted to make a difference,
no matter what profession they aspired to. It was hell in the
'60s; between the civil rights demonstrations, the anti-war protests,
the assassinations, the divisions between black and white, rich
and poor, young and old, it seemed sometimes the country would
be torn asunder. And it was my belief that as a journalist, and
especially as a minority journalist, I could communicate what
the problems were to the American people in a compelling fashion
and I felt that once they were aware of why people were protesting,
why they were angry, they could understand the problems and we
could begin to solve them. All I dreamed of, as corny as it sounds,
was Superman's logo: `truth, justice, and the American way,' for
all people in this country.&quot; -- ABC's Carole Simpson accepting
an award at the April 2 Radio &amp; TV News Directors Foundation
dinner, on C-SPAN.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>True Confessions About the Republican Primaries<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;For a really good time, take the Candidate
Rate-O-Matic quiz, which asks a series of multiple choice questions
about where you stand on the issues...When you're done AllPolitics
sorts the candidates according to how well they match your views,
giving each a score. The closer to zero, the closer the match.
I took the test and couldn't get a candidate within 3,000, which
isn't surprising, I guess, since (full disclosure) I'm a Democrat
just like everyone else I know in the mainstream media.&quot;
-- Syndicated cyberspace columnist Daniel Akst on Republican presidential
candidates on the Time-CNN web site, March 18 Los Angeles Times.

<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote.
His manifesto, and there are a lot of things in it that I would
agree with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization
and pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an
extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond
any political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any
plumbing, he didn't have any electricity.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt;
Washington reporter Elaine Shannon on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal&lt;M&gt;,
April 7.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber.
Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting. The
original Unabomber -- the anonymous, hooded fellow, hiding behind
aviator glasses -- was uninteresting, a freak, a nobody. But Theodore
Kaczynski is someone very interesting indeed...I envy his disobedience....the
[manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can
be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force....If
Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly
not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have
many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our
front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic and manacled
before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber
set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society
that drove him to madness.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Boston Globe &lt;M&gt;columnist
Alex Beam, April 10.&lt;D&gt;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: He's No Leftist...<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;One source told the San Francisco Examiner
that Kaczynski was `disgusted with the widespread drug use and
liberal politics' at Berkeley. Maybe so: the Unabomer [sic] manifesto
is harshly critical of leftism.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Newsweek&lt;M&gt;
Senior Writer Tom Morganthau, April 15 issue.&lt;D&gt;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Yet no one, either at Michigan or Berkeley,
remembers Ted having any contact with the leftists he would later
excoriate in his manifesto.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt; Senior
Editor Nancy Gibbs, April 15. The Unabomber manifesto begins:
&quot;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been
a disaster for the human race.&quot;&lt;D&gt;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>....But the Right Wing's Still to Blame for Oklahoma
City<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bill Moyers, promoting April 12 Dateline NBC on Oklahoma
City victims: &quot;They're angry now that, most of the people
who were killed were connected, in one way or the other, to the
federal government. They thought of themselves as public servants.
Then politicians and talk radio turned them into faceless bureaucrats,
and finally the terrorists turned them into victims, and they're
angry.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bryant Gumbel: &quot;You mention talk radio. They
have some very hard feelings about talk radio and the hate being
spewed by some of those on the far end of the spectrum.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moyers: &quot;If anything, talk radio in that part
of the world is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves
are saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the government
makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances against government.
But this is, this goes beyond that, it's excessive. And these
people take it like salt in the wound. They drive around, they
turn on their radio, they hear some vicious attack on government,
and they think, `You know, if you strike the government, you kill
my daughter.'&quot; -- Exchange on Today, April 12.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Brown's Death: Great PR! <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There has been a huge push to get rid of the
Commerce Department and this has been, I don't want to sound too
cynical, but this has been a great PR experience, in a way, for
the Clinton administration's view of how to use the Commerce Department
to promote American business. I think it will be very difficult
now to kill the Commerce Department.&quot; -- National Public
Radio reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, April 6. 
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gumbel: Decency Over Politics<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Although many have praised Ron [Brown] lavishly,
I understand that no Republicans have yet expressed condolences
to the Brown family. Is that politics as usual, or is that just
plain bad manners?&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Rep. Charles Rangel,
April 10 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Out of respect for the memory of Ron Brown
and his grieving family, I am not anxious to prolong this story.
Like most people, I hoped that decency would prevail over politics.
Those involved will have to live with the truth.&quot; -- Gumbel's
press statement, next day.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[GOP Chairman Haley] Barbour told Gumbel after
the plane crash that killed Brown last week, he issued a statement
praising Brown and expressing his `deepest sympathy' to Brown's
family. Barbour made similar comments on his GOP-TV cable show.&quot;
-- April 11 Washington Post story by Howard Kurtz.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Though Republican leaders did not attend the
memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to
the Brown family. In addition, Mr. Gingrich, the House Speaker,
made special arrangements for Mr. Brown to lie in repose on the
catafalque used for President Kennedy's coffin.&quot; -- April
12 Washington Times story by Laurie Kellman.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Only Conservatives Would Let Liberals Solve Problems
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Let me go to the minimum wage though for a
minute...Ten million people would be affected by it. Most of them
live at or below the poverty level. And this Congress which is
trying to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit, which conservatives
used to tell us was the alternative, and refuses to do anything
about the minimum wage makes Marie Antoinette look like Mother
Teresa. It is just an outrage!&quot; Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, March 30 edition of CNN's Capital Gang.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If high crimes and misdemeanors have occurred,
by all means, the Clintons must be held accountable. But my head
spins to think of the time and energy the White House, Congress,
special prosecutors and legions of lawyers have spent digging
up and rehashing eye-glazing Whitewater details when they could
have been solving the country's problems.&quot; -- USA Today reporter
Leslie Phillips reviewing James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood
Sport, March 25.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Policing Police Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I hope I'm not the only one to notice that
Nash Bridges, Max Swift, and The Sentinel are all indifferent
to the rules against breaking and entering, search and seizure,
and even kidnapping. Warrants are an inconvenient waste of time
and the Miranda warning is never uttered except contemptuously.
This same contempt for pious legalities, this coarsening of our
thin blue line has also shown up recently on Law &amp; Order,
NYPD Blue, and even Homicide. It used to be that we could count
on TV to oppose the death penalty as we could rely on it to favor
integration. But you can't watch any cop show these days without
hearing an angry centurion gloat about the options of lethal injections
and electric chairs. Imagine that: Society has reduced television
to the lowest common denominator, which is a lynch mob.&quot;
-- John Leonard on CBS Sunday Morning, March 24.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bloody Cleanup in Aisle 13<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The safety of car seats, cribs, and toys are
the concerns of all you conscientious parents. Well, now you can
add shopping carts to your list. According to a recent study,
shopping cart related injuries account for 25,000 trips to the
emergency room every year. At least two deaths have occurred in
related incidents. In the last three years, 2,000 children were
hospitalized from shopping cart injuries such as skull fractures,
concussions, cuts, and bruises.&quot; -- Today co-host Katie Couric,
March 20. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Just Four Years Until CBS Gets a Normal Anchor <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I'd love to, but that's not going to happen.
You can sooner expect a tall talking broccoli stick to offer to
mow your lawn for free. Television is a young person's game, and
I'm living on borrowed time.&quot; -- Dan Rather when asked if
he'd like to remain anchor past 2000, in the Los Angeles Times,
March 9.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>A Fond Forbes Farewell<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Mr. Kemp, at a time when the Republican Party
seems to be determined to be united, doesn't your endorsement
of Mr. Forbes seem rather divisive?&quot; -- Peter Jennings to
Jack Kemp, March 6 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Forbes's persistence matches that of the movement
he champions. For despite being largely discredited and banished
by the political and economic establishment, supply-sideism has
refused to disappear.&quot; -- Washington Post reporter Glenn
Frankel in a front page story, March 12.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The McVeigh Update: Conservatives Still Incite Violence
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The torching of black churches throughout the
South punctuates the ugly rhetoric of the Buchanan campaign....In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to
Pete Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting
white resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of
the New Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder
if their coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past
18 months, while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative
action, more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern
and Border states have been torched....there is already enough
evidence to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames.&quot; -- Time
national correspondent Jack E. White, March 18 issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Republicans captured Congress by insisting
that the government itself was the problem....But the Republicans
played Robin Hood in reverse: taking from Medicare to finance
reductions in capital gains. But no one keeps up with Buchanan,
who, drunk on his early success, turns to medieval war cries.
`The peasants are coming with pitchforks!' he bellows at every
stop. It's comic, captivating, viscerally appealing -- and scary.
Those black-leather bikers and gun nuts turning up at his rallies
may not have mastered the concept of metaphor. Urging them to
`lock and load' -- and take aim at `Jose' -- is virtually a request
for violence.&quot; -- Reporter Jason DeParle in a March 17 New
York Times Magazine story subheaded: &quot;The presidential contenders
are falling all over themselves to identify with the lunch pail
vote. But it's all talk: The remedy is more government, and no
one will say that.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Pat Buchanan: Son of Willie Horton?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think in some ways this is the natural payback
from a Republican Party that has flirted too much with code words
and Willie Horton-type ads, and when you incite that kind of feeling,
don't be surprised when it comes up and hits you in the face.&quot;
-- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg, February 24 Inside Washington.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like a stain suddenly ruining the new carpet,
the success of Pat Buchanan and his alarming snarl -- xenophobic,
anti-Semitic, misogynistic, homophobic and racist -- has sent
the smug Republican family into a dither of accountability. `Who
let that pit bull into the house and why wasn't he housebroken?'
they must be asking, as if Buchanan is someone else's dog....This
is not some mongrel outsider but rather a purebred from the kennels
of Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan....Buchanan
speaks for a good chunk of the party faithful who have been lured
into the fold with a message of fear and hate and now demand to
be heard. These are the folks who take seriously the charge that
immigrants and uppity minorities are the source of all our problems.&quot;-- Former L.A. Times reporter Robert Scheer, Feb. 27 column.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In the end, Pat Buchanan is a hater not a healer,
a guerrilla not a statesman. For all his flaws, Republicans would
be better off with Bob Dole, a man who thinks of his opponents
as `distinguished gentlemen,' not instruments of the devil.&quot;

her husband Steven of U.S. News &amp; World Report, February 28.

that perhaps you and I will just -- I hope in good humor -- agree
to disagree that we don't do editorializing. And I'm either famous

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>King: &quot;I don't know what it means either, but
they say it. I'm just quoting 'em.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Rather: &quot;Oh, no. I understand. Well, my answer
to that is basically a good Texas phrase, which is bullfeathers....I
think the fact that if someone survives for four or five years
at or near the top in network television, you can just about bet
they are pretty good at keeping independence in their reporting.
What happens is a lot of people don't want independence. They
want the news reported the way they want it for their own special
political agendas or ideological reasons.&quot; -- CNN's Larry

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist,
embarrassed Pat Buchanan today by embracing him as an ideological
soulmate. `Today,' said Zhirinovsky, `there is a presidential
candidate in America who is not afraid to speak the truth, that
truly the Congress of the United States is an occupied territory
of Israel. Your press,' Zhirinovsky went on, `is occupied, and
all of your finances. Americans don't manage those. Israel does,
through American Jews or Negroes.' The Buchanan campaign immediately
issued a message of rejection to Zhirinovsky. It's not that Buchanan
hasn't expressed some of the views that Zhirinovsky echoed, but
perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they sounded until he heard
them in the mouth of a genuine bigot.&quot; -- Ted Koppel concluding
a February 23 Nightline profile of Buchanan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;But he is worse than oblivious to the political
sewage. It is the medium he has chosen to swim in. Sometimes this
evil nonsense takes the form of language....In waging the culture
wars, he introduces a hateful ethnic dimension. Almost all the
20th century's horrors (the slaughter of the Armenians, Stalin's
starvation of the Ukrainian kulaks, the Hitler Holocaust) have
begun with a demonization of others. Buchanan has a genius for
techniques that bundle his enemies together and subtly satanize
them.&quot; -- Time essayist Lance Morrow on Buchanan, March 4.

trying to force you to report the news the way they want you to

I don't agree with Bernie on that. I don't think that people are
by-and-large conservative or liberal. I mean he was making the
point that they tend to be more liberal. I think that we are anti-establishment.
I think that journalists, you know, can make their bread and butter
going after the establishment, whoever the establishment happens
to be. And whether that establishment is conservative or whether
that establishment is liberal makes very little difference to
most of my colleagues.&quot; -- Ted Koppel on Goldberg's charge,

<FONT SIZE=2>Cronkite: Capitalism Ruins the Media<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Journalists....are fully capable, willing and
anxious to do a superior job of reporting the difficult stories.
The problem is with their employers who have chosen to abandon
their public responsibility in favor of stockholders' demands
for maximization of profit. Adequate profits clearly are necessary
for survival -- but stockholder greed demands superprofits. The
investment in a public service essential to the successful working
of our democracy is required to pay off like an investment in
the rest of the stock market. To play the downsizing game, the
boards and their executives deny to their news managers enough
funding to pay for the minimum coverage necessary to serve their
consumers well....A more responsible press depends not upon individual
journalists but upon more responsible owners. That is the bottom
line.&quot; -- Letter to Newsweek from Walter Cronkite which appeared

<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Eric Engberg's Story<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CBS reporter Eric Engberg: &quot;Steve Forbes pitches
his flat tax scheme as an economic elixir good for everything
that ails us....It's the kind of optimistic message people want
to believe. But experts have trouble with many of Forbes' specific
promises, like how the flat tax would boost economic growth.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Steve Forbes: &quot;By removing obstacles, starting
with the tax code, we are capable of growing at twice that rate.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;Time out! Economists say nothing like
that has ever actually happened...Forbes claims taxes can be lowered
without adding to the deficit....That was called supply-side economics
under President Reagan, less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't
work out that way. Is it fair to say the last time we tried something
like this we ended up with these hideous deficits?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>William Gale, Brookings Institution: &quot;It's perfectly
fair to say that, yes.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;And that if we try it again, your
fear is?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gale: &quot;That we end up with the same problem
again.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;....Okay, how about Forbes' number
one wackiest flat tax promise?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes: &quot;Parents would have more time to spend
with their children, and with each other.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Former IRS commissioner Donald Alexander: &quot;That's
right. The sky would be blue all the time.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;The fact is, the flat tax is one giant
untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting
it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania. Eric
Engberg, CBS News, Washington.&quot; -- February 8 CBS Evening
News.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Goldberg Reacts<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There are lots of reasons fewer people are
watching network news, and one of them, I'm more convinced than
ever, is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good
reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth
discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and
plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't
have to. It comes naturally to most reporters.....Mr. Engberg's
report set new standards for bias....Can you imagine, in your
wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's
health care plan `wacky?'..</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`Reality Check' suggests the viewers are going
to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr.
Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of
getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania.&quot; -- CBS
reporter Bernard Goldberg in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, February
13.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Circle the Wagons! We're Blind to Bias!
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I've never regarded myself as an ideological
warrior of any kind. It's too hard to get the facts straight and
also have an agenda on my plate.&quot; -- Engberg quoted in USA
Today, February 14.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>His [Engberg's] hallmarks have always been fairness
and accuracy.&quot; -- Dan Rather, quoted in the February 14 New
York Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;People are just stunned. It's such a wacky
charge, and a weird way to go about it....I don't know what Bernie
was driving at. It just sounds bizarre.&quot; -- CBS News Chief
Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer quoted by Howard Kurtz
in the February 15 Washington Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd.&quot;
-- CBS News President Andrew Heyward, quoted by Gail Shister in
the February 15 Philadelphia Inquirer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;What is liberal bias? See again, when you use
this blunderbuss criticism, I back off. If you want to be specific
and say Brokaw did a piece that was obviously biased and not balanced,
fine. Or I did a piece, or you did a piece, or you wrote a piece.
But just to spray everybody, I disagree with that. Be specific.&quot;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! He's Never Complained Before</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There's no suggestion here that this man went
to CBS over a period of time and said, `Our stuff is all one sided,
we've got to do something about this'....There's no suggestion
that he has done that. He has simply stabbed this guy in the back.&quot;
-- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple on CNN's
Reliable Sources, February 18.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Goldberg has told friends he feels badly about
hurting Engberg, but that he has complained to CBS management
about a liberal tilt for several years and been consistently ignored.&quot;

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! CBS Expert Corrects Engberg<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well, and the fact of the matter is yes, we
did balloon the deficit with the Reagan tax cuts, not because
of the tax cuts -- we doubled revenue....Congress went along and
said, `Yeah, let's spend it all, and let's spend more than what
we're taking in.'  If we do the same thing under a flat tax scenario,
yes, we're gonna have a huge deficit. But if we rein in the spending,
we won't.&quot; -- CBS This Morning financial expert Daria Dolan,
February 13.<BR>

One on TV Awards,' go to: runner-up, Steve Forbes. True, he's
never run before. But a McDonald's visit trying to show he is
a regular Joe can't conceal the fact that this regular Joe has
spent more on dirty-tricks negative ads than any other politician
in history.&quot; -- Eric Engberg in the CBS News New Hampshire

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It Runs in the Family<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Bill Clinton has not done everything right,
but at least he cares for the common man. And tries to help everyone,
not just the chosen rich and big business who support the conservative
point of view. Anyone who would use a sticker `Hail to Rush Limbaugh'
shows me an incredible lack of intelligence and understanding
of what needs to be done.&quot; -- NBC Sports anchor Greg Gumbel

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Gwen, those in the media and his opponents
keep saying that Buchanan's too extreme to win the nomination.
Is it impossible, or is that wishful thinking among those with

<FONT SIZE=2>Is It a &quot;Smear&quot; Even If It's True?<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;That February [1992], the Clintons were reeling.

advocates a new sociopolitical system. `We may have to find some
marvelous middle ground between capitalism and communism,' he
says....`While each nation has distinctive problems, for the United

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The heart of his fiscal crusade is his flat
tax, a plan derided as `deja voodoo' by economists who blame Reagan's
supply-side tax cuts for the explosion of the national debt. He
has captured perfectly the fury Americans feel for a system they
think treats them like suckers while the rich enjoy a secret tax
code written just for them -- not withstanding his flat tax could
favor the rich even more effectively.&quot; -- Time Senior Editor

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] is changing the debate in a really

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Despite what the Republicans may say, there's
no left in this country, L-E-F-T. Liberalism has largely been
pilloried, and successfully so, by Newt Gingrich and others who
preceded him...Imagine, here we have the freest nation on Earth
and our political dialogue is impoverished. You can't even acknowledge
being a liberal. This is not to say that liberals have all the
answers. This is to say, rather, that liberals have been excluded
from the table that might allow them to make a contribution.&quot;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;They are still among the few people in this
country who spend a lot of time talking to other people -- and
actually trying to understand people -- who are different from
themselves. At a time when so many on the right and what remains
of the left actually brag about refusing to socialize with, publish
alongside or even speak to those who do not already agree with
them, the responsible news media provide the few vehicles by which
we encounter and try to communicate with each other.&quot; --

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In working recently on a documentary about
Andrew Carnegie and 19th century industrialism, I explored a period
of greed, of rapidly growing wealth inequality, of painful structural
changes in the economy, or a frustrated labor movement, and of
unethical business dealings born from an absence of regulation.
I found it surprisingly good preparation for my next project,
a documentary about the Reagan years.&quot; -- Josh Clark, associate

<FONT SIZE=2>Newsweek's Idea of an Investigative Reporter<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`She's [Sarah McClendon] a real treasure for
journalism in this city,' says investigative reporter Robert Parry,
a former staffer with the Associated Press and Newsweek, now freelance.
`There was a time in journalism when journalists took pride in
being individuals instead of being members of the pack.' A disgruntled
loner, Parry is a perfect speaker for tonight's meeting. His topic
is the `October Surprise,' a much probed but never proved tangle
of allegations involving top CIA officials and monied Republicans
who supposedly schemed to sabotage an October 1980 release of
the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran, thereby putting the kibosh on President
Carter's re-election. Parry talks spellbindingly for two hours
about a House committee's classified `X-files,' which he stumbled
upon in `a converted ladies' room, with the tampon dispenser still
on the wall': the Hashemi brothers...BCCI links...a $20 million
deposit...David Rockefeller...the Shah's twin sister...a Marcos
bagman. McClendon appears to doze off during parts of the presentation,
then pipes up with such on-point questions as: `Was there any
sort of French intelligence input in those [classified] papers?'&quot;
-- Washington Post reporter Richard Leiby on gatherings held by
McClendon, Jan. 24.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Hillary's Tough Media Scrutiny<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You also quote a letter in [It Takes a Village]
that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was
in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there
is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal
triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You
clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you
going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You think government should do a lot more than
it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things
for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government.
How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's
kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government
needs to be more involved?&quot; -- Questions to Hillary Rodham
Clinton from Today substitute co-host Maria Shriver (who called
the book &quot;really terrific&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;),
January 16.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think it's been a pretty good week for Mrs.
Clinton. I think that a lot of people even listening to the program
so much today keep saying `What's the crime? What did she do so
wrong?' It's a little bit like the budget. Mr. Clinton's protecting
us and everybody is against him. I think there is beginning to
be the feeling of she's being harassed too much.&quot; -- Barbara

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes Annoys the Media<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well it helps to know this about a flat tax.
It's a very radical notion and it's not nearly so simple as it
sounds and politicians are very careful not to put all the ramifications
on the table. But here are some of the basics....It is supposed
to encourage savings and investment because profits would be tax
free. But will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats?....Certainly
the rich would do better than the middle class....Here is something
else that worries almost everyone. You see no Western country
has ever tried to make such a seismic shift. How big will a flat
tax need to be to raise the money which the government needs to
run the country?&quot; -- ABC News anchor Peter Jennings on the
January 15 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Steve, isn't this a souped-up version of the
same kind of trickle-down Reaganomics that we saw through already?
Lower taxes were supposed to spur growth. Instead we got record
deficits.&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Republican presidential candidate
Steve Forbes, January 18 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] paints a vision of wealthy investors
shifting their money out of T-bills and into new factories and
investments. It may not have worked that way in the 1980s, when
top tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's
the reason supply-siders are often described as optimists.&quot;
-- Time Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame, January 29 issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You may recall that Ronald Reagan, on whom
Forbes models himself, said his tax cuts would balance the budget.
Instead, they helped add trillions to the national debt.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>Boston Globe reporter John Koch: &quot;What's your
view of the lack of universal health care in this country?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ABC reporter Dr. Timothy Johnson: &quot;Morally,
it is outrageous that the wealthiest country in the world cannot
provide at least basic care for all of its citizens, when so many
other industrialized countries have accomplished just that. Economically,
it's outrageous, because in fact we still do take care of people
outside the insurance or managed-care systems; but because we
take care of them at a later state, when they're sicker, we pay
more, and it's more difficult to effectively treat them. There
is no argument for anything but universal health care.&quot; --
January 14 Boston Globe Magazine interview.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Should Control America's Thinking<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Time magazine, to use that lingo, can be your
intelligent agent. It can also help set the agenda, so that we,
in a time when everything is fractured, 500 channels, you know,
hundreds of thousands of places to go on the World Wide Web, what
we do need in this country, and maybe in this world, is common
ground.... What I think Time magazine should be looking for is
the right tone, a set of core beliefs, and set of core values,
and I think that those are based on sort of a sensible American
common ground; an approach where we ask certain basic values we
all share like what's good for the kids? You know, clean up after
ourselves, certain faith in free minds and free markets and a
certain sense that, whatever the proposal is, the most basic question
we should ask is: yes, but does it work?&quot; -- New Time Managing

9.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He talks `devolution' to the point of distraction,
trying a bit too hard to stuff some interesting ideas into a dim
populist straitjacket, lobotomizing himself. A more profitable

smart, reasonable person in a party that seems mesmerized by its
lunatic fringe.&quot; -- Newsweek Senior Writer Joe Klein on GOP

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Limbaugh's draft-avoiding, non-churchgoing,
non-voting, non-fact-checking, painfully insecure triple-wife
lifestyle all are topics delicately touched upon by Franken. Where
I think he really hits the jackpot, though, is when he actually
quotes Limbaugh directly as in: ...`I'm sick and tired of playing
the one phony game I've had to play and that is this so-called
compassion for the poor. I don't have compassion for the poor.'
He may not have cancer, either, and I would pray that he never
have to walk that particular path of pain: Yet who am I to say,
or how can any of us know, the ways of God in unlocking a heart
grown hard? It could happen more gently; I notice a couple of
weeks ago, for instance, they shut down that `Rush Room' at Blackie's
House of Beef. Limbaugh `is fading right now' in popularity among
the restaurant's patrons, according to catering manager Paul DeKoning.
Is this a great country, or what?&quot; -- Washington Post reporter
Phil McCombs (whom Limbaugh ridiculed in 1994) on Saturday Night

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Remember, even with a budget deal, the government

children's children ever pay that back? The same way our leaders
tried to enact fiscal discipline back in 1996 -- by short-changing
the poor....Fortunately, both sides remain fierce in their determination
to enact a middle class tax cut. That way, all of us will have

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Fortunately the exceptions give us hope --
in this case the Republicans who stood up to the gun lobby and

people with true grit and guts under intense pressure. Exhibit
A is Peter Blute from Worcester....Blute's courage stands in dramatic

out of any collection of the fellow-minded by intoning a truism:
`to dump Newt you have to dump Blute.' That reference is to the

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Globe's Nov. 30 chart explaining where
Weld and Kerry stand on `Medicare cuts' prompted complaints that
the word `cuts' buys into Democratic budget propaganda. They've
got a point, which is why [national editor Jim] Concannon recently
sent out a memo endorsing the phrase `slow the rate of growth'
instead of `cuts.' Yeah, it's a little awkward. But it's one way
-- among many -- that the Globe can do its part to prevent the

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Monuments and national parks are shut. So are
museums. A long-awaited rare exhibit of the Dutch painter Vermeer
at the National Gallery, eight years in the making, is closed.
And the shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his
wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed.
They can't afford a Christmas tree.&quot; -- ABC reporter Jack
Smith, December 22 World News Tonight, the fifth day of the shutdown.

<FONT SIZE=2>Dan Rather: All Dork, All the Time<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I'm all news, all the time. Full power, tall
tower. I want to break in when news breaks out. That's my agenda.
Now respectfully, when you start talking about a liberal agenda
and all the, quote, liberal bias in the media, I quite frankly,
and I say this respectfully but candidly to you, I don't know
what you're talking about. Now if you want to talk about an issue,
what do I believe as a citizen of the United States of</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>America, I can tell you what I believe in. I believe
in a strong defense, clean water, and tight money. Now whatever
that makes me politically, that's what I am. What I don't like,
and if you want to see my neck swell or the hair begin to rise
on the back of my neck, is to be tagged by someone else's label.
I try really</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>hard not to do that with other people, particularly
people who are in public service and politics.&quot; -- Dan Rather
to talk radio host Mike Rosen of KOA in Denver, November 28.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;It is not just Congress that is taking a sharp
turn to the right. The surge to the right on Capitol Hill is making
waves all over the country on openly politically partisan and
sometimes racist radio.&quot; -- Rather, January 4, 1995 CBS Evening
News.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;While others in the GOP pack are running as
Mr. Right or Mr. Far Right, Senator Lugar is stressing his foreign
policy expertise.&quot; -- Rather on the March 3, 1995 CBS Evening
News.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Even after Oklahoma City, you can turn on your
radio in any city and still dial up hate talk: extremist, racist,
and violent rhetoric from the host and those who call in.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Powell did say he is planning to be active

<FONT SIZE=2>Seething Hatred for Tax Cuts<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We're all deficit hawks here. Let's scrap the
tax cut. Let us not have ice cream before the spinach because
we have to take so much more spinach in as a result of these tax
cuts. I thought one of Clinton's worst moments was proposing his
tax cut back in December. It was a weak one, and it didn't really
get him</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>anything and it looked like a copycat crime more
or less.&quot; -- Time columnist Margaret Carlson on CNBC's Tim
Russert, December 5.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If there is going to be a deal since both sides
have tax cuts on the table, I'm afraid we'll end up with some
tax cut, even though that's the last thing we need when we're
trying to fix the deficit.&quot; -- Time contributing writer Matt
Miller on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, December 10.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Is it too much to ask this: That both sides
spare us those declarations about how the government must start
operating like a family with a financial problem. Because what
family, with more bills to pay than money to pay them...would
say, `Even though we have to cut back, let's take what money we
can scrape together now and give ourselves a big gift.' But that's
exactly what both sides are saying when they propose a major tax
cut.&quot; -- CBS Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer in an end-of-show
commentary,</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Enid vs. Hillary</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If you look at what was written about her when
she was campaigning, it talks about how detail-oriented and meticulous
and forceful she was, and how she campaigned on an issue of personal
responsibility, as well as family values, and attacked her opponent
-- a very vicious campaign. All of those chickens are coming home
to roost, and I don't know whether she was blinded by love or
by ambition, she saw that money coming and she said `Come right
in here'....She's either a greedy fool or a stupid fool, but people
don't want their Congressperson to be either one.&quot; -- Time

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I believe her story that it was smarts and
luck and some good advice. Who of us at the age of 30 hasn't taken
a few risks, and I wish my risks had been that successful...Of
course, maybe she took some advice of some people who later ran
into legal problems in terms of lawsuits, but I think all of us
may have done that at one time or another. You can't be responsible
for the lives of every broker and banker you ever run across.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Rapture, and I quote, `is the immediate
departure from this Earth of over four million people in less
than a fifth of a second,' unquote. This happily-volatilized mass
of the saved were born again in Jesus Christ. Everybody left behind
will basically go to Hell, but not before experiencing Armageddon,
which is a really bad end of the world. If you find yourself in
this situation, there isn't much you can do except one, starve
yourself, and two, get your head cut off. This loving Christmas
message coming as it did amid the jingle of the mall Santa and
the twinkling manger at the corner of Canal and the Ramparts made
it clear that the Rapture is indeed necessary. The evaporation
of four million people who believe this crap would leave the world
an instantly better place.&quot; -- New Orleans-based National

with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a
major network anchor of Pat Buchanan, who happened to be the guest
on the program: `You've got political enemies calling you an isolationist,
a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your
social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the
kind of ideologically loaded stuff that</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>turns a lot of people off, isn't it? David Brinkley:
&quot;That is so loaded, it's overloaded, and it destroys itself
in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously.
I wouldn't even bother to answer it.&quot; -- December 7 exchange

<center><h2> December 4, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 25)</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Gergen: Working Both Sides</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Congress now seems intent on imposing new burdens upon the poor, the elderly, and vulnerable children while, incredibly, delivering a windfall for the wealthy....This assault doesn't even count the $270 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare that is frightening senior citizens and could further squeeze public hospitals." -- U.S. News Editor-at-Large David Gergen, November 13 back page column.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"The Democrats were soon up to old tricks, splattering the GOP plan with charges of gutting Medicare, student loans and environmental protections -- charges wildly overstating the facts -- and public opposition rapidly mounted." -- Gergen's next U.S. News & World Report column, two weeks later.
<p>
No, There Are Simply Too Many TV Reporters with Bizarre Theories
<p>
<dd>"This year there's a Grinch: more layoffs in recent weeks by large corporations...And that fear could keep many from spending this year. Worse, there simply are too many stores and, says one expert, this season's holiday spending may not bail out the losers." -- Reporter Ray Brady, November 24 CBS Evening News.
<p>
<dd>"Though some VA and Social Security workers will return next week, the backlog of cases will be tremendous, and in the rest of government, problems are worsening. Imported Christmas toys, which could be unsafe, are not being examined by safety inspectors." -- Reporter Linda Douglass on the federal shutdown, November 16 CBS Evening News. 
<p>
Heard of Bob Dole? Lamar Alexander?
<p>
<dd>"Republican moderates may have reason to feel more threatened than turkeys on this Thanksgiving. With Arlen Specter's out-of-money exit from the '96 White House race, they have no presidential candidate to call their own." -- Judy Woodruff on CNN's Inside Politics, November 23. 
<p>
Bias, on CBS? You Can't Be Serious
<p>
<dd>David Gold, Dallas radio talk show host: "It's you folks in the media. Your bias toward the President and towards the liberals has been palpable, and it's understandable."<br>
CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn: "I don't know where you see that manifested. Certainly not on the CBS network news. I don't think you can indict us all on several bad reports..."<br>
Gold: "I'll give you an example. If you tell people, as Paula did, that Republicans are in quotes, `slashing' $270 billion dollars from Medicare."<br>
Zahn: "Did I just say that?" -- Exchange on CBS This Morning<M>, November 17.<br>
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- Zahn, September 28 CBS This Morning.
<p>
Eleanor "Squeaky Fromme" Clift
<p>
Michael Duffy, Time: "I think Dole will probably be more moderate."<br>
Mara Liasson, NPR: "Especially now that Newt Gingrich has become the poster child for Republican extremism." -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, November 12.
<p>
<dd>"Newt Gingrich teaching manners is like Charles Manson teaching nonviolence." -- Newsweek contributor Eleanor Clift, November 18 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
President Energizer Bunny
<p>
<dd>"As far as I'll go describing Bill Clinton is he's perhaps the most intellectually and physically active person to have held the job in decades. I've also said that if Americans were paying Presidents by the thought, we're getting a bargain in this guy because, my God, he's just always moving, his brain's moving, he hardly sleeps." -- NBC White House reporter Brian Williams, November 17 CBS Late Late Show with Tom Snyder.
<p>
Please Name One Actual Cut
<p>
"With the Republican Congress moving to slash many federal social programs, an odd hush has fallen over Washington: the sound of liberal advocacy groups that have been unable to create much of a clamor against the most drastic cuts in decades." -- Lead of November 24 page 1 New York Times story by Tamar Lewin.
<p>
"The real problem: Many GOP conservatives are determined to slash federal spending to the bone, even if those cuts aren't needed to balance he budget." -- USA Today reporter Bill Montague, November 17 news story.
<p>
<dd>"Republican policies in the age of Gingrich are not just mean, they are vicious. With its unconscionable welfare, Medicare and Medicaid policies, the Grand Old Party is gleefully shredding the income and health safety nets for the young, the poor, the elderly and the disabled." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, in his November 10 New York Times column.
<p>
Unbalanced Views of a Balanced Budget
<p>
<dd>"Let me make just one point. I'm for a balanced budget, too, but in American history, every time we've had a major, real drive to balance the budget it has been followed by a huge depression, economic depression." -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, November 18.
<p>
<dd>"The evidence is quite clear that the 1994 vote was more a negative verdict on the Democrats' failures than the result of some sharp ideological turn in the public. It's true, of course, that the Bolsheviks were willing to launch a revolution without even having a majority. But whatever one thought was wrong with the Republicans, nobody lost sleep at night worrying that they were Leninists. Maybe that was a mistake. As soon as he won his historic but far from overwhelming majority, Newt Gingrich began talking `revolution' and never stopped. His biggest revolutionary move was the balanced budget, which was built on ideas that were not discussed at all in 1994." -- Former New York Times and Washington Post reporter E.J. Dionne, November 14 Washington Post column.
<p>
Will Colin Save That Harsh Fringe Party?
<p>
<dd>"How hard a blow is this to the Republican Party? Has it, as Stephen Ambrose has suggested, left the party to those on the fringe right who all the hopefuls seem anxious to dance to?" -- Bryant Gumbel to reporter Gwen Ifill on Powell's decision not to run for President, November 9 Today.
<p>
<dd>"I think whoever the Republican nominee is will have to work very hard to have Colin Powell actively campaigning for him. And I think also Colin Powell will exact a price for that -- in terms of language, efforts to reach out to minorities, and an effort to make the Republican agenda appear a little less harsh to those who are poor and the working poor." -- NBC News reporter Lisa Myers, same segment.
<p>
Sam's Late Night Dreams of Powell 
<p>
<dd>Sam Donaldson: "I think he's still in it. Let me tell you the plan. It's next summer. Bob Dole looks like the nominee, but people are still grumbling and he's ten points behind in the polls. One morning at dawn we rush in the house, we kidnap Alma, we tie her up, we put tape over her mouth so she can't shout no, and we call him up. We say, `General, your wife is being held in a cavernous auditorium in San Diego.' He rushes there like a good husband. He runs through the curtains -- it's the Republican convention. They see him. They unanimously nominate him. Now he can't refuse, and so he's the nominee. You like that story?"
David Letterman: "Apparently, the sodium pentothal has not worn off, Sam." -- Late Show with David Letterman, November. 28.

<p>
<h3>Pouting Over Powell</h3>
<p>
<dd>"But what might have been is what is so intriguing: shrink the safety net, he was saying, but look out for the children. Cut the programs, but don't shut out the people at the bottom.... Abortion, no. But protect the bearer of the child and allow that person to decide. It was the glimpse of these views from someone speaking from inside the Republican Party that might have made for change in American politics. For the last generation, the Republicans have moved even further to the right. Here with candor and some skill, it was a political figure willing to move it back toward the center. That is what made today's announcement so bittersweet." -- ABC reporter John Martin on Colin Powell's decision, Nov. 8 Peter Jennings' Journal on radio.
<p>
<dd>"Most of them [Washington reporters] are centrists. They're not liberals, they're sane centrists, and Powell appealed to the image of why they think they got into politics -- journalism, to begin with....a lot of my colleagues are trying to accept the fact that the Republican Party has the upper hand, and they want a Republican Party they can live with, and Powell is a guy they could live with." <M>-- Newsweek<M> Washington reporter Howard Fineman on CNBC's Equal Time<M>, November 8.<D>
<p>
<dd>"Republicans...are, with calculation, risking blame for shutting down the government next week, or for the United States' defaulting on its debt soon after. In the process they may project an extreme, uncompromising image, the sort that contributed heavily to this week's election setbacks. Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a presidential campaign by Gen. Colin L. Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won." <br>
-- New York Times Washington reporter Adam Clymer, November 11 "news analysis." 
<p>
<dd>"I feel as if this is The Bridges of Fairfax County, and I'm Francesca. The graceful, hard male animal who did nothing overtly to dominate us yet dominated us completely, in the exact way we wanted that to happen at this moment, like a fine leopard on the veld, was gone....`Don't leave, Colin Powell,' I could hear myself crying from somewhere inside....Bummer. We were this close to something interesting and real, and it slipped away." <br>
-- Former New York Times White House reporter Maureen Dowd, November 9 column.
<p>
<h3>Klein, Heal Thyself</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Colin's crusade should be to rescue America from its poisoned political atmosphere....You have a great opportunity to recivilize the public square. Your mission should be to alleviate this awful screeching." <br>-- Newsweek Senior Writer Joe Klein on what he'd tell Colin Powell, November 13 issue. 
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"If he decided to run as a Republican, we'd all have to prepare for the unavoidable, stomach-turning moment when the general made himself available for a photo op with the oleaginous tele-quack Pat Robertson....[Gingrich] misread the public disgust with the tired, corrupt Democratic Congress as support for a `revolution' that abandons the poor while protecting gun nuts and polluters." <br>
-- Klein, same article.
<p>
<h3>Setting Up the Answer</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Do you agree or disagree that the Republicans in Congress are going too far in cutting back government programs?" <br>
-- Question in a Time/CNN poll, November 20 Time.
<p>
<dd>"First, the budget, passed by the Republican Congress, the biggest cuts in the shortest time in memory. According to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out today, almost three-quarters of those asked prefer a budget balancing plan that takes longer, but cuts less from Medicare and education. That's what the President wants. Sixty-one percent think that the President should veto this Republican budget as it now stands." <br>
-- Tom Brokaw, Nov. 1 Nightly News. Spending overall and on Medicare will rise faster than inflation.
<p>
<h3>Brutal and Deep Six Percent Annual Hikes</h3>
<p>
<dd>"White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said Clinton would veto the GOP Medicare proposals. That tough talk suggests the battle for Medicare may be the one that casts Clinton in the role his pollsters ache to see -- as the hero in the way of a brutal Republican juggernaut." <br>
-- Time Senior Writer John Greenwald, Oct. 16.
<p>
<dd>"The most important issue in the fight, which is sometimes lost amid all the talk of train wrecks and debt ceilings, is whether the Republican budget cuts will needlessly hurt the poor and the working class and thereby deepen divisions in an already polarized economy." <br>
-- Greenwald, October 30.
<p>
<h3>Conservatives to Blacks: Drop Dead</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think they're hearing the worst possible message out of Washington right now. I think they're hearing a message of harshness far beyond any rationality that they can see in the figures and the numbers that are coming out of there and the intentions that are coming out of there." 
<br>-- Former CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite on the message blacks are getting from the GOP Congress. CNBC's Tim Russert, Nov. 13.
<p>
<h3>Today's Top News: A Democratic Press Release</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Half of the program reductions included in the budget packages would fall on the poorest fifth of American families, according to projections by the Democratic staff of Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Another 25 percent of the changes would be felt by the next poorest fifth of the population. At the same time, the richest 5 percent of the population would benefit from tax breaks that, on average, are almost as large as the reductions in income and health benefits facing families with children, according to a separate analysis by the Office of Management and Budget....The immediate result, however, is likely to be an increase in the average rate of poverty nationwide and harder times for many families and individuals. Clinton Administration officials and independent budget analysts contend." <br>
-- Front page story by Los Angeles Times reporter Elizabeth Shogren, October 29.
<p>
<h3>Communists and Liberal Republicans: The Same </h3>
<p>
<dd>"The book is, however, a testament to the deep affinity between the two dominant conservative leaders of their time: Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev. At the height of Watergate, Dobrynin delivered a secret message from Brezhnev, urging Nixon to tough it out. When Nixon resigned one step ahead of the law, Brezhnev sent a generous, secret tribute. Brezhnev later demonstrated his conservative consistency by urging Gerald Ford to run for a full term as President." <br>
-- Boston Globe reporter and former Moscow Bureau Chief Paul Quinn-Judge reviewing Anatoly Dobrynin's memoir In Confidence, October 19 Globe.
<p>
<h3>So Much for Unique Political Analysis on PBS</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Well, will they get the blame for killing programs that help people? I mean, we've been talking about politics a lot, we're talking about size and shape and politics, but how about the issues that are involved? Won't Democrats get any credit for trying to save Medicare and other policies that help people?" <br>
-- Associated Press reporter Barry Schweid on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 27.
<p>
"The flat tax is a great one-liner but when you get behind the one line and look at it, it has some problems, the biggest of which is that it amounts to a huge tax cut for people with high incomes...and amounts to a tax increase for a lot of people who are in the middle, middle-income types." <br>
-- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray on the new PBS series Challengers '96, same night.
<p>
<h3>Abortion: Just as Bad as Eating Meat</h3>
<p>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?" <br>-- PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe discussing partial-birth abortions, November 3. 
<p>
-- L. Brent Bozell III, Publisher; Brent H. Baker, Tim Graham; Editors<br>
-- Geoffrey Dickens, James Forbes, Steve Kaminski, Gesele Rey, Clay Waters; Media Analysts<br>
-- Kathleen Ruff, Circulation Manager; Gene Eliasen, Intern<br>
<p>
<p>
<dd>"The assault on Medicare and Medicaid is, purely and simply, a naked grab for hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for the care of people unfortunate enough to have fallen ill....As the dollars begin to disappear, various money-losing services will go with them. Clinics will close. Research and teaching will be cut back. Access to physician care in general will be reduced. Growth is anticipated only in the areas of suffering and mortality." <br>
-- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, October 27 New York Times column.
<p>
<dd>"Republicans have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution, killing regulations simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson in an essay titled "Back to the Dark Ages," October 30.
<p>
<dd>"With Rockefeller Republicans like Powell on one side and the far right on the other, the GOP is wondering: whose party is it, anyway?" <br>
--  Newsweek headline, November 13.
<p>
<dd>"In the 1980s President Reagan made the same mistake. He promised that huge tax cuts would accelerate business activity and eliminate the budget deficit. Instead the economy stumbled, and the deficit rose to its highest level in history. Lucas' recommendation to policymakers: stop trying to fine-tune the economy." -- Unbylined story in Time, October 23. 
<p>

<dd>"Carver, who carries his Constitution in his shirt pocket even while baling hay, is a product of the same antifederalist ferment that produced such widely divergent events as the Oklahoma City bombing and Ross Perot's recent proposal to launch a new political party." <br>
-- Time  Erik Larson, October 23 issue.
<p>


<dd>"Republicans may have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, October 30 issue.
<p>
<dd>"For instance, projected Medicare costs will rise over the next seven years by ten point five percent a year if left alone...the Republicans would reduce that increase to six point four percent a year. But that's still an increase, says Gingrich, not a cut.
<p>
<dd>Well, I got to thinking about that and I must tell you I think Gingrich is wrong. Take a family of four. Suppose that family earns enough to buy a loaf of bread each day and everyone gets a fourth of the loaf. That loaf costs a dollar. Now, I know it really costs more, but let's just keep this simple.
<p>
<dd>Suddenly, mama gives birth to another child. It is now a family of five and the head of the house comes to Mr. Gingrich and says, "I'll need another quarter please to buy another quarter loaf of bread."
<p>
<dd>And Mr. Gingrich says, "No, sorry. I'll give you another twelve and a half cents. But not a penny more. I suspect that family will think it's just suffered a cut. No longer can everyone have a quarter loaf of bread a day...now everyone has to have less. Even though Mr. Gingrich will say, "Why, that family got an increase in its budget."
<p>
<dd>Now, any way you slice it, the Republicans are cutting the budget. Perhaps a good thing. Who needs a quarter loaf of bread a day anyway?" -- ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, October 31 Peter Jennings' Journal.
<p>

<dd> Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a Presidential campaign by Gen. Colin Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won. But the retired Army general announced on Wednesday that he would not run next year." <br>
-- New York Times columnist Adam Clymer, November 10 edition.
<p>

<dd>"Ms. Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund and she is outraged by the Republican-led assault on the poor and the young and the sick and the disabled." <br>
-- New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, November 6 "In America" column.
<p>
<dd>"What is more important is that the Federal Government is abandoning its responsibility to provide eveen the most minimal level of assistance to Americans left without any other resources.
That is a radical and deeply regrettable change at the core of the American value system." <br>
-- Herbert, same column.
<p>

<dd>"Let me hog the lectern for the moment and say that you expect the three far-right justices, Scalia, Rehnquist, and Thomas, to vote to uphold this constitutional amendment. You expect the moderate left, because there is no hard left anymore on this court, but the moderate left -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Souter, and it's slipping my mind, Stevens, to vote to throw it out." <br>
-- Mutual/NBC radio reporter Bonnie Erbe hosting the PBS show To the Contray, October 13.
<p>
<h3>Words Never Used for the Million Man March</h3>
<p>
"From fewer than 100 followers four years ago, the ranks of this macho religious revival group have exploded, today numbering 700,000 zealots." <br>
-- CBS reporter Frank Currier on the Christian men's group Promise Keepers, October 18.
<p>

<h3>Republicans Hate Old People</h3>
<p>
"O'Rourke allies himself with the privileged. His heartless mockery of the less fortunate makes him the perfect jester for the court of Newt Gingrich." <br>
-- Los Angeles Times book critic Charles Solomon reviewing P.J. O'Rourke's All the Trouble in the World, October 8.
<p>
<h3>Clarence Thomas </h3>
<p>
"But don't expect an end to juries here [in the U.S.]. That would require an outright repeal of the Sixth Amendment -- not likely even in the archconservative era symbolized by Justice Clarence Thomas." <br>
-- Newsweek David A. Kaplan, October 16.

<h3>Will the Lies Ever Stop?</h3>
<p>
"And on a busy Saturday this morning, Jack, we're going to get to the very latest on Republicans' plan to slash the Medicare budget." -- Today co-host Giselle Fernandez to co-host Jack Ford, October 14.
<p>
"Republicans are predicting victory today when their plan to overhaul Medicare is put to a vote in the House. Last night, Democrats were still attacking the bill, which slashes $270 billion in Medicare spending." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 19.
<p>
"Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?" -- Tom Brokaw to Tim Russert, October 19 NBC Nightly News.
<p>
"The House and Senate begin debate today on the Republican plan to balance the budget. It would slash spending by a quarter-trillion dollars, which Democrats claim would fund a tax cut for the rich." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 25.
<p>
"If enacted it would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor....It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government." -- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray, October 26 NBC News at Sunrise.
<p>
"Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and too extreme." -- Dan Rather, October 25 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor...For
weeks, Democrats have hammered Republicans for seeking large cuts in Medicare and other social programs to help offset the cost of their tax cut for middle- and upper-income Americans." -- Washington Post reporters John E. Yang and Eric Pianin, October 27 front page story.
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"An illuminating way to look at this budget is to take what the government actually spent and raised over the past seven years and compare it to what Republicans propose to spend and raise over the next seven years. The results: Spending will increase by $2.6 trillion. Revenues will increase by $3.3 trillion....Spending will rise by 27 percent and tax revenues by 41 percent....Consider Medicare. Politicians talk about $271 billion in cuts, but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than in 1995, an increase of more than 6 percent annually." -- Washington Post <M>columnist James K. Glassman, October 17.
<p>
<h3>Weren't Southern Segregationists All Democrats?</h3>
<p>
"Mr. Clinton has sought to keep blacks involved by standing up for at least some affirmative action programs, which is highly unpopular with many white voters. But he must also respond, to some degree, to the national passion for shrinking government, which will inevitably involve reductions in federal programs that poor blacks regard as lifelines, like Medicaid and urban subsidies. Mr. Clinton can only hope that his party is not punished further for its longstanding commitment to (and identification with) the blacks of America." -- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple, October 17 "news analysis."
<p>
"They were there to remind Americans that even in a time of conservatism and backlash, the business of racism and inequality will not be ignored." -- Time's Richard Lacayo on the Million Man March, Oct. 30.
<p>
<h3>I Won't Condemn Louis Farrakhan, But Bob Dole Is Sickening</h3>
<p>
"I think he [Farrakhan] has begun to rehabilitate himself. I don't know that it will ever be complete. I think he said so many vile things. I don't think we can ever erase that. But if somebody is going to do something decent and encourage the kind of expression of solidarity we saw today, I'm not going to condemn it. I think it was a positive march." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, CBS's Late Late Show with Tom Snyder, Oct. 17.
<p>
"He's [Dole's] a raging moderate in his heart. But the things he's doing now to pander to the right wing of the party are sickening." -- Clift, minutes later.
<p>
<h3>Is There Any Doubt?</h3>
<p>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is still being treated as if he were guilty." -- Bryant Gumbel, October 16 Today.
<p>
<h3>Reporters Aren't Liberal, They're Just Compassionate</h3>
<p>
Cokie Roberts: "I don't think the coverage of Gingrich and the GOP Congress has been liberally biased..."
Lisa Myers: "I also think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal vs. conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending money to try to solve problems. And it's compassionate to spend money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation." -- The ABC and NBC reporter on CNBC's Meet the Media, Oct. 23.
<p>
<h3>From the Conservatives You've Ignored</h3>
<p>
"This is a pretty big complicated idea and you're looking at a real bedrock program [Medicare] here. How come we haven't heard about this before? Where did this Medical Savings Account come from?" -- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus, October 20 Washington Week in Review.
<p>
<h3>Helping Clinton's Triangulation</h3>
<p>
"How do you view the GOP's courtship of the extreme and religious right?" -- Bryant Gumbel to former Democratic Senator Gary Hart, October 17 Today.
<p>
"There's a hollowness to the U.S. economy and -- as the President explained aboard Air Force One -- to the American spirit in this post-Cold War era. Doubt and fear leave people vulnerable to the seductive voice of extremists, he said, drawing votes from centrists like himself." -- Boston Globe reporter John Aloysius Farrell, September 22.
<p>
<h3>Bill the Terrific and the Fabulous Democrats</h3>
<p>
"It's nice, of course, if we have a President we like. But there's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, October 17.
<p>
"With eight retiring Senators, Sam Nunn being the latest, I think there's a lot of concern that this party is looking very hard to find its voice and find a clear vision for the fabulous record of things that it's done for this country, and hopefully that will come up in your next segment with Gary Hart." -- U.S. News Director of Editorial Administration (and 1984 Hart press secretary) Kathryn Bushkin, C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, Oct. 15.
<p>
<h3>Saw Off That Tongue</h3>
<p>
Tim Russert: "You're encouraging the President today in saying `Let the Democrats in Congress negotiate.' Are you not concerned that if you cut a deal with Republicans, President Clinton will saw your limb off?"
Sen. Bob Kerrey: "That's a terrible metaphor, since someone's already sawed one of them off." -- Exchange from the October 29 Meet the Press. (Kerrey lost a leg in the Vietnam War).

<p>
<h3>Let's Leave Out the Inconvenient Speeches</h3>
<p>
"Though not without controversy, it's expected to be the biggest rally ever in the nation's capital. Organizers are viewing the march as a peaceful time of atonement for African-American men, a time of reconciliation, a time of personal responsibility, and a time of healing today." -- Bryant Gumbel opening the October 16 Today, the morning of the Million Man March.
<p>
"Responding to a common problem, hundreds of thousands of black men gathered in a peaceful rally of prayer and atonement and were encouraged to go home and make a difference...very peaceful, it was a day of prayer, of song, of atonement, and one hopes of considerable action." -- Gumbel, next morning. 
<p>
"It would be astonishing if this public performance of Farrakhan were to end or even minimize the controversy which he inspires in the country as a whole, but it would be a terrible mistake not to
recognize that here today, he inspired many people, and in a broader sense, as one participant after another has reaffirmed, this day, at this time and this place, really did mean unity over division." -- Peter Jennings ending World News Tonight, October 16.
<p>
"Were you struck by the fact that these hundreds of thousands of men...did not come to the seat of power to ask their government for anything?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Penn.)
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"Blacks should atone not for our anger, but for not being angry enough at the growing racism and incipient fascism of white America. We should atone for not developing more political independence, more cultural identity, and more control of our economy, in defiance of white power, in defiance of Jewish
influence....White dreams have crippled many black children and white values have maimed many black families....In the military, we died to save European Jews in the 1940s and South Koreans in the '50s and Vietnamese in the '60s. Yet, since then, all three have taken from our community to enrich their own....We
are an oppressed colony in the most imperialist nation the world has ever known." -- Former U.S. Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) addressing the march, as shown on C-SPAN.
<p>
"When I grow up, and find a man of my choice, I'll produce like Mary, a man of God's divine race." -- Tiffany Jamille Mayo reading a Maya Angelou poem adapted by Louis Farrakhan, on C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Did Minister Farrakhan organize the march? No, Clarence Thomas and Gingrich organized the march just like Bull Connor organized the march in 1963." -- Jesse Jackson, shown by C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Whereas African black people have been forced to invest vast amounts of labor in the development of U.S. capitalism, but have never received due compensation for slavery....the Virgin Islands shall seriously explore the political status of foreign relations, reparations/repatriation issue within six months of the enactment of the resolution." -- March speaker Adelbert Bryan, shown by C-SPAN.
<p>
"In the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555 feet high. But if we put a one in front of that 555 feet we get 1555, the year that our first fathers landed on the shores of Jamestown Virginia as slaves. In the background, is the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial. Each of these monuments is 19 feet high. Abraham Lincoln is the 16th President, Thomas Jefferson the 3rd President, and 16 and 3 makes 19 again." -- Louis Farrakhan in a portion of his speech shown live by CNN and C-SPAN but not on network news shows.
<p>
<h3>Where's My Hanky?</h3>
<p>
"Before I leave you, a very personal question. How many times have you felt like crying today?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Maryland), during October 16 live march coverage.
<p>
<h3>Someone Got Released Too Early</h3>
<p>
"Black men's tension is compounded when we see how many, but by  no means all, white Americans respond with apathy and outright hostility to our distress. The fashionable formula offered by white demagogues for addressing black men's monumental woes -- three-strikes-and-you're-out, mandatory sentencing, and the abolition of parole -- is especially vicious and destructive. As an African-American who's gone the prison route, these sinister measures make me so furious sometimes my vision gets blurred. They make me want to lash out at whites in the basest way." -- Convicted armed robber turned Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, October 15 Outlook section article on why he would join the march.
<p>
<h3>Another Day, Another Round of Media Lies</h3>
<p>
"Republicans began pushing the last and perhaps most controversial elements of their ambitious legislative agenda yesterday, seeking to scale back medical aid for the poor and the elderly."<M> -- Reporter Peter Gosselin in a Boston Globe story headlined "GOP Pushes Health Cuts for the Poor," September 27.
<p>
"[Clinton's] focus on GOP Medicaid cuts followed similar attacks the day before on GOP Medicare cuts in talks to senior citizens in southern Florida." -- Associated Press dispatch in the September 21 Los Angeles Times, headlined "Clinton Sounds Warning on Medicaid Cuts by GOP."
<p>
E.J. Dionne, Washington Post columnist: "No one has talked about the Medicaid cuts, which are if anything much deeper and much more significant...I think that with those kind of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do, as Steve says, a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people." 
Mara Liasson, NPR: "....But you know, the cuts they proposed in Medicaid are huge!" -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, October 1. <br>
Reality Check:<br>
"Far from being a `cut,' MediGrant funding represents nearly a 50 percent increase in federal assistance to help the states pay health care costs for the needy over the next seven years....On a per-person basis, MediGrants will increase the average federal grant for each person in poverty from $2,188 in 1994 to $3,263 per person in 2002 -- hardly a `slimmed down grant,' as suggested in Post articles." -- House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley (R-Va.) in an October 11 Washington Post op-ed.
<p>
<h3>Pope's a Cuomo Kind of Guy</h3>
<p>
"Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of proposed laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's
programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of President Clinton's warnings." -- New York Times reporter Robert McFadden, October 5.
<p>
"At times, the Pope even sounded like a Democrat. His heart is clearly with the have-nots. And for that, at least, liberals appreciate his views on peace and social justice and the responsibility of rich nations to the poor....For sure, on sexual morality he is predictably conservative, and he often repeats his boilerplate message against abortion." -- Chicago Tribune reporter Timothy McNulty, October 8. 
<p>
<h3>Very Unifying</h3>
<p>
"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there [marching]." -- Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page on the October 15 McLaughlin Group. 
<p>
<h3>Yes, She Said "Popularity Control"</h3>
<p>
"The Pope's stands on issues such as, for instance, abortion, popularity control, birth control -- is he aware that American Catholic women, the majority, have different views than he does on these matters?" -- Giselle Fernandez to papal envoy Mary Ann Glendon, October 8 Today.

<h3>No, Ito Didn't Underestimate the White Jurors Either</h3>
<p>
"In his written ruling, Ito said, I'm quoting here, `The court finds the probative value of the remaining examples,' those not allowed, `substantially and overwhelmingly outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.' Do you think Ito has underestimated the intellectual capacity of this jury because it is black-majority?" -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Alan Dershowitz on Judge Ito's ruling that admitted only two of Mark Fuhrman's racial slurs, September 1.
<p>
<h3>Lying More Than Johnnie Cochran</h3>
<p>
"On Close Up this morning, Medicare. Republicans in Congress are beginning to detail how they intend to cut $270 billion from the Medicare budget." -- Bryant Gumbel, September 15 Today.
<p>
"The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital bell ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, September 16 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
"Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut. The question is how much and
for how many." -- Dan Rather, September 20 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Congressional Republicans are trying to squeeze $270 billion out of the program during the next seven years. The Democrats say the proposed cuts are too deep." -- CNN's Bernard Shaw, Sept. 20 Inside Politics.
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn, September 28.
<p>
"Just after midnight the [Senate Finance] committee voted 11 to 9 along party lines to approve an 
anti-deficit plan mandating massive cuts and changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal
welfare program." -- Washington Post reporters Eric Pianin and Judith Havemann, September 30.
<p>
"Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said today Democrats have a plan to save Medicare without raising
premiums or deductibles. He said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of
what the Republicans have proposed to slash." -- PBS anchor Robert MacNeil on The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour, October 2.
<p>

<h3>Cronkite Tries Spin Control</h3>
<p>
Caller: "You've been quoted as saying that you felt that most journalists were liberal, in fact that a good journalist was by nature a liberal."
Walter Cronkite: "I define liberal as a person who is not doctrinaire. That is a dictionary definition of liberal. That's opposed to `liberal' as part of the political spectrum....open to change, constantly, not committed to any particular creed or doctrine, or whatnot, and in that respect I think that news people should be liberal." -- Exchange on CNN's Larry King Live, September 11.
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"I know liberalism isn't dead in this country. It simply has, temporarily we hope, lost its voice....We know that Star Wars means uncontrollable escalation of the arms race. We know that the real threat to democracy is the half of the nation in poverty....We know that no one should tell a woman she has to bear an unwanted child....Gawd Almighty, we've got to shout these truths in which we believe from the housetops. Like that scene in the movie Network, we've got to throw open our windows and shout these truths to the streets and the heavens." -- Cronkite addressing a November 17, 1988 People for the American Way dinner as quoted in the December 5, 1988 Newsweek.
<p>
<h3>No, Colin, Not the Genocidal Republicans!</h3>
<p>
"For urban dwellers, and especially the poor, the Republican Party as currently constituted is the enemy -- the source of endless destructive, mean-spirited and racist initiatives....The unspoken question on Kelly Street [in the Bronx] was how, in good conscience, General Powell could serve as the standard-bearer of a party that is waging all-out war against the poor and racial and ethnic minorities (and which is hostile to the interests of the middle class as well)....For years, the insidious and blatantly racist strategy of the Republican Party has been to pit the middle classes against the lower classes, while sucking money from both groups up the economic pyramid to the smiling faces at the top." -- Former NBC reporter Bob Herbert in his New York Times column, September 22.
<p>
<h3>The Pope's a Crank</h3>
<p>
"There are 60 million Catholics in America, and for many of them he also speaks with the voice of a conservative crank when he stonewalls on abortion, birth control, married priests, women priests and so on." -- Washington Post reporter Henry Allen in an October 2 Style section story.
<p>

<h3>Nothing Dangerous About Abortion</h3>
<p>
"The picture, fed by conservative critics, of a festival of radical feminism where ideas germinated in the West were spread aggressively among wide-eyed disciples from the rest of the world, didn't match the conference that I covered....to those who argue there was a dangerous political agenda at work, that is true only if you believe there is something dangerous about helping 70 percent of the world's poor, who happen to be women." -- CNN anchor Judy Woodruff in a Washington Post op-ed, October 1.
<p>
<h3>Sounds Like Mario Cuomo</h3>
<p>
"Our viewers remember from '80, from 1980 to 1988, Ronald Reagan said he could cut taxes, increase defense, and still balance the budget. The deficit under Ronald Reagan doubled. The debt tripled, and home mortgage rates were 12 percent. It didn't work then. Why would it work now?" -- Meet the Press host Tim Russert to GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, September 24.
<p>
<h3>For Once We Agree</h3>
<p>
"The Standard is part of the process, whereas George is part of the problem. Why should politics need more packaging when The New Yorker has gone Hollywood, Vanity Fair psycho-babbles, and we've
already got too many television yak shows where Ross Perot flies in one of Larry King's ears and out the other like a maddened fruit bat." -- CBS Sunday Morning television critic John Leonard, September 24.

<h3>Someday, Hawaii Might Become the 50th State</h3>

"President Clinton will be attending more ceremonies in Hawaii marking V-J Day, Victory over Japan. Saturday, Mr. Clinton went to a ceremony on a hill high above Honolulu. He praised those who served in the military 50 years ago, saying they saved the world. After today's ceremonies marking the end of World War II, President Clinton will head back to the United States." -- NBC anchor Giselle Fernandez, September 3 Today.

"Let's touch on your hard stands against affirmative action. You were Governor during the Los Angeles riots. Many of the people there believed those happen not just because of Rodney King, but because affirmative action didn't trickle down far enough.

<p>
"So perhaps the weekend of World War II commemoration was  somewhat of an epiphany for Clinton, and for the nation. Maybe the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II was a time when he came to the realization that his reluctance to answer his country's call was a mistake, and those who answered without
a second thought forgave him. How else do we explain aging World War II veterans, as giddy as children, jockeying to get their pictures taken with the President, and camouflaged young soldiers with shaven heads shouting out `Four more years!'" -- USA Today reporter Richard Benedetto in Honolulu, September 5.
<p>
<h3>Senator Bill Bradley's A "Moderate"...</h3>
<p>
"Bradley is one of an endangered species in American politics, a true moderate." -- CNN political analyst William Schneider, August 19 Inside Politics, after the New Jersey Democrat said he wouldn't seek re-election.
<p>
"Bradley...he's got the right profile, he's sort of in the middle and he's got integrity." -- Time reporter Laurence Barrett on CNBC's Cal Thomas, August 23.
<p>
"Echoing growing disillusionment in Washington by moderates of both parties -- including Bradley -- [former New Jersey Gov. Thomas] Kean criticized a `lack of civility' and `meanness' in national politics..." -- Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, September 1. (Bradley's 1994 Americans for Democratic Action liberal rating: 85. His 1994 American Conservative Union rating: 4.)
<p>

<h3>...But More Moderate Senator Judd Gregg's A "Radical"?</h3>
<p>
"Gregg-ism (the supine adoption of Gingrich's far-out agenda and Bob Dole's kissin' cousin facsimile) would literally involve the transfer of income and wealth to the occupants of plush homes along the quiet streets of Amherst and Peterborough, straight from the pockets of working and retired families from Salem in the south all the way north to Berlin. From his perch on the budget and human resources committees, Gregg has been a  down-the-line rubber stamp for radicalism; fortunately, serious Republican leaders to his north in Maine, west in Vermont and south in Rhode Island are picking up his slack. The good news is that Gingrich, Gregg, and the radicals are going to lose their fight to transfer income and wealth on this extreme scale." -- Boston Globe Washington columnist and former reporter Tom Oliphant on Gregg (R-NH), August 20. (Gregg's 1994 ADA liberal rating: 15. Gregg's 1994 ACU conservative score: 79.)
<p>
<h3>At Least His Victims Are Alive to Complain</h3>
<p>
"Good evening. Senator Bob Packwood has been one of the Senate's enduring embarrassments since it was disclosed that he had a long history of explicit sexual harassment and fondling, and now his career, his time as a U.S. Senator, apparently is very near an end." -- NBC's Tom Brokaw, September 6 Nightly News.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
Anchor Mary Alice Williams: "It was 20 years ago tonight that a car swerved off a small bridge on Chappadquiddick Island off Massachusetts' coast...NBC's Andrea Mitchell tonight on how Ted Kennedy is winning respect 20 years later."
<p>
Mitchell: "In reforming the immigration law last week, Ted Kennedy was updating the rules he first legislated in 1965. It's that kind of nuts-and-bolts work that has earned the respect of colleagues -- even conservatives." -- NBC Nightly News, July 18, 1989.
<p>
<h3>Harmless Communism and Its Harmful Overthrow</h3>
<p>
"But Vietnam's government is worried about the ugly side of the free market system: crime, unemployment, pollution, and most of all, political dissent." -- NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, August 4 Nightly News.
<p>
"This is how Arbat Street looked then, 150 years ago. None of the buildings still stand -- too much trauma. The end of the czars, a revolution, two World Wars, the fall of communism -- it's all taken a heavy toll on this tired nation." -- NBC reporter Martin Fletcher in Russia, August 27 Today.
<p>
<h3>The "Nonpartisan" Group Seeking to Destroy the Religious Right</h3>
<p>
"Norman Lear, veteran TV and film producer and co-founder of the nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization People for the American Way, has doubts about the merger of Capital Cities/ABC with the Walt Disney Co." -- Unbylined item in Los Angeles Times, August 1.
<p>
<h3>Pat Makes Them Shiver</h3>
<p>
"Pat Buchanan is seen by many in the party as extreme. That's not my word. That's not the Democrats' words. That's the Republicans' words. I was on the floor of the convention in 1992 when Pat Buchanan delivered that speech in which he talked about taking back the country street by street. That sent shivers down the backs of many Republicans at that convention." -- CNN's Frank Sesno on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, August 20.
<p>

<h3>Deficit of Consistency</h3>
<p>
"Apparently, the Republicans, who tend to govern by slogan, think the meaningless balanced budget and its accompanying tax cuts for the rich are more important than school lunches for the poor. That, of course, is absurd. The administration has proposed a humane bu dget that calls for no new debt by 2004, but the CBO, using less rosy projections, says the deficit would be about $200 billion then. So what? That would be just 1.7 percent of the projected gross domestic product." -- Former NBC News President
Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, September 5.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
"Before you listen to them trash Bill Clinton, before you put a new bumper sticker on your car, look at what happened between 1981 and 1992, the 12 years the White House was controlled by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. The budget deficit in 1980, the year before the Republicans took over, was about $73 billion. By 1992, their last year in office, it has soared to $340 billion (or, if you want to toss in the Social Security surplus, $290 billion). Responsible management? Hardly." -- Gartner in USA Today, April 18.

<p>
<h3>Failing to Help CBS Democrats</h3>
<p>
"So why not stay in the Senate with your party and restore -- if it's all broken, have you no responsibility to even your Democratic constituents from New Jersey who work right within this building?" -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith to Senator Bill Bradley who announced he will not seek re-election, August 17.
<p>
<h3>Gephardt and Daschle: The Media's Middle</h3>
<p>
"The Democrats can offer only a cacophony of views, ranging from the leftist tract of [Jesse] Jackson to the more centrist perspectives of House minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate minority leader Tom Daschle." -- Time Washington reporter Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, in an August 14 story on what the parties can offer Perot voters. Gephardt's 1992 American Conservative Union (ACU) rating: 0. Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) rating in 1992: 85 percent. Daschle's 1992 ACU: 22 percent; 1992 ADA: 95.
<p>
<h3>A Massive Six Tenths of One Percent Slash from the Federal Budget</h3>
<p>
"A bitter battle on Capitol Hill has ended with a deep slash in federal spending. The House made more than $9 billion in cuts, hitting education and employment programs especially hard. NBC's Joe Johns has more." -- NBC Today anchor Matt Lauer, August 4.
<p>
<h3>More Concerned About Investigators Than Investigated</h3>
<p>
"The Whitewater scandal occupied key committees in both the House and Senate last week -- a two-ring circus whose single goal seemed to be causing maximum embarrassment to Bill and Hillary Clinton and their friends." -- Opening sentence of August 21 Newsweek story headlined "An End in Sight (Maybe), Whitewater: Trying to finish the investigations." Story written by Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff.
<p>
"But these won't be the last ones. The Republicans plan several more rounds, and these hearings left us with more questions than answers about the tangled Whitewater mess and Republicans' motives." -- CNN's Bob Franken concluding an August 11 World News story.
<p>
<h3>White Men Ruin Everything</h3>
<p>
"Why don't we adequately fund urban education at the preschool and elementary level to eliminate the need for race-based admission standards later on?....The uncomfortable truth is that the tension about raceand gender in this country is not about facts; it is about fear. In the '60s and '70s, we settled all this on paper. We desegregated the schools. We admitted women to the Ivy League. We granted women control of their reproductive lives. And in response? White, middle class families abandoned our cities and schools to poor minorities. Universities educated the women they had admitted, then denied them tenure....We thought we had granted women the right to abortion in 1973. But barely a year goes by that the U.S. Supreme Court calendar does not include a case attempting to limit the right to abortion outlined in Roe v. Wade." -- Boston Globe<M> reporter Eileen McNamara in an August 16 front page "commentary." 
<p>
<h3>Internment Camps, Proposition 187: Same Thing</h3>
<p>
"Is it really a comfort to know that Canadians were as disdainful of civil liberties and common sense as the rest of us in our yellow fever?...In California, where I grew up, they're doing it all over again, punishing brown-skinned berry-pickers for the collapse of the aerospace industry and the savings-and-loan
scandals." -- CBS Sunday Morning TV critic John Leonard on a movie about Japanese relocation camps in Canada during World War II, July 30.
<p>
<h3>Abandoned to Crazed Uncles and Big Business</h3>
<p>
"The Republicans say they are for the poor as well as the rich. So how come they want to offer no aid and comfort -- and care -- when the poor are put upon? How come they want to eliminate  federal welfare programs and leave the poor and the sick and the unlucky at the mercy of the states -- some of which don't have a great record of caring for people who don't make political contributions. Why do they want to let states take away aid to provide for abortions in case of rape and incest? So only the rich won't have to bear children of violent strangers or crazed uncles? Do the Republicans perhaps have a double standard
-- not of men and women, but of rich and poor?" -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, August 15. 
<p>
"The sordid, cynical effort to pass regulatory `reform' is all about money. The legislation is designed to enhance the profits of big business by tying the regulatory process in knots. Government officials will be virtually neutralized as they are forced to make endless cost-benefit analyses before determining whether to protect Americans from unsafe food or drugs, from dangers in the workplace, from a tainted blood supply, from pollutants in the environment, and on and on." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, August 7 New York Times column.
<p>
"You're probably wondering how I'm going to make this segue from Gingrich to Galapagos but the point I was trying to make was that, in the 19th century, after Darwin, you had a movement called, that you know all about, called Social Darwinism, where people applied Darwin's rules of nature to society: survival of the fittest, the strong prosper, the weak don't. I'm wondering, do you, some people think we actually are headed back into Social Darwinism now, a new way of looking at society's responsibilities." -- Question from Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter to ABC's Forrest Sawyer, August 12 CNBC Talk
Live.
<p>
<h3>Never Mind Current Events, Media Can't Get History Straight </h3>
<p>
"The Russians attacked on August 9th; on the 11th the U.S. assured the Japanese that they could keep their Emperor. [Historian Gar] Alperovitz says this assurance could have produced a surrender without the atomic bombs. That is now the prevailing view among U.S. historians." -- NBC reporter Gary Matsumoto, August 6 Today.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
"Japanese students were still being drafted to prepare for the expected U.S. invasion; boys as young as 12 were being trained to fly Kamikaze suicide missions....Japan's Emperor and civilian leaders had wanted to end the war weeks earlier but feared a military revolt. Then came the atomic bombings. On August 9th
Emperor Hirohito summoned top government officials to the Imperial Palace where he told them the end had come; it was time to accept the unthinkable. Kasotoshi Hondo wrote Japan's definitive history on the last hours of the war. Through a film based on his book many Japanese learned...how the military
attempted a coup d'etat on the 14th of August. Several hundred troops stormed the palace trying to find the recording of the Emperor's surrender announcement." -- ABC's Mark Litke on World News Tonight, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Lionizing Politically Correct Cop Killers</h3>
<p>
"Sympathizers around the globe from Dublin to Soweto hail him as a political prisoner punished for taking journalistic aim at politicians, police and the prison system (most recently in a book entitled Live from Death Row). If he is put to death, they argue, he will be the first American since Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg to be executed for his political beliefs." -- Time Senior Writer Jill Smolowe in August 7 story on battle to save Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer.

<h3>Republicans Will Kill You</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Safe food, safe water, safe air, safe transportation. You have this protection now, but you might be about to lose it. Why? Watch a special In Depth report on NBC Nightly News tomorrow." -- Promo at the end of NBC Nightly News,<M> July 17.<D>
<p>
<dd>"There will be change, but most hope the original intent of the law will not be lost. Because if the plants and animals can't survive, what future is there for the human species?"<M> -- NBC reporter Roger O'Neil concluding a story on proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, July 28 Nightly News.
<p>
<dd>"This is deregulation madness! We're gonna have dirty water, dirty air. OSHA regulations are being rolled back. There's gonna be no competition in the telecommunications industry. And between local cable and local phone, there's not gonna be competition at the present time. It's gonna take awhile and there's gonna be no regulation in the meantime. And so no, he [Clinton] can't go along with this. And the people, the public isn't going to go along with this. They don't want E. coli bacteria in their drinking water." <M>-- Time<M> columnist Margaret Carlson, August 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
<dd>"The onslaught of political and legislative attacks on programs for the poor and for the young is about to create even bigger problems for America's troubled inner cities. Just yesterday, Congress killed nearly $900 million in funding for summer youth jobs programs, a major blow to disadvantaged inner-city youth and to cities trying to keep young people occupied and out of trouble." <M>-- ABC World News Saturday <M>anchor John Cochran, July 22.
<p>
<h3>Artful Thoughts About Lobotomized Conservatives</h3>
<p>
<dd>"The conservatives' agenda, if it goes through, is going to depress the quality of cultural and educational life for everyone in America, young and old, black, brown, male or female. This is one of the most ill-conceived, profoundly anti-democratic ideas ever to get loose in Congress. Private philanthropy will never be able to restore what seems about to be taken away. Some will not notice it; others won't care; given the shortness of American social memory, perhaps the next generation won't know what happened. Partial lobotomies work that way. They favor Beavis and Butt-head. Is that the business of American government?" <M>-- Time <M>art critic Robert Hughes, concluding August 7 cover story on plans to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.
<p>
<dd>"Welcome to the Hall of Shame, Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio. Chabot this week called the National Endowment for the Humanities a `boondoggle' while leading the House to cut the NEH budget by 40 percent. The House also cut funding for the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. These are the prize jewels of our national culture. As Arthur Miller writes in The Nation, America's arts are getting far less government support than any other advanced society." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang Sunday<M>, July 23. 
<p>
<h3>A Man of Peace</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Yes Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, you are the enemy. Yes Clarence Thomas, you poor confused fellow, you are the enemy, and we are determined to turn you around, and if we don't, you are leading our country to a racial confrontation that we will all be the poorer for." <M>-- Harlem's Reverend Calvin Butts, in July 25 NBC News at Sunrise <M>profile by anchor Ann Curry of the Abyssinian Baptist "whose life's work has focused on fighting racial divisions." 
"The words of a peacemaker, Calvin Butts." <M>-- Curry, immediately after the story.
<p>
<h3>Atoning for Prosperity</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole has deftly shifted far to the right on the tax issue....Dole shepherded President Ronald Reagan's supply-side tax-cut proposals through Congress in 1981, and then, as an act of contrition, spent years trying to reverse the steady rise of red ink fueled by a recession, Reagan's peacetime defense buildup, and the impact of the tax cuts." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Eric Pianin, August 6.
<p>
<h3>The Objective Eleanor Clift</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I'm a journalist, and I look at things objectively, and I think anybody looking at the Bosnia situation will agree that there are no good answers; and I don't really think this is something we want to play politics about." <M>-- Newsweek<M> reporter Eleanor Clift on CNN's Crossfire, <M>July 21<D>.
<p>
<dd>"That's right. It's not to anyone's advantage to have sleaze on television, and that's exactly what those hearings are. The Republicans do not have a single shred of new evidence." <M>-- Clift on Whitewater hearings, later in same show.
<p>
<h3>Know-Nothing Newt</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Great rhetoric, but Gingrich has trouble on the specifics. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, it's not what he doesn't know about the economy that's dangerous; it's what he does know that just ain't so....
<dd>"What's mostly missing from Gingrich's book is an analysis of what `winning' would really mean for millions of Americans. There is no mention of declining real wages or the growing gap in incomes and wealth, possibly for fear that raising the subject could fan some Democrats' demands for redistribution. And while he stresses the importance of lifelong learning, he doesn't reconcile this with proposed GOP cuts in federal student loan programs. These are strange deficits from a man who would clearly love to be President someday. Fortunately for the economy, Gingrich probably has time to do more reading and thinking before he ever sweeps into the Oval Office."  <M>-- U.S. News & World Report<M> Senior Writer Susan Dentzer reviewing Newt Gingrich's book To Renew America<M>, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Denying Liberal Bias is Nuts</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think this is another reflection of the overwhelming journalistic tilt towards liberalism and those programs. Now the question is whether that's bad or not, and that's another debate. But the idea that many of us, and my colleagues deny that there is this kind of bias is nuts, because there is in our world. I forget what the surveys show but most of us are Democratic and probably most of us line up in the fairly liberal world." <M>-- Time<M> Washington contributing editor Hugh Sidey responding to a caller who asked if journalists are in favor of affirmative action, July 21 C-SPAN Washington Journal.
<p>
<h3>It's Good to See Athletes Speak Out -- Unless They're Conservative</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Whatever one thinks of Winslow's positions, it's encouraging to see a Stateside athlete -- particularly one who rose from the squalor of East St. Louis, Ill., to earn a law degree -- engaging himself in the world of which sports is only a small part." <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>'s 'Scorecard' feature on Kellen Winslow's Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech supporting affirmative action and racial quotas, August 7 issue.<D>
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"Champions for Life, a 10-minute-long piece of antiabortion propaganda that first appeared 14 months ago, became the subject of controversy last week when the New York Giants made it to the Super Bowl...No matter how one feels about abortion, it's hard not to be repulsed by the video's inflammatory language....Jimmy Burt, Jr., the nine-year-old son of Jim Burt, a former Giant now with the 49ers, looks into the camera from atop his father's shoulders and says `It's great to be alive.'" <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>, Feb. 4, 1991.

<center><H3>Peter Jennings: You Voters Need A Diaper</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any 
two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: 
the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming. It's clear 
that the anger controls the child and not the other way around. 
It's the job of the parent to teach the child to control the anger 
and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of 
uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum 
last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: 
the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." -- Peter 
Jennings in his daily ABC Radio commentary, November 14.
<P>
"We say we are tired of politics because we are afraid of being 
fed simplistic lies. Yet voters are notorious for demanding that 
politicians commit themselves to cutting taxes while maintaining 
or increasing benefits for their constituents. There is no way 
those promises can be kept. Nevertheless we believe them, and 
express outrage when they cannot be kept. Believing invalid 
promises, hearing the siren song of term limits, listening to 
negative advertising -- all parts of the same dismal picture. 
Ultimately, many of the problems with politics may rest with the 
voters themselves." -- Jennings' commentary, November 3.

"The public seemed more intolerant than involved, uninterested in 
what the candidates have had to say, blindly voting against....The 
President might argue, with some justification, that it's the 
media's fault: we're allergic to good news." -- Newsweek Senior 
Editor Joe Klein, November 14.
<P>
<center><H3>Newt Gingrich, The Conservative Che Guevara </H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's 
gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the 
Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism....It's a record filled 
with contradictions: the family-values candidate who divorced his 
ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 
22 checks at the House Bank, and runs a big-dollar political 
action committee that won't disclose its contributors....Gingrich 
himself, bombastic and ruthless, would be the most dramatic change 
imaginable, a change the administration can only dread." -- CBS 
reporter Eric Engberg, November  2 Evening News.
<P>
CBS News consultant Joe Klein: "Last weekend, he seemed to blame 
the murder of two small children in South Carolina on the 
Democrats. He said that if you want to end that sort of moral 
decay, vote Republican. And so political insiders were wondering 
this week, would Newt's new responsibilities make him more 
statesmanlike, more responsible, less flagrant? Naah!"
Gingrich: "It is impossible to take the Great Society structure of 
bureaucracy, the redistributionist model of how wealth is 
acquired, and the counterculture value system that now permeates 
the way we deal with the poor, and have any hope of fixing it. 
They are a disaster." -- CBS Evening News, November 13.

<P>
"It would strike some of us that the campaigns have all been so 
down and dirty and nasty and personal, there's no overarching 
mandate that the GOP can read into this...My memory after that '92 
convention the Republicans held in Texas, is that a lot of people, 
even Republicans, said `Good Lord, what have we done?' Because the 
party seemed to have skewed so to the right. Well, the whole 
country gets to see that now. It's at least conceivable they set 
up their own defeat in '96, isn't it?" -- CNN's Mary Tillotson,

S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts, November 9.
<P>
"The so-called Christian Coalition, as you know, is claiming a 
great deal of credit for GOP victories across the board. Are you 
not at all concerned about where their brand of, some would say, 
extremism or intolerance, may yet try to take your party?" -- 
Gumbel to Jack Kemp, November 10.
<P>
"You said the American people gave very clear orders. I read the 
transcript of your press conference yesterday and you talked at 
length of a Republican mandate. But in an off-year election where 
Republicans won the majority of only a 37 percent turnout, how 
broad a mandate can you rightfully claim?" -- Gumbel to Senator

"Let me ask you about tax cuts. If you're going to cut taxes and

more for it?....Last time that happened, in 1980, we ran up the

Brokaw to Republican Senator-elect Bill Frist, November 9 NBC 
Nightly News.

"The fiscal centerpieces of the GOP program have surface appeal 
but do not appear to meet the traditional math test: They don't 
add up. President Ronald Reagan tried cutting taxes and increasing 
defense spending on the theory that growth would increase, which 
eventually would bring in more tax revenue. Then-Senate Majority 
Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) called it a `riverboat gamble.' And 
it was a gamble that lost: The federal budget deficit ballooned."

Tom Brokaw: "During the course of the last two years, they have 
passed the crime bill. They have made progress on the deficit. 
They have done things like the national volunteer service. Do you 
think the press has been too fascinated with other ancillary 
issues like the feud between the President and some more 
conservative members of Congress, like Whitewater and Paula 
Jones?"

"They are not voting Republican tonight, Mary. They are voting 
against a lot of unhappiness in their own lives....I think that 
it's very easy for the Republicans to make the same mistake that 
the Democrats made in thinking that somehow we've been given this 
great mandate....They have got to be practical. They have got to 
compromise. They have got to meet the real needs of people. This 
is not an anti-government vote tonight." -- U.S. News & World 
Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on CNBC's Equal Time, election 
night.
<P>
"The cynics would say this was a vote for gridlock, but I think 
it's easier to say, and the data points to the conclusion, that it 
was a vote for bipartisanship, for centrism." -- CNN's William 
Schneider, election night.
<P>
"If Bill Clinton and the Democrats were given a blow on Tuesday 
because they moved to the left, if the Republicans govern only 
from the right and abandon the center, my guess is the public will 
pay them back in the very near future....The American people 
aren't ideological. They don't want a liberal government, a 
conservative government. They want a centrist, moderate 
government, maybe tilt a bit right of center. They don't want 
extremes." -- Tim Russert, NBC News Washington Bureau Chief, 
November 13 Today.

"Both parties were sounding very conciliatory the morning after 
these midterm elections. But now it appears the gloves are 
starting to come out [sic]. We just heard Newt Gingrich make some

this as a major redirection for America?" -- Today co-host Katie

November 5.

"Republicans would have to pick up 40 new seats today to take 
contol of the power structure, to chair committees and make

"If it's 28 [GOP House pick-ups] it's because people go in and

"I want you to think about this question not as a partisan 
Republican, but just as an American, who as I, loves this country. 
Two years ago the American voters gave Bill Clinton a mandate for 
change. He went to Washington, sought to create change. He had 
internal problems with his staff, he had external problems. There 
were questions about his personality, his character, et cetera. 
But I don't think anyone can question that this man and his staff 
sought what was best for the United States. Tonight, it is clear 
voters coast to coast in this country have said `We want a 
change.' Now Republicans had voted this Democrat to be virtually, 
or described him as a monster. My question is essentially this: 
Where did he go wrong? What did he do so wrong that was against 
the American body politic, considering that he loves this country 
as much as you and I do?" -- CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Pat

<img src ="/mrc/images/famsmall.gif" align="right">Parents have every reason to be frustrated with the lack of quality television programming. Hollywood is becoming more and more out-of touch with real family issues and family values.

Here's what Jane Seymour of <I>Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman</I> says.... "The <I>Family Guide</I> provides parents with the critical information needed to make intelligent viewing choices about their children's television viewing.

<title> TV Ratings </title>
<br>
<center><h2> TV Ratings&#58; A Fine Mess </h2></center>
<p>
The television ratings system has been in effect only since January 1, yet there's already plenty of evidence it's doing a poor job of informing parents about which programs are suitable, and which unsuitable, for their children.
<p>
So far, the most obvious flaw has to do with the treatment of sexual content. The networks, which rate their own offerings, repeatedly have given to racy shows ratings that indicate those shows are fine for youngsters. The following episodes were rated TV-PG, meaning "parental guidance [is] suggested the program may contain infrequent coarse language, limited violence, [and] some suggestive sexual dialogue and situations."  Given the sort of content we're talking about, that would seem much too mild a warning.
<p>
Take the January 6 "Ink," on CBS. This episode of the newspaper sitcom centered on a madam and her little black book. One reporter exulted, "This story has everything! Sex in a car, sex after lunch, sex under water." Another reporter reminisced about the time in boarding school when she "sold pictures of the gym teacher doing it with the headmaster." The next night, ABC's "Life's Work" contained jokes about a man who masturbated by rubbing against a tree.
<p>
NBC's night for smut was January 8. On "Wings," a character discussed how he and his girlfriend made love four times a day, and mentioned that the previous night, "we did it on the hood of my El Camino." On "Chicago Sons," a character expressed his desire to invite an attractive female colleague to a bed-and-breakfast, "where we'll eat pralines off each other's naked bodies."
<p>
The next night on NBC, "Friends" had one character talking about how depressed he was when he saw a woman he'd just split up with "just walkin' with her friend Donna, laughin' and talkin'. It killed me." His roommate replied, "Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
<p>
All those series air in the so-called family hour, between 8 and 9 p.m. Post-9 o'clock programming was raunchy as well: on January 8, NBC's "Men Behaving Badly" included a woman's reference to "fifty-five hours of nonstop sex" with a man she'd just met. "Men Behaving Badly" was rated, you guessed it, TV-PG.

<center><h2>Special Project & Report:<br>Bringing Back the Family Hour</h2></center>
	The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved national attention and impressive results. 
<P>
	At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the television networks to bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over <a href="/mrc/ptc/famhrad.html">70 members of Congress signed on to a letter </a> urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety.</i> Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah,</i> which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
	The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results.
<P>
	On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
	Bozell's "eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on the decision-making process at the network," echoed Jacqueline Lovejoy, the show's publicist. "[His] voice was powerful, and it was heard."
<P>
	Brandon Tartikoff, former chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah's</i> production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told <i><a href="/mrc/flash/flash.html"> Flash </a> </i> that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<a name="Summary"<a/>
<center><h3>Executive Summary</h3><P>
</center>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>

   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.<p>

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.
<p>
  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
<p> 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>

  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
  <p> 
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  <p>
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  
<p>

   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   

<p>
  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   <p>
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
  <p> 
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
  <p> 
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
 <p> 
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
  <p> 
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
  <p> 
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
 <p> 

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
 <p> 
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
 <p> 
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
  <p> 
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
<p> 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 

<hr>
<a name="Three"</a>
<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>
   
<hr>
<a name="quan"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<hr>
<a name="rec"</a>
<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

<center><h2>Top 10 Best and Worst Primetime TV Shows</h2></center>
<P>
 MRC research has shown that while the number of prime time series
containing gratuitous sex and obscene language has increased,
wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment
Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the
least family-friendly prime time shows, but also named several
programs which respect family values and are appropriate for audiences
of all ages. 
<P>

<P>
 This report, which has been distributed to thousands of journalists
-- including television critics from print publications and television,
and radio talk show hosts, is the culmination of thousands of
hours of television analysis. As of press time, this annual season-end
tally has received widespread coverage in several major media
outlets, including <I>USA Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>,
<I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and was even included in Jay Leno's<I>
Tonight Show</I> monologue. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><h3>The Top Ten Least Family Friendly shows, in ranking
order:
</h3></CENTER>
<P>
1.<I><B>Married...With Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 9:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 The crudest comedy on prime time television, <I>Married</I> routinely
ridicules the family. Every week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot;
trade insults, celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom humor;
this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with lewd punch lines about
sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle, and the lead character's
fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs.
<P>
2. <I><B>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content despite the
show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. Virtually every episode
revolves around sexual themes and contains inappropriate language,
and each of the six central characters, all single twentysomethings,
is sexually active. Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting
and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>
3. <I><B>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 pm time slot
has done little to mitigate the show's content. The series' central
characters are openly derisive of their parents; religion and
the religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; premarital
sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>
4. <I><B>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly in and out of
one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex.
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with
one gay character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>
5. <I><B>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) Miniseries
<P>
 Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members
of a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in
public while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital
andextramarital affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up
schemes. 
<P>
6. <I><B>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, <I>CPW</I>
condoned premarital sex and adultery, and aired scenes containing
foul language and explicitly sexual content. Fortunately, the
acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in
to its sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>
7. <I><B>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) Thursday 9:30 EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with obscenity-laden
skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers withdrew
their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off
the air.
<P>
8. <I><B>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits. Dialogue
is littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive
scenarios. The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution
of marriage. Casual sex -- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>
9. <I><B>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) Wednesday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity,
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been
more than happy to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and
completely inconsequential --  fact of college life. The teen-targeted
soap sends mixed messages on drugs: positive characters deride
substance abuse, but rarely address the illegality of drug use.
<P>
10.<I><B> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom.
Most of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with
sexual references and obscene language.
<P>
<BR>

<center><h3>The Most Family Friendly Shows</h3></center>
<P>
 The Most Family-friendly shows on prime time contain wholesome
subject matter for viewing by all ages. These prime time offerings
include:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Touched By an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 One of CBS' few success stories of the season, <I>Touched By
An Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of traditional values
on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama showcases God's
message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of prayer,
and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties.
<P>
<I><B>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's
most pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental
authority as the key to a strong family unit, and advocate premarital
chastity, individual responsibility, and faith.
<P>
<I><B>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title
character, a young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of
his three younger siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices
to ensure that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing.
The show imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and
taking responsibility for one's actions.
<P>
<I><B>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
<I> Dr. Quinn's</I> promotion of traditional values has endeared
it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and family are staunchly
promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and respect for parental
authority. The drama boasts one of prime time's most positive
clerics -- &quot;the Reverend,&quot; a series regular, is depicted
as an intelligent, caring, and very dedicated member of the community.
<P>
<I><B>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife,
and their children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable
lessons about teenage drinking, honesty, respect and the importance
of education. One of prime time's foremost advocates of the institution
of marriage, the show frequently addresses the challenges faced
by the husband and wife and the steps they take toward strengthening
their relationship. 
<P>
<I><B>Lois &amp; Clark: the New Adventures of Superman</B></I>
(ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive dialogue and
sexual references of its 1993-94 inaugural season, and, in the
words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove
that television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator
to provide quality entertainment: dialogue and fast-paced action
sequences are free of offensive language and sexual innuendo,
and the newly-engaged protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P>
<I><B>The Parent 'Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 'Hood'</I>s central
characters provide positive role models for viewers of all ages.
The happily-married African-American couple, both successful professionals,
teach their children that education, self-discipline and integrity
are keys to success. The positive impact of a father in the household,
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage is also underscored.

ABOUT THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL
</center></h2><br><p><b>
"Bringing responsibility to television programming"</b>
<P>
The Parents Television Council (PTC) was established in 1995 as a special project of the 
Media Research Center to bring America's demand for values-driven television programming to 
the entertainment industry.
<P>
The PTC offers private sector solutions to restore television to its roots as an independent 
and socially responsible entertainment medium. Much of the PTC's success stems from urging 
the public to voice its support of family-friendly programming to network executives, 
advertisers, and public policy leaders. The PTC has employed these efforts to help save values- 
driven shows such as ABC's <i>Second Noah</i> and CBS's <i>Touched By An Angel</i>.
<P>
Along with empowering the public to voice their concerns, the PTC organized a star-
studded group of industry leaders to become members of  the Parents Televisions Council's  
Advisory Board. These spokespersons address issues relating to television entertainment and its 
impact on families across America.
<P>
More information on the PTC can be found in its flagship publication, the <a href="/mrc/entertainment/95famgui.html">1995-`96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Programming</a>, the only comprehensive study of prime time's 
content available in America. Profiling every sitcom and drama on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN 
and WB, the <i>Family Guide</i> provides viewers with information on subject matter that is 
inappropriate for children while also identifying shows which promote family-friendly themes.
<P>
For more information on the Parents Television Council, or to simply give us your 
feedback on today's prime time programming, please <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">e-mail</a> us.

<p>
Dear Mr. Harbert, Mr. Moonves, Mr. Matoian, Mr. Littlefield, Ms. Salhany, and Mr. Kellner:
<p>
     Until recently, the major networks set aside the first hour 
of prime time for family programming. This timeslot featured such 
wholesome series as <i>Happy Days</i>, <i>Little House on 
the Prairie</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>; adult-oriented fare was relegated to the late evening hours.
<p>     
This voluntary covenant with the viewing public has disintegrated to the point where the former Family Hour now features sitcoms and dramas promoting promiscuity and obscene language.
<p>     
We, the Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, urge you, the leaders of the 
major commercial broadcast networks, to recognize the pernicious effects of this programming on our children and voluntarily 
return to the spirit of the Family Hour. By creating a safe haven for the family viewing audience, and resolving to dedicate one 
hour of prime time programming to the promotion of positive values, the entertainment industry would not only endear itself to 
parents, but also immeasurably benefit American society.
<P>

<TITLE> Restoring Family Hour </TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Restoring the Spirit of The Family Hour</h2></center>
<P>
The Media Research Center's campaign to restore the spirit of the "Family Hour" has had impressive results. 
<P>
In April, the MRC organized a bi-partisan coalition of United States Senators and Representatives who challenged the television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full-page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<p> 
MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah</i>, which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results: On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, then the chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah</i>'s production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told Flash, the MRC's monthly membership newsletter, that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<P>
<I>Dear Friend,<BR>
<P>							

After spending weeks predicting the Republicans' chances of holding on to their majorities in Congress were shaky at best, the media completely ignored their stunning comeback on Election Day. <BR>
<P>

Think about it. Big Labor, according to <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, spent nearly $500 million in a savage, year-long campaign of distortions and outright lies, to defeat the Republicans. Their primary targets were the conservative freshmen in the House; the unions were out to destroy them. <BR>
<P>

Other left-wing special interests, from Hollywood to wacky environmentalists, spent millions more. Topping it off Bill Clinton and Al Gore lied in the national debates, in nationwide advertisements, and in hundreds of speeches, constantly endorsing conservative issues they'd actually vetoed! <BR>
<P>

It was, to my thinking, the most dishonest campaign I've ever seen. <BR>
<P>

So, where was the national press holding the Clinton campaign accountable for all the distortions and lies? Why didn't the national media expose the fact that 35% of union members voted Republican - yet union bosses forced them to pay for the anti-GOP ads? Where were the investigative reports on Clinton scandals by the television networks? Nowhere. The left wing so-called "objective" media did nothing to expose this fraud. <BR>
<P>

Why? Maybe because the media themselves have been promoting the very same anti-GOP distortions while actively pushing for Clinton's re-election. <BR>
<P>

This election not only proved to be an egg-on-your-face embarrassment for the unions and bureaucrat-hugging environmentalists, it was an embarrassment for the media.  Conservatives survived in the House, even increased their numbers in the Senate. <BR>
<P>

This past year we've updated you on our <a href="/mrc/reality/"> Media Reality Check '96 </a> campaign to hold the media accountable for their lies and distortions. Thanks to all your support, our campaign reached millions of Americans daily through newspapers, magazines, and talk radio. Because of our campaign, some reporters are now -- finally! --  admitting there is a liberal bias in the media. Even Walter Cronkite is admitting what he denied for 30 years. "Everyone knows that there is a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." <BR>
<P>

It took Walter Cronkite 30 years to figure out what we've known for 30 years. <BR>
<P>

Over the next few months, you can bet the networks will continue to ignore the many Clinton scandals that are currently under investigation. And the MRC will continue to expose the media's lies and distortions, throughout Clinton's second term. <BR>
<P>

For the past several weeks our <a href="/mrc/news/"> News Division </a> has been aggressively reviewing four years' worth of media reports on Clinton scandals, and the stories the networks have never bothered to air. There have been countless investigative stories in <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, <b>The Washington Times</b>, even the liberal <b>Washington Post</b> and <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. And still there's been silence from the networks. When the study is done, and I give you the results, you are going to be amazed by the media cover-up, I promise. <BR>
<P>

A study like this is a huge undertaking - nothing like this has ever been done. We are going to prove once and for all the media helped deliver Clinton to the White House - not once, but twice - by refusing to report the truth. <BR>
<P>

I invite you join us by becoming an <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">MRC Member </a>.  Help stop the media's lies and distortions. <BR>
<P>

By becoming a <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Member</a>  you'll receive MRC's monthly membership newsletter <a href="/mrc/membership/flash.html">Flash</a> , which details our studies, research, and projects. Other  <a href="/mrc/membership/benefits.html">Membership Benefits </a> include updates from me, discounts on all our books and publications - up to 50% off, and much more. <BR>
<P>

Through our web site we are offering <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Free Membership</a> for six-months! <BR>
<P> 

The work of the Media Research Center is more important than ever. Become a member today, and join us in our efforts to neutralize and expose the media's leftist attacks on conservatives. <BR>

<p>
<a href="/mrc/nq">Notable Quotables</a> is a bi-weekly 
compilation of the most outrageous and humorous examples of 
liberal media bias. At year-end a Best Of NQ issue presents

<html><head><title>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><blockquote><center><h2>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</h2><p><h3>Revolving Door Spins More for Clinton Administration than Bush's</h3></center>A Very Comfortable Relationship<p><dd>As Bill Clinton's nomination became secure in 1992, former Newsweek reporter Mickey Kaus predicted reporters would be rewarded. In the May 11 New Republic he wrote: "Many pro-Clinton journalists can reasonably hope for something more than glamorous candlelight dinners in the Clinton White House. They can hope for jobs in the Clinton White House."<p><dd>A MediaWatch study of this "revolving door" has proven Kaus prophetic. In just two years, more than twice as many members of the media have joined the Clinton administration (33) as jumped to the Bush team in four years (15). The study counted those with influence over news coverage at a national media outlet who left to take a politically appointed slot with the administrations.  Those who decided to join Clinton's team held higher profile or more influential media slots than did those whom Bush attracted: <p><dd>While no on-air network TV reporter joined the Bush team, so far six have taken Clinton jobs. <p><dd>Ten network producers, executives, and researchers have made the jump to Clinton's staff, compared to just three during the Bush years.<p><dd>Another 13 major newspaper and magazine reporters hopped aboard the Clinton team while just eight put in a stint for Bush.    In alphabetical order, here are the revolvers listed with their administration title and dates of service, followed by their media position. <p>Clinton Administration:<p><ol><li>Kevin Anderson: Health care spokes-man, White House public affairs office, 1993USA Today Money section reporter<li>Kenneth Bacon: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, 1994-Wall Street Journal Washington bureau reporter, 1969-1994<li>Donald Baer: Director of White House speechwriting and research, 1994- U.S. News & World Report Asst.

<CENTER><H2>The Free Market Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Free Market Project is the business and economics arm of the Media Research Center. The Project 
analyzes both the entertainment and news media to determine how they portray the free enterprise system. 
The Project engages in three main activities: 
<p> 
<ol> 
<li> <a href="/mrc/medianomics/"> MediaNomics </a>, a monthly four-page supplement to<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/"> MediaWatch </a>. MediaNomics reports on how the 
national media cover business and economics. Each issue includes an in-depth study of media coverage of 
a particular economic issue, such as the flat tax, minimum wage proposals, or Medicare reform. Every 
month MediaNomics commissions a prominent free-market economist to write an essay about how the 
media could improve their coverage of a particular economic issue. 
<p> 
<li> Quarterly Breakfast Forums. Every few months, the MRC's Free Market Project hosts a breakfast 
forum at the National Press Club for reporters. Each forum features a prominent conservative economist 
and policymaker, who give the media their side of the story on an issue in the news. In March, for instance, 
presidential candidate Steve Forbes talked about the flat tax and how reporters ought to cover it. 
<p>
<li> Joint Projects. The MRC's Free Market Project is also a vehicle for other conservative organizations or 
industry groups to analyze and criticize the press. Currently, the MRC is involved in a joint project with 
Consumer Alert, which will determine whether there is an anti-free market bias in large-circulation 
consumer publications. 
</ol> 
<p> 
The work of the MRC's Free Market Project has had a wide influence, being quoted in the Harvard 
Business Review, Inc., Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today's "Money" 
section, among many, many other publications. It is the only organization devoted solely to analyzing 
media coverage of business and the economy. 
<p> 
<p>

Each month MediaNomics points out such glaring omissions in the news. To subscribe to MediaNomics

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
November 21, 1996<br>
<P>
<center><h1> Women's Magazines: A Liberal Pipeline to Soccer Moms </h1></center><br>
<P>
<P>
<P>
	High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and personal care, and dieting.  Surprisingly, many also deal with public policy issues relating to government activism and women's and families' health and safety.<BR>
<P>
	A joint <a href=" http://www.his.com/~calert"> Consumer Alert </a> / <a href="/mrc/about/ "> Media Research Center </a> study of 13 women's and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage.  Part I of the study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was depicted positively or negatively.  Part II looked at the magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues relating to health and safety.  The study found: <BR>
<P>

<LI>In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more.  There were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less. <BR>


<LI>Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government -- they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. <BR>


<LI>In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against mainstream science. <BR>

<LI>According to women's magazines, recycling is always good.  Out of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. <BR>

<LI>Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. <BR>
<P>

	Recommendations:  Look for balance in coverage of public policy issues.  Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of view.  Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or gals) and bad guys?  Be skeptical of articles that provide only anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence. <BR>
<P>
<P>
<b><h2>Part I: Calling for a Village</h2></b><br>
<P>
 "Soccer Moms." This term struck as much fear into the hearts of conservatives during the 1996 election campaign as "Angry White Men" did in liberals in 1994. Conventional wisdom has it that the limited-government policies of the GOP just did not resonate with these suburban housewives, creating a gender gap that cost Bob Dole dearly at the polls.<BR>
<P>
Why the apparent skepticism among women towards smaller government, especially since in some polls they strongly favor reducing taxes and cutting wasteful spending? Perhaps at least part of the reason can be found in a joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of the publications that Soccer Moms read. Each month, as they perused the pages of their favorite magazines, women were not merely learning new recipes, the latest diet ideas, and how to have better relationships with their husbands or boyfriends; they were also often being told that government was the solution to most of society's problems, and they were being urged to lobby for its expansion. <BR>
<p>
For the study, Consumer Alert and the Media Research Center analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues of thirteen family and women's publications -- <i>Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Woman's Day, and Working Woman</i>.<BR>
<p>
Overall, there were 115 positive portrayals of government intervention in the market and/or calls for such intervention during the study period. There were only 18 negative portrayals of government intervention and/or calls for cutbacks in government spending or regulation. There were five balanced portrayals of policy issues. <BR>
<p>
Working Woman</i> and <i>Glamour</i> were the most biased in favor of expanding government. Each had 24 positive portrayals of government activism compared to four negative portrayals. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> was next with 15 stories promoting bigger government and only three stories promoting smaller government.<p>
Ladies' Home Journal</i> was the most politically balanced magazine in the study. Although the monthly ran ten stories promoting bigger government, it also ran six promoting limited government and ran four balanced stories. Two of the magazines, <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i> and <i>Prevention</i>, almost completely avoided public policy issues during the study period. <BR>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</B> Health-related issues brought forth the most calls for government intervention. There were 28 such stories. Seven focused on "drive-through deliveries," in which insurance companies didn't pay for women to stay in the hospital for longer than one day after giving birth. <i>Good Housekeeping </i>warned that "tiny lives are at risk" and advised readers on "how you can help stop this shocking practice." The magazine provided a form readers could send to Congress to demand regulations extending hospital stays. <BR>
<p>
Seventeen stories demanded increased federal funding for medical research into everything from AIDS to obesity to breast cancer, with no mention of how this new spending would be paid for. It didn't seem to matter because, according to <i>Woman's Day</i>, women had a "right" to quality health care. Liberal journalist Margaret Carlson, writing for <i>Glamour</i>, argued that families did too. Republican Medicare reform efforts, she wrote, would hurt the party with women: "If Granny gets booted out of the nursing home for lack of Medicare funds, it will be the woman of the house who picks her up." <BR>
<p>
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and managed care in general, took a beating in family publications. There were nine stories about the horrors people had faced at the hands of heartless health care bureaucracies. None of these stories discussed the health care reform option many market-oriented reformers promote -- Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). MSA advocates argue that such accounts would put health care dollars in the hands of consumers, giving them an incentive to find bargains and employ preventive medicine. A search of the EBSCO Publishing database found that there were no mentions of MSAs in these magazines during the study period; other magazines mentioned MSAs in 121 articles. <BR>
<p> 
Instead of discussing the problems of systems relying on third-party payers, women's and family magazines often proposed expanding such systems. In the September <i>Glamour</i> freelance writer Tessa DeCarlo urged readers not to "give up on universal coverage...No reform of managed care can be completely successful as long as more than 40 million Americans don't have any health coverage at all." She also wrote that laws should be changed to encourage more medical lawsuits. <BR>
<p>
<B>Urging Readers to Lobby.</b> Twenty- three stories went beyond merely promoting bigger government as the solution to problems; they also asked readers to contact Congressmen or other government officials to lobby on behalf of bigger government. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided form letters ("Join the <i>Good Housekeeping</i> Lobby") that merely needed a signature. After a June, 1996 story about Christopher Reeve and his life since his equestrian accident, for instance, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided a letter to Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. The letter told Sen. Specter: "Please add my name to the list of supporters of increased funding for spinal cord injury (SCI) research during fiscal year 1997." <BR>
<p>
Other publications, while not going to such elaborate lengths, nonetheless prodded readers into lobbying for bigger government. Three stories highlighted the "These Children Have Faces" campaign. Under the headline "Has Congress Put Children in Danger?" the May <i>Glamour</i> told readers that the group's founders "devised a plan to let politicians know that children's allies are watching: They're collecting photos of young people, with notes about their parents' fears and hopes, and will deliver the pictures to Congress next month." <i>Glamour</i> advised its readers on how to participate. <BR>
<p>
In a November 1, 1995 <i>Woman's Day </i>story about osteoporosis, <i>Woman's Day </i>told readers to "urge your members of Congress to work for more women's health research funding."<i> Woman's Day's </i>Dr. Loraine Stern, who writes the "Your Child's Health" column, wrote: "If you agree that immunizations should be fully covered for all children in need, tell your insurance company and<F255D> your representatives in Washington." In March, Weight Watchers alerted readers to a new advocacy group, the American Obesity Association, whose "first priority is to lobby the federal government to spend more money on obesity research." The magazine then told readers how to get in touch with the group to help. <BR>
<p>
The September <i>Mademoiselle</i> explained the nuts and bolts of writing a letter to Congress, using the example of a group called 20/20 Vision, which claims to have halted an "environmentally disastrous" plutonium-processing plant through a letter-writing campaign. The October, 1995 <i>Mademoiselle</i> urged 20-somethings to vote, strongly implying that they should support a liberal agenda. "The Contract with America, tax breaks for the rich, the end of public TV -- was this what my fellow Gen-Xers wanted? It's impossible to know, because most of us didn't vote," wrote freelance writer Esther Gabara. <BR>
<p>
<B>Promoting Liberal Activists.</b> Well-known liberal activists and political figures were profiled or prominently mentioned 18 times by these magazines. Marian Wright Edelman was the clear favorite, being promoted in<i> Family Circle, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle Parents</i>, and <i>Working Woman</i>.<i> Family Circle</i> seemed particularly enamored with the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) founder, mentioning her on four different occasions. The November 1, 1995 "From the Editor" section featured a prayer drawn from Edelman's latest book; the May 14 issue gave Edelman the magazine's "Lifetime Achievement Award" for such accomplishments as increasing Head Start funding; the June 4 issue promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march in Washington. And when the editors of <i>Family Circle</i> picked the 25 best-selling books "that can change your life," a recent Edelman book made the list. <BR>
<p>
<i>Good Housekeeping</i> also promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march on Washington; <i>Parents</i> editor Ann Pleshette Murphy pointed out with pride that Edelman won that magazine's first "As They Grow Award," and <i>Mademoiselle</i>, in a sidebar to a September article about poverty, urged readers to send a check to the CDF and provided the group's address. At no point did any of these publications question Edelman's policy prescriptions. They could have pointed out, for example, that Census Bureau statistics show that child poverty went down every year between 1983 and 1989, when Ronald Reagan's policies, which Edelman opposed, were in effect. But no critic or criticism of Edelman was mentioned. <BR>
<p>
Some magazines had regular features to highlight liberals. <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women in Washington" column, for instance, reported on the work of female representatives and senators -- but usually only the ones who were working to expand the role of government. One month, the column praised a host of female legislators for increasing funding for child care "during last year's bitter welfare debate." Another column expressed relief that "while members of Congress were slashing funding for almost all federally funded programs last fall and winter, Congresswomen from both parties managed to engineer a triumph for breast-cancer programs." In July, 1996, the column praised Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and Rep. Louise Slaughter for expanding regulation in health care. <BR>
<p>
The magazines also promoted the liberal agenda by quoting "authorities" from liberal activist groups. <i>Weight Watchers</I> for instance, promoted the views of the Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen Health Research Group in a May story warning about databases of medical records maintained by insurance companies to evaluate risk. No other counter-source was quoted. <i>Woman's Day</i> gave kudos to the World Wildlife Fund for protecting rhinos from poachers in Nepal, yet didn't mention private property approaches to wildlife preservation that, for instance, have increased elephant herds dramatically in Zimbabwe, where hunting is permitted as a property right and villagers have incentives to protect their property. <BR>
<p>
Liberal activists themselves often wrote stories for these magazines. Edelman wrote an essay for <i>Parents</i> to promote her Stand for Children march. Representative Pat Schroeder explained to <i>Glamour</i> readers why she was leaving Congress, even though she was "proud to be the sponsor of many bills that helped women and children, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Women's Health Equity Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Women's Economic Equity Act." <BR>
<p>
<I>Prevention</i>, which usually shied away from outright political stances, nonetheless allowed space in its October, 1995 issue for Hillary Clinton to tout government-run health care. "Taking steps to protect our children's health is one of the soundest investments our nation can make," the first lady opined. "President Clinton has initiated a campaign to improve immunization services, lower costs, reach out to families and ensure that all young children receive the vaccinations they need. In addition, Medicaid has provided millions of young children with important preventive health services." <BR>
<p>
Two staffers at the magazines even became liberal activists for a time, attending the United Nations' World Conference on Women in Beijing. "What hit me...was the passionate belief shared by women everywhere that we have a <i>right</i> to good health care," wrote Dr. Marie Savard, who penned the "Your Health" section of <i>Woman's Day, Ladies' Home Journal</i> editor-in-chief Myrna Blyth also attended, writing that the evening after Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech, the American delegation "got into a large circle, held hands and sang some sixties-style folk songs." <BR>
<p>
There were some conservative and/or Republican women profiled by these magazines, but their political views were often challenged instead of celebrated. Liberal journalist Eleanor Clift, for instance, profiled New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman for the November, 1995 <i>Working Woman</i>. While the story was generally upbeat, Clift took a shot at Whitman's tax-cutting policies: "In order to cut income taxes by 30 percent, she has increased long-term borrowing, reduced payments to public pension funds and cut state aid to local governments. The ripple effect of those steps is yet to be fully realized." <BR>
<p>
Republican women would often be praised...when they worked to expand the role of government. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, for example, was chosen as one of <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women of the Year" for working to ban assault weapons, for expanding regulation of health care, and for, in general, not being "extreme." <BR>
<p>
On a more balanced note, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> devoted the back page of each issue to an essay by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan. But Noonan rarely mentioned public policy issues in her essays. <BR>
<p>
<B>Lost Opportunities.</b> There were numerous stories in which the case that big-government policies hurt consumers, families, and women could have been made, but wasn't. Many articles eagerly announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just approved a new drug or medical device. The November 1, 1995 <i>Family Circle </i>reported that "the FDA has approved the drug Caverject, which treats impotence, a condition affecting as many as 20 million men." This, the headline declared, was "good news for couples." While it may indeed have been good news for couples at the time, <i>Family Circle</i> didn't mention those who had been suffering before the FDA had gotten around to approving the treatment. <BR>
<p>
Only <i>Good Housekeeping </I> condemned FDA policy. The magazine's February, 1996 issue took the agency to task for not allowing the breast cancer Sensor Pad onto the market. "Women are not stupid," writer Laura Muha declared. "They ought to be able to decide whether this is something they want." But <i>Good Housekeeping</i> didn't ask if other life-saving products were being held up by the FDA. <BR>
<p>
Another lost opportunity: taxes. There were nine major stories about financially strapped families and the stress this caused family members. <i>Parents</i>, for instance, labeled the dilemma: "Mommy guilt vs. economic reality." Only one of these stories mentioned the rising tax burden on families. Even that one didn't point out what the Tax Foundation found: that taxes take more from a family than food, clothing, and housing costs combined. No story urged readers to lobby Congress for tax cuts, as these magazines had done for more liberal policies which allegedly would help families. <BR>
<p>
These magazines also ignored the regulatory burden on women. Only one article, in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, pointed out that regulations hurt small business owners, many of whom are women. The September issue of that magazine profiled a woman who had owned a garbage-hauling and recycling business, but was forced out of business because of the high costs of government regulation. No story all year pointed out that, according to the Small Business Administration, government regulations cost almost $7,000 per American household, or how such regulations raise the prices of the products women and families buy. <BR>
<p>
And stories about safety didn't point out that often government policies undermine the safety of consumers. The April, 1996 <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i>, for instance, reported that "the larger your car, the less likely you are to be hurt if involved in an accident. That's the not-so-shocking conclusion of an insurance claim analysis for 1992-1994 models." But the magazine didn't then point out that federal fuel economy regulations encourage smaller, and therefore more dangerous, cars. <BR>
<p>
<B>"<i>Redbook</i> Strategy."</b> The Clinton campaign understood what an asset it had in family and women's magazines. It pursued, according to <i>U.S News & World Report</i>, a "<i>Redbook</i> strategy" aimed at courting the demographic group to which most of the readers of women's and family magazines belong. <i>Redbook</i> editor Kate White, in an article about "Why you're the White House's secret weapon," wrote that she was "flattered." But the magazines themselves, by promoting big government, had laid the groundwork for such a strategy to be successful. In doing so, they often misled their readers -- or didn't give them the whole story -- about the downside of government activism for women and families.<BR>
<p>
<P>
<b><h2>Part II: Scaring Women to Death</b></h2>
"Gender plays ... a powerful role in perception of hazards." That was the conclusion of Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis after the center polled more than 1,000 Americans to find out whether they believe in widely reported, but unproven, "hazards." Graham found that women were more likely to believe such scares were true by margins of 10 points or more, but he couldn't figure out why. "Some suggest that because women give birth, protect, and care for their children, they may naturally tend to be more nurturing than men, therefore they may be more concerned about hazards that may harm their families," Graham speculated. "Another possible explanation is that women are less familiar with science and technology than men, and are generally more fearful of it, especially in relation to nuclear power and chemicals." But Graham ended up concluding that "the role of gender in risk is more profound than can be explained by either the 'nurturing' or 'worldview' hypothesis" and that "more research is needed to understand why gender plays such a powerful role in perception of hazards." <BR>
<p>

One explanation Graham did not explore is that the reporting about risks in women's magazines may play a role in how women perceive those risks. After all, many women read these magazines not just for recipes and marriage advice but to receive important information about their own and their families' health. In a 1995 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, 80 percent of the female respondents said that women's magazines were a valuable source of information for them about nutrition. Overall, women's magazines ranked above TV news, newspaper articles, and even nurses as valuable sources of nutrition information. <BR>
<p>
 
Some advocacy groups already recognize that women's magazines can be a valuable ally in promoting their ideological agenda. In <I>Science Under Siege</i>, Michael Fumento reported that public relations agent David Fenton arranged interviews months in advance with magazines such as <I>Woman's Day</i> and <I>Redbook</i> to hype the scare he was orchestrating about the pesticide Alar that has now been widely discredited by respected scientists. The magazines readily complied with Fenton in 1989 with headlines such as "The Foods that Are Poisoning Your Child" (<I>Redbook</i>) and "Are Pesticides Poisoning  Our Children?" (<I>Woman's Day</i>)<BR>
<p>

Mainstream media outlets are not above running alarming stories about unproven risks either, but they usually give at least some space or air time to the other side. Articles in women's magazines, by contrast, frequently don't even acknowledge that there is another side. Many of the stories appear to be spoon-fed to the magazines by activists and go against mainstream science. Yet as the ADA survey suggests, women tend to trust these magazines more than any other type of media. The following examination of how these magazines -- <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I>, <I>Faily Circle</I>, <I>Glamour</I>, <I>Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Redbook, Weight Watchers and Woman's Day</I>  --  treat certain risk issues indicates that much of this trust is misplaced. (Two of the magazines surveyed, <I>Prevention</I> and <I>Working Woman</I>, did not report on the risk issues studied here.) <BR>
<p>

<B>Chemicals and Health Effects.</b> "One of the most overblown risks is that minute quantities of pesticide residues on food are related to human cancer," Harvard's Graham told <I>Weight Watchers</I> </I>(December 1995)  in one of the only articles to put this risk in perspective. Other articles, including one in <I>Weight Watchers</I> itself, indicate that these magazines seem to have learned very little in the seven years since the Alar scare. The National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific body in the U.S., recently concluded that most "synthetic chemicals appear to be present at levels below which any significant biologic effect is likely, and so low that they are unlikely  to pose an appreciable cancer risk." The NAS also pointed out that man-made pesticides are greatly outnumbered by natural pesticides plants make themselves, and that many of these natural chemicals have been found to be just as potent as the synthetic ones. <BR>
<p>

Nevertheless, according to Graham's poll, around 70 percent of women believe pesticides pose a hazard (compared with less than 60 percent of men), and an examination of this issue's coverage in women's magazines helps explain why. Of the 15 stories on claims of serious health effects from chemicals, eight of the stories were completely one-sided and mentioned no skeptical arguments against the claims. Three of the stories mentioned opposing arguments, but did so in a superficial manner. Only 4 out of the 15 articles were balanced in that they explored skeptical arguments in detail and tried to get to the scientific truth. <BR>
<p>

In an August 6 <I>Faily Circle</I> article entitled "Danger in the House," the author warns of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides that "pose potential health risks ranging from allergic reactions to cancer." The article mentions no scientists who question these risks nor does it mention what level of exposure is needed before these ill health effects occur (just about all substances, natural and artificial, are harmful at some level). And the author uses the flimsy anecdotal case of a mother who blamed garden pesticides sprayed in her neighborhood for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting (which could have had any number of causes), even though she didn't know what pesticides were being sprayed. The April <I>McCall's</I> ran a slightly less hysterical article on garden pesticides, but urged readers to contact the National Coalition Against the Issue of Pesticides, a radical environmental group that wants to ban pesticides even if they pose a very small risk. <BR>
<p>

<I>McCall's</I> (February 1996) and <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> (March 1996) warned of pesticide residues in baby food, and these articles also contained no arguments casting doubt on pesticides dangers, although <I>McCall's</I> did quote a doctor saying that "the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables are far, far greater than the risks." The article pointed out that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults, but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. The articles also recommend that parents buy more expensive organic baby food, without mentioning the natural pesticide residues that may be contained in these foods and pose the same (small) risk. <BR>
<p>

Three stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996), <I>Glamour</I> (April 1996), and <I>Weight Watchers</II> </I>(June 1996) that reported on the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer never mentioned that the largest study ever conducted found no correlation between that disease and synthetic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs. <I>Weight Watchers</I>  even condemned scientific studies that pointed to other possible causes such as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." <BR>
 <p>

The magazines that covered the newer chemical scare about "environmental estrogens" that allegedly affect reproductive health didn't fare much better. The two  stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996) and <I>Glamour </I>(April 1996) at least aired skeptical viewpoints but gave those opinions only a fraction of the space devoted to arguments for the scare. And both stories ignored important counter-arguments to some of the "facts" asserted by environmentalists. <I>Glamour</I>, for instance, did not report that the study that found declining sperm counts, a supposed effect of synthetic chemicals, had been severely criticized by many respected scientists and in an editorial in the very scientific journal that originally published it. <I>Mademoiselle</I> did mention in parentheses a new conflicting study that found that sperm counts have actually increased in the U.S. But the article did not mention how the new study casts doubts on the old study's finding of declining sperm counts by highlighting the geographic variation in sperm counts that the old study did not account for. Neither article mentioned that humans are exposed to far more natural estrogens from plants than to synthetic estrogen-licking chemicals. <BR>
<p>

The only story to mention pesticides' benefits in producing an affordable, abundant supply of fruits and vegetables was a July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that quoted an industry spokesman saying that he'd "rather take a chance on one ppb [parts per billion] in the food than on having no food at all." Unfortunately, the article then undercuts balance and accuracy by stating, without any evidence, that "concern about pesticide residue ... will become a moot point as the quality of organic produce continues to improve." This is wishful thinking. Agricultural experts such as the Hudson Institute's Dennis Avery, the former senior agricultural analyst for the U.S. Department of State, point out that crop yields from organic farms are typically less than half of those from conventional, high-yield farms, and that organic farms show no signs of catching up anytime soon. <BR>
<p>

The only two articles that critically examined chemical scares were stories in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (September) and <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I> (March) that pointed out the lack of scientific evidence behind claims that artificial sweeteners were harmful. An article in the January</II> <I>Glamour </I>that has dentists rate natural toothpastes also deserves kudos because it points out that natural isn't always good and artificial isn't always bad. The dentists note that many of the natural toothpastes lack fluoride, which provides the most vital protection against decay, and that  many of the toothpastes' natural ingredients such as baking soda and sea salt may wear down tooth enamel. <BR>
 <p>

On the bright side, the magazines proved very capable of putting minor health effects from food ingredients in perspective. Most of the nine articles on the fat substitute olestra were just as good, if not better, than those published in the mainstream media. Six stories were careful to mention that only some people get side effects such as diarrhea, and that olestra snacks are fortified with vitamins to make up for the nutrients that olestra inhibits the body from receiving from other foods. Two articles in <I>Weight Watchers </I>(March and June) went over the arguments of olestra's defenders superficially, and only one article was completely one-sided against olestra and this was clearly marked in <I>Woman's Day</I> (July 16) as an opinion piece. <I>McCall's</I> gave the most balanced coverage of all by noting  that the percentage of olestra snackers suffering side effects in studies was virtually the same as that of the non-olestra snackers suffering side effects. All three stories on the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate reported that most people don't suffer allergic reactions to it. <BR>
<p>

<B>Drinking Water/ Chlorine.</b> Women's magazines also featured many warnings about unsafe drinking water. Unless she were to read one balanced article about risks in the April 23 <I>Woman's Day</I>, a subscriber to these magazines would likely never know that "the American water supply is one of the safest in the world, and outbreaks of contamination ... are very rare." This was the only balanced article of the six articles that dealt with water. The other five were scare-mongering stories that did not even present another side to their points of view. <BR>
 <p>

With titles like "What's in your water?" and "Troubled waters," these articles usually couldn't see the algae for the lake. They vastly overstated drinking water's risks and failed to distinguish the real risks in water systems. For instance, articles in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(November 1995), <I>Parents</I> (March), and <I>Mademoiselle</I> (September) uncritically reported an alarmist study by the Environmental Working Group about agricultural pesticide runoff in water and treated pesticides as if they were as serious a problem as cryptosporidium and other waterborne bacteria. But as agricultural expert Avery has written, "The fact is that field application of pesticides is not contaminating drinking water. The only pesticide residues exceeding good health standards in recent EPA and state surveys have been from known pollution sites." <BR>
<p>

One of the most ironic aspects of the water stories is that they routinely bash chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine is the chemical that provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. Bizarre as it may seem, while the World Health Organization pursues chlorination of the world's drinking water systems as one of its top priorities, the July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> suggests that Americans stop putting chlorine in their pools! A subheading in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> asked, "Is chlorine bad for you?" <I>Mademoiselle</I> charged that "chlorine, normally a water safety hero because it kills most bacteria, produces cancer-causing by-products." <I>Good Housekeeping </I>did at least quote a scientist who says, "The risk of microbial contamination far outweighs the smaller increased risk of cancer." Yet none of the stories illustrated the risk of not using chlorine by informing readers what happened after Peru stopped chlorinating its water in the early '80s: a cholera epidemic that so far has killed 10,000 people. <BR>
<p>

As for the possible cancer risks of chlorine by-products, the award-winning cancer researcher Bruce Ames of the University of California-Berkeley (who, incidentally, was not quoted in any of the articles) points out that at the levels humans are exposed to, chlorine by-products in tap and swimming pool water are less carcinogenic than peanut butter, which contains the mold aflatoxin. <BR>
<p>

The story that the magazines all issued is that because the federal government issues top-down regulations that cost municipalities up to $37 billion a year (according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute) in chasing small risks such as pesticides and chlorine by-products, the municipalities often don't have the resources or the flexibility to fully pursue larger local risks like cryptosporidium. <BR>
<p>

<B>Passive Smoke.</b> In Graham's survey, almost 80 percent of women believed that environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoke was a serious health hazard, compared with slightly over 60 percent of men who believed this was so. Judging from the coverage of this issue in women's magazines, this may be another case where women's perceptions may be shaped or reinforced by the periodicals they read. Of five articles that covered the alleged health risk of passive smoke, only one featured any skeptical arguments. A December, 1995 <I>Weight Watchers</I> article proclaimed, "Mindful of secondhand-smoke risks, many cities are banning smoking in public places," without ever questioning if the risks were real. An April 23 <I>Woman's Day </I>article entitled "Health Scares: Real or Not" that did a good job of deflating other scares such as dirty water, uncritically accepts the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) estimate that passive smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. It is only in a four-page <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that a skeptical view is even presented, and this article spends just two paragraphs quoting a Tobacco Institute spokesman who criticized the EPA and said passive smoke risks are "not even slight." <BR>
<p>

However, none of these articles gave readers a clue that it is not just tobacco industry spokesmen who question the EPA's findings on passive smoke. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service, for one, has concluded that "the statistical record does not appear to support a conclusion that there are substantial health effects of passive smoking." The CRS noted that under circumstances of conventional studies, the EPA's finding "is not statistically significant."  Steve Milloy, president of the Environmental Policy Analysis Network, have noted that even the risk the EPA did find (1.19) is so tiny that some experts don't even consider it a real risk. He notes that there are higher correlations between yogurt and ovarian cancer (2), whole ilk and lung cancer (2.14), and abortion and breast cancer (1.5), than there is between passive smoke and lung cancer. <BR>
<p>

The September <I>Parents</I> ran a one-sided article entitled "Smoking is Child Abuse" that blames passive smoke for a number of childhood illnesses. It quotes Dr. Joseph DiFranza as saying, "A judge should know whether an adult seeking custody of a youngster smokes, so the child isn't placed in an unhealthy environment." However, the article does not note that even DiFranza has acknowledged in a medical journal article that not all studies show these effects. Some researchers also question the notion that passive smoke could cause an illness such as middle ear disease when smoking itself has never been found to cause this illness. An article presenting both sides suggesting caution when smoking around children would have been appropriate, but this article is too one-sided and alarmist in the face of uncertain scientific research. <BR>
<p>

<b>Recycling.</b> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out of 15 articles that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. A statement typical of the philosophy of these articles came from an article in the June <I>Better Homes & Gardens</II> </I>that showcased products such as a yardbird made from old garden tools. The article said, "For recycling to be successful, consumers must make the process profitable for manufacturers by purchasing products made from recycled materials." But should manufacturers make recycled products if they're not profitable? Some reporters in the mainstream media are now breaking a taboo and asking this question. An article in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> said that recycling not only is more costly than landfilling, it also is sometimes "a messy way to try to help the environment" and has environmental costs associated with it, citing examples of energy wasted by additional garbage trucks that have to pick up recycled materials. <BR>
<p>

<b>Alcohol.</b> One area where women's magazines have a better record at reporting on  comparative risks is in articles weighing the health benefits of moderate drinking against the hazards of excess drinking. An article in <I>McCall's </I>(May) and two in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(May and September) reported on the announcement in Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines that moderate consumption of alcohol can lower the risk of heart disease. The articles note, however, that drinking can be hazardous with medications, during pregnancy, or in excess. Unfortunately, another article in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (August 1996) focuses on the "overlooked dangers" alcohol poses to women without mentioning its health benefits. And a "To Do" article in the January <I>Weight Watchers</I> on hangovers ended by saying, "And remember: Alcohol is a drug, so it's best not to drink in the first place." <BR>
  <p>

<b>Nannyism.</b> The biggest risk issues women's magazine take on have to do with household products. Frequently, there are articles that give good advice about how to select the safest products for children and how to monitor children using these products. However, there is a disturbing tendency in seven articles for the authors to act as a national nanny and preach to readers what they should and shouldn't buy. Articles in <I>Woman's Day</I> (June 4 and Aug. 6) tell mothers not to allow guns to be kept in the house. <I>Woman's Day</I> (Feb. 1) and <I>Parents</I> (March) tell moms not to let kids play with BB guns. In these cases, the authors are not serving their readers by informing of risks, they are crossing the line into substituting their value judgments for those of their readers. Many of these articles also fail to point out that the product isn't as much of a danger as is the lack of parental supervision. For instance, a June 4 <I>Woman's Day</I> article recommended that parents not buy baby walkers because they injured 25,000 children each year. But the article failed to note that according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, over 20,000 children who are not in baby walkers also are injured falling down the stairs each year. A much better article on how to manage risks comes from August <I>Parents</I>. The article describes a possible hazard that may occur when lead in imported miniblinds  breaks down into dust particles and children lick the blinds. But it quotes someone who points out that this can be taken care of by washing the blinds yearly. <BR>
<P> 
<B><I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>'s Valuable Advice.</B> This study reviewed 56 mentions of science and risk issues. Of those, 35 -- more than half -- were completely one-sided and did not even acknowledge a skeptical view. Six include an opposing view but gave it much less ink and discussed it superficially. Only 15 were balanced articles that put risks in perspective by reference to scientific findings.  Clearly, women and families have enough to worry about and don't need new, baseless fears added to their burden. Indeed, many women would be interested in articles that report how much government regulations for tiny risks cost them and their families. The Small Business Administration places the costs of regulation at almost $7000 per household. This cost is passed on to women and families in terms of higher prices and less competition and product innovation. <BR>
<P>
The article that, by far, provided the best overall coverage of health and science issues appeared in the March issue of <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>. In that article, Alfred Sommer, dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at  Johns Hopkins University, gave some guidelines to help readers evaluate health claims. Judging from the quality of their articles on risk issues, women's magazine writers should learn some of Sommer's tips as well: <BR>
<P>
"Keep in mind that each study is a piece of a bigger puzzle. View each new finding as an update rather than the final word." <BR>
<P>
"Remember that most studies highlight an association between a behavior characteristic and a health outcome, not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship." <BR>
<P>
"Even when an association between a particular behavior and a health risk is found it doesn't mean one leads to the other." <BR>
<P>
"Finally, consider the size and duration of the study (the larger it is and the longer it ran, the more dependable its findings) and the source of the report." <BR>

<BR>
Reporters consider most risky products newsworthy, but tobacco gets far more coverage than any other risky 
product, including such illegal drugs as cocaine and marijuana. This is one conclusion of a special year-long, 
two-part study of news coverage of risky products. The study, conducted by the Media Research Center's Free
Market Project, analyzes network morning and evening news shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. 
The study found:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Tobacco as a risk problem is overemphasized.</B></a><BR> Tobacco and smoking were the subject of 413 news stories, compared to 136 stories for obesity/fatty foods, 94 for auto safety, and 58 for alcohol. Tobacco even drew more coverage than cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined, which were the subjects of 340 stories.
<P>
<LI><B> The media have allowed the Clinton Administration to use tobacco as a political weapon.</B> </a><BR>President Clinton was the driving force behind a good deal of the tobacco news. Eighty-five stories focused on his efforts to regulate tobacco. Only 45 of the stories about illegal drugs mentioned Clinton, and almost all of these references were positive.
<P>
<LI><B>There is a double standard in coverage of tobacco as a political issue. </B></a><BR>Jack Kemp's flip-flops on affirmative action and immigration were noted in five evening news stories during the 1996 Republican Convention. Al Gore's tobacco flip-flop -- politically exploiting his sister's smoking-related death after having boasted in 1988 about his tobacco farming history -- didn't receive any evening news coverage during the Democratic Convention.
<P>
<LI><B> Anti-tobacco sources far exceed pro-tobacco sources in terms of both quality and quantity.</B></a><BR> Reporters ran soundbites from 270 anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources, compared to 116 from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. They also gave anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources the last word in 132 stories, compared to only 40 for the other side.

<I>Reporters should be skeptical of both the tobacco industry and anti-smoking activists. Currently, they are 
skeptical of only one side -- the tobacco industry. And they should ask themselves: Is tobacco really more

<H3><CENTER>Part I: Tobacco Versus Other Risky Products</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Consumers face risks when they choose to buy and consume certain products. But the news media do not treat all of those risks the same. Tobacco, especially, receives far more total coverage with a far more negative tone than does every other risky product.
This is the finding of a special year-long Media Research Center study of news coverage of risky products and the industries which make and sell them. For the study, Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky products on the morning and evening news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as CNN's World News and World Today shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage by far than any other risky legal product or its maker, such as dietary fat and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry. Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well, even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign.

<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be life-threatening, or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former. Over the twelve-month study period television news has devoted significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
There were 413 stories during the twelve-month study period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite well-documented rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few years, notably among teenagers. It should be noted, too, that many of the stories about illegal drugs were brief anchor-reads about, for instance, the status of football star Michael Irvin's drug trial, not rising drug use.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American newspapers found that the terms "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" were employed 9,067 times between during the study period. Over the same time period, however, the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" were used only 3,875 times. In other words, there were more than twice as many stories focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal drugs.

President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the map. Eighty-five of the television news tobacco stories were about the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry. Almost all of these stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry, portraying him as courageously taking on a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced on the August 11, 1995 Today that "in a historic move the Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers." According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning, "President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco lobby."
<P>
But when the issue was the increased use of illegal drugs, Clinton Administration officials were only mentioned in 45 stories, and most of these references were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals that there were 1,819 stories between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996 that had "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" in the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the story. Stories with the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" in the headline and a reference to Clinton in the body of the story numbered only 204.
<P>
This media's obvious distaste for tobacco continued after the study period and affected campaign coverage as the 1996 presidential contest heated up. Normally, when a politician radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance, there were five network evening news stories during the 1996 Republican National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the Republican vice-presidential candidate. 
<P>
"The quarterback became the acrobat today," reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August 14, 1996 World News Tonight. "Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She noted that these changes "left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned" and that "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker." According to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration." Rather wondered: "Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?"
<P>
But these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco crusade. None of the networks pointed out that in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that "throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and sold it." There were no stories on the evening news shows during the convention about Gore's change of heart. The same reporters who derided Kemp for changing positions on immigration and affirmative action didn't find Gore's flip-flop on tobacco at all newsworthy.
<P>
<a name="fat">

<BR>
 <H4> Tobacco and Fat</H4>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was an even greater disparity between the number of stories on tobacco and the number on other legal products. On television -- during the same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco -- there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; 94 stories focused on auto safety; only 58 stories were related to alcohol and health.
<P>
The disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000 deaths in the U.S. per year. It would stand to reason, then, that there would be about three-fourths the number of stories on fat and obesity as there were about tobacco. There weren't.
<P>
Reporters acknowledged the riskiness of obesity and dietary fat. "Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country," NBC's Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. "It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS' Jacqueline Adams reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<P>
One reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one high-fat meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. McKenzie told viewers about a University of Marylyand study  in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<P>
While reporters acknowledged this riskiness, they didn't give the risk of obesity and dietary fat nearly the same amount of coverage they gave to tobacco. There were only about one-fourth the number of stories about obesity and fat as there were stories about tobacco, even though obesity contributes to three-fourths as many deaths each year as tobacco.
<P>
<a name="complain">

<H4>Complaints Against Tobacco</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was also a different standard of judgment for the industries that make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured. There were no stories, for example, about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol. But the networks were all critical of tobacco advertising and campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society of smoking-related illnesses.
<P>
In stories about advertising, the assumption was clear: Cunning tobacco advertising entices unwitting youngsters into lifelong addiction to tobacco. ABC's Nancy Snyderman, for instance, reported "that 12-18 year-olds are in fact most influenced by [tobacco] advertising...and obviously we know that the earlier you smoke, the more addicted you are, the harder it is to break. So I think it's one more indication that advertising works."
<P>
But there are those both inside and outside the tobacco and advertising industries who question how effective -- and how constitutional -- proposed regulations on tobacco advertising could be. "How will banning tobacco ads possibly discourage smoking?" asked columnist James K. Glassman in the August 27, 1996 Washington Post. "LSD use rose 183 percent between 1992 and 1995, and I haven't seen any LSD ads recently." Such arguments were rarely heard on television news.
<P>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<P>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27, 1996 CBS Evening News, told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On the same night, NBC's Bob Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." Industry -- especially tobacco industry -- contributions were all reporters cared about. The political contributions of trial lawyers or unions sparked little media interest.
<P>
Second-hand smoke was the focus of twelve stories. Reporters were much more likely to cover studies showing that second-hand smoke leads to health problems in non-smokers than they were to cover studies which questioned such data. Example: A November 14, 1995 Congressional Research Service study, while not declaring passive smoke to be safe, questioned some of the numbers put forward by second-hand smoke critics. The number of stories on the CRS study -- zero.
<P>
Reporters often mistook experts on health and medicine for experts on public policy. Bob Kur, on the April 9, 1996 Today, introduced viewers to a doctor who studied the effects of second-hand smoke on children. Kur didn't show any skepticism toward the doctor when he recommended that "smoking be banned wherever children are present and even suggests smoking be considered in child custody cases and foster home placements. With tobacco under increasing assault, [Dr.] DiFranza also believes a study like his could prompt a class-action lawsuit on behalf of children." Kur didn't allow other views into his story, such as the view that separating children from their smoking parents is a bit extreme or the view that much tobacco litigation is frivolous.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more stories on tobacco than on other legal risky products, but they have allowed the Clinton administration to use smoking to deflect public attention from rising illegal drug use. Responsible reporters should not ignore tobacco, but they should not apply to it a standard which is harsher even than the standard they apply to illegal drugs.

<H3><CENTER>Part II: Sources</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
One subtle, but powerful, form of bias in the media has to do with selection and placement of soundbites from sources. The most obvious display of source bias is when reporters interview or use sources only from one side of an issue. Sometimes, however, a story is biased even when reporters have conscientiously produced soundbites from both sides. One side may consistently get the last word in a story, thereby giving it an edge. Or reporters may interview sources from one side that will be credible in the eyes of viewers and less credible sources from the other. In the case of tobacco reporting during the year-long study period, every one of these biases was present.
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<a name="number">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Number of Soundbites</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#content">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 In stories about tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions from tobacco companies, and second-hand smoke, there were more than twice as many soundbites from those opposed to the tobacco industry than from those either supporting tobacco or opposing government regulation. In such stories, there were 270 soundbites from anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources. There were only 116 soundbites from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. In many stories, only anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were presented.
<P>
Example: The introductory story for the May 23, 1996 CBS Evening News. The story was about a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry that had just been thrown out of court and a new study which indicated that smoking had increased among young blacks. Correspondent Jim Stewart's story included a soundbite about the lawsuit from John Banzhaf, an anti-smoking activist, who said: "I think this is a significant setback for the victims, but it is not a reprieve for the tobacco industry. We'll simply bring the cases in state court rather than federal court." He also interviewed Rep. John Lewis about tobacco sales to black teens. "I think there has been a deliberate, systematic effort on the part of the tobacco industry to target black teenagers." Stewart noted that many blamed advertising for the increase in smoking. He didn't make room in his story for comments from those who think tobacco lawsuits are frivolous, or from those who think advertising doesn't explain teen smoking behavior.
<a name="word">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Getting the Last Word</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The last soundbite in a story is often the most important. The exeprt who is quoted last often gets the chance to refute the best argument presented from the other side. In the stories about tobacco, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the opportunity to speak last more than three times as often pro-tobacco or anti-regulation sources. In 132 stories, most of which were about either lawsuits or proposed regulations, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the last word. In 40 stories, pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources were given the last word.
<P>
In one typical story, CBS's Bill Plante first ran a soundbite from Bill Clinton arguing that further regulation of tobacco is necessary because "cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are harmful, highly addictive, and aggressively marketed to our young people." He then ran a soundbite from "tobacco-state lawmaker" Wendell Ford, who said: "The administration has chosen litigation over compromise." Plante's next soundbite was from Clinton arguing that voluntary measures won't work: "First of all, there'd be no way to enforce it. Secondly, the history of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry is not good, to put it mildly." Steve Parrish of Philip Morris, then told viewers: "Make no mistake, the real issue and the real agenda here is prohibition." Plante's final soundbite was from FDA Commissioner David Kessler, who said the issue was solely about children: "If you don't start smoking by 18 or 19, you don't start smoking."
<P>
In each case, Plante let soundbites from Clinton Administration sources counter whatever arguments anti-regulation spokesmen brought up, without giving the anti-regulation side the same courtesy.
<a name="credible">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Credibility of Sources</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
In the stories about tobacco, television news reporters almost always went to anti-smoking sources that would likely be more credible in the eyes of viewers than the sources interviewed on the pro-tobacco/anti-regulation side. An August 3, 1995 CNN World News story about President Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry is an example. Correspondent Wolf Blitzer first ran a soundbite from President Clinton, who asserted that the best way to improve the health and health care of Americans is to stop teen smoking.
<P>
Then Blitzer ran a soundbite from George Dessart of the American Cancer Society. "Trusting the tobacco industry to set and enforce the same limits voluntarily," argued Dessart, "flies in the face of the industry's record, of its best interests, and of its motives." Blitzer then allowed the Tobacco Institute's Walker Merryman a chance to respond: "If the Food & Drug Administration gets involved in tobacco regulation there can be only one result, and that's a ban on the product." Finally, Blitzer ran a soundbite from North Carolina Representative Charlie Rose, who asked, "Why not take the word of the cigarette companies that they will join in a government partnership to keep tobacco products away from kids?"
<P>
Is this balance? Blitzer interviewed two sources from each side of the regulatory debate, and he even gave an anti-regulation congressman the last word. But both of those featured on the anti-regulation side of the debate had a personal interest in opposing regulations. This, of course, didn't make what they had to say wrong, but it certainly would taint their opinions in the eyes of viewers, unlike the source affiliated with the American Cancer Society. Blitzer should have also interviewed an expert, perhaps from a university psychology or marketing department, who would have questioned the efficacy of regulations on advertising.
<P>
In some cases reporters cannot be expected to find credible sources on both sides. For example, balance does not require reporters to find and interview scientists who claim that smoking is not risky behavior. But on such issues as tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions by the tobacco industry, and second-hand smoke, there is a real debate with independent experts arguing, for instance, against the regulation of tobacco and against lawsuits aimed at the tobacco industry.
<P>
Usually the only people opposing tobacco regulations who were interviewed were those with a vested interest in stopping regulations, such as tobacco-industry spokesmen or tobacco-state politicians. Such sources should be interviewed. But they are not the only ones who oppose increased regulation. Other disinterested experts should be interviewed as well. Reporters who don't interview credible experts on both sides of such issues are not giving their viewers the entire story.

<p></center>
In every recent presidential election the media have tilted their coverage toward the liberal nominee. One poll by the  <!--a href="/may96pg1.html"-->Freedom Forum found 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Bill Clinton in '92. 
<p>
We fully expect the media to again portray Congressional Republicans as out-of-touch extremists and the Democratic incumbents as mainstream moderates. 
<p>
The Democrats will portray themselves as the last defense against a takeover of the presidency and Congress by far-right extremists out to destroy 
the environment, starve the poor, and throw the elderly on the
 streets.
  The media will let them get away with this by failing to highlight Clinton's liberal policies. 
<p>
To neutralize this bias, the MRC launched a $2.8 million effort to expose liberal media bias during the 1996 election campaign. Read <a href="/mrc/reality/pcspeech.html">Chairman L. Brent Bozell's</a> speech.
<p>
<a href="/mrc/reality/realchek.html">Media Reality Check '96</a> will counter the media's liberal spin through our comprehensive media database of network news stories, our newsletters 
<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/welcome.html"><b>MediaWatch</b></a>, 
<a href="/mrc/nq/welcome.html"><b>Notable Quotables</b></a>, and 
<a href="/mrc/medianomics/welcome.html"><b>MediaNomics</b></a>, and our new book 
<a href="/mrc/bookstore/welcome.html"><b>Pattern of Deception</b></a>
, proving the media's pro-Clinton bias. 
<p>
In addition, several new projects are now or will soon be available on-line:
<p><ul>
<li>Two-page Media Reality Check '96 updates will be periodically 
sent via <a href="/mrc/reality/pressrel.html"><b>Fax Reports</b></a>
 to a list of over 1,500 media, political, public policy and grassroots contacts around the country, documenting examples of biased coverage and detailing study results proving bias.
<p>
<li>A daily <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/conv96.html"><b> Media Reality Check</b></a> newsletter to be distributed to delegates, talk show hosts, and reporters at the Republican Convention in San Diego and the Democratic Convention in Chicago. Through e-mail, faxes and on-site delivery in San Diego, we'll get our evidence distributed to talk show hosts, columnists, editorial writers, and reporters across the country.
 <p>
<li><a href="/mrc/cyberalert/welcome.html"><b>CyberAlerts</b></a> on campaign bias: Several times a week we'll deliver e-mail alerts on the latest biased quotes and trends to reporters, talk show hosts, columnists, and conservative activists. To sign up for CyberAlerts, send your e-mail address to <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">mrc@mediaresearch.org</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Press releases</b> will announce study findings, provide our reaction to bias as it occurs, and give warning shots to reporters before major events, telling them how to avoid biased coverage. 
<p>
<li><b>Convention Guide to the Media</b> will be distributed at the conventions to show through past quotes which reporters have been naughty or nice. 
<p>
<li><b>MRC Merchandise</b>: Bumper stickers, pens and magnets boldly displaying our message "I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media!" will be distributed to delegates at the national conventions and to the public.

<center><h1>The Media's Coverage of Election Night '96</h1></center>
<P>
<P>
<I><B>November 6, 1996:  MRC analysts are working furiously to get you the latest liberal bias spouted by the media on election night and during the post-election coverage.  MRC <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/">CyberAlerts</a>, studies, and reports will soon be released. Until then, here's the tip of the iceberg of the Election Night '96 coverage:</I></B><P>
<P>
<P>

NBC <I>Today</I>'s Matt Lauer to RNC Chairman Haley Barbour, 11/6/96:<BR>  
"Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last night.  And although character and trust play a role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues.  With that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White House?"<BR>
<P>

CBS<I> This Morning</I>'s Troy Roberts, 11/6/96: <BR> 
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old revolution that changed the face of Congress.  The party retains control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about its leader..."<BR>
<P>

ABC's David Brinkley talking to Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, Hal Bruno and Peter Jennings during the final minutes of <I>The '96 Vote</I>, 11/6/96: <BR>
"OK, fine, I'm not going to say much.  Among things I admire, almost near the top is creativeness, and everyone in this group has it.  It shows in your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one reason this group is so terrific.  Bill Clinton has none of it, he has not a creative bone in his body.  Therefore, he's a bore and will always be a bore."<BR>
<P>
<P>
More coverage coming soon!  <BR>

<center><h1> Statement of L. Brent Bozell III <BR>
Chairman, Media Research Center </h1></center>
<center><h3> <a href="http://www.conservative.org">ACU Press Conference</a><BR>
November 6, 1996</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
	In 1990 a group of conservative leaders - some present today - publicly predicted George Bush would lose his campaign for re-election because his administration had abandoned the mission of the Reagan revolution.  As the '92 campaign unfolded , and the lackluster, issue-less Bush campaign limped through the summer and fall, it became evident our prediction would be correct.<BR>
<P>

	Bob Dole had two diametrically opposite strategies to choose from this year.  Follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan with a conservative agenda outlining not just a vision of, but a specific agenda for, a limited government, a strong national defense and a commitment to family values - a strategy that led to two landslide elections; or follow in the footsteps of Bush, with  no vision,  and virtually no message.  It was stunning to see Dole for months reject the Reagan message, and adopt the Bush non-agenda.  And when, in the final days, he decided to move to the right, Dole, like Bush in '92, closed the gap.  But like Bush in '92, it was too little too late. <BR>
<P>

	Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  Santayana would have made for a good political pundit this year. <BR>
<P>

	But there was another similarity.  In both campaigns, the GOP nominee made the same terrible miscalculation, assuming the national media, particularly the networks, would report on the elections in a fair and balanced manner. <BR>
<P>

	In 1992, Bill Clinton presented himself to America as a "New Democrat" and embraced a strongly conservative agenda in his campaign.  It was a farce, and those who knew this man's record said so.  The media, however, were silently, refusing to expose the charade - and no one was surprised when Clinton immediately launched a left-wing agenda in 1993, abandoning promise after campaign promise.  Also in 1992, reporters, contrary to the conventional mythology perpetrated by so many in the press, barely touched numerous Clinton scandals; some, like Whitewater, were ignored completely by the networks throughout the entirety of the campaign. <BR>
<P>

	Remarkably, Clinton pulled it off again this year.  After his Big Government agenda was so decisively rejected after two years, Clinton announced the era of Big Government was dead - and then took responsibility for it.  What followed in this campaign was dishonesty after dishonestly, twisting the facts, distorting the truth, even claiming on national television to stand in favor of issue after issue that he had, in fact, actively opposed!  But what made this situation even worse, the so-called Truth Squads in the media, again particularly on the networks, simply took a pass, and refused to expose the dishonesty. <BR>
<P>
 

	But where the coverage of ethical scandals was concerned, the record this year from the networks was simply abominable.  At this moment the Media Research Center is analyzing every single network news story in the past four years to determine how many Clinton scandals, or major developments within them, were completely ignored by the networks, either on their evening news or their morning news programs.  Having seen the initial data, I can tell you that when this report is released in a couple of weeks, the American public will be absolutely shocked at the sheer number of scandals covered up by the networks. <BR>
<P>

	The next few months will tell the story.  If in that period Clinton delivers on his campaign promises - tax cuts, a balanced budget, reduced federal government, a strong national defense, a ban on partial birth abortions,  support for the institution of marriage, school choice; and if the literally dozens of scandals swirling around this administration in general, and the Clintons in particular, all prove to be groundless as this administration contends, then there really is a Tooth Fairy.  But if Clinton returns to his left-wing agenda while the indictments begin to fly, no one standing here will be shocked; and the American public is going to demand to know why the networks did not report what they knew was going to happen.  I will be one of those demanding an answer. <BR>
<P>

<h2>MEDIA REALITY CHECK BLAST</h2>


Whitewater: The Story Reporters Loved to Hate
<p>

ALEXANDRIA, VA. &#173;&#173; In a study of nearly three months of network and news magazine coverage, the Media Research Center found that despite the suggestion that
the national media's only bias is in favor of &quot;a good story,&quot; the Whitewater story &#173;&#173; indictments, convictions, Senate hearings, and all &#173;&#173; is still the story reporters love to hate. The lack of coverage is matched by the disparaging tone members of the media have displayed toward Whitewater over the past few months. A representative sampling of these follows on page two.
<p>

First, among the study findings:<p>

From February 29 to May 20, the four TV evening news shows aired only 23 reporter&#173;based stories on Whitewater in more than 11 weeks. Only 13 reports came from the Big Three, compared to ten stories on CNN's The World Today.
Eleven of the 23 stories focused on the President's testimony.
<p>
The most stunning lack of coverage came from NBC Nightly News, which aired only one reporter&#173;based story in the entire 11 weeks &#173;&#173; on May 9.
<p>
The three network morning shows aired only 14 reporter&#173;based stories and five interviews in 11 weeks. Again, much of the coverage (nine of the 14 stories and
two of the five interviews) concerned Clinton's testimony.
<p>
None of the magazine shows covered the trial &#173;&#173; but then, from 1992 forward, all of the magazine shows combined have aired only two reporter&#173;based stories
on Whitewater. 
<p>
Although Time carried a long cover story excerpting James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood Sport, the news magazines devoted fewer pages to the Whitewater trial than they
did to the Jackie Onassis auction. In their May 6 editions, Time made the auction their cover story and gave it eight pages, Newsweek devoted six pages, U.S. News, two.

<p>
Some significant stories the networks barely or never covered: 

<p>
On February 29 and again on March 7, Senate Democrats blocked votes extending the tenure of the Senate Whitewater Committee. The Democrats held up further hearings until agreeing to a deal on April 18. One reporter&#173;based story on ABC's World News Tonight (and anchor briefs on ABC's Good Morning America and CNN) were the only coverage of the Democratic filibuster until the hearings resumed April 24.
<p>
On March 15, a federal appeals court removed Judge Henry Woods from a related case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and reinstated four fraud counts struck down by Woods,
finding the judge was too close to the Clintons. Despite several network stories and an entire Nightline on the credibility of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the networks never covered the Woods story.                        
<p>
On March 24, an ABC News/Washington Post poll announced 52 percent of respondents believed the First Lady was not telling the truth about Whitewater and 49 percent said
they believe she acted illegally. While the Post published the poll, buried on page A16, ABC never reported it. 

<p>
When word leaked on April 29 that the FBI found Hillary Clinton's fingerprints on the long&#173;missing Rose Law Firm documents discovered in the White House, it drew
only four anchor&#173;read briefs.Second, there's a good reason why Whitewater has received so little coverage: Many reporters don't think it's worth covering or that it's been over covered.
<p>
Check out these recent quotes:
<p>
On Friday's Washington Week in Review (May 24) on PBS they discussed the RNC ad attacking Clinton for invoking the Soldier and Sailors' Act, prompting New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman to note the ad was created &quot;Right when Whitewater seems to be grinding to a halt as a legal issue.&quot; A few minutes later, moderator Ken Bode (also a CNN analyst), offered his view of why Republicans decided to run the ad: &quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of fading away, it's kind of a shadowy
thing now, it's going away.&quot; 
<p>
Steve Roberts of U.S. News &amp; World Report, on C&#173;SPAN's Washington Journal, May 16: &quot;This kind of call which says, 'You're all liberals,' haven't been listening, they haven't been reading. Anybody, anybody, it seems to me, who
gives a fair reading, Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton. The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one example and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate and should be there.&quot;

<p>
Time columnist Margaret Carlson and U.S. News &amp; World Report Editor&#173;in&#173;Chief Mort Zuckerman on CNBC's Cal Thomas show, March 24, 1996: 
<p>
Carlson: &quot;It's [Whitewater] out there, it's been out there, it's not going to have any more impact than it's already having.&quot; 
<p>
Zuckerman: &quot;I don't think there's anything there unless Kenneth Starr does come up with anything, and the fact that there is a trial going on I think is not going to be relevant to what the elections going to be all about, you can't run an election based on attacking the President's wife.&quot;

<p>
Eleanor Clift of Newsweek on The McLaughlin Group, February 10, 1996: &quot;If Ken Starr is a credible prosecutor he will bring this to a conclusion and the Clintons will be exonerated.&quot;

<p>
Margaret Carlson, Time magazine columnist and former White House reporter, on CNN's Capital Gang, December 23, 1995: &quot;As the curtains keep getting lifted there's nothing there! There's no big, you know, there's no big smoking gun. There's no magilla! And they keep going and not finding anything.&quot;

<i>Tuesday, February 4, 1997 (Vol. Two; No. 12)</i>
</center>
<p>  
<hr width=10% align=center>
<CENTER><I>MRC Alert: Nets Play Catch-Up; Broder from the Left; Clinton the Forgiver?</I></CENTER>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1"> Monday night ABC and CBS aired Democratic fundraising stories
highlighting information reported in newspapers weeks or months
earlier.</A>
<li><a href="#2"> Washington Post reporter David Broder's plea to the Governor of
NH: "Are the kids not worth having a sales tax or an income tax?"</a>
<li><a href="#3"> NBC's Today suggests that Bill Clinton is popular because he
"forgives and accepts" the public's excesses and frailties.</a>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) The networks keep playing catch-up on Clinton scandals
reported weeks or months ago in the print media. World News
Tonight, which still hasn't uttered a syllable on the White House
database story, Monday night devoted two pieces to Democratic
fundraising. First, Linda Douglass reported how top Clinton aide
Harold Ickes sent a memo to a potential donor suggesting how he
direct his promised $5 million donation.
<p>
<dd>
Second, John Donvan took viewers through the developing coffee
meetings story. He noted: "Now there are questions about how some
of the guests at these and other functions ever got through the
White House gates. The Clinton administration appears to have
dropped screening procedures used by the Reagan and Bush White
Houses to keep the wrong sorts of people from getting in. People
like Eric Wynn, a stock promoter reported this weekend to be
linked to the Bonanno crime family and who served two years in
prison for securities fraud. Others include, Wang Jun, one of
China's leading arms merchants, Gregory Loutchansky, head of a
company said to be tied to the Russian mafia. And Jorge Cabrera
who was convicted of drug charges after contributing $20,00 to the
Democratic Party..."
<p>
<dd>
Not exactly groundbreaking revelations, except to ABC viewers.
While World News Tonight did air a story on Cabrera last October,
they ignored the others when uncovered by other outlets:
<br>
<dd>
-- Eric Wynn's role was revealed in the February 1 Washington
Post, but not reported by ABC that night.
<br>
<dd>
-- Wang Jun's attendance became known on December 20 and Bill
Clinton was asked about it at a press conference that day. World
News Tonight: no story. On January 29 The Washington Times
discovered that on the day Wang Jun visited the White House the
man who helped him get a U.S. visa donated $50,000 to the DNC.
World News Tonight: no story.
<br>
<dd>
-- Gregory Loutchansky's attendance was uncovered by the
Associated Press on November 3. World News Tonight: no mention.
<p>
<dd>
On the CBS Evening News Monday night (February 3), Phil Jones
offered a lengthy piece on John Huang's possible involvement in
economic espionage as he got numerous top secret briefings and
maintained his security clearance months after he left the
Commerce Department. Of course, these charges weren't reported by
CBS when raised in the January 16 Los Angeles Times and January 30
Washington Times. 
<p>
<dd>
Continuing its policy of shying away from Democratic scandal
stories, Monday's NBC Nightly News didn't include a fundraising
story.
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) Sunday's Meet the Press (February 2) featured the
nation's two female Governors. Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New
Hampshire and Republican Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey are
from different parties, but Washington Post reporter David Broder
pressed them both from the same platform -- a liberal one. 
<br>
<dd>
Broder's first question: "Governor Shaheen, you've said that
you want kindergarten available for every child in your state. And
you're proposing to finance it with higher cigarette taxes and
more gambling in the state. I guess you have to do that because
you've locked yourself away from calling for any sales tax or
income tax in New Hampshire. Are the kids not worth having a sales
tax or an income tax?"
<br>
<dd>
Broder's second question: "Governor Whitman, welfare, big
issue for Governors and you've won the big battle because you now
are in control of it. I noticed in one of the news stories about
your new budget that you're proposing to cut county welfare
authorities by ten million dollars. Those are the folks who
actually deal face to face with welfare clients. Now they are
supposed to be the ones who help move those people off welfare,
into jobs. Why in the world would you be cutting their money?"
<p>
<dd>
Note it's "their" money, not the taxpayer's.
<p>
<dd>
Broder's third question went again to Whitman: "I read in the
paper this morning that you had backed off now on asking Congress
to re-open the welfare bill to take care of legal immigrants, who
they are now cutting off. Why would you back off of that?"
<p>
<dd>
You get the idea. But Broder isn't the only Post staffer upset
by welfare reform. E.J. Dionne, a former New York Times and
Washington Post reporter who now pens a column for the Post,
asserted in his January 31 offering:
<br>
<dd>
"Mary Jo Bane, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human
Services until she quit, rightly thought the President was wrong
in signing the welfare 'reform' bill. She described the problem
well in an interview with Post reporters Judith Havemann and
Barbara Vobejda: 'Poor people tend to be concentrated in certain
areas of states that don't have the resources to take care of
them.'"
<br>
<dd>
Dionne's answer: "If we were serious about welfare reform," he
argued, "we'd have the federal government put up the money
required to support our poorest families and to create jobs," and
"we'd funnel some money" to voluntary and church groups.  
<p>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Tuesday night President Clinton will deliver his State of
the Union address. As you observe how the television network
commentators analyze his speech, see if any top a bit of network
veneration noticed by MRC news analyst Geoffrey Dickens. The day
before the Inauguration, on the January 19 Today show, NPR's Scott
Simon explained Clinton's popularity:
<br>
<dd>
"It might fit better to see President Clinton as a 1950's
American car salesmen. Selling image as much as engines. Saying,
'If you don't like blue I can sell you tan. And if you don't like
tan I'll call it Aztec Gold.' And like all great salesmen a man
who believes that the torch can be passed in a handshake. [video
of young Clinton meeting John F. Kennedy] Now just two years ago
the public wasn't buying Bill Clinton's product line. But then the
new Speaker committed the classic mistake of success. He expanded
too fast. Declaring a revolution instead of a simple victory.
Capturing control of the government only to shut it down. Whatever
you feel about Newt Gingrich or Bill Clinton as political leaders
which man would most Americans choose to sit next to on the long
bus trip? The man who prattles on about putting a supercomputer in
every lap or the one who can talk about both Helmut Kohl and
Heartbreak Hotel..."
<br>
<dd>
Simon picked up a minute later: "As he begins his second term
you may lament that President Clinton leaves little eloquence. But
in an age of focus groups and consultants saying, 'Keep it short.
Don't take sides,' few politicians do. He faces personal charges
about his conduct in a motel bedroom. And ethical allegations
about opening the Lincoln bedroom to the highest contributor. But
you come back to the fact that if Bill Clinton isn't always
trusted he has twice been entrusted by the largest responsibility
we have to bestow by voters who can have few illusions. Instead
they seem to trust that as President Clinton displays his own
excesses and frailties he forgives and accepts ours too. This is
Scott Simon."
<p>
<dd>
I'm trying to choke back my tears now that I know he feels my 
pain. And forgives it.
<p>

</ol>
<p>
<A NAME="1">
<dd>
1) "Secret System Computerizes Personal Data," declared a
front page June 26, 1996 article in The Washington Times. Reporter
Paul Rodriquez detailed how the White House Office Data Base
(WHODB) tracked personal information on those who visited the
Clintons, including their DNC donation records.
<br>
<dd>
Network coverage? Not a word on ABC, CBS or NBC. Nor on CNN's
10pm ET The World Today. But, CNN's Inside Politics that day did
carry a full story from Claire Shipmam.
<p>
<dd>
Seven months later, the February 3 Time magazine, out January
27, ran a story headlined "A Secret Cash Link: A White House
Operation that Tracked Donors Was Extensive, Top Secret and Pushed
by the First Lady." On January 30 the Los Angeles Times reported
on its front page that though the government-owned database could
be legally used only for official purposes, "the White House staff
frequently retrieved data on large political contributors and
turned it over to the Democratic National Committee to help raise
money for the President's re-election, interviews show." 
<p>
<dd>
Finally, seven months and four days after The Washington Times
broke the story, the night the LA Times story appeared the
database drew broadcast network attention, but only from two of
the three networks.
<p>
<dd>
The January 30 NBC Nightly News devoted its "Fleecing of
America" segment to the database. Reporter Lisa Myers filed a
tough report that highlighted some Hollywood celebrities:
<br>
<dd>
"...White House documents obtained by NBC News show the
database was conceived as a political tool, as a way to keep track
of early supporters. Hollywood mogul David Geffen is listed as an
early financial supporter, which means he gave money during the
'92 primary, and as a Democratic National Committee trustee, which
means he gave the party at least $100,000. He was invited to 16
White House functions. Diva Barbra Streisand also is listed as a
DNC trustee. She was invited to nine events..."
<br>
<dd>
Myers later noted: "A non-partisan expert on campaign ethics
says the White House crossed the line."
<br>
<dd>
Charles Lewis, Center for Public Integrity: "This is beyond
the pale. Everyone knows this is improper. There's no way to put a
happy spin on this."
<br>
<dd>
Myers: "The White House tried to keep the database secret. An
early memo to Hillary Clinton, who pushed the project hard, noted
that precautions should be taken or the database would be open to
public scrutiny and inquiry....The White House refuses to allow
congressional investigators examine the database even though
taxpayers paid for it. So for now we do know it's another fleecing
of America. But we don't know which contributors slept upstairs in
the Lincoln Bedroom because their names appeared downstairs and
across the way in a secret computer."
<p>
<dd>
On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced: "Questions keep
coming about the way Democrats bankrolled the Clinton re-election
campaign. Republicans have again attacked the White House for
using a database containing 350,000 names. The Republicans say
that this was a blatant fundraising operation and that taxpayers
were stuck with a $1.7 million tab to create it. Correspondent
Rita Braver reports why that could be a problem for President
Clinton."
<p>
<dd>
Of course, it would have been more of a problem if reported
last June.
<p>
<dd>
Braver concluded by noting Hillary Clinton's role, but gave
her the last word: "....Now the documents we obtained showed that
the First Lady personally pushed hard for this system. And at a
meeting with a few reporters today on another subject, she
confirmed that. She also insisted she only wanted something to
track who came to official White House functions. Dan."
<p>
<dd>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't air a piece, but did do a
story on the Friday, January 31 Good Morning America. How about
World News Tonight Friday night? No story, nor one Saturday
or Sunday.
<p>
<A NAME="2">
<dd>
2) The database stories aired Thursday night, but CBS and
NBC immediately dropped the subject. Not another word about the
database on the CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News through
Sunday night.  
<p>
<dd>
It's not the only revelation the networks are failing to
pursue. On January 30 the Associated Press reported that "a former
banker who is a fugitive from Lebanon on embezzlement charges
sipped coffee at the White House with President Clinton and other
Democratic donors last April." Coverage: a story on CNN, but
nothing on the broadcast network evening shows.
<p>
<dd>
The Saturday, February 1 Washington Post revealed that "a New
Jersey stock promoter, convicted of criminal securities fraud that
benefitted a member of the Bonanno organized crime family, was
among eight guests who accepted an invitation to join President
Clinton and top Democratic Party leaders for an early morning
coffee four days before Christmas in 1995."
<br>
<dd>
CBS Evening News anchor Paula Zahn read a brief item on this
revelation, but ABC's World News Saturday? No story. On Sunday's
Meet the Press host Tim Russert noted that "The headline in The
Washington Post today: 'White House Says Felon Not an Appropriate
Guest.' I think this is going to give Senator Thompson an awful
lot of ammunition." So how did NBC play this "ammunition"? No
mention on Nightly News either Saturday or Sunday. 
<p>
<A NAME="3">
<dd>
3) Michael Weisskopf wrote the Time magazine story on the
database. Weisskopf recently jumped to Time from The Washington
Post where he had become infamous for a paragraph in a 1993 news
story he wrote. It won the "Dumbest Quote of the Year" Award in
the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1993: The Sixth Annual Awards
for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
<dd>
In a February 1, 1993 Washington Post story Weisskopf
asserted: "Corporations pay public relations firms millions pf
dollars to contrive the kind of grass-roots response that [Jerry]
Falwell or Pat Robertson can galvanize in a televised sermon.
Their followers are largely poor, uneducated, and easy to command."
<p>
<A NAME="4">
<dd>
4) Friday night (January 31) Dan Rather told CBS Evening
News viewers:
<br>
<dd>
"Encouraging news tonight about the U.S. economy. The
government says the economy grew two and a half percent last year.
That's considered an ideal, non-inflationary growth rate."
<p>
<dd>
Not quite the gloomy spin CBS offered in 1992 when a higher
GDP rate of 2.7 percent was announced. On October 27, 1992 Susan
Spencer filed from the Bush campaign: "He crowed today at upbeat
news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though some
economists warned that may not hold." Spencer was correct, but not
in the direction she thought: the GDP was later revised upward to
3.9 percent.
<p>
<A NAME="5">
<dd>
5) A caller to C-SPAN's Washington Journal on Friday morning
asked Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes about liberal media bias in
coverage of Bill Clinton. She responded by claiming the bias is
not with reporters but with viewers. Here's her response, as
transcribed by MRC news analyst Jim Forbes:
<p>
<dd>
"I was about to say that if you want to talk about bias go ask
President Clinton where the bias lies. As you know, the White
House just issued this big huge study, they called it, of how the
main line media is sucked in by the right wing conspiratorialists.
My point is that everybody who watches television brings their own
biases to it, and if what you're watching doesn't please you then
you think we're biased. 
<br>
<dd>
"Everybody dislikes the messenger, everybody complains about
us, right wing, left wing, Democrats, Republicans, they all pound
on us, they all think we're unfair to them if we're telling them
things they don't want to hear. And we do the best we can, we try
to be fair, there are always issues where an individual reporter
does have a point of view. If he or she is a good journalist and
does his or her job the way they are supposed to then the piece
will come out as balanced as is humanly possible and the
individuals' leanings won't come through. I'm sure there are cases
where a piece is slanted, but I think generally the effort and the
end product, overall, is balanced with everybody being happy with
the way things come out."

6) MRC news analyst Clay Waters noticed this contradictory
reporting just hours apart on CNN. On the January 22 Inside
Politics Candy Crowley reported:
<br>
<dd>
Crowley: "And the hearing on Andrew Cuomo's nomination as
Housing Secretary was practically breathless."
<br>
<dd>
Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD): "This is a sterling choice by the
President."
<br>
<dd>
Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-NC): "You have, certainly have an
impressive record and an impressive group of friends."
<br>
<dd>
Crowley: "It should all be so easy."
<p>
<dd>
Maybe it wasn't so easy. Six hours later CNN anchor Kathleen
Kennedy announced on The World Today: "Senate confirmation for two
of President Clinton's other Cabinet appointees may not be so
easy. Housing Secretary nominee Andrew Cuomo was grilled for three
hours on the state of Housing and Urban Development. The
Department is under congressional fire for alleged inefficiency
and wastefulness."
<p>
<dd>
While on the contrast beat, compare these January 31
headlines. 
<br>
<dd>
The Washington Post -- "Saudis May Purchase U.S. F-16
Fighters: Bethesda's Lockheed Martin in Line for Multibillion-Dollar 
Deal."
<br>
<dd>
The Washington Times -- "F-16 Sale to Saudis Isn't in the
Works, White House Says."
<p>
<A NAME="7">
<dd>
7) "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" became a well-known
phrase in media circles, and the title of a R.E.M. song, after Dan
Rather claimed that's what a man on a Manhattan street yelled at
him during a 1986 assault. The incident added to Rather's image as
a man on the edge, just about to go nuts. Thursday's USA Today
recalled that Rather's story of being mugged "was greeted with
widespread incredulity." Well, it may well be that Rather's tale
was actually true.
<br>
<dd>
The Wednesday January 29 New York Daily News revealed that
Rather looked at pictures of William Tager, a man now serving 25
years for shooting to death an NBC technician outside NBC's
studios in 1994, and identified Tager as his assailant. A forensic
psychiatrist, who examined Tager, first made the connection and
alerted Rather.
<p>
<dd>
Before you think that means Rather is perfectly rational,
remember what he said election night: "In New Hampshire, closest
Senate race in the country, this race between Dick Swett and Bob
Smith is hot and tight as a too small bathing suit on a too long
car ride back from the beach."

[Correction: The January 27 CyberAlert twice quoted members of
the media citing Nellie Bligh as a model for undercover reporting.
It's Bly, not Bligh. Nellie Bly was the byline for Elizabeth
Cochrane, a crusading reporter in the late 1800s for Joseph
Pulitzer's The World newspaper in New York City.]
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) NBC's Today on Friday (January 24) devoted the first half
hour to a glowing profile of Vice President Al Gore, concentrating
on his humor and dancing skills. In an interview segment, however,
Katie Couric got serious and recalled how Gore had cited his
sister's death from lung cancer as why he is so opposed to
smoking:
<br>
<dd>
Katie Couric: "You're aware that you were criticized for the
speech because your family was involved in the growing and selling
tobacco until the late '80s. Correct?"
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "That's true."
<br>
<dd>
Couric: "So wasn't it hypocritical in a way."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "No, I don't think that's a fair charge at all because
we, my family, quit growing tobacco."
<br>
<dd>
Couric: "I noticed that your mom seemed to be in visible pain
as you were talking about this, and, led me to wonder if you felt
you were exploiting your sister's death for political gain at all?"
<br>
<dd>Gore: "They and my brother in law encouraged this when the
time came."
<p>
<dd>
This is quite a U-turn for Today which repeatedly heaped
praise on Gore's speech last summer and fall. First, some
background. The New York Times reported July 3, 1996 that in 1988,
Al Gore told an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of
my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own
hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it."
<p>
<dd>
Now, fast forward to Chicago. The morning after Al Gore's
convention speech Bryant Gumbel opened the August 29 Today: 
<br>
<dd>
"The hall fell silent as the Vice President recalled his
sister's death from lung cancer after more than three decades of
smoking. It was an emotional attempt to build support for the
administration's anti-smoking efforts."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "And that is why, until I draw my last breath, I will
pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children
from the dangers of smoking."
<p>
<dd>
A few minutes later reporter Jim Miklaszewski asserted: "Gore
was most effective in his shot at Dole's record on tobacco.
Political but poignant, Gore invoked the memory of his sister, a
cigarette smoker who had died of lung cancer. With his parents
looking on, Gore recounted her agonizing death."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "And in a very short time her breathing became labored,
and then she breathed her last breath. And that is why, until I
draw my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause
of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking."
<br>
<dd>
Miklaszewski: "It's a recurring theme, to put a human face on
Clinton administration politics and policy."
<p>
<dd>
Then, on October 9, Today featured an interview with Gore. But
interviewer Ed Gordon of MSNBC did not broach the tobacco
hypocrisy topic. Instead, he posed questions such as: "Many can
see that you have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in
our history. You satisfied with the role that you played for four
years?"
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) The January issue of Dateline, the newsletter published
by the Washington chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists recounted the comments by Hal Bruno at the SPJ's
Christmas party. Bruno, political editor for ABC News, dismissed
concern that the lack of excitement in the election fueled talk
about liberal bias: 
<br>
<dd>
"What were we going to do differently? Pretend that it wasn't
static? Take up the slack for Dole? And we certainly can't do
anything about the perception that we're too liberal. I thought
David Brinkley [in his on air anti-Clinton diatribe] struck a
pretty good blow against the feeling that all reporters are
liberal Democrats, but it doesn't seem to have changed anything.
The truth is that I don't care anymore."  
<p>
<dd>
But Bruno is no fan of the Clinton Administration. Dateline
newsletter editor Willie Schatz quoted Bruno: "I've never seen
anything like the Clinton White House. It's got the arrogance of
JFK and the meanness of Nixon with none of the charm and
incompetence of Carter."
<p>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Item #4 today is the latest Notable Quotables, but here
are a couple of things that didn't make it but are worth noting.
<p>
<dd>
First, writing a point/counterpoint column (with Washington
Times Managing Editor Josette Shiner) Bonnie Erbe of NBC
Radio/Westwood One news and host of To the Contrary on PBS
declared:
<br>
<dd>
"My Walter Mitty fantasy for 1997 is the same as it was for
1996: an end to extremism in American politics. Perhaps the 1996
elections were an indication that we are getting there. The year
1995 was one of extremism at its worst from the slash-and-burn
attitude of the Republican congressional 'revolution' to the rise
in activity by militia groups, to that horrendous outburst of
terrorism in Oklahoma City. As bad as 1995 was, I take solace in
the fact that in 1996, Americans appeared to begin to disavow
extremists and extremism in all its forms." 
<p>
<dd>
Second, MRC news analyst Clay Waters noticed a bit of a
contradiction in two New York Times stories. In a January 7 story
headlined "Clinton Seeks Help for the Nation's Spirit," reporter
Alison Mitchell wrote: "Mr. Clinton noted that recent statistics
showed crime rates falling, pregnancy rates among teenagers
dropping and wage inequalities narrowing."
<br>
<dd>
Two days later the Times ran a piece on Labor Secretary Robert
Reich's departure, headlined "The Last Liberal (Almost) Leaves
Town." Reporter David Sanger began: "One of the lonely liberals of
the Clinton Administration, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich,
leaves Washington this week declaring that the government must
lead a campaign to narrow a growing gap between rich and poor..."
<p>
<dd>
But I thought Clinton already solved the income gap problem.

4) The latest edition of Notable Quotables, the MRC's bi-weekly 
compilation of the latest outrageous, sometimes humorous,
quotes in the liberal media. Many of these quotes have already
appeared in previous CyberAlerts, but I urge you to check out the
quotes beneath the "U.S. News Under Jim Fallows: More Liberal Bias
More Often" heading. It's a very illuminating contrast caught by
MRC news analyst Jim Forbes.
<p>
January 27, 1997 (Vol. Ten; No. 2)
<p>
Spoiled Spin on Tainted Meat 
<p>
"A federal jury in North Carolina ordered ABC television today to
pay the Food Lion supermarkets five and a half million dollars in
punitive damages. That's in connection with an undercover news
investigation that proved to be true...Important to note that the
truth of the report was never at issue in the lawsuit, not even
challenged, only the journalistic techniques." 
<br>-- Dan Rather on
the CBS Evening News, January 22.
<p>
Reality Check:
<br>
"Food Lion claimed 'the unedited footage provides an extraordinary
look at how a network news magazine can create false impressions,'
and that 'ABC producers and editors used a combination of staged
events and selective editing to fit a preconceived story line and
systematically fabricate a story to deceive the public.' In one
specific instance, Food Lion claims that when ABC used
hidden-camera footage of a Food Lion employee talking about how
she had cooked a batch of out-of-date chicken, it edited out the
part where she says she brought the matter up with her manager,
who directed her to throw the chicken away." 
<br>-- New Republic media
columnist William Powers, January 20.
<p>
U.S. News Under Jim Fallows: More Liberal Bias More Often 
<p>
"But there's another reason why all but nine of the 225 House
Republicans backed Gingrich: deep reservations about the man next
in line, the hard-right majority leader, Dick Armey. Just as Dan
Quayle's lack of gravitas led many Republicans to pray for the
health of George Bush, Armey's ideological stubbornness and
hot-headed rhetoric inspire in his colleagues protective optimism
about Gingrich....In a House brimming with mean-spirited rhetoric,
Armey stands out." 
<br>-- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writers Kent
Jenkins Jr. and Paul Glastris, January 20 issue.
<br>
<i>vs.</i> 
<br>
"Gore's commitment to the world of big ideas is no pose. Unlike
John F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson, who became darlings of the
highbrow set without fully earning the honor, Gore is truly
engaged in the life of the mind...Had the younger Gore not become
a Congressman at 28, a Senator at 36, and Vice President at 44, he
might have become the sort of essayist who aspires to membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Letters." 
<br>-- U.S. News Senior Writer Timothy Noah, January 27 issue.
<p>
Absolving Clinton
<p>
"There's been a lot of talk lately, as you know, printed and so
forth, about the Lincoln Bedroom and the people who stay here. And
obviously a lot of them are your friends. And I don't think
anybody would begrudge somebody having guests in their own house.
Some of them, though, it seems apparently you didn't know quite as
well. And we're wondering if you might feel let down a little bit
by your staff or by the DNC in their zeal to raise funds?" 
<br>--Question from Washington Post reporters in interview published
Jan. 19.
<p>
Hillary's White House Hell
<p>
CBS reporter Martha Teichner: "Health care was just the beginning.
She has been the subject of a non-stop, ceaseless litany of
investigations. Three at the moment being conducted by Whitewater
special counsel Kenneth Starr. Speculation she may be indicted
continues."
<br>
Hillary Clinton: "I expect this matter to drag out as long as it
is to anyone else's advantage to drag it out and then it will end.
I mean no one likes to be accused of having done anything improper
or wrong. It becomes frustrating when you know that people are
saying things that aren't true, but you just learn to live with it
and you just go on day after day and..."
<br>
Teichner: "But how do you do that though in the climate of a
non-stop four- or even eight-year bashing?" -- January 19 CBS
Sunday Morning. Teichner and Hillary were classmates at Wellesley
College.)
<p>
Illegal Taping? Don't Let It Distract from Nailing Newt 
<p>
"I'm not trying to minimize the offense here, though I would have
to suggest that the ones of Speaker Gingrich look considerably
more severe than Mr. McDermott's." 
<br>-- Chicago Tribune reporter
Ellen Warren on CNN & Company, January 16.
<p>
"As a political matter, the Republicans managed brilliantly on the
last two weekends of television talk shows to keep the focus where
they wanted....Of course, they could not have done it without the
Democrats' giving them a clear field. The first weekend the
Democrats had available a Time magazine article suggesting that
the leadership, possibly waving campaign money, put pressure on
two ethics committee members to write an extraordinary letter
telling colleagues to vote for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. The
Democrats hardly brought it up. Then last weekend the Democrats
effectively failed to make their case that the taped conversation,
whatever its ancestry, showed that Mr. Gingrich had broken his
promises to the ethics committee." 
<br>-- New York Times reporter Adam
Clymer, who first reported the contents of the GOP cellular phone
conversation, in a January 16 "news analysis."
<p>
"The New Republic points out this week that the book [To Renew
America] leans heavily on copyrighted materials developed for
Newt's college course by the tax-exempt group that is at the
center of his current problems. That could well be a violation of
IRS rules that prohibit tax-exempt organizations from transferring
assets to private individuals. It also calls into question
Gingrich's claim that he's no Jim Wright -- the Democratic Speaker
whose ouster he spearheaded -- because he never sought to line his
own pockets. After taxes, his royalties would have stuffed his
pockets with something like $300,000 -- the amount of his fine.
Maybe he should hand it over. If nothing else, it would prove that
even when you can't count on the rule of law in Washington,
there's always poetic justice." 
<br>-- Conclusion to Time Senior
Editor Richard Lacayo's story, January 27 issue.
<p>
Shaw Fawns
<p>
"A very, very special day for this President when you recall that
four years ago he came to this city, he was expecting so much. His
mother was at his side there at the Inaugural. She passed away a
year later. And when you look at what was besetting the United
States, a four trillion dollar deficit, budget problems, foreign
policy problems. The budget deficit now has decreased. There seems
to be relative peace in Bosnia. The Middle East, the breakthrough
of the Hebron agreement, a lot has gone on in four short years."
<br>
-- Bernard Shaw during CNN Inauguration coverage, January 20.
<p>
God, I Admire You 
<p>
"Tribe's detractors think his arrogance is finally catching up
with him. 'He was his usual glib self,' one veteran practitioner
sniffed after the argument. But Tribe has a lot to be arrogant and
glib about. There is still no one better on his feet, no one
better able to respond to questions from the justices with a fully
developed and usually persuasive response. But sometimes he seems
too nimble, too cerebral, too able to see contradiction and
ironies and nuances light-years before the justices and other mere
mortals are able to. Especially coming in the last quarter of a
two-hour argument, he seemed to make the justices' heads hurt.
Baryshnikov probably has had the same effect on dance aficionados
-- too much dazzle to take all at once. Maybe Tribe needs to slow
down and simplify his routine the next time out -- and dance the
macarena instead of Swan Lake." 
<br>-- USA Today reporter Tony Mauro
in the January 13 Legal Times.
<p>
CBS: Clueless Broadcasting System
<p>
Larry King: "I'm told by our producers, that a lot of calls, so
rather than make it microscopic here, are complaining about
advocates being hired by television stations. [Robert] Shapiro was
on one side in the Simpson trial, he's hired. [George]
Stephanopoulos is now at ABC -- that we're not getting balance."
<br>
Dan Rather: "I think that's a valid criticism. I'm concerned about
it. Look, a Bill Moyers came out of the Lyndon Johnson White House
and became one of the great journalists of all time."
<br>
King: "But a major liberal, self-confessed."
<br>
Rather: "Ah, is he? I don't want to get into that, but he was
terrific. I do think, personal opinion, it's gone too far." 
<br>--Exchange on Larry King Live, January 13.

<dd> 
1) A week and a half ago VP Gore's office conceded that the
Buddhist Temple event was indeed a fundraiser. CNN did a story,
but not ABC, CBS or NBC. That same week, on January 16, some major
newspapers carried stories contending Clinton changed policy to
match donor's desires and that John Huang influenced Commerce
Dept. policy. Nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. 
<BR>
<DD>    
The Washington Times on January 23 and the Washington Post on
January 24 reported that Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry
admitted, contrary to earlier White House assurances, that senior
adviser Bruce Lindsey knew in 1994 that the Lippo Group had paid
$250,000 to Webster Hubbell. Lippo retained Hubbell after the
former Associate Attorney General resigned. The suggestion has
been raised that Lippo paid Hubbell in order to keep him from
talking to the independent counsel. Network coverage: Zilch.
<p>
<DD>    
But on Friday, January 24, the White released documents
detailing how over 100 "coffees" were held at the White House with
various ethnic and business groups to raise money for the
Democratic National Committee, all attended by Bill Clinton,
Hillary Clinton, Al Gore or Tipper Gore.
<BR>
<DD>    
All the networks aired stories Friday night. Here's how Tom
Brokaw opened NBC Nightly News:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Good evening. Everyone in Washington agrees that the money
game in that town is simply out of control for Republican and
Democrat alike. And the more we learn, the greater the outrage.
There's enough blame to go all the way around the country tonight.
But the latest money trail, it turns out, is a four lane highway
leading from the White House to almost every group in America. As
NBC's Andrea Mitchell tells us now, the White House released the
documentation, the Republicans are thrilled."
<p>
<DD>    
One of the meetings involved bank executives and the chief
bank regulator. Appearing on Sunday's CNN Late Edition (January
26) Associate White House counsel Lanny Davis denied the bankers
swayed administration policy. That prompted CNN reporter Brooks
Jackson to ask Davis this very interesting question not posed by
others in the media:
<BR>
<DD>    
"One thing puzzles me. Now if the President invited these
bankers to listen to them, with the implication that if they said
something that got to him he might change policy and then he
didn't change policy, was he wasting their time. Was this all a
sham?"
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd> 
2) On Sunday's (January 26) Face the Nation CBS host Bob
Schieffer noted how Newt Gingrich complained about a harsher
ethics standard held against conservatives. Schieffer then asked
Senator John McCain: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"He apparently made an agreement, or did make with the ethics
committee, that he would accept the punishment that they meted out
and in exchange for that he would not contest it nor would he
criticize it. He has now received his punishment. This morning we
learn that he went before his hometown folks yesterday and
basically said none of this was my fault. It was either the fault
of my lawyers or there's a double standard for conservatives in
Washington, no matter what they do they're going to be blamed for
it. Is that good for the Republican cause?"
<p>
<DD>    
First, a minor memo to Bob: Watch TV. Gingrich's comments
happened Saturday morning and were reported that night.
<p>
<DD>    
Second, as Bob Novak reported in his column last week,
Gingrich "was the victim of a classic bait and switch scheme" by
ethics committee members. Gingrich and the committee agreed that
he would admit to two charges, "but the report of James Cole,
House ethics committee special counsel, made public Jan. 17 was
concluded by a much harsher bill of particulars against the
Speaker. In floor speeches Tuesday, veteran partisan Democratic
politicians Ben Cardin and Nancy Pelosi echoed Cole's report
rather than what Gingrich had admitted. This is near total victory
for foes who have plotted the Speaker's fall for two years."
<p>
<DD>    
On CNN's Late Edition Steve Roberts of the New York Daily News
(and formerly with U.S. News) offered little sympathy for
Gingrich. CNN showed a clip of Gingrich: "You can on the left do
anything you want and nobody seems to notice. But if you are a
conservative and you follow the law and you hire lawyers and you
do what you can, if you make a single mistake you better plan to
be pilloried because you're politically incorrect."
<BR>
<DD>    
Roberts shot back: "Oh, please. That is my reaction. I mean
he's the guy who drove Jim Wright out of office. Jim Wright was
hounded out of office by Newt Gingrich. The press covered that.
The press is covering all of Bill Clinton's problems....C'mon,
that's silly."
<p>
<DD>    
The "press covered" Jim Wright? Eventually, at best. As the
MRC's Tim Graham determined in providing research for a recent
column by MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell, the media were less than
excited about Gingrich's concerns about Wright. Bozell explained:
"On September 24, 1987, Washington Post reporter Charles Babcock
broke the story of Speaker Jim Wright's book deal. Absolute
television silence followed. On February 19, 1988 Newt Gingrich
asked for an ethics investigation of Wright. He gained two
paragraphs in the Los Angeles Times and a mention in the
Washington Post. Network coverage: zero."
<p>
<DD>    
On CNN Reader's Digest's Michael Barone did note that Dick
Gephardt's false statements about a real estate deal failed to
generate much coverage. But on Fox News Sunday Brit Hume, newly
installed as the network's Washington Managing Editor, took on his
brethren. After the Washington Post's Juan Williams insisted
Gingrich's violations would have put a regular person in jail,
Hume countered:  
<BR>
<DD>    
"Speaking of double standards, there is an interesting
question here. About this time last week we were all still
interested in the case of Mr. McDermott, and the leaked tape, the
illegally recorded and apparently illegally released tape. Even
the media for a time were interested in that. What happened to
that story? We never found out, we never got to the bottom of it.
It just fell off the side of the table. Now does anyone seriously
imagine here that if it were Newt Gingrich on that side, or some
other prominent conservative Republican, that the Hounds of Hell
in the Washington media would have dropped it because the case it
came up in the context of was concluded? I doubt it very
seriously."
<BR>
<DD>    
Williams responded: "Certainly we're all aware and talking
about it. I think you're being harsh."
<p>
<DD>    
Harsh. The ultimate media insult normally reserved for
conservatives on the House.
<p>
<DD>    
And before it's totally out of date, I should mention the
debate over the newsworthiness of what Gingrich said in the taped
cellular call. In the January 20 Washington Post media reporter
Howard Kurtz noted that the tape was given not only to the New
York Times which ran with it, but also the Atlanta Journal
Constitution. The Atlanta paper ran a short New York Times News
Service item, but Kurtz relayed that Washington correspondent
Jeanne Cummings "references to the tape were deleted from a
separate story she wrote on Gingrich and the ethics
committee...While Cummings was reported to be furious, the Atlanta
editors defend their news judgment. 'Quite frankly, we didn't see
it as being any kind of smoking gun,' said Carl Rauscher, the
paper's national editor."
<BR>
<DD>    
Not quite the impression given by the networks or other
papers. 
<p>

<dd> 
3) ABC's Prime Time Live is not conceding that they made any
errors or exaggerations in their Food Lion story. As transcribed
by MRC News analyst Eugene Eliasen, here's what Diane Sawyer told
viewers January 22:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Now to bring you up to date on a story you've heard 
about. In November of 1992, we broadcast a story on the Food Lion
supermarket chain, in which we raised a number of serious
questions about the way they handled and repackaged food. After
that story aired, Food Lion sued us. Not over the accuracy of the
report, but over the way we gathered some of the information, by
working in their supermarkets undercover. Today a jury in 
North Carolina awarded punitive damages to Food Lion because of
the techniques we used to bring those facts to light. Roone
Arledge, President of ABC News, called the award unconscionable
and said, quote, 'if large corporations were allowed to stop hard
hitting investigative journalism, the American people would be the
losers,' unquote. ABC will appeal the decision, and again, the
truth of the broadcast was not at issue in this decision and ABC 
News stands behind the talented journalists who brought this
important story to your attention."
<p>
<DD>    
A few hours later on Good Morning America on Thursday analyst
Eliasen caught this re-assertion from co-host Charles Gibson: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Right now, we're going to talk about ourselves. Yesterday, a
jury ordered ABC News to pay five-and-a-half million dollars in
damages to the Food Lion Supermarket chain. It came about because
of a 1992 report on Prime Time Live. The show said that the food
chain knowingly sold spoiled or contaminated food to their
customers. The food chain didn't contest the report itself but
argued that ABC had used improper methods, that producers had 
disguised themselves in order to get a story."
<p>
<DD>    
Time magazine Managing Editor Walter Isaacson asserted: "It
has a chilling effect for a couple reasons. First of all, it
reminds us that people are pretty fed up with the press in this
country and the media and some of the tactics. I don't think this 
was just about ABC or this case, I think people have sensed that
the press has gone a bit too far, become like jackals in pursuing
some of the tabloid stories. It's a shame it happened in this case
cause this was a very valuable, important story that ABC did and
the truth of the story was not contended in court."
<p>
<DD>    
The assertion that the accuracy of ABC's Food Lion story is
beyond dispute continued on the weekend talk shows where
commentators almost universally failed to tell viewers that Food
Lion does contest the charges, or that a union suggested the story
to ABC (Food Lion is non-union). For all we know, Food Lion may
have been guilty of some bad food practices, but the media have
refused to concede that maybe ABC tried to stage events for tape
or explain that just because a company does not file a libel suit
does not mean they find a story true. It is virtually impossible
to win a libel suit even for a false story because of the requirement
to prove malice/"a reckless disregard for the truth."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On the January 24 Washington Week in Review on PBS Alan
Murray, Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal,
explained:
<BR>
<DD>    
"I have problems with journalists lying about who they are in
order to get stories. But if Food Lion was bleaching meat and
selling it to people, people want to know that. People watch these
shows for a reason. Isn't that exactly what journalism is supposed
to do for the public?"
<BR>
<DD>    
Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post did note: "Well, I should
say that Food Lion disputes that, although that was not at issue
in the courtroom..."
<BR>
<DD>    
Host Ken Bode then showed a clip of Food Lion's compilation of
outtakes tape in which a Food Lion narrator charged ABC with
creating false resumes. Bode then insisted that ABC followed a
great tradition:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Let me remind folks that Nellie Bligh (sp?) in the 19th
Century went into, feigned madness and went into a New York insane
asylum to demonstrate the brutal conditions of the madhouses of
New York. And Upton Sinclair did a similar kind of thing in the
slaughter houses of Chicago. This is not something that's very
new..."
<BR>
<DD>    
Kurtz responded with a rare mention of Food Lion's argument:    
"...And one thing that hasn't happened in the days of Nellie Bligh
was that there were arguments made by Food Lion, they showed the
jury outtakes, 45 hours of videotape that wasn't on the air. And
they argue, ABC denies, that some of this was sort of staged, that
the ABC producers tried to get permission to sell dated food and
in one case when a colleague said 'no, no don't sell that chicken
it's too old,' you could hear the ABC producer saying 'damn.' Now
that's the kind of thing that has a powerful effect on a jury."
<BR>
<DD>    
Bode replied: "That's true. I did see that in the tape, that is
true."
<BR>
<DD>    
But Bode failed to let viewers see that incriminating portion
of the outtake tape.
<p>
<DD>    
-- On this past weekend's Inside Washington Evan Thomas of
Newsweek asserted:
<BR>
<DD>    
"It was pretty scary for the press because the story was
basically right, it looked like Food Lion really did have some
problems and ABC got in there and exposed them. Yes, they did some
illegal stuff to get there and we can have a debate as we will
about whether reporters are supposed to do that, but for the press
it was a very scary verdict."
<BR>
<DD>    
"Basically right" but no exploration of what was untrue.
<p>
<DD>    
NPR's Nina Totenberg defended ABC's methods: "I must say this
is a time-honored way of getting at a story you can't get
otherwise. It goes back to Nellie Bligh who pretended to be a
crazy person in order to get into mental institutions and find out
what was going on there, you know a hundred years ago. Muckraking
journalism couldn't exist without this technique."
<p>
<DD>    
At the very end of the segment host Gordon Peterson noted that
Food Lion says ABC left out footage which included an ABC staffer
stating "we're going to get these guys." Deborah Mathis of the
Gannett News Service found that troubling: "That is the part that
bothers me most. When I hear about some things that actually sound
like entrapment, not just being there and covering but actual
entrapment by reporters, now that is flatly wrong. There can be no
defense, in view, of that."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On the McLaughlin Group Newsweek's Eleanor Clift charged:   
<BR>
<DD>    
"The story was accurate and we shouldn't forget our tradition of
muckraking in this country."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On Fox News Sunday Brit Hume stood up for Food Lion over
ABC, his former employer. Noting the outtakes, Hume explained:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Food Lion turns around and takes from that 45 hours a tape
that was produced for the trial -- about 20 minutes or so worth --
and produces a video that makes ABC look every bit as bad in the
news business as Food Lion looked in the food business. It's the
first I can remember an organization under assault from the news
media doing to the news media what it claimed the news media had
done to it."
<BR>
<DD>    
Washington Times Managing Editor Josette Shiner said the media
should admit mistakes and Hume suggested ABC went beyond the
evidence, but The Washington Post's Juan Williams retorted: "I think
you guys are crazy," saying of ABC's piece: "That's good journalism."
<BR>
<DD>    
Hume then told viewers: "They worked very closely with a labor
union that is shut out of that food chain which obviously is an
interested party."
<p>
<DD>    
So a mention on the talk shows of labor unions and of staged
events, but what did they and the network news stories leave out?
"ABC's Food Lyin'" is the headline over a fascinating February 10
National Review article by Thomas McArdle of Investor's Business
Daily. Reviewing the outtakes and the case overall McArdle
revealed:
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "One of the producers, Susan Barnett, after several days of
work as a deli clerk at a Myrtle Beach Food Lion, is obviously
very frustrated at not being able to get a story. As she sees a
Food Lion employee start to clean a meat slicer, she can't conceal
her disappointment.  Oh damn,' she says. Then as it sinks in, she
says a long, drawn out  Sh--.'"  
<BR>
<DD>    
-- Referring to producer Lynne Dale, McArdle wrote: "For some
reason Mrs. Dale has left the store at 9:30am. The videotape is
blacked out, but the audio can be heard clearly. 'I'm gonna lose
my job,' she nervously tells one of the technicians. Right before
the tape cuts off, the technician is heard telling her, 'Throw
that tape away.' Food Lion is convinced that what Mrs. Dale had
just been doing was removing a 10-inch wire from the water heater
to make it impossible to clean the store's meat department that
day." The plumber testified at the trial that the heater had been
vandalized. Dale denied the charge.
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "But if ABC had nothing to hide, why did it originally
leave out key segments of the tapes when ordered to provide Food
Lion with copies? Why did the copies provided by ABC, which owns
the best in high-tech video equipment, seem to be copies of copies
of copies, at least one segment re-recorded on used tape? Why were
multiple 'cutting signatures' found on the tapes? 
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "The chain became a huge threat to the United Food and
Commercial Workers union (UFCW) which targeted it for punitive
action as far back as the early 1980s. Douglas Dority, the UFCW's
international President, said of 'the non-union chains -- the Food
Lions' during a 1990 conference, 'We must either reduce these
chains' market share...or we must put them out of business. There
is no other option.'" UFCW pushed the story on ABC.
<p>
<DD>    
Still, the January 23 USA Today quoted ABC producer Lynne
Dale: "What frightens me most about all this is that Food Lion
tried to punish us as journalists without ever challenging the
truth of the broadcast."
<p>
<a name="4">
<dd> 
4) Headline from the front page of the January 25 New York
Times: "Deaths From AIDS Decline Sharply in New York City/ Access
to Care is Cited/ 30% Drop in All Ethnic Groups and Both Sexes in
1996 -- New-Case Rate Is Same."
<BR>
<DD>    
But the same day's Washington Post has even better news: "AIDS
Toll Falls by Half in New York."
<p>
<a name="5">
<dd> 
5) Finally, last Wednesday morning the local Washington, DC
media as well as CNN and the other networks later in the day, were
full of stories on an explosion near Planned Parenthood's DC
office. MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham alerted me to a
humorous take on the coverage from Washington Post "Metro"
columnist Steve Twomey: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"All morning, the radio had been pumping out breathless
reports of an explosion near the clinic...My first conclusion upon
arrival: People have a funny definition of 'near.' If you think
'near' includes a spot at the opposite end of the block, and on
the other side of the street, then I suppose an explosive device
went off 'near' Planned Parenthood. The site was much nearer to
National Geographic, which suggests at least the possibility that
somebody was objecting to photos of bare-breasted Polynesian
women."

<dd>
1) Some notes from Inauguration Day coverage:<p>

-- MRC analyst Clay Waters caught this bit of generosity by
CNN's Bernard Shaw at about 11am ET:
<p>
<dd>
"A very, very special day for this President when you recall
that our years ago he came to this city he was expecting so much.
His mother was at his side there at the Inaugural. She passed away
a year later. And when you look at what was besetting the United
States, a four trillion dollar deficit, budget problems, foreign
policy problems. The budget deficit now has decreased. There seems
to be relative peace in Bosnia. The Middle East, the breakthrough
of the Hebron agreement, a lot has gone on in four short years."
<p>
<dd>
A while after Clinton's address, in an exchange with guest
commentator Peggy Noonan (a former Reagan and Bush speechwriter),
Shaw defended the President's anti-conservative comments:
<br>
<dd>
Noonan: "Some of the language seemed almost radical. He had a
sentence in there that said as each new wave of immigrants come
into the United States they become targets for hatred and
persecution or something to that extent and I thought 
Yowsa! That's a little bit hot."
<br>
<dd>
Shaw: "Well some people would argue that those immigrants with
dark skins have been the object of discrimination rather than
those immigrants from Eastern European nations."
<br>
<dd>
Noonan: "But targets! Read it to me, 'Wave after wave of
immigrants come and become targets of hatred.' That's just a
little bit hot. I have a feeling he went a little over 
the line in that section, in that part."
<br>
<dd>
Shaw: "Well do you think he went over the line in view of the
campaign, the fire-hot, white-heat hot, if you will, rhetoric and
debate in the just-concluded presidential campaign. Immigration, a
very visceral issue in California and elsewhere?"
<p>
-- Over on NBC before Clinton spoke, MRC analyst Geoffrey
Dickens noticed NBC News VP Tim Russert relaying as fact the
rhetoric of liberals opposed to welfare reform:
<p>
<dd>
"Many children in this country, it is estimated, will fall
below the poverty line with the changes in the welfare reform
bill. And Hillary Clinton is going to take initiatives to try to
bring some of those children into programs which will help educate
and feed and clothe them." 
<p>
-- Monday night Tom Brokaw announced on the January 20 NBC
Nightly News: "The President, it turns out, worked on his speech
right up to the moment that he delivered it and while it lacked
great passion or memorable phrases, it was filled with noble
intentions."
<p>
<dd>
In Tuesday's USA Today (January 21) former Carter
Administration official turned Time magazine reporter turned USA
Today news columnist Walter Shapiro also found comfort in
Clinton's attack on conservatives. Citing the same passage that so
upset Noonan ("Each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to
old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of
religious or political conviction are no different") Shapiro
endorsed Clinton's take: "That last sentence was a fusillade
against aimed at California Gov. Pete Wilson and the Republicans
like him who dangerously fan the flames of discord with nostrums
like Proposition 209, which rolled back affirmative action."
<br>
<dd>
Shapiro continued: "I doubt that Ralph Reed and the Christian
Coalition were cheering wildly as the President attacked
'prejudice and contempt' masquerading as 'religious conviction.'
But one stirring passage does not a reborn President make."
<p>
<dd>
Ignoring the jabs at conservatives and emphasizing Clinton's
call to end partisan bickering, ABC's new White House reporter,
John Donvan, concluded his World News Tonight story: 
<br>
<dd>
"...Tomorrow, of course, it is back to business.
Another question, however, is whether it will also be back to
politics. If it is not, and if the President's address today had
anything to do with it, then that speech, Peter, certainly
deserves to go down in history."<br>

<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) Reporters continue to assume that President Clinton was
some kind of innocent bystander to Democratic fundraising tactics.
<p>
<dd>
The January 19 Washington Post ran the transcript of its
interview with Clinton. Here's the campaign finance questions: 
<br>
<dd>
"There's been a lot of talk lately, as you know, printed and
so forth, about the Lincoln Bedroom and the people who stay here.
And obviously a lot of them are your friends. And I don't think
anybody would begrudge somebody having guests in their own house.
Some of them, though, it seems apparently you didn't know quite as
well. And we're wondering if you might feel let down a little bit
by your staff or by the DNC in their zeal to raise funds?"
<p>
<dd>
On Monday's CBS Evening News reporter Rita Braver noted that
while the President was being sworn in, "White House aides were
putting the finishing touches on the plan he'll propose tomorrow
in the wake of he controversy over Democratic fundraising. The
President will also announce new rules tightening up contributor's
access to the White House."
<p>
<dd>
It's as if these guests showed up unannounced and Clinton was
forced to accommodate them.

<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Tuesday night the broadcast networks highlighted the
ethical breaches of Newt Gingrich, but the word "ethics" didn't
pass their lips in stories on Clinton's proposed campaign finance
rules. 
<p>
Dan Rather opened the January 21 CBS Evening News:
<br>
<dd>
"Good evening. The mood in Washington changed dramatically
overnight, from celebration to castigation. The House of
Representatives voted today to reprimand and fine Speaker Newt
Gingrich for low ethics. Specifically, using money from tax-exempt
foundations to fund his partisan college course. And, a pattern of
giving investigators inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable
information."
<br>
<dd>
CBS didn't mention a word about Clinton's campaign finance
proposal.
<p>
As a "Day of Dishonor" chyron was displayed, Tom Brokaw opened 
NBC Nightly News: 
<br>
<dd>
"Newt Gingrich, who came to power after all preaching a higher
standard in American politics, a man who brought down another
Speaker on ethics accusations, tonight he has on his own record
the judgment of his peers, Democrat and Republican alike. By an
overwhelming vote they found him guilty of ethics violations."
<br>
<dd>
Introducing the second story of the night Brokaw emphasized
how Clinton was solving a problem: 
<br>
<dd>    
"For his part, President Clinton tried to take the high road
today on political money, just when Gingrich was caught in the
headlights. But, of course, Clinton has his own troubling record
on campaign contributions. We have more tonight on how he's trying
to get beyond that now from NBC's Jim Miklaszewski."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski noted that "in the last campaign it was the
Democrats who took questionable foreign contributions. As of
today, no more. The Democratic Party will no longer take political
money from foreign firms or individuals, no longer accept more tan
$100,000 from any single donor per year. And White House access
for campaign contributors will be tightened. But the new rules do
not apply to individual Democratic candidates and President
Clinton will still invite big contributors to sleep in the Lincoln
Bedroom."
<br>
<dd>
After a clip of Common Cause's Ann McBride saying voluntary
rules aren't enough, Miklaszeski announced:
<br>
<dd>
"But the President claims no matter what mistakes Democrats
have made, Republicans are worse."
<br>
<dd>
Clinton: "They raise more money, they raise more foreign
money, they raise more money in gig contributions and we take all
the heat. It's a free ride."
<br>
<dd>
Stop the tape. "...and President Clinton will still invite big
contributors to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom." Huh? NBC viewers
must have asked. That story broke December 15, but that was its
first mention on NBC Nightly News.
<p>
On ABC's World News Tonight Peter Jennings told viewers: 
<br>
<dd>
"The Democrats have had their own highly embarrassing
problems, as you know, with campaign contributions during the
presidential race, have tried today, to get some of the problems
behind them. New rules for who may give and under what circumstances."
<p>
<dd>
Stop the tape. "As you know..." How would World News Tonight
viewers know about major developments in the Democratic
fundraising scandal. They have yet to mention the Lincoln Bedroom
as Motel 6 news. As noted in the January 16 and 17 CyberAlerts,
NBC Nightly News and ABC World News Tonight have failed to report
several recent revelations, including:
<p>
-- Last week Vice President Al Gore admitted to the AP that he 
used "a poor choice of words" when he insisted an April 1996 
fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple was nothing more than a 
"community outreach" event. The AP noted that three days before 
the event the DNC sent Gore a memo explaining how he should 
"extend appreciation for participant support and inspire 
political and fundraising efforts." 
<br>
-- The day after Christmas the Democratic National Committee
released a huge pile of documents on their fundraising activities.
The papers showed how foreign donors to the DNC got special access
to the White House and Clinton. The New York Times ran a big piece
on the December 27 front page.
<br>
-- Last Thursday three newspapers uncovered new aspects in the
John Huang/Democratic fundraising saga: Thursday's Washington Post
front page headline: "Guest Lists at White House Didn't Include
Rap Sheets: Some at DNC Fund-Raising Coffees Ran Afoul of Law."    
The Los Angeles Times front page: "Papers Show Huang's Policy Role
at Commerce: Documents Contrast with Assertions that Figure in
Democratic Fundraising Scandal Had Minimal Duties." The 
Boston Globe's page one headline declared: "Clinton Policy Shift
Followed Asian-American Fundraiser."
<p>
<dd>
ABC's John Donvan did conclude his piece by noting: "...The
new rules look like serious reform. The only question is how good
the Democratic Party will be at enforcing them after a 1996
campaign when millions in illegal and improper contributions
reached the party coffers and had to be sent back."
<p>
<dd>
And NBC's Miklaszewski was the only one to report that "The
Democrats problems are far from over. The Republican Chairman of
the House Rules Committee sent a letter to the FBI today asking it
to investigate whether some of those foreign contributions may
have been a part of espionage against the U.S."
<p>
<dd>
Sounds like a good subject for an investigation by NBC News,
or at least an explanatory story. But don't count on it. In a
January 17 USA Today story reporter Martha Moore relayed the
perspective of NBC's Russert: 
<dd>    
"The test facing the media may be to not spend all its time
covering scandals. 'Do we just become totally overwhelmed with the
news of scandal, and forget that all the things we talked about
during the campaign -- Medicare, balanced budget and Social
Security -- are still going on?' asks NBC's Tim Russert. 'The
scandals will eventually be resolved,' but the issues 'will have a
lot more impact and consequence.'"

<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Time magazine decided to equate Newt Gingrich with former
House Speaker Jim Wright who used royalties from bulk book sales
to pocket money and circumvent honoraria limits. Richard Lacayo
concluded his piece in the current (January 27) issue:
<br>
<dd>
"The New Republic points out this week that the book [To Renew
America] leans heavily on copyrighted materials developed for
Newt's college course by the tax-exempt group that is at the
center of his current problems.
<br>
<dd>
"That could well be a violation of IRS rules that prohibit
tax-exempt organizations from transferring assets to private
individuals. It also calls into question Gingrich's claim that
he's no Jim wright -- the Democratic Speaker whose ouster he
spearheaded -- because he never sought to line his own pockets.
After taxes, his royalties would have stuffed his pockets with
something like $300,000 -- the amount of his fine. Maybe he should
hand it over. If nothing else, it would prove that even when you
can't count on the rule of law in Washington, there's always
poetic justice." 

<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Back on January 3 MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
debated Eleanor Clift on MSNBC about coverage of scandals. Here's
one exchange in which Clift was not fully forthcoming:
<br>
<dd>
Tim Graham: "What's worse, Eleanor, is you coming on this
program and pretending you're not a partisan, that you can go out
on the weekends on the press and compare Newt Gingrich to Charles
Manson and than say you can be an observer--"
<br>
<dd>    
Eleanor Clift, Newsweek: "I have never compared Newt Gingrich
to Charles Manson."
<br>
<dd>
Graham: "McLaughlin Group."
<br>
<dd>
Clift: "In fact, I wrote a book called War Without Bloodshed
published earlier this year in which Newt Gingrich is one of the
characters. He provided the title for the book. I believe I have
fairly covered Newt Gingrich, and I think he would answer that
well."
<p>
<dd>
Let's go to the videotape. On the November 18, 1995 McLaughlin
Group Clift declared: "Newt Gingrich teaching manners is like
Charles Manson teaching nonviolence."

<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) Speaking of bizarre analogies, we normally don't follow
Morton Kondracke of Roll Call since he's not with a major news
outlet, but here's his argument on how Gingrich's punishment was
too soft, as expressed on the McLaughlin Group this past weekend:  
<br>
<dd>
"Now, as to Newt Gingrich, this is thoroughly in keeping with 
the OJ Simpson case, for example. OJ Simpson may have committed 
murder, but he gets fined as a result, he has to pay money. By this 
theory you get $300,000 for this offense, whatever it is, big fine, 
Richard Nixon instead of being impeached should have gotten a $5 
million dollar fine, maybe. And Jim Wright should have paid $50,000 
bucks?"
<p>
<dd>
Well, at least it's not as bad as Sam Donaldson comparing Mr. Newt
to Lenin.

<dd>
1) Sunday night CBS broadcast an Inaugural Gala show from
the USAir Arena in Largo, Maryland co-hosted by Whoopi Goldberg,
Michael Douglas and Candice Bergen. On Saturday they held a
rehearsal show and a local TV reporter talked to some of the
participants.    
<p>
<dd>
WUSA-TV's Eyewitness News at 11 on Saturday night included a
couple of interesting soundbites. NYPD Blue star Jimmy Smits
explained why he flew in from California: "I believe he's a
wonderful President, has been and will continue to be. So I'm
honored that they would think to ask -- hey, come on down and hang
with me."
<p>
<dd>
Singer Stevie Wonder tied his vote for Clinton with the murder
of Bill Cosby's son: "We hope that because of us voting for this
man and voting for change for tomorrow, that will help these kinds
of things to not happen."
<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) The CBS News show Sunday Morning on January 19 featured
one of First Lady Hillary Clinton's two television interviews for
the Inauguration. Reporter Martha Teichner portrayed an oppressed
and misunderstood First Lady.
<p>
<dd>
On her role in health care reform, Teichner asked: "Were you
startled at the fact that is was as controversial an issue as it
was and that you became controversial?"
<br>
<dd>
Following Hillary Clinton's response, Teichner continued:
"Health care was just the beginning. She has been the subject of a
non-stop, ceaseless litany of investigations. Three at the moment
being conducted by Whitewater special counsel Kenneth Starr.
Speculation she may be indicted continues."
<br>
<dd>
Hillary Clinton responded: "I expect this matter to drag out
as long as it is to anyone else's advantage to drag it out and
then it will end. I mean no one likes to be accused of having done
anything improper or wrong. It becomes frustrating when you know
that people are saying things that aren't true, but you just learn
to live with it and you just go on day after day and..."
<br>
<dd>
Teichner jumped in: "But how do you do that though in the
climate of a non-stop four or even eight year bashing?"
<p>
<dd>
A bit later Teichner continued her sympathetic report: "Her
biggest gripe is that the positive is never what the public sees.
That her media image as a First Lady under fire, edgy and
defensive, belies the real Hillary Clinton who has even been known
to laugh." 
<p>
<dd>
After a bit of video, Teichner went on: "One gauge of a First
Lady's stamp on the White House is the art she chooses to display
there. 'Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City' by Henry Tanner is
the first work acquired for the permanent collection by an African
American artist. It now hangs in the Green Room."
<p>
<dd>
Finally, Teichner ended by showing the White House sculpture
garden, inquiring of Mrs. Clinton: "Do you ever just go there and
sit?"
<p>
<dd>
Not once did Teichner ask a tough question or even suggest
that Hillary Clinton's actions may have contributed to her
problems. 
<p>
<dd>
The CBS interview aired at about 9:30am ET. Less than ten
hours later, at 7pm ET C-SPAN aired its interview with Hillary
Clinton. In it she complained about a "very effective, well
organized advocacy press that is, I think, very up-front in its
right wing, conservative inclinations and makes no apologies."
According to a story in Saturday's Washington Times, she
elaborated on how "there's not something comparable to that" on the
liberal side: "You've got a conservative press and/or right wing
press presence with really nothing on the other end of the
political spectrum, so that most of what is left in what you might
call the middle or the establishment or the mainstream tries to be
objective and tries to be thoughtful."
<p>
<dd>
I guess she'd put CBS in the "thoughtful" category.
<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) If you want to avoid George Stephanopoulos, or Bill
Kristol for that matter, don't watch ABC News. Former Clinton aide
Stephanopoulos made his premiere as an ABC News analyst on
Friday's Good Morning America paired with Bill Kristol. He Kristol
also appeared together on ABC's World News Saturday, plus Sunday's
GMA and This Week as part of the show's roundtable.
<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Al Hunt, the Wall Street Journal's Executive Washington
Editor, can't admit when he's wrong. As pointed out in a past
CyberAlert, some in the media have blamed Newt Gingrich for taking
money from children because he took over the Abraham Lincoln
Foundation and used it to fund his college course. But as Bob
Novak pointed out, the foundation was inactive and not helping
kids. Gingrich took it over to save the time it would take to form
a new foundation. With that background, here's an exchange from
Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN:
<p>
<dd>
Bob Novak: "We have had debates at this table we've had
debates around town, over this shell of the Abraham Lincoln
Opportunity Foundation, which a lot of people have said Newt
looted of money for needy kids to give political contributions.
Your prosecutor, Mr. Cole, said that it was defunct. This is a
sham, and people who said he was looting money from kids, should
be ashamed of themselves, Al."
<br>
<dd>
Al Hunt: "He looted money from kids. I'll tell you exactly
what he did. This was set up, it didn't matter if it was defunct,
the Abraham Lincoln thing was set up to aid needy kids."
<br>
<dd>
Novak: "There was no money."
<br>
<dd>
Hunt: "Newt never went to the IRS, as he was required to by
law, and said we're going to take this thing that was set up for
needy kids and we're going to use it for partisan political
purposes."
<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Part three of the eight part Discovery Channel series,
Cronkite Remembers, offered a scary insight into the thinking of
reporters during the Cold War.
<br>
<dd>
The January 16 installment explored the Cold War era. Looking
at 1948, the year he returned from a Moscow reporting assignment,
Cronkite recalled: "It was great to be back in America. With the
GIs back home everything was expanding. More house, more babies,
more schools. It should have been the happiest of times, I guess,
but despite all the nation's optimism and new affluence there was
that chill in the air that just couldn't be ignored."
<p>
<dd>
Following some Soviet May Day video Cronkite continued:
<br>
<dd>
"I thought that we Americans overreacted to the Soviets and
the news coverage sometimes seemed to accentuate that misdirected
concern. Fear of the Soviet Union taking over the world just
seemed as likely to me as invaders from Mars. Well, perhaps I was
naive, but I'd seen those May Day parades and Soviet bread lines
and miserable conditions hidden behind them. That war-devastated
country didn't seem that threatening to me. United Press sent me
around speaking occasionally to various groups about life in the
Soviet Union. At almost all of the talks I was asked about Russian
technology and the prospects that they would develop an atomic
bomb. With great assurance, I would tell the questioner, 'no way,
no way, they can't even screw in a lightbulb.' I walked out of the
hall after one of those speeches and there were the headlines,
'Soviets Explode Atomic Bomb.' Another item for my cloudy crystal
ball department. 
<br>
<dd>
"The nuclear arms race was on in earnest. All the anti-Soviet
paranoia that had been festering since the war really blew up
then. A Soviet bomb was seen as an assault on us. But I saw it as
part of their pursuit of nuclear equality. After all, what should
we expect, that our enemy's just going to sit still there and not
try to develop the bomb?" 
<p>
<dd>
So, Americans had "overreacted" to the Soviet threat, but when
they did develop a nuclear weapon that didn't confirm the need for
concern, it "blew up" anti-Soviet "paranoia." And, what's the big
deal anyway? The Soviets deserved nuclear equality. 
<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) Mike Wallace did a piece for the January 19 60 Minutes on
the Ted Turner/Rupert Murdoch feud.
<p>
<dd>
Murdoch wouldn't talk to him, so Andrew Neal (sp?), a former
editor of one of Murdoch's London newspapers, served as the
Murdoch expert. After showing clips of some racy Fox entertainment
shows and explaining how Murdoch's London tabloid runs a topless
Page 3 Girl everyday, Wallace stated: 
<br>
<dd>
"I asked Andrew Neal how Murdoch, a conservative, can publish
papers and create programming that many conservatives find so
offensive. The buck is more important than his moral take on
life?"
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "You can't reconcile his private social views with what
he broadcasts and prints. His wife Anna is always pushing him to
end the topless girls in the Page 3 of the Sun tabloid in London
and he thinks about it. I remember him once saying we have to have
a moral compass, but at the end of the day we have to have a
bottom line."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Nothing, Neal says, nothing is more important in
Murdoch's life than winning."
<p>
<dd>
A few minutes later, Wallace took up Murdoch's political
views.
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "In the last election campaign Murdoch contributed
more than a million and a half dollars to political candidates,
most of them Republicans."
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "Rupert is a political ideologue. He has his right wing
Republican agenda."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Is it a fact that he once said that Oliver North,
quote 'deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor'?"
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "He thought Oliver North was one of the greatest heroes
in American history."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "He's genuinely a conservative?" 
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "When you regard Pat Robertson in 1988 as the best
Republican candidate you can see just how conservative he is.
Reagan was his hero. He hated Clinton."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Which was obvious during the election campaign to
readers of the Post."
<br>
<dd>
[Video of New York Post headline with photo of Clinton:
"America Decides: Is He Worthy?"
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "And on Murdoch's new cable channel the news also
comes with a conservative spin."
<br>
<dd>
Clip of Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel: "Those who are street
wise in America's big cities know that drug pushers and liquor
stores make a ton of money the day the welfare checks arrive. It's
a tough thing to say, but it's true."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Ted Turner disdains all this. He believes Murdoch's
political bias contaminates his news coverage."
<br>
<dd>
Turner: "He looks down his nose at do-good, honest journalism.
He thinks that his media should be used by him to further his own
goals."
<p>
<dd>
This from a man who put Barbara Pyle in charge of CNN and TBS
environmental shows. In 1990 she boasted: "I feel that I'm here on
this planet to work in television, to be the little subversive
person in television. I've chosen television as my form of
activism. I felt that if I was to infiltrate anything, I'd do best
to infiltrate television."
<p>
<dd>
Two observations about the Wallace story:
<br>
<dd>
a) CBS won't concede any bias in 40 plus years of
broadcasting, not even in last year's Eric Engberg bashing of the 
flat tax which Bernard Goldberg was ostracized for calling biased,
but manages to find it on a four-month-old cable network.
<br>
<dd>
b) When Murdoch is liberal (Fox TV and sex in London tabloid)
it's because he wants to make money. But when what he does is
conservative (supposedly) Wallace assumes it's because Murdoch is
conservative. So if Murdoch's personal views effect his news
operations why can't the same be said off those overseeing every
other media outlet? 
<P>
<a name="7">
<dd>
7) In his new book Dick Morris reported that President
Clinton cannot type and thus writes his speeches on a notepad. In
her CBS Sunday Morning interview First Lady Hillary Clinton also
revealed that she's not quite up on modern technology. Discussing
what she'll do when daughter Chelsea goes to college in the fall,
she told Martha Teichner:
<br>
<dd>
"We'll just have to figure out as many ways as possible to
stay in touch with her, both through e-mail, which I know nothing
about but will have to learn, or through actual visits with her."
<p>
<dd>
They can't use computers. Just the kind of people to serve as
a bridge to the 21st century.

<P>
<a name="1">
<P>
1) Three big newspapers on Thursday, January 16 uncovered different 
new aspects in the John Huang/Democratic fundraising saga:
<ul>
<li>
    Thursday's Washington Post front page headline: "Guest Lists at White 
House Didn't Include Rap Sheets: Some at DNC Fund-Raising Coffees Ran Afoul
of Law." The Post reported that since full background checks were not run 
on large donors attending coffees with the President at the White House 
that some criminals got in to talk with Clinton.
<li>
    The Los Angeles Times front page: "Papers Show Huang's Policy Role at 
Commerce: Documents Contrast with Assertions that Figure in Democratic 
Fundraising Scandal Had Minimal Duties." 
<li>  
    Reporter Alan Miller's lead: "Newly disclosed Commerce Department 
documents indicate that controversial fundraiser John Huang was 
considered an expert on Asian affairs when he worked at the 
agency and had a voice in U.S.-Asia commercial policy, despite Clinton 
administration assertions that his duties there were largely administrative."</ul><dd>
Miller explained: "The issue is a sensitive one because of looming 
questions over whether Asian donors of large amounts of money later 
solicited by Huang were given insights into U.S. policy or other favors 
in return for their contributions." Further, Miller discovered that Huang 
retained his top secret clearance "for a year while he was raising money 
because Commerce officials failed to have it lifted."
<BR>
<DD>
    Offering an answer as to what influence Huang may have exerted, The 
Boston Globe's page one headline declared: "Clinton Policy Shift Followed 
Asian-American Fundraiser."
<BR>
<DD>    Reporter Michael Kranish began: "President Clinton made a last-minute 
about-face last year on his immigration policy, a reversal that brought 
the White House in line with the top priority of Asian-Americans who had
paid $12,500 each a month earlier to attend a fundraising dinner with
Clinton that generated $1.1 million. Clinton made his reversal after the 
Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman, John Huang, waged an intensive 
effort to influence Clinton's immigration policy, according to documents 
reviewed by the Globe."
Huang wanted to make sure the foreign born brothers and sisters of 
naturalized citizens could immigrate.
<BR>
<DD>
    Three big stories. How were they covered Thursday night? Let's go 
show by show:
<ul>
<li>ABC's World News Tonight: Nothing
<li>CBS Evening News: Nothing
<li>NBC Nightly News: Zilch
<li>CNN's The World Today (10-11pm ET): Not a word.</ul>
<DD>But CNN found time for a piece by Claire Shipman on how the White House 
handles 10,000 letters a day and who can reach Clinton through his personal
Zip code. Plus, at about 10:45 ET, a live report from Bob Franken on the status
of the still-to-be released special counsel report on Newt Gingrich.
<DD>It should be noted that CNN's Inside Politics did run a full report by 
Brooks Jackson examining the immigration story broken by the Boston Globe.<BR>
<P>
<a name="2">
<BR>
2) USA Today's Supreme Court reporter, Tony Mauro, is in love not 
with the law but with Laurence Tribe, the liberal Harvard law professor 
always on the Democratic list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Just 
try to make it through Mauro's assessment of Tribe's January 8 performance
as advocate for assisted suicide in oral argument before the Court. MRC 
media analyst, and aspiring personal injury lawyer, Steve Kaminski came 
across Mauro's oozings in the January 13 edition of Legal Times. Gushed 
Mauro:
<BR>
<DD>    "Tribe's detractors think his arrogance is finally catching up with him. 
'He was his usual glib self,' one veteran practitioner sniffed after the 
argument. But Tribe has a lot to be arrogant and glib about. There is 
still no one better on his feet, no one better able to respond to questions 
from the justices with a fully developed and usually persuasive response.
<BR>
<DD>    "But sometimes he seems too nimble, too cerebral, too able to see 
contradiction and ironies and nuances light-years before the justices and
other mere mortals are able to. Especially coming in the last quarter of a 
two-hour argument, he seemed to make the justices' heads hurt.
<BR>
<DD>    "Baryshnikov probably has had the same effect on dance aficionados -- 
too much dazzle to take all at once. Maybe Tribe needs to slow down and 
simplify his routine the next time out -- and dance the macarena instead 
of Swan Lake." 
<P>
<a name="3">      
<BR>
3) MRC media analyst Clay Waters caught two examples of reporters 
explaining away the offenses of Congressman Jim McDermott, the Democrat
accused of giving to the New York Times the tape of the Newt Gingrich 
cellular call. 
<BR>
<DD>
    First, on Thursday's CNN & Company Chicago Tribune reporter Ellen 
Warren insisted: "I'm not trying to minimize the offense here, though 
I would have to suggest that the ones of Speaker Gingrich look 
considerably more severe than Mr. McDermott's."
<BR>
<DD>
    Second, the January 16 New York Times included a news analysis 
piece from Adam Clymer, the reporter who wrote the January 10 story 
revealing the Gingrich phone conversation. Clymer lamented how the 
Gingrich ethics probe has been sidetracked. But instead of condemning 
McDermott or his own role in the process, Clymer said the Republicans 
were wrong on the substance. And he actually criticized Democrats for 
not being aggressive enough.
<BR>
<DD>    Clymer argued: "The case is also playing out on a more substantive
level, emerging as a test of the House's ability to perform its 
constitutional duty to judge and discipline its own members....
<BR>
<DD>    "As a political matter, the Republicans managed brilliantly 
on the last two weekends of television talk shows to keep the focus
where they wanted. First, they emphasized how trivial the charges against 
the Speaker were -- the phrase 'jaywalking ticket' was used to describe 
breaches of tax law and furnishing untrue information to the committee.
The next weekend they stressed how bad it was for a Democrat to 
make a taped telephone conversation public.
<BR>
<DD>    "Of course, they could not have done it without the Democrats' 
giving them a clear field. The first weekend the Democrats had 
available a Time magazine article suggesting that the leadership, 
possibly waving campaign money, put pressure on two ethics committee 
members to write an extraordinary letter telling colleagues to vote 
for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. The Democrats hardly brought it up.
<BR>
<DD>    "Then last weekend the Democrats effectively failed to make their 
case that the taped conversation, whatever its ancestory, showed that 
Mr. Gingrich had broken his promises to the ethics committee."
<BR>
<DD>
    Allow me to interpret: Hey, Democrats, we in the media are doing
all we can to provide you with the ammunition to blast Newt out of 
the Speaker's chair, but you guys keep blowing it.<BR><P>

<DD>
"I don't know if I have a liberal bent...But it is fair to say it's 
very difficult for a black man in this country to be of a conservative 
bent. That's a fair statement. It's very difficult to be an African-
American male, and have an African-American son who is going to be 
18 years of age, and hear things like cops want to crack down and 
send more to prison, to hear calls for tougher statutes, less welfare, 
less programs for the poor, and less things for people of color. 
If that says I'm not conservative, so be it."<br>
-- Bryant Gumbel in the January 2 USA Today, the day before his 
last morning as co-host of NBC's Today.<p>
<BR>
<center><u>Gingrich the Assassin</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>    
"Newt Gingrich's problem, I've always thought, he's like Lenin.
They both made a revolution by shooting people -- Newt shot
Democrats, Lenin shot everybody -- and then they didn't have
enough sense to stop shooting once they won. So, I mean, once you
win, you say, 'Okay, now I've shot all your relatives, but you're
a good guy, let's work together.' Instead, Newt shut down the
government and kept on trying to shoot Democrats."
-- ABC's Sam Donaldson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, January 8.</p>
<DD><p>
Margaret Carlson, Time: "If we didn't have Newt Gingrich having
brought down Jim Wright on, on, I think, picayune, as picayune as
this, then I think there would be less hostility towards him at
this moment."
<BR>
<DD>
Andrew Ferguson, The Weekly Standard: "Jim Wright was trying to
line his own pockets in the most sordid, squalid sort of way...."
Carlson: "But he [Gingrich] was lining his own personal power
pockets, which is just as bad."<br>
-- December 28 Capital Gang on CNN.<p></p>
<DD>"Not just maybe from a technical point of view, but you had the
Speaker, somebody who led the assault on Jim Wright, he never
ended up getting prosecuted, he never broke the law. Doesn't the
Speaker's credibility kind of get diminished by this and doesn't
he become a symbol of somebody who broke the rules as opposed to
somebody who followed the rules? Doesn't this give you a
credibility problem?"<br>
-- CBS reporter Rita Braver to U.S. Rep Chris Shays (R-Conn.), 
December 29 Face the Nation.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Cronkite the Censor</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"It's [the Internet] at the moment highly dangerous; I hope that
we pacify it in the near future. A three-page, very slickly done
presentation alleged that I was drunk in an Orlando restaurant
and spit in a man's soup. And no way to trace it whatsoever. It
seems to me that these sources of so called information should
have to identify themselves. There should be a sense of
responsibility placed upon them to stand behind what they report.
I just abhor any form of censorship, but I do not think there's
anything wrong at all with banning anonymous information."<br>

<br>
Most Decisive Campaign Moment: "Sadly, the flap over the
Indonesian campaign contributions. The only thing that moved the

conditioned by nearly half a century of cold war. Strength and
toughness trumped everything else. At one military briefing
during the 1980s, Reagan was shown models of American missiles.
The American power phalluses were long and white; the Soviets',
shorter and black. We were still safely ahead, but only by the
margin of our machismo."<br>

<br>  December 30, 1996/January 6, 1997 issue. <p>

"There's an ethnic undertone to this. If these were Greeks, or
American Jews, or Irish-Americans rather than Asian, some of this
wouldn't have the same undertones."<br>
-- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus on 
Indogate/Donorgate,<br>   January 4 Inside Washington.<p>
<BR>
<DD>
"I'll take Phil Gramm. Buchanan was always a sideshow and a
cartoon. But Gramm was serious, but a serious divider. He was a
classic wedge-issue politician that would have driven us apart."<br>

most pleased left the presidential race, Dec. 28.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Criminal Welfare Reform Will Bring Starvation</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"The most shameful act of '96 was welfare reform....welfare
reform became a political football in '96, an easy way to kick
around the poor and especially poor children and immigrants, even
legal immigrants. Bill Clinton thought the GOP had a hot issue,
so he closed his eyes and signed a bill that punishes children
and people who want to work, but can't find a job in a tough
market for entry level employment. This was a criminal act,
further dividing us as haves and have nots. It was shameful."<br>
-- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang,
December 29.<p>
<BR>
<DD>       
"Welfare Ends. Acknowledging that the new law was 'seriously
flawed,' President Clinton signed it anyway, ending welfare as we
know it....Supporters said the new law would get people on their
feet, but criticism came from many quarters: from states that
said they couldn't meet the deadlines, from social workers who
said the new system will plunge more people into poverty, from
three top federal officials who resigned in protest. 'I think a
lot of people will start starving,' said Shawn Cornett, a
22-year-old welfare recipient in Kentucky."<br>
-- AP reporter Helen O'Neill in year-end story summarizing the 
top ten stories of 1996.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Bombing Bob Dornan</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"Robert Dornan. B-1 Bob went ballistic after narrowly losing his
House seat in Orange County, California, to Hispanic financial
analyst Loretta Sanchez. Threatening to sue her for election
fraud, Dornan called Sanchez a 'liar' and said 'the whole thing
stinks to high heaven.' Of course, sour grapes were to be
expected from the former fighter pilot who once grabbed a fellow
Congressman by the collar and called him a 'draft-dodging wimp.'
Sanchez's campaign manager, John Sullivan, spoke for many when he
said of Dornan, 'He's been, and continues to be, a national
disgrace. All we can say is Adios.' The bad news is that Dornan
will now have more time for his second job as Rush Limbaugh's
substitute host."<br> 
-- Time on "Worst Public Performances of 1996," December 23.

<center><u>"Growing" Left</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"[Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu was a possibility because his
election was quite a surprise. He had a lot of people hoping that
he would in fact grow in the job and become a peacemaker and so
far that hasn't happened."<br>
-- Time Deputy Managing Editor James Kelley, CNN's Time "Man of 
the Year" special, Dec. 23.<p> 
<BR>

<center><u>Media Bias: A Ditsy Notion</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"The latter [Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes] has made his fervent
mantra the ditsy notion of the media having perverted the United
States by being a cesspool of lefty ideologues. Sure, as in ABC's
David Brinkley publicly calling President Clinton a bore."<br>

<P>
Bryant Gumbel:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>

Jimmy Carter:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>

Gumbel:
<P>

 "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?"

"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <DD>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.
<P>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <DD>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.
<P>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?"
<DD>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.

"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <DD>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
<br>
<b>vs.</b>
<P>
<br>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <DD>-- Clift, later in the same show.

<CENTER><H3>Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <DD>-- New

memoirs, October 20.

<CENTER><H3>It's Her Ideas, Stupid</H3></CENTER>
<P>

CBS reporter Rita Braver:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
</blockquote>
<P>
Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
"So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out."

<CENTER><H3>Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <DD>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <DD>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."
<P>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <DD>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.
<p>
<BR>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<br>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss."<DD> -- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Very Questionable Sources of Information</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <DD>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.
<P>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <DD>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.

CNN's Brooks Jackson is usually one of the most balanced
and least gullible reporters on TV, taking on the campaign
rhetoric of both sides. But on Friday's (December 6) Inside
Politics he seemed to have let down his guard.
<P>
    Sitting beside substitute anchor Charles Bierbauer, he told
viewers: "Well, Charles, one of the more bizarre episodes may have
gotten a little less bizarre today. Back in October, attention
focused on the Buddhist temple in California where Democrats
raised $140,000 in an event attended by Vice President Al Gore.
The Wall Street Journal, back then, quoted a Buddhist nun who had
given $5,000 as saying the money was not hers, that it had been
given to her by the real donor who did not want to be identified.
But that would be illegal, so that was news, embarrassing to the
Vice President and to the Democratic Party. Now, that Buddhist nun
has changed her story and is saying the money was hers all along.
We are told she has filed a statement with the Federal Election
Commission, which is investigating, saying the money came not from
some secret donor but from her own savings and from offerings of
persons who supported her work at the temple, Charles."
<P>
<blockquote>
    Charles Bierbauer: "And, why do we suppose Brooks that she
might have once told the Wall Street Journal the money was not
hers?"
<P>
    Jackson: "We are told in this statement that she didn't know
quite how to handle a call from this national news reporter and
told what she hoped, or thought, was a harmless lie just to get
him off the phone. Turns out it was not so harmless."
<P>
</blockquote>
    How about a more logical scenario: When called by the reporter
she innocently told the truth. After DNC lawyers panicked they
came up with a legal explanation. Indeed, the December 2 Wall
Street Journal reported that "Democratic lawyer Peter Kelly"
became "closely involved with" allegations "that fraudulent
contributions may have been made to the Democratic Party during a
fundraising event at a Buddhist temple in California. 
<blockquote>    
<P>
"Mr. Kelly is a prominent Democratic fundraiser himself and
attended the temple event. After the controversy broke, he emerged
as the temple's lawyer...On the day that this newspaper published
a front page article quoting a Buddhist monk, Man Yah Shih, saying
she gave $5,000 at the fundraiser with money that wasn't hers, Mr.
Kelly called the woman and questioned her and was told
subsequently the same thing. Ms. Shih then left her temple for a
'retreat' overseas, from which she didn't return until after the
election. She now won't talk to reporters, referring all calls to
Mr. Kelly."

Here's a sentence apparently thought "outlandish" by New
York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "The powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people."
<P>
    That's the 10th Amendment. Here's her take on the Supreme
Court's review of the Brady gun control law. From the December 6
Washington Week in Review on PBS:
<blockquote>
<P>  
  "The Brady gun control law has been challenged, on of all
things, not on gun control grounds, but on federalism grounds, on
states rights grounds, because the bill has a provision that
requires local Sheriffs, the local law enforcement officials, to
do the background checks during the five day waiting period to
make sure a prospective gun purchaser is not a convicted felon.
And the local Sheriffs, backed by the National Rifle Association,
are arguing that this violates states rights because it in effect
is a commandeering by the federal government of the processes of
local government to make the locals officials do the Fed's work. 
And on the face of it, it sounds like a sort of outlandish
argument, you know, what local law enforcement officials do is
background checks, it's a very common kind of procedure. But this
argument has a lot of force these days because this case is part
on an ongoing review at the court and in the federal courts
generally about the whole relationship between the state and
federal government. So it's quite a potent argument, actually."

Sunday's Reliable Sources showed how the CNN program,
which is supposed to critique the news media, does anything but as
panelists pounce on anyone who dares draw attention to bias. 
<P>
    The December 8 guest panelist: former Washington Post reporter
William Powers, fresh from his inaugural New Republic piece on the
media. He's now a Senior Editor of the magazine. Regulars Marty
Schram of Scripps Howard, Bernard (I only own rust colored ties)
Kalb, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post as well as Jane Shaw of
the Los Angles Times spent an entire segment attacking Powers. One
by one they argued how preposterous they found his thesis.
<P>
    And what did Powers assert? In his December 16 New Republic
piece he showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton character
issue during the campaign. After explaining how Clinton staffers 
convinced network producers to not air some stories, Powers 
explained:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "Why, besides the skill of its practitioners, has the White
House 'outreach' worked so well? Simply put, because Clinton and
his people are, to most journalists, culturally sympathetic. What
every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every
reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal.
Most Washington reporters share with the Clinton aides a language,
a value system, a set of buttons. Outrage at, say, 'partial birth
infanticide' is not one of the buttons of this class. Outrage at
'right-wing abortion activists' is.
<P>
    "When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal
journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they
are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no
plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held
they're mostly unconscious. All of which means that, had a
Republican President been up for re-election this year, facing the
same array of ethical problems Clinton faced, the scandals would
have gotten more ink. Recall the alacrity with which the
journalism establishment seized on the sexual allegations against
Clarence Thomas, John Tower and Bob Packwood."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Of course the MRC has never seen a plot, but it would be nice
if some media people of influence would realize this "unconscious"
bias before we put "former" before their name.

Thought you could escape from Bryant Gumbel after January
3, his last Today day? Friday's New York Post brought bad news.
The Post's Josef Adalian reported: 
<blockquote>
<P>
"There's an increasingly hard-to- ignore buzz among ABC News staffer that a deal between soon-to-depart 
Today show anchor Bryant Gumbel and ABC could be a match made in 
Nielsen heaven....Over the last few days speculation among ABC News 
insiders has become commonplace that...network execs are more than 
willing to guarantee Gumbel a 10pm Thursday newsmagazine showcase 
on ABC."

<a name="COLA">
1) A congressionally appointed panel reported Wednesday that
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has overstated inflation, thus
leading to higher than necessary entitlement program payments. For
1996 they estimated the CPI was 1.1 percent too high. ABC and CBS
approached the issue not from the view of saving taxpayer money
but from the perspective of what recipients will lose and how such
an adjustment will mean more money for the government -- as if
it's the government's money that's being improperly spent. 
<P>
<DD>
    Here's how Peter Jennings led the December 4 World News
Tonight: "We begin tonight with money. Maybe a little less for
you, depending on who you are, and certainly a little more for
Uncle Sam."
<BR>
<DD>
    Reporter Lisa Stark then explained how "One third of the
federal budget is tied to the CPI, so cutting the official
inflation measurement 1.1 percent would lower all government
payments based on the cost of living, saving the government a
trillion dollars over the next twelve years. But cutting those
payments would affect 60 million Americans, including seniors who
stand to lose an average of $100 dollars a year in Social
Security."
<BR>
<DD>
    Patrick Burns of the National Council of Senior Citizens then
asserted: "It's a very simple, stealth, back door way of balancing
the budget. And it's really not based on science, it's based o
political opportunism."
<P>
<DD>
    Of course seniors wouldn't "lose" $100. They'll still get a
hike from the current payment.
<P>
<DD>
    On Wednesday's CBS Evening News Dan Rather, as usual,
forwarded the victim angle: "A plan officially proposed in
Washington today could effect the incomes of millions of
Americans, especially those older or at the lower end of the
economic scale." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Ray Brady elaborated: "From seniors to taxpayers, a special
congressional commission fired a shot today that could be felt by
anyone getting a government check."
<p>
<dd>
    Brady aired a soundbite from commission head Michael Boskin:
"The Consumer Price Index is substantially, substantially
overstating the true change in the cost of living by about 1.1
percentage points per year."
<br>
<dd>
    Brady continued: "Sound like economic gobbledygook? The
Consumer Price Index is the nation's main measure of inflation.
Government statisticians use it to figure out how much to pay in
food stamps, school lunches and Social Security, all of which go
up or down with inflation. Take the average Social Security check:
It will rise from $724 to $745 dollars a month in January, but it
would rise to just $737 dollars, a difference of eight dollars if
the congressional commission has its way."
<br>
<dd>
    Margrit Pittman, a Social Security recipient at a senior's
center illustrated the point: "For many people who come here,
eight dollars a month is a big loss. That may be the only eight
dollars they have to ever go to the movies."
<P>
<DD>
    There you have it. Transfer $13 per month more to Social
Security recipients, instead of $21 more, and they'll no longer be
able to see a movie. 
<P>
<a name="Dornan">
2) In his Monday (December 2) USA Today "Politics" column
reporter Richard Benedetto favorably examined the Carl Rowan and
Georgie Ann Geyer books which contend racial/ethnic tensions are
rising. Near the end Benedetto asserted: "Despite the authors'
bleak outlook, however, there were signs of hope in the last
elections." Benedetto cited three examples: First, five black
Congressmen won majority white districts; second, an Asian won the
race for Governor of Washington; and third:
<BR>
<DD>
    "Newly registered Hispanic-American voters provided critical
votes in many elections, most notably in the defeat of the
bombastic Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif."
<P>
<a name="foodstamps">
3) An editorial in the December 4 Washington Times noted
that Congressional Budget Office figures show "that the net effect
of welfare reform will be to increase annual federal poverty
spending by 7 percent per year through 2002." AFDC, food stamps,
Medicaid, SSI, child nutrition, etc. "will increase by 50 percent
from $198 billion in 1996 to $297 billion in 2002. With inflation
projected to average 2.8 percent a year, the 7 percent nominal
increase in federal poverty spending translates into an inflation-
adjusted increase of more than 4 percent a year."
<P>
<DD>
    That isn't the picture portrayed on network news. On the
Thanksgiving Day CBS Evening News substitute anchor Harry Smith
announced: "For the first time in decades the federal government
will no longer guarantee open-ended help to the poor. Case in 
point, food stamps. As Diana Olick reports, this could mean hunger
in America will grow, even in places famous for food and plenty of it."
<BR>
<DD>
    MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed Olick's report from New
Orleans. She began: "In a city that celebrates every street
corner, where Cajun spice walks out of every doorway and century
old eateries lure patrons from all walks of life a drafty downtown
soup kitchen is preparing for an onslaught."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick went on to explain that "On March 1st, a provision in the
new welfare reform law will cut off food stamps to all able bodied 
adults ages 18 to 50 with no dependents, who don't have a job."
She found one not-so-hard working victim: "37 year old Denise Lee
has been on food stamps most of her life. She doesn't want to
work, but she's now planning to get a job. She fears though that
others will turn to crime instead to pay for food."
<br>
<dd>
    Denise Lee: "They say times is hard and crime is up and this
and that but they ain't seen nothing yet. They ain't seen
nothing."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick: "In the 35 year history of the food stamp program there
has never been a cut this drastic. More than one million people
nationwide will be affected. That's nearly 2,000 people in New
Orleans alone. But lawmakers say this cut is critical and the 
success of the welfare overhaul is riding on it."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick then allowed Ohio Congressman Robert Ney to argue: "This
is going to force the federal government, and the state
government, and the local government right down to the most local
levels to talk about how to help people, how to have opportunity."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick concluded "The cut in food stamps will force many people
to go to work. But in New Orleans, where there are more people
than jobs, some, like Denise Lee are worrying how they will carry
this new financial burden once the government stops carrying 
them. Diana Olick, CBS News, New Orleans."
<p>
<dd>
    Only at CBS is a 4 percent increase considered a "drastic
cut."
<P>
<a name="Atlanta">
4) Continuing CBS's victimization theme, MRC analyst Steve
Kaminski caught this story on homeless which aired on the December
1 CBS Evening News. Anchor John Roberts began: "All big cities
have homeless people, it's a growing problem marked by
controversy. What to do about it? Well, the city of Atlanta has an
answer: outlaw homelessness. But that approach, says Jim Axelrod,
is causing even more controversy."
<P>
<DD>
   Reporter Axelrod started by showing viewers a mother with kids
who must ride a bus each night to find shelter: "Like most
families, Xena Hampton and her kids have a bedtime ritual. Unlike
most families, their ritual is boarding a bus to find a bed.
Which, this night, takes them twenty miles away. They are
homeless, and now a new law could make them criminals."
<br>
<dd>
    Anita Beatty, homeless taskforce: "It's immoral, it's
unethical, it's, most probably, unconstitutional."
<br>
<dd>
    After another soundbite from a homeless advocate, Axelrod
continued: "The biggest problem Atlanta's homeless advocates have
with the new law is that most people targeted have nowhere else to
go. The shelters here, they say, have enough beds for one out of
seven people who need them."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod allowed Atlanta Council President Marvin Arrington
explain: "You've got to get up and go to work every day and that's
not being inhumane, that's caring about yourself and caring 
about the environment that you live in."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod also aired a clip of a Wendy's manager complaining
about a homeless man urinating in front of his restaurant, but
proceeded to end with a hit on the law: "Opponents of the law will
now head to the courts worried that Atlanta's solution to this
problem will soon spread across the country. Jim Axelrod CBS 
News, Atlanta." 
<br>
<dd>
We'll never run out of victims for CBS to portray.

Gumbel's Morning Devotions
<BR>
<DD>
<i>Bryant Gumbel:</i> "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Jimmy Carter:</i> "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Gumbel:</i> "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?" -- Exchange on Today about Carter's new book, Living
Faith, November 18.
<p>
<dd>
Time Does DNC Damage Control
<br>
<dd>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <i>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <i>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?)"
<i>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Eleanor "Sybil" Clift
<br>
<dd>
"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he

seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <i>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.</i>

"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <i>-- Clift, later in the same show.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fabulous Clinton Cabinet
<br>
<dd>
"Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the
Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any
more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who
is the Treasury Secretary?" <i>-- Tom Brokaw during NBC News election
night coverage.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
<br>
<dd>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <i>-- New
York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's
memoirs, October 20.</i>
<p>
<dd>
It's Her Ideas, Stupid
<br>
<dd>
<i>CBS reporter Rita Braver:</i> "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
<i>Hillary Clinton:</i> "So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out." <i>-- CBS Evening News story, November 25.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
<br>
<dd>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <i>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <i>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Reality Check:
<br>
<dd>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss." <i>-- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Very Questionable Sources of Information
<br>
<dd>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <i>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <i>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fashionably Feminist Fertility

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT>On Monday's CBS Evening News (November 25), 
Rita Braver reviewed First Lady Hillary Clinton's activities while
accompanying the President in Asia. Braver relayed that 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Her theme has been equality and opportunity for women, whether
speaking to thousands or to just a few. In Bangkok, she
comforted a former prostitute now dying of AIDS. And 
later made the point that if women are educated they are not
forced to turn to prostitution."  
 </blockquote>
<P>    
Following a clip of Mrs. Clinton, Braver continued:
 <P>
<blockquote>    
"But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still stirs up controversy at
home. In a Time magazine interview, she talked about her plans
to travel the U.S., monitoring the administration's new welfare
reform policies. The White House immediately denied that 
the First Lady will have any formal role. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is never to express opinions or ideas."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "So it's a kind of difficult position and I
think the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you
do and get through it and wait for the first man to hold the
position and see how that turns out."
<P> 
</blockquote>   
Braver: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"And sources close to the First Lady say she is
still struggling to define exactly what her role will be in her
husbands next term. How to do work that is important 
but not controversial. Rita Braver CBS News, Bangkok, Thailand."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Hmmm. Maybe it's not that she expresses ideas, maybe it's
the socialist ideas that she expresses that people don't like.

A CyberAlert recipient alerted me to a November 25
Reuters story on the same topic that he saw in Yahoo, from where
I downloaded the story headlined "Hillary's Role on Welfare
Played Down."
<P>
    The piece, datelined Manila, began: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
was at the center of a new controversy on Monday after she
suggested she wanted a 'formal role' in shaping policy on U.S.
welfare reform."
<P>
    Several paragraphs later the Reuters dispatch asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A draconian welfare reform measure passed by the Republican
Congress and signed into law by Clinton at the height of the
U.S. presidential campaign in October ends a 60-year guarantee
of federal aid to the poor. It is expected to deprive at least a
million people of public assistance over the next few years."

 Monday's resignation by FDA Commissioner David Kessler
received full stories on all the evening newscasts November 25.
But NBC's Robert Hager provided the most glowing assessment of
the man who fought to expand the agency's regulatory power.
<P>
    As transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi, here's Hager's NBC
Nightly News story:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Kessler was controversial from the start, loved going after
the big guys, set the tone immediately six years ago by telling
Proctor & Gamble to get the word 'fresh' off its frozen orange
juice. When the company ignored him, Kessler began seizing the
product. P&G backed down. Later Kessler reformed the way we
label all foods, developed a whole new system for listing fat,
cholesterol, and nutrients. Kessler had a law degree from the
University of Chicago and an MD from Harvard Medical. And he was
bipartisan too, appointed by the Republican Bush, kept on by the
Democrat Clinton."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Hager continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "But all this was prelude to his landmark
decision to go after big tobacco, some of the nation's
wealthiest corporations. Call cigarettes a drug, he said, and
regulate them. It had been assumed that Kessler would stay in
office to defend the new regulations from tobacco companies and
see the regulations implemented, perhaps some, by next spring.
But he's reportedly being pursued by several universities and
his wife, once a Manhattan lawyer, is known to have tired of
Washington politics. Also there was recent flap over some of his
expense accounts uncovering dozens of errors and forcing Kessler
to write an $850 reimbursement check to the government. And all
along Kessler had no shortage of detractors."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Following a soundbite from Newt Gingrich on how Kessler was
too cautious in approving drugs and praise from Congressman
Henry Waxman, Hager concluded: "So Kessler will move on, leaving
history to judge the difference he may have made in American
health."
<P>
    Hager spent so much time hyping Kessler's activities as
accomplishments that NBC viewers never learned the other side
from those who thought Kessler symbolized the worst of the
nanny-state. As a November 27 Boston Herald editorial argued:
<P>
<blockquote>
"He thought -- he said -- the brand name 'Fresh Choice' was
misleading. Never mind that right under the name it said 'made
from concentrate.' With no evidence of harm but anecdotes spread
by plaintiffs lawyers so cherished by the Clinton
administration, Kessler ordered silicone breast implants off the
market. After the publication of two impeccable studies that
demolished the case against implants, Kessler has declined to
end the ban, condemning thousands of women to inferior
substitutes."

 Discussing politics with husband and wife team James
Carville and Mary Matalin on the November 24 Meet the Press,
host Tim Russert asked Matalin: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A week before the inauguration in January, the Supreme
Court's going to hear arguments about sexual harassment charges
filed by Paula Jones. Stuart Taylor in the American Lawyer, a
long piece where he lays out the charges by Paula Jones against
Bill Clinton, Anita Hill against Clarence Thomas and says the
evidence involving Jones is overwhelming compared to that of
Anita Hill. Mary Matalin, how big of a political story 
and a media story is this going to be?"
</blockquote>
<P>   
 Well, so far it hasn't been much of one. As far as I've seen
it still hasn't been mentioned on Nightly News or Today. In
fact, the only broadcast network coverage it's gotten was in a
late October World News Tonight story in which ABC's Jeff
Greenfield used the lack of coverage given the blockbuster
article as an example of why conservatives see liberal bias.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)  </FONT>Later in the same Meet the Press (November 24) Russert
played a tape of Whittaker Chambers on the old Meet the Press
radio show during which he accused Alger Hiss of being a spy.
<P>
    Two points here. First, reporters were as skeptical about
the guilt of Hiss in 1948 as they were this year when he died.
Second, after the clip, Russert actually laid out the evidence,
something Nightly News never did.
<P>
    From the Friday, August 27, 1948 at 10pm Meet the Press
radio show, here are some of the questions posed to Chambers:   
<P>
Nat Finney, Cowles Publications:
<blockquote>
<P> "I thought you left it a
little unclear as to whether you are certain in your mind, now,
whether Alger Hiss is now a member of the Communist Party or
not."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"I would not presume to say whether Mr. Hiss is or
is not a member of the Communist Party."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Finney:
<P>
<blockquote> "You mean to say that you have not made a check to
find out whether he, as you, has recanted."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I have no possibility of making such a charge.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities subpoenaed me to
tell what I knew about the Communist Party at the time that Mr.
Hiss was a member. I have testified on that, I have not 
presumed to testify what he is now."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Tom Reynolds, Chicago Sun-Times:
<P>
<blockquote> "Are you prepared at this
time, to say that Alger Hiss was anything more than, in your
opinion, a Communist? Did he do anything wrong? Did he commit
any overt act? Has he been disloyal to his country?"
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I am only prepared, at this time, to say that he
was a Communist."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Reynolds:
<P>
<blockquote> "It seems to me then sir, if I may say so, that in
some respects this may be a tempest in a teapot. You say that
you think he was a Communist, you say he was a Communist but you
will not accuse him of any act that is disloyal to the United
States."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>"I am not prepared, legally, to make that charge.
My whole interest in this business has been to show that Mr.
Hiss was a Communist."
   </blockquote>
<P>
    Back to 1996, Russert explained that "Hiss sued Whittaker
Chambers for slander, for what he said on Meet the Press"
and Hiss was later convicted of perjury for his congressional
testimony "because the statute of limitations on espionage had
expired."
 <P>
    Russert then explained: "For the last 40 years until he died
last week at age 92, Alger Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so called 
Venona files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent
from the Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated
30 March, 1945, talks about the activities of a high level State 
Department official, turned Soviet agent, code named A-L-E-S,
ALES. His travel schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the
bottom of the cable, there's a notation by an officer at 
the National Security Agency saying ALES, A-L-E-S was probably,
quote Alger Hiss." 
<P>
    As you saw in past CyberAlerts, when Hiss died Tom Brokaw
said he was "caught up" in a spy scandal. NBC Nightly News made
no mention of the Venona files. In fact, when they were released
this past Spring, of the broadcast networks, only the CBS
Evening News did a story (by David Martin).

The last CyberAlert reported how Peter Jennings and Tom
Brokaw last Friday (November 15) suggested Alger Hiss was
vindicated before his death. Tom Brokaw said Hiss was innocently
"caught up in a spy scandal" and "considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General...saying that Hiss had never
been a spy." Jennings claimed that "Boris Yeltsin said that KGB
files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim" of innocence.
<P>
    Since then I've come across another instance of a network
assuming he was victimized by anti-communism. On Friday's The
News with Brian Williams last week on MSNBC substitute anchor
Brigitte Quinn told viewers, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "Alger Hiss was a symbol of the cold war and the McCarthy
witch hunts that haunted that era. And his public disgrace
propelled Richard Nixon to the White House. Hiss died today at 
a New York City hospital. He was four days shy of his 93rd
birthday. Hiss was a brilliant lawyer and teacher until 1948 when
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused Hiss of giving him State
Department secrets to pass to the Soviets. An ambitious
Congressman named Richard Nixon lead the prosecution against
Hiss, who was convicted and sent to prison. The publicity helped
win Nixon the vice presidential nomination in 1952. As for Hiss,
he fought for vindication for the rest of his life. In 1987 a
Russian General declared that Hiss was never a spy but a victim
of cold war hysteria."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Did she say 1987? Yes, she did.   
<P>
    On Monday's NBC Nightly News (November 18), Tom Brokaw issued
a correction:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Last week on this program we reported on the death of Alger
Hiss, the establishment intellectual who was the center of a long
bitter debate about his Communist Party credentials and suspected
Soviet spy activity. Late in his life, we reported, he felt
vindicated by a Russian General's claim that there were no
records to support the claims that Hiss was a spy. However, the 
Russian General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
</blockquote>
    The next night, Tuesday, November 19, Peter Jennings got
around to noting his error. On World News Tonight he stated:
<P>
<blockquote>    
"We have a clarification tonight of something we reported on 
Friday. In the obituary of Alger Hiss, we reported that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had said that KGB files supported Hiss'
contention that he had never spied for the Soviets as he insisted
all his life. It was actually a member of Mr. Yeltsin's staff,
General Dmitri Volkogonov who made the statement. He later said
that the evidence wasn't conclusive because there were other
Soviet intelligence agencies whose files were not available."
</blockquote>
<P>    
The networks have now conceded the evidence of his innocence
is not solid, but viewers never a got a full understanding of the
depth of proof of his guilt.

 Revelations about John Huang continue to make the front
pages of newspapers, but the television networks have nearly
blacked out the entire scandal. Last week we reported that of the
broadcast network evening shows only ABC's World News Tonight, on
November 12, reported that the Commerce Dept. had launched an
investigation of John Huang to see if he really cut off ties to
the Lippo Group. The last CyberAlert detailed how a series of
revelations in the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New
York Times never made it onto the ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows. 
<P>
    Picking up where that list left off, here's a run down on
coverage this week that I compiled with the assistance of MRC
analysts Steve Kaminski and Gene Eliasen. This review includes the
three evening shows, plus CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) as well
as GMA, This Morning and Today from Sunday through Thursday.
<P>
<blockquote>  
<UL>
<LI>  In five mornings, GMA mentioned Huang in one newscast one
morning. Today and CBS This Morning devoted half of one story.
<LI> In five evenings, ABC raised Huang in two anchor-read
items. CBS devoted one full story. In four nights (no Nightly
News on Sunday) NBC aired one anchor-read brief. 
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Sunday, November 17.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
The day after the front page of the New York Times reported that President Clinton 
had met with and discussed Indonesian policy with James Riady, the former employer
of John Huang. Also, the DNC announced that Huang was let go as
part of post-election reductions.
<P> 
       CNN's The World Today and ABC's World News Tonight: Brief
anchor-read mentions of Huang leaving the DNC. Nothing on Riady
on any show.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Monday, November 18.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times reported that Huang, who claimed he severed contact with Lippo 
when he joined Commerce, made 70 phone calls at Commerce to the Lippo Bank in
Los Angeles. The Washington Times reported that Huang lobbied to
open trade with Vietnam, a position advocated by his former
employer.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on Today or This Morning. One
mention on GMA of Huang's firing. In the evening, nothing on CBS
Evening News and NBC Nightly News. On ABC Jennings did brief item
on the 70 calls. CNN's World Today aired full story by Bob
Franken on Huang-Lippo connections. Franken even noted the money
returned from an April fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple attended
by Al Gore.

 "Close Aide to Clinton Urged Less Candor Over Indonesian" declared 
the front page New York Times headline. The Times reported that aide 
Bruce Lindsey advised describing Clinton's meetings with Indonesian billionaire 
James Riady as "social calls" though after the campaign the White House
admitted policy was discussed.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on GMA, Today or This Morning. In
the evening, nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. The specifics weren't
spelled out on CNN's The World Today, but Wolf Blitzer did report
on a Clinton press conference in Australia that took place at
about 9pm ET:
<P>
<blockquote> 
"Sensitive questions involving a former Democratic Party
fundraiser's activities continue to chase President Clinton here
to Australia, his first overseas trip since his re-election. At a
joint news conference with Prime Minister John Howard, President
Clinton warned reporters not to rush to judgment about all of
this, including his friend and former Democratic Party fundraiser
John Huang. He compared all of this to the highly publicized case
of Richard Jewell who was wrongly accused of planting a bomb at
the Olympic games in Atlanta."
<P>         
 Clinton: "...One of the things I would urge you to do,
remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
totally baseless, I just think that we ought to make sure, we
ought to just get the facts out. And they should be reported
That's what I've encouraged everybody to do."
<P>          
Blitzer: "Mr. Clinton says he's encouraging all of his a
ides to fully cooperate and he denies that there's any official
stonewalling."
</blockquote>
<P>   
 <CENTER><H4>Wednesday, November 20</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 The above press conference is still fresh news and the DNC announces that it has 
returned $253,000 to a Thai businesswoman who had donated funds that were
really from a citizen of Thailand.
<P>          
In the morning, nothing on GMA. Both Today and This
Morning devote half of one story to Clinton's Jewell analogy.
On CBS This Morning Bill Plante reported:
<blockquote>
<P>
          "....Mr. Clinton could not avoid the controversy over
		contributions to the Democrats by wealthy Asians. Asked if his
		staff had stonewalled the issue before the election, he replied
		that he had answered all the questions asked of him and then
		compared himself with Olympic security guard Richard Jewell."
<P>
          Clinton: "One of the things I would urge you to do,
		remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
		what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
		four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
		totally baseless."
<P>          
		Plante: "In fact, the question of whether those
		accusations are baseless or not is likely to shadow Mr. Clinton's
		next couple of years, but he's not likely to have to deal with
		them again on this trip because the next three days in Australia
		are mostly R&R. And tomorrow he gets the chance to do what he
		really wanted to do and that's 18 holes of golf with champion
		Greg Norman."
</blockquote>
<P>
  Of course, a CBS viewer would have no idea what he
stonewalled.
<P>
          In the evening, ABC aired nothing, NBC's Tom Brokaw
mentioned the Thai money return and CBS Evening News actually
aired a full story. Rita Braver highlighted the Jewell analogy:   
<blockquote>
<P>          
"Questions keep swirling around former Lippo Group Vice
President, John Huang. Appointed by the White House to a high
Commerce Department post then transferred to a job as a top
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. And at a news
conference, the President was asked about new allegations that
his staff deliberately delayed releasing information about
Huang's activities until after the election. A major issue, newly
disclosed White House meetings where Huang and his former Lippo
boss, James Riady discussed policy matters with Mr. Clinton. But
though some contributions Huang raised may have been illegal, Mr.
Clinton compared both Huang and himself to Richard Jewell, a man
the FBI incorrectly identified as a suspect in the Atlanta
Olympics bombing."
</blockquote>
<P>
          After a clip of Clinton claiming "I just think that we
ought to make sure we've got, you know, we ought to just get the
facts out," Braver offered a tough conclusion: "But many of those
involved in the controversy have refused to discuss their roles.
And privately, some White House aides are appalled because of the
appearance created by the unusual access of the Lippo Group." 
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Thursday, November 21.</H4></CENTER>
 Nothing on any broadcast network
show. I did not get a chance to check CNN.
<P>
    Concluding his November 18 story CNN's Bob Franklin
suggested: "John Huang may have lost his job, but neither he nor
the controversy he's the center of is about the fade away.
Congressional Republicans will see to that." 
<P>
    They will have to since the networks won't.

Jimmy Carter appeared on Today Monday (November 18) to
plug his new book, "Living Faith." Here's an exchange with Bryant
Gumbel in which Gumbel implicates prayer with Carter's poor
presidential performance:
<P> 
<blockquote> 
  Gumbel: "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>    
Carter: "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>    
Gumbel: "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general
view. What do you think, if anything, that says about the power
of prayer?"

Thursday night NBC Nightly News aired another segment of
its Who Cares series on charitable giving. Over video of the
Statue of Liberty, Tom Brokaw began:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "She's a symbol of hope for those seeking a better life, the
words given to us by poet Emma Lazarus. So, when the welfare
reform bill was passed by Congress this year, a bill that slashed
aid to legal immigrants, deep cuts, some $22 billion dollars
philanthropist George Soros reacted immediately, creating a $50
fund and he named it after Emma Lazarus."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw asked Soros:
<blockquote> 
<P>
"You just gave a lot of money for
immigrants because you worry immigrants, in the eyes of some
people in this country, pariahs."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "His swift and deeply personal response to
the welfare reform bill comes at a time when many are asking
whether private giving can compensate for government cuts in
social services."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw did give Arianna Huffington a chance to explain the
benefits of personal charity, but it's amazing how year after
year there are "cuts in social services" yet the budget keeps
soaring.

Boston held its Achievement in Radio Awards luncheon
Wednesday. The master of ceremonies: Charles Osgood of CBS. The
Boston Globe's Susan Bickelhaupt reported Thursday: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"As he introduced Gina (he didn't share her last name) as the one who
would hand out the awards, he took note of the catcalls and
whistles that greeted her as she took the stage in a floor-length, 
backless green gown. He then asked her to turn around, telling 
the audience, 'There are two sides to people, a front and
a back.'"
</blockquote>
<P>
    As the Boston Herald's Inside Track column observed about
Osgood making "the shapely award presenter...model her
attributes" for the crowd, "If the PC Police were there, he would
have been 'cuffed and hauled away!"

 Thursday the MRC's Free Market Project released a joint
study conducted with a group called Consumer Alert. The study
examined 13 magazines: Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle,
Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle,
McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Women's
Day, and Working Woman.
<P>
    Following is the front page summary of the 12 page study. The
entire report will soon be on our <A HREF="http://www.mediaresearch.org/">web site</A>
, but for more information, to arrange an interview or to get a copy, e-mail

<P>
High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their
ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating
and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and
personal care, and dieting. Surprisingly, many also deal with
public policy issues relating to government activism and women's
and families' health and safety.
<P>
A joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of 13 women's
and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September
1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage. Part I of the
study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was
depicted positively or negatively. Part II looked at the
magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues
relating to health and safety. The study found:
<P>
<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI> In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive
portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more. There
were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less.
<LI> Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government
they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf
of expanded government programs.
<LI> In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were
one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks
depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against
mainstream science.
<LI> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out
of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one
skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is
impractical and wastes resources.
<LI> Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe
drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even
though chlorine provides the most effective protection against
waterborne diseases.
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Recommendations:</B>
<P>
<BR> 
Look for balance in coverage of public policy
issues. Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of
view. Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or
gals) and bad guys? Be skeptical of articles that provide only
anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence.

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Reporting the death of Alger Hiss, in the November 16
Washington Times, reporter Carelton Bryant noted that "Hiss's
supporters and detractors often have camped on opposite sides of
the political spectrum. Liberals, such as Adlai Stevenson and
John Foster Dulles, defended Hiss, saying charges against him
were the product of a communist witch hunt. Conservatives, such
as William F. Buckley and J. Edgar Hoover, castigated Hiss,
saying he was one of many left-leaning intellectuals swayed by
the communists' economic rhetoric during the Great Depression."
<P>
    Guess which point of view the networks took Friday night?
<P>
    On the November 15 <I>World News Tonight</I> Peter Jennings
announced:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "We learned late today that a very controversial American had
died. Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused him a being a communist
who passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional
hearings Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon.
Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood
and his marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end
and last year we reported that the Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim. He
was 92 when he died today."
<P>
</blockquote>
    On CNN's <I>Prime News</I> anchor Linden Soles told viewers: 
<P>   
<blockquote>
 "Alger Hiss, the man at the center of a Cold War spy scandal,
has died at age 92. Hiss was a Harvard educated lawyer with a
distinguished career in government when he was accused in 1948 of
helping pass secret documents to the Soviets. The case attracted
national attention and helped spurn a period of blacklisting and
hysteria over the communist threat. Richard Nixon's political
career got a major boost after his aggressive efforts in Congress
against Hiss. Hiss was later convicted of perjury and spent the
rest of his life trying to clear his name."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Tom Brokaw, on NBC <I>Nightly News</I>, declared: 
<P>
<blockquote>   
 "One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has
died. Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of
rising prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was
caught up in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member
of the Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass
State Department secrets to the Soviets. His case drew
unprecedented attention and he was pursued tenaciously by a
freshman Congressman -- Richard Nixon. Despite the support of
many prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this
country, but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB
archives, saying that Hiss had never been a spy. Alger Hiss, dead
tonight at the age of 92."
</blockquote>
<P>    
As for the vindication suggested by Jennings and Brokaw, both
were apparently referring to a 1992 statement from Soviet General
Volkogonov that the KGB archives contained no evidence that Hiss
had spied for the Soviet Union. But as even The New York Times
obituary on Saturday noted, "he conceded that he could not rule
out the possibility that some records have been overlooked or
destroyed."
<P>
    The New York Times story continued: "In 1993, Maria Schmidt,
a Hungarian historian doing research on the Hungarian secret
police, said she had discovered a stack of documents among the
files of the Interior Ministry in Budapest that implicated Mr.
Hiss as a communist spy."
<P>
    Finally, earlier this year the National Security Agency
released a 1945 message to Moscow from a Soviet spy in Washington
that identified a State Department official as an agent code-named 
"Ales." As the Times reported, "There was a notation by
someone at the National Security Agency suggesting Ales was
'probably Alger Hiss.'"

<FONT SIZE=+2>2)  </FONT> The November 13 CyberAlert reported that ABC's <I>World
News Tonight</I> on Tuesday, November 12 aired a story on the
Commerce Department launching an investigation of whether John
Huang raised money for the DNC while he was at Commerce and
whether he really cut off all contact with the Lippo Indonesian
conglomerate where he formerly worked.
<P>
    NBC <I>Nightly News</I> and CBS <I>Evening News</I> that night: No story. 
And the blackout has continued, a review of broadcast network
evening shows through November 16 found:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>    The November 13 Washington Post reported the Commerce
Department investigation and that DNC Chairman Don Fowler
conceded the party failed the check the legitimacy of donors. The
Washington Times reported on page one that Huang met with Webster
Hubbell after Hubbell resigned but before he plead guilty: "At
the time of the meeting, Mr. Huang had been at the Commerce
Department for 15 days after his resignation as vice chairman of
the Indonesian-based Lippo Group. Hubbell was on the Lippo
payroll after his 1994 resignation and was negotiating with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for testimony in the Whitewater
probe." 
</UL>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The November 14 Washington Post picked up the Washington
Times story on the Huang/Hubbell meeting and detailed how Huang
simultaneously worked at Commerce and raised DNC money.
</ul>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
    <ul>
<LI>A front page story in the November 15 Los Angeles Times
recounted how large donations to the DNC followed a few days after
businessmen met Huang at Commerce. Also on Friday, The Wall
Street Journal revealed that Mark Middleton, the White House aide
involved in fundraising in Taiwan with Huang, "entertained
clients or potential clients in the White House staff restaurant
after he left the government and set up his own consulting
company."
 </UL>
<P>
       Network stories: None
<P>
<UL>
    <LI> The Saturday, November 16 New York Times reported that in
an interview with the paper Clinton admitted "that he twice
discussed policy about Indonesia and China with James Riady, the
Indonesian financier, Democratic contributor and longtime friend
of Mr. Clinton who is at the center of several inquiries into the
influence of foreign money in Washington."

 On Friday The Washington Post's John Carmody reported:
"Senior presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos lunched in
Manhattan yesterday with ABC News President Roone Arledge and his
top aide, Joanna Bistany. Network sources say Stephanopoulos, who
has said he plans to leave the White House soon, is being
considered as a contributor to Sunday morning's This Week as the
program undergoes changes following David Brinkley's retirement
as moderator, and on other news programs, including Good Morning
America."

<blockquote>
    -- "George, did the media last night and today make too much
of this magic 50 percent margin for the President, or was it
internally a big deal?"
<P>
    -- "George, recently in a New Yorker profile that I think
most would argue was very favorable about you, not only did you
mention potential plans to leave, you said, I'm paraphrasing, 'it
was time to grow up,' leading some of your detractors to say 
'what in goodness name was the senior counselor to the President
doing having not grown up, but being senior counselor to the
President.' If you can dispassionately critique your own
performance over the past four years, I'd like you to do so."
<P>
    -- "It was said of the welfare bill when it came up from the
Hill at the time that the choice for the White House was, and
this was a cynical view, either veto it as extreme or sign it and
fix it. Can you fix it?"

  <FONT SIZE=+2> 4)</FONT> Yesterday's CyberAlert reported that a November 10
Washington Post editorial incorrectly argued that many NRA-backed 
candidates, such as Colorado's Wayne Allard, lost. Tuesday's Post 
ran this correction: "In the Colorado election to replace retiring Sen.
Hank Brown, Rep. Wayne Allard was the winner last Tuesday. In an
editorial Sunday we listed him incorrectly as having lost."
<P>
    A nice start, but as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
pointed out to me the Post had also listed "Vince Snowbarger,
Kansas," as "among the other NRA favorites who lost." In fact,
Snowbarger won his House seat race 50 percent to 45 percent for
his Democratic opponent.
<P>
    Maybe next time the Post should fact-check the Handgun 
Control Inc. press release before running it as an editorial.

<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)</FONT> Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman Monday
night ABC Prime Time Live co-host Diane Sawyer recounted an
experience on a recent plane flight:
<P>
<blockquote>
    Diane Sawyer: "The other day, this is your worst nightmare.
It happened to me on the plane. I am sitting there, and I'd been
traveling and traveling and I'm in who knows what time zone,
there is no time zone for which I am in. And sitting next to me
is this woman who has this sumptuous bosom, there's just no other
way to put it. And something must have sublimely set in,
grandmother reveries, or something like that, and the next thing
you know thirty minutes later I wake up and my nose is right in
the cleavage. We are not talking just leaning against, I'm just
buried in there, my little nose. It's true, it's a true story.
And one eye opened and you think 'where am I?' And then the other
eye opens and you look up and there she is, and she's absolutely
benign, like God sent me a pillow. It was beautiful, it was
beautiful."
<P>
    David Letterman: "Had there been complimentary wine on the
flight? Was there a delay and everybody got an extra cocktail, is
that what happened?"
<P>
    Sawyer: "It was just temptation, like you and Morley Safer,
you know how it is."
<P>

    It would be impossible to make this stuff up.

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Past CyberAlerts have quoted examples of reporters
tagging Dole, Gingrich and conservatives as "harsh" and examples
of reporters stating as fact that it was the Republicans who
shut down the government, as if President Clinton had nothing to
do with it. Well, MRC analyst Steve Kaminski alerted me to a
media bias combo quote in which CBS reporter Bob Schieffer did
both. On the November 3 Sunday Morning Schieffer asserted: 
 <P>
<blockquote>   "Newt Gingrich has become sort of a logo for harsh
Republican rhetoric. I don't think there's anybody who would
tell you today that the Republicans maybe did not go a little
too far in the harshness of their rhetoric. They really
irritated a lot of people, poll after poll shows it, local
officials will tell you that, when they shut down the
government. They got the blame for that and I think in some 
ways it really kind of frightened people."

<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> UPN's "Star Trek: Voyager" episode last Wednesday,
November 6, revolved around the crew of the Voyager, which is
from the 24th Century, traveling back in time to 1996 Los
Angeles in order to avert the destruction of the Earth in the
29th Century. The cause of the future disaster: a Mr. Henry
Starling, played by Ed Begley Jr., who heads a computer company
ominously named ChronowerX.
<P>
    Because of a time-travel mess up Starling has obtained
technological know-how from a 29th Century spaceship. The
Voyager crew learns he's an evil businessman who became rich and
powerful by using this knowledge to create a new computer chip
in 1969 and dominate the new industry. They conclude the
"computer age of late 20th century shouldn't have happened." 
In order to keep the Voyager crew's arrival secret, businessman
Starling dispatches one of his goons to murder the astronomer
who alerted him to their arrival. 
   <P>
 Anyway, at one point the camera pans his office and full
screen for a couple of seconds is a picture on a table: a framed
photo of "Starling" shaking hands with President Richard Nixon.

 <FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> The November 10 Washington Post ran an editorial titled
"Slim Sales at the Polls for the NRA." A reliable source, a
CyberAlert recipient, urged me to check the editorial's content.
It reads in part: "Though the big campaign contributions from
the NRA flowed as usual this year, they didn't pay off the way
they once did. Some of the strongest opponents of responsible
handgun and assault weapon controls were among the losers."
Conveniently, the Post supplied a list of these losers: "Among
the NRA favorites who lost....In Senate races, Wayne Allard in
Colorado..."
<P>
    Wayne Allard, known to those outside the Post as Senator-elect 
Allard, captured 51 percent of the vote versus 46 percent for his 
Democratic opponent.            
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> While we're on the Post, the November 11 Weekly
Standard observed: "The Washington Post has editorialized
against color-blind public policies, but it has embraced
colorblindness in an area where color presumably does matter --
in describing the appearance of individuals....we read in
October 26's Post of an abduction from a garage at Tysons II
Galleria mall near Washington: 'Police describe the suspect as
muscular, about 6 feet 1 inch tall and about 190 pounds, with
short dark hair and dark eyes.'...
<P>
    "In fact, the police described the suspect as muscular and
dark-skinned...so at least the warning posters at the mall said
the next day. But the police description was too politically
incorrect to be reproduced by the Post, which is evidently more
afraid of getting angry calls from black 'community leaders'
than it is interested in helping apprehend a rapist.'"
<P>    
Indeed, that's not an isolated example. The November 9 Post
carried an account of a street robbery in D.C. suffered by
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Here's the complete
description of the purse-snatcher as provided by the Post: "The
thief was a man of undetermined age who wore a white satin
jacket, police said."

  <FONT SIZE=+2> 5)</FONT> Here are some poll numbers I never found the space to
run before the election. So, before they become antique:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- A September poll of 1,000 registered voters for the
Freedom Forum (conducted by the Roper Center), found that most
who believe the media are biased think the media are biased to
the left: "Nearly one-third (31%) say coverage favors the
Democratic party, while 9% say coverage favors the GOP. More
than half (53%) regard coverage as balanced."
<P>
    -- Recall how the networks ignored many Clinton scandal
stories that newspapers covered? The same Freedom Forum/Roper
poll showed why that's relevant: "More than half of all voters
(56 percent) said they get most of their information about the
presidential campaign from television. An additional 30 percent
get most of their information from newspapers (17 percent),
radio (11 percent), or magazines (2 percent)." 
<P>
   -- A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll
released October 25 found: "A huge majority of voters (67%)
believe that among four leadership groups in the country, the
news media exerts too much influence on which candidate becomes
President, followed by business corporations (59%), labor unions
(45%) and the churches (15%)."

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> On Friday's PBS Washington Week in Review NBC News
reporter Gwen Ifill offered her view on what the Republican
congressional leaders and Clinton will do next year: 
<P>
<blockquote>   "I don't see any of them talking about entitlement reform in
any real way other than to brand the other guy someone who's
interested in cutting your own mother off."
<P>
    Entitlement reform, as in Medicare? Where has Ifill been?
Isn't that an issue the Republican Congress tried to "reform" in

<FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught the loaded spin from
Time magazine on how Republican House members fared in Tuesday's
election. Writing the cover story for the November 18 issue that
was released last week, Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Nearly half the casualties came from Gingrich's militant
class of 1994, who had pushed the Speaker hardest to the right
and demanded the deepest cuts in popular domestic programs in
their zeal for a balanced budget. Gone are at least six of 71
GOP freshmen, including Dan Frisa of New York, who was defeated
by Carolyn McCarthy, the widow of a victim of the Long Island
Rail Road shooting, who ran on a single-issue platform: gun
control."
</blockquote>
<P>
    I think 17 House Republicans lost by the latest count, so
really only about a third were freshmen. But let's do a little
math based upon Time's numbers. Six of 71 lost. That's 8.5
percent, meaning 91.5 percent of the House freshmen won. Quite a
repudiation of those "extremists." 
<P>
    Also among the Republicans who lost on Tuesday: Peter Blute
and Peter Torkildsen, two moderates who abandoned Gingrich on
some key votes and were gun control advocates.

<FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> As mentioned in the last CyberAlert, on Thursday's
Larry King Live King said David Brinkley's election night
remarks reminded him of "wacko talk radio." Here's the complete
transcript of that November 7 exchange with guest Ted Koppel.
(Diane Rehmm is host of a 10am to noon talk show on a Washington
public radio station and her show is heard on NPR stations
around the country.)
<P>
<blockquote>
    Larry King: "How about the part where he said 'he's a bore,
always will be a bore.'? That sounds, someone called Diane
Rehm's radio show the other day, and this was the first I'd
heard of it, and I was driving along."
<P>  
 Ted Koppel: "I was listening to the same show, heard the same
call."
<P>
    King: "And it was a lady."
<P>
    Koppel: "Very nice lady."
<P>
    King: "And she was disappointed, very nice lady, a fan of
David Brinkley. She was very disappointed. And when I heard the
quote it sounded to me like it was Limbaugh or Liddy or Ollie
North. It was like wacko talk radio. It didn't sound like
Brinkley. In other words, Brinkley's always been irreverent, but
always kind of classy."
<P>
    Interesting to learn that while both King and Koppel listen
to a talk show, it's a public radio talk show.
<P>
    On Friday David Brinkley taped an interview with Bill
Clinton for airing on Sunday's This Week, his last show as host.
Brinkley, who had called Clinton "a bore" and said his election
night speech was full of "goddamn nonsense," began the
interview: "Before we begin I am reminded of something I wrote
years ago. 'It may be impossible to be objective,' I said. 'But
we must always be fair.' Well after a long day election day, and
seven hours on the set, what I said at the end of our election
night coverage was both impolite and unfair. And I'm sorry. I
regret it."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brinkley had the class to apologize for interjecting his
opinion into a newscast. I await Bryant Gumbels's apology for 
insults against Republicans over the years.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="3">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> Reminding one of Nixonian thinking, last week Bill
Clinton promised to "cut out of American politics" his enemies. The
comment has hardly generated any media outrage. I've only seen
it on one TV show: CNN's Late Edition, and then only thanks to Bill
Bennett. On Sunday, November 10 host Frank Sesno raised it
during an interview with Bennett and Mario Cuomo:
   <blockquote>
<P>
 Frank Sesno to Mario Cuomo: "Mario Cuomo I need to ask you
about this, because amid all this hugging and this 'vital
center' and this other nonsense that we hear about that will
soon fade away as we actually get down to the reality, there is
this item that Bill Bennett actually caught in USA Today a
couple of days back that's a pick up from the Associated
Press quoting Bill Clinton as telling political supporters in
Arkansas that he 'will devote a lot of time,' I am quoting from
the paper here, 'going after detractors who pursued him on
Whitewater and other ethical questions.' He called political
attackers, quote, 'a cancer,' and vowed, quote 'to cut them out
of American politics.'"
<P>
    Cuomo: "Excuse me, that was President Clinton?"
<P>    
Sesno: "Yes. That is remarkable stuff. What do you make of
that?"
<P>
</blockquote>
    As Bennett observed, if the President were Republican such a
remark would cause "a firestorm" in the media.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5) </FONT> Speaking of what Sesno termed "nonsense," on the Don
Imus radio show on Thursday, November 7, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw
urged the Congress to forget doing anything conservative and
avoid investigations. Here are some of Brokaw's comments, as
transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: 
<blockquote>
    Though voters kept the Congress in Republican hands Brokaw
saw no endorsement of the 1994 switch: 
    "I don't think it is a status quo election. I think there is
a kind of command, if you will, from the public to move to the
sensible center and let's get some things done....I don't think
that you can say that there's any ideological revolution as the
Republicans claimed two years ago nor do I think this President
can now say that he has this overwhelming mandate. I think what
people have cried out for is some return to common sense in
American politics. And I think that you see that reflected
already in Alfonse D'Amato, his evil twin, Skippy, apparently
has vacated his body and now he says we no longer need these
investigations of Bill and Hillary. I mean it's really one of
the remarkable turnarounds in contemporary politics."
   <P>
 Imus: "Isn't that really from Senator D'Amato covering his
own situation because he's got to run for reelection here in '98
and a lot of these exit polls here in New York suggest that
people well, hate him.
<P>
    Brokaw: "....I think that's what people want. I think that
they want politicians in Washington to solve the real problems
that are going on and when they make an assignment to a special
prosecutor or to the Justice Department, let them do that kind
of investigation....
   <P>
 "And you must remember, a lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential
aspirations four years from now. They'll want to get things done
because I think that's the underlying message from the country
here - solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems
within the administration that need to be investigated, but
there are agencies and ways of doing that without tying up
Congress in these expensive hearings."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>6) </FONT> Finally, on the humorous front, here's a bit of what
Senator John Kerry told Katie Couric on Today Wednesday morning
after his re-election over Bill Weld: 
<blockquote>
   "The fact is that out of the last five Governors of
Massachusetts, four of them have been Republicans. People forget
that about Massachusetts. We are a reflection of the rest of the
country. We're fairly conservative, people want the same things
people want in the rest of the country."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Massachusetts conservative? Reflection of the country? This
the morning after Bob Dole got just 28 percent in the state. He
did worse only in Rhode Island. And, the day after the state's
two GOP House members were turned out. 
<P>
    As for Republican Governors, current Governor Weld is a 
Republican. Before him Democrat Michael Dukakis held the office 
for eight years and he succeeded Ed King, another Democrat who 
beat Dukakis in the 1978 primary. That means two of the last three 
have been Democrats.

1) A front page story in the November 7 Los Angeles Times
reported: "The Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that
it is returning one of its largest 1996 campaign contributions,
$325,000, to Yogesh K. Gandhi because it could not verify that he
was the source of the funds." On Thursday the DNC returned a
$50,000 donation to a Greek businessman. 
<BR><DD>
So how did the networks play this confirmation of the pre-election 
GOP charge that the DNC took money from foreign nationals, which 
is illegal? Not a word on the November 7 CBS Evening News or NBC 
Nightly News. Only ABC's World News Tonight covered it. Reporter 
Jackie Judd put the news at the top of her piece on Republican 
plans to investigate Clinton.
<P>
But Thursday's NBC Nightly News found time to report
D'Amato's announcement and to disparage the quest for information.
Jim Miklaszewski's story started with the news of cabinet
resignations, then moved to D'Amato. Here's the end of his
report: 
<BR><DD>
    Jim Miklaszewski: "One of the Clinton's chief antagonists in
Congress, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, announced his Whitewater probe
is over"
<br><dd>
    D'Amato: "I think if we get into this business of looking
like we're out to fish, to bring up something to embarrass the
President. I don't think that's good for the country."
<br><dd>
    Miklaszewski: "White House officials are under no illusions
and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue investigations
on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's
announcement may signal an end to any high profile political
witch hunts. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the White House."
<p>
When the Senate held four weeks of hearings chaired by
D'Amato in July and August 1995 NBC Nightly News ran a grand
total three stories.

2) Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas has
discovered that Paula Jones may have some credibility. On the
November 3 Inside Washington the panel discussed the new American
Lawyer article in which reporter Stuart Taylor learned that "a
comparison of the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests
that the evidence against the President is far stronger than the
media has let on -- and far stronger than the evidence against
[Clarence] Thomas."
<BR><DD>
On the show Evan Thomas explained: "There are two witnesses
here that matter, there are two friends of Paula Jones that she
spoke to right after the alleged incident. And they do not
generally make their story available to the press, generally.
They talked to one reporter from the [Washington] Post, Mike
Isikoff, and the Post worried about whether to do this story for
a long time, finally ran a kind of somewhat diluted version of
it, and nobody talked to these women. Now, Stuart has gone back
and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale."
<BR><DD>
Nina Totenberg, who first publicized Hill's unsubstantiated
an uncorroborated charges, then asserted: "There are two things
in this article: one is the examination of the evidence which is
fair game and not dramatically new but very interesting and
somewhat compelling. The other is the Anita Hill argument and I
would say that's apples and oranges. This woman is going to get
her day in court or she's going to settle, one or the other."
<P>
When the Jones story first came to light Evan took a bit
different approach. On the May 7, 1994 Inside Washington he
declared:
<br><dd>
"Yes, the case is being fomented by right-wing nuts, and yes,
she is not a very credible witness, and it's really not a law
case at all...some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the
trailer parks...I think she's a dubious witness, I really do."
<P>
The American Lawyer article has been out for two weeks. So
what has Evan Thomas put in Newsweek. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski
reports nothing appeared in this week's or last week's issue.

3) Yesterday's CyberAlert reported how at the end of ABC's
election night broadcast David Brinkley noted the creativity of
his ABC colleagues, and then charged that "Bill Clinton has none
of it. He has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore he is a
bore and will always be a bore." I also predicted that his
remarks would become big news as the journalistic community
cringed at the anti-Clinton remarks. 
<P>
Well, Thursday's newspapers brought plenty of stories and a
remark earlier election night that didn't air on ABC's Washington
affiliate. Just after Clinton finished his speech, at about
12:30am ET, this exchange occurred, as printed in the November 7
Dallas Morning News. (Rush Limbaugh on Thursday also played a tape
of Brinkley's comments.)
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "I wish to say that we all look forward with great
pleasure to four years of wonderful, inspiring speeches full of
wit, poetry, music, love and affection. More goddamn nonsense."
<br><dd>
Peter Jennings: "You can't say that on the air, Mr. Brinkley."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Well, I'm not on the air."
<br><dd>
Jennings: "David, we are on the air."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Too bad. I told you I was leaving."
<P>
<DD>Thursday night the controversy led Larry King's CNN interview
with Ted Koppel. King called the remarks "mean-spirited," and
something he'd expect from "wacko talk radio" hosts like
Limbaugh, Oliver North or G. Gordon Liddy. [There will be more of
King's comments in the next CyberAlert.]
<br><dd>
All fall reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole as "harsh,"
but no controversy erupted. Back on the February 20 Today show
Bryant Gumbel derided Pat Buchanan as "Mr. Puke-anan." 
<br><dd>
I'm still waiting for the media consternation.

4) Here are some more quotes from election night coverage on
NBC and CBS, as collated by Steve Kaminski, Geoffrey Dickens and
Joe Alfonsi.
<ul>
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "How concerned is the President about the potential of his being, sort of, tied down as Gulliver was by the Lilliputians, by all this scandal investigation, ethics investigations that are bound to be unleashed?"
<li><i>Dan Rather to Senator Trent Lott:</i> "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the White House with so-called ethics inquiries?"
<li><i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "At one point Trent Lott was talking about unleashing some investigations of fundraising and other matters at the White House. Do you think he will pull back from that once reality sets in come January?"
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "The Colorado Senate race has been decided. Our CBS News estimate is the seat will remain Republican with Wayne Allard finishing with roughly 51 percent and Tom Strickland somewhat below that. The Democrats thought that Wayne Allard perhaps was, 'too far right' to succeed the retiring Republican, Senator Hank Brown. Turned out to be not the case, Allard wins it for the Republicans in Colorado."
<li><i>Up next, Rather labeled a Democrat, but not as "too far left." He used a milder tag for a Minnesota Senator:</i> "No surprises here, although Paul Wellstone, the Republicans had targeted him. They thought they had him. Frequently called the most liberal member of the United States Senate, but Wellstone has returned for a second term in Minnesota."
</ul>
<P>
Brinkley may have dumped on Clinton, but here's what NBC
viewers got after Clinton's speech:
<ul>
<li><dd><i>Maria Shriver:</i> "Tom, very emotional ending to his speech. Expressed a lot of gratitude. He said he was humbled by this victory. And I don't know if you could tell, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be brushing away some tears. A lot of hugging up on that stage. A lot of tears in this audience. A tremendous amount of emotion here this evening. A lot of young people with smiles on their face but holding each other. Certainly a night that I don't think anybody here will ever forget." <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "We're watching the two couples on stage now.  They are the icons of the baby boomer generation!" <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "That's true!"  <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton. They're handsome families." <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "They're picture perfect!" <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Right!" 
<li><i>Brokaw after 1am ET:</i> "That's 30 Rockefeller Plaza overlooking the ice-skating rink and if Bill Clinton were here tonight he'd be down there skating to his heart's delight obviously because he's been re-elected President of the United States." 
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "We're back. Thirty Rockefeller Plaza there. I half expect to see Jimmy Cagney singing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' and dancing between those flags."
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who is the Treasury Secretary?"
</ul>

5) On Wednesday night's Late Show with David Letterman
actress Marisa Tomei appeared. Here's part of the interview:
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Did you vote yesterday?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Are you happy with the outcome?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I'm very happy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Have you ever met President Clinton?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes I have."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Where'd you meet him? At the White House?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I met him at the White House."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "What was that like?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "It was very sexy, actually. It is that whole feeling."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Sexy in what sense? You're not talking about the President?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Well, it's a round room, first of all, the Oval Office."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He's an enormous guy, isn't he?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: [taken aback, assuming a reference to Clinton's penis size]
"I don't know. [pause] I'm sure. It's why I voted for him."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "I mean he's fat, is what I was driving at."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Oooh."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "I don't think so."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat and I'm going to continue to say so."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "No, he's healthy. He's healthy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "No, they say, you know they released his medical
records like about a month ago to show that he was okay, he can 
run for another four years. And I'm telling you they fudged,
because they said he's 215 [Letterman laughs]. Two-fifteen is
when lunch ends for this guy."
<p>
The gender gap solved. All Bob Dole had to do was meet women in a "round room."

"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession." -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30

Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." -- <i>World News Tonight</i>, October 27, 1992.
<P>
"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." -- Dan Rather,

"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." -- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS <i>Evening News</i>. The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." -- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC <i>Nightly News.</i>

of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.

"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT> If you say something less than glowing about President
Clinton, then you are "harsh." On Monday (November 4) night's
World News Tonight, ABC anchor Peter Jennings told viewers:
<blockquote>    "Some of the harshest language about the President, again
today coming from Ross Perot. Mr. Perot made only one public
appearance today, in his home state of Texas."
</blockquote>
<P>
    And here's Perot's harsh comment: "Would you allow a man with
pending criminal charges to babysit your children? It's a joke.
You wouldn't think about it."

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> In a short World News Tonight segment Monday night Sam Donaldson explained some of the changes in committee
chairmanships that would happen if Democrats take control of the
upper chamber. But only one Senator got an extremist tag:
<blockquote>    "At the Armed Services Committee, you'll find Carl Levin, far
less user friendly to the armed services, would be the chairman.
In Foreign Relations, Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative would no
longer be there. And in Labor and Foreign Relations, Ted Kennedy
would chair once again. If the President wants to try for health
care reform once more, he'd have a friendly committee there."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Yes, he said "Labor and Foreign Relations" when he meant
Labor and Human Resources.

<BR>
     <FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught CBS reporter Bill
Plante adopting liberal spin as fact on Monday's This Morning.
Looking back at the 1996 campaign, Plante asserted at one point: 
   <blockquote> "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made
for TV convention? No way. It really began with this year's State
of the Union address. The President already knew he'd have no
opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled
badly by shutting down the government."

    <FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> On Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN both Margaret Carlson of Time and Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal put their liberal
hearts ahead of their political brains. 
<P>
   Margaret Carlson offered this prediction on the House races,
as transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: "Some of the Democrats
are going to suffer from the down draft from Clinton and the
money. Some of these freshman are going to go and that's great
relief. Helen Chenoweth, her evil twin, Andrea Seastrand in
California, J.D. Hayworth, Steve Stockman, the painter from
Texas." 
<P>
   National Review's Kate O'Beirne jumped in: "More women in
Congress Margaret, what's wrong with you?" Carlson countered:
"You have to reach a certain level of competence."
<P>
    O'Beirne then predicted the GOP would hold the House. Al Hunt
agreed, but: "All the reporting that I've done, suggests that
Kate is absolutely right and I think over 90 percent of the
incumbents are going to be re-elected because it's a good year
for incumbents. But my gut tells me that two dozen of those
Gingrich robots, the freshmen, are going to bite the dust and the
Democrats are going to pick up 25 seats. Mark I'm not sure I
believe it, but it's my prediction and I'm sticking with it."
<P>
    We'll soon know if Hunt's dream of a Democratic House will
come true.

<BR>
   <FONT SIZE=+2>  5) </FONT>Why are Generation Xers (those in their 20s) turned off
by Campaign '96? Here's the explanation of Tabitha Soren from MTV
as espoused on Monday's This Morning: 
   <blockquote> "This year you have two known quantities so young people feel
like they are dealing with people who are political insiders and
that generally turns younger people off. They really feel, our
polls show, that they are disinterested and even the people who
are voting are not really happy with their choices. They feel
like they're sort of choosing between which Menendez brother do
they like better. So, a lot of them also say they'd love to turn
to a third party if they thought they could win. But I think
that's keeping a lot of people away from the process."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
    Between watching all the election night coverage and going to
an election night party, I probably won't have time to do a
CyberAlert for Wednesday morning, so expect the next CyberAlert
Wednesday night/Thursday morning.

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>NPR's Mara Liasson predicts that <a href="#second">in a second term Bill Clinton will propose many new government programs,</a> but that doesn't make him a liberal.
<li><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> says Republicans shut the government down and asserts: "I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide in 1994."
<li>Among the DNC donors listed in the report the Democrats initially refused to release: <a href="#celebs">Hollywood celebrities from Robert Zemeckis to Danny DeVito.</a>
<li>A TV <a href="#host">network host admits supporting George McGovern</a> -- when she was seven years old.
</ol>
<a name="second">
1) A lot of little government programs add up to big government
and putting mandates on business is the latest way liberals have found
to impose their views, but that's escaped NPR's Mara Liasson. On
Washington Week in Review Friday night on PBS (November 1) Liasson
assured viewers that Republican are wrong to tag Clinton a liberal:
<br><dd>
"There's this myth that if Clinton does get the Democrats back in
control [of Congress], he'll revert to the quote 'old Bill Clinton.' The 
Republicans would like you to believe he'll become a liberal again. 
I don't think that's going to happen. I think the White House has 
prepared a second term agenda that is geared with either a razor-thin 
Democratic majority in mind, or Republicans still in control. They are 
going to be able to get the same program through no matter what. And 
it's going to be these small, incremental things, teeny tiny proposals 
that he's made this year, nothing big, no big government programs."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
2) Republicans and conservatives may gain House and Senate seats 
on Tuesday and Bill Clinton is winning by stealing conservative issues
and claiming credit for the accomplishments of Congress, but Sam Donaldson
doesn't think the country has moved right.
<P>
In the roundtable portion of Sunday's This Week with David Brinkley
Sam Donaldson went so far from reality that even Cokie Roberts felt 
compelled to correct him:
<br><dd>
    Sam Donaldson: "George is always seeing a conservative tide. If 
three county commissioners are elected in an off season and they 
happen to be Republican conservative, you say there's a Republican 
conservative tide. I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide 
in 1994."
<br><dd>
Cokie Roberts: "How come only Democratic incumbents lost and no 
Republican incumbents lost?"
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "Because I think it was the voters saying throw the 
bums out."
<br><dd>
Roberts: "But no Republican incumbents lost."
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "But I'm taking about conservative tide. There was an 
anti-Democratic tide, absolutely, Cokie. They said throw these Democrtaic 
bums out they've had all these years in Congress and we don't like it 
and we don't like our lives and they're in."
<br><dd>George Will: "Speaking for conservatives, let's just say 1994 is 
alright with us no matter what you call it."
<br><dd>Donaldson: "Are you going to shut down the government again, did 
that strategy work?"
<P>
<a name="celebs">
3) At a campaign rally in New Jersey on Sunday, actress
Whoopi Goldberg introduced the President. While she's on the
road for the campaign, her friends in Hollywood have been writing
some large checks. When the Democratic National Committee last 
week released a donor list they initially withheld, the Washington
Times checked to see who was among those making the $10.1 million
in donations that arrived in early October. Among the names:
<ul>
<li>TV producer Norman Lear: $80,000
<li>Movie director Robert Zemeckis: $50,000
<li>Actor Robin Williams and wife Marsha: $30,000
<li>Eagles singer Don Henley: $30,000
<li>Actor Danny DeVito: $5,000
<li>Movie Director Rob Reiner: $5,000
<li>Former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis: $5,000
</ul>
Meanwhile, the October 31 Washington Post had this item
in a "day in the life" story on the campaigns:
<br><dd>
"3pm, Washington. Kevin Spacey, the movie actor is touring the
Clinton-Gore headquarters....The entire Clinton-Gore Washington
operation screeches to a halt. Eventually they get Spacey to
participate in a daily campaign ritual. The staffers have taped
a sheet a butcher paper to a door. On the paper, in crayon, somebody
has drawn the White House and the number seven -- as in seven
more days and it's over. As the Olympic fanfare blares from a
boombox, and the staffers cheer him on, Spacey jumps through the
paper like Superman."
<P>
<a name="host">
4) Opening the Saturday Today show on November 2, co-host
Jodi Applegate promoted an upcoming segment. In so doing she
showed that members of the media don't grow liberal with age, 
they start out that way.
<BR><DD>
Jodi Applegate: "Did you hear about the Weekly Reader poll 
that was out this week?"
<BR><DD>
Jack Ford: "Did you used to get them in school? I loved them."
<BR><DD>
Applegate: "Oh yeah. In 1972 I voted for McGovern, because  
'govern' was in his name. This was my thinking when I was seven 
years old. Anyway, they're uncannily accurate at predicting the 
outcome of the presidential campaign so we'll take a look at why 
that might be."
<P>
How much do you want to bet that she's voting for Clinton this 
year because she thinks the C in Clinton stands for "compassion"?

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#huang">revelation of John Huang's frequent white house visits</a> led Thursday's Good Morning America, but were not mentioned at all on Today or This Morning.
<li>Wednesday's <a href="#nbc">NBC Nightly News</a> did not include a word about Huang, but ABC and CBS did air stories on him.
<li>ABC's Jeff Greenfield explores <a href="#bias">whether liberal bias may explain</a> why scandals don't hurt Clinton. 
<li>Five days before the election <a href="#cnn">CNN bumped Inside Politics back a half hour</a> in order to show....
<li>The November 4 edition of the MRC's <a href="#nq">Notable Quotables.</a> 
</ol>
<a name="huang">
1) <b>"DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often: Log Shows 
Him There 78 Times Since July '95"</b> declared the front page story 
in the Thursday, October 31 <i>Washington Post</i>. The <i>Washington Times</i> 
headline read: <b>"Huang Frequent White House Visitor: Also Got Unusual 
Security Clearance Waiver."</b>
<BR><DD>
So, did these headlines prompt stories on the network morning 
shows? MRC analysts Steve Kaminski and Jim Forbes told me not on CBS 
This Morning or NBC's Today. Only GMA, MRC analyst Gene Eliasen observed, 
didn't ignore the news. GMA co-host Charlie Gibson opened the show:
<BR><DD>
"The lead story involves campaign fundraising. More fuel on the 
fire of that story that has been catching heat in the latter days of 
the campaign. John Huang, the fellow who was at the center of that 
Indonesian fundraising connection for the Democrats. The people in 
the administration have been downplaying his importance, but now 
there is word he made more than sixty visits to the White House in 
the first part of this year, those visits ending right away when 
those stories about Indonesian fundraising broke, and we'll have 
that in our newscasts throughout the morning."
<P>
Tuesday morning on Good Morning America Gibson had wondered 
why there wasn't more coverage of questions about Democratic 
fundraising, suggesting that "if Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them." (See last quote in Notable Quotables 
below.) The question remains for the other networks, but Thursday 
morning Gibson's reporting addressed his concerns.
<P>
<a name="nbc">
2) Thursday night NBC Nightly News failed to mention John 
Huang's name. Introducing a story on the Clinton campaign, Tom 
Brokaw announced: "For his part, President Clinton is attempting 
to cool off the controversies over his campaign contributions. 
NBC's Brian Williams is in California tonight ahead of the 
President's trip there."
<P>
But that was it. Williams said nothing about fundraising, 
instead reporting that "in Las Vegas he [Clinton] hit Dole on the 
tax cut plan. He reminded the audience about Dole's role, along 
with Gingrich, in shutting the government down during the winter."
<P>
Next, NBC aired a story from Lisa Myers on what will happen if 
Democrats win Congress. She began by noting that Dick Gephardt says 
"Democrats are more moderate than two years ago." She reported that 
"long time liberals who claim to have signed on to the new centrist 
agenda" would get the committee chairmanships. But she compared that 
to reality, asking Congressman Charles Rangel: "Are you committed 
to balancing the budget in six years?" Rangel shot back: "No."
<P>
On World News Tonight, Jackie Judd explored the latest on the 
John Huang front, noting the Republicans have asked if donors 
"were front men to donate money that came from illegal sources, 
and did large contributions influence foreign policy."
<P>
On the CBS Evening News Thursday, Dan Rather stated: "President 
Clinton's strategy to deal with the pre-election attacks is keep 
moving, change the subject and have aides handle damage control.
Case in point: Questions about John Huang, the Democratic fundraiser 
with easy access to heavy money interests in Asia. It now turns out 
Huang also had much easier access to the White House itself than was
previously disclosed."
<P>
Later in the show in a "Follow the Dollar" segment, a week after 
ABC did it, Linda Douglass examined John Huang's trail.
<P>
<a name="bias">
3) World News Tonight looked at why scandals don't damage 
Clinton and gave airtime to the liberal bias explanation. Peter 
Jennings introduced the October 31 story: "We have one additional 
report tonight on these many questions about the behavior, and in 
some cases the alleged behavior, of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton during 
these last few years. ABC's Jeff Greenfield tonight on what sticks 
and what doesn't and what may stick around."
<P>
<DD>Here's the end of Greenfield's piece:
<BR>
<DD>"Among Republicans, one of the most popular explanations for 
Clinton's invulnerability is a liberal media bias. And at least one 
journalist thinks the critics may have a point. A forthcoming article
in The American Lawyer magazine argues that Paula Jones' charges of 
sexual harassment against then-Governor Clinton are far more credible 
than those of Anita Hill against Judge Clarence Thomas. But the 
article's author says the Paula Jones case has been covered very 
differently."
<BR>
<DD>Stuart Taylor, The American Lawyer magazine: "Imagine if Paula Jones 
or someone just like her made allegations, just like this, with evidence
just like this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich."
Greenfield: "If the polls are right all these charges will have very
little impact on the election. But once the political season ends, they 
could cast giant cloud over a second Clinton term."
<P>
Indeed, though the American Lawyer piece has been out for a week,
as far as I know this is the first network mention.
<P>
<a name="cnn">
4) Five days before Americans vote CNN carried live coverage of 
TV talk show host Jenny Jones testifying in a Michigan murder trial 
instead of their daily politics show. CNN stayed with her past 4pm ET, 
the time for Inside Politics. She stepped down at about 4:20 and CNN 
carried Inside Politics a half hour late at 4:30pm.

<b>Gun to Our Heads</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Going into the homestretch, the campaign is taking on faint overtones 
of the old protection racket with Republicans increasingly sounding like 
the Capone gang, offering protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob." 
<i>-- ABC's John Cochran on House GOP strategy, October 27 This Week 
introductory story.</i>
<P>
<b>The Bad News is Really Good, Good News Really Not</b>
<BR>
<DD>"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession."<i> -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30 
World News Tonight.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD><i>Peter Jennings:</i> "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<i>Bob Jamieson: </i>"The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." <i>-- World News Tonight, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<DD>"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." <i>-- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS Evening News.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD>"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." <i>-- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS Evening News.</i> The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
<DD>"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<b>vs.</b>
<DD>"The President [Bush] tonight finally has an economic number that he 
can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking in today 
and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning around." 
<i>-- Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<b>Relaying Democratic Spin as Fact</b>
<BR>
<DD>"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need 19 seats.
And as of today it looks like they could win them. Democrats are taking 
special aim at the Republicans elected in 1994. They're endangered in 
part because their leader is so unpopular. With the help of millions
of dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind
voters that these freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they 
shut down the government." <i>-- ABC's Cokie Roberts, October 18 World 
News Tonight.</i>
<P>
<b>Cheap Shot</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when he said, 
`Until death do us part?'" <i>-- CNN Talk Back Live host Susan Rook after the 
RNC's Ed Gillespie said Dole's "word is his bond." Quoted by Washington 
Post media reporter Howard Kurtz, October 21.</i>
<P>
<b>NBC: No Big Deal, Republicans Just as Bad</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts 
contributions from overseas." <i>-- Gwen Ifill on Perot's speech criticizing 
Clinton's illegal foreign donations, Oct. 24 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
<DD>"In a year when you talk about, corporations who give $25,000 chunks of 
money, why are people particularly outraged when people with last names 
like Cabrera and people from India and Korea and Indonesia and China 
all of a sudden get, there just seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing 
as a subtext in some of the criticism." <i>-- NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill 
on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 25. Cabrera is now serving
 a 19-year sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S.</i>
<P>
<DD>"Beyond the tedium of the day to day campaigning, there's another much 
more alarming development this year -- money. Huge amounts of money 
pouring into both parties, raising very serious questions about 
influence and conflict of interest." <i>-- Tom Brokaw opening the 
October 29 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
"Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have also 
tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of these investigations will 
produce answers until months, or years, after election day." <i>-- Andrea 
Mitchell concluding her October 29 NBC Nightly News story.</i>
<P>
<DD>"On campaign finance, White House officials admit that both sides are 
dirty. The best defense: Republicans do it too." <i>-- Jim Miklaszewski, 
October 29 The News with Brian Williams on MSNBC.</i>
<P>
<b>Dole Was Okay When He Raised Taxes</b>
<DD>"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." <i>-- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.</i>
<P>
<DD>"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." <i>-- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21</i>.
<P>
<DD>"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." <i>-- Actress Blair Brown narrating Frontline on PBS, 
October 8.</i>
<P>
"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues 
by closing tax loopholes, and pushing through what was then the 
argest tax increase in history." <i>-- Ken Bode narrating "Bob 
Dole's Odyssey" in CNN's Democracy in America, Oct 20.</i>
<P>
<b>Charles Should Be In Charge</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts 
of money to the Democratic Party, and nobody seems to notice this. 
Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"

and Cokie Roberts, October 29.</i>

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Here today, gone tomorrow. Tuesday night the three networks led with <a href="#stories">stories of Democratic fundraising.</a> Wednesday night neither ABC's World News Tonight or the CBS Evening News mentioned anything about Democratic fundraising. Only NBC Nightly News ran a piece.
<li>A tale of two campaigns. Third quarter GDP this year was below the rate in the same quarter in 1992. This year the networks gave a straight forward account, or offered a spin that favored Clinton. Announced one anchor: <a href="#slow">"The economy was slow,</a> but steady going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is under control." That's not the treatment George Bush got four years ago.
<li>ABC's Charlie Gibson cited several Clinton scandals Tuesday morning and <a href="#pressing">asked why the media aren't pressing Democrats:</a> "If the Republicans had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"
<li>A talk <a href="#host">show host and a former network news anchor</a> in bed together, add a little nudity on ABC, and you get... 
</ol>
<a name="stories">
1) The current issue of Newsweek includes a story about John 
Huang and a Clinton ally in Taiwan involved in questionable fundraising 
in that island nation. Wednesday's Los Angeles Times moved the story 
further. It began:
<br><dd>
"Mark Middleton, a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide 
from Arkansas, was responsible for arranging a controversial encounter 
between President Clinton and Liu Tai-ying, the chief financial manager 
of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party, in September 1995, officials said 
Tuesday." The LA Times went on to report that Liu offered to donate 
$15 million to the Clinton campaign, which would be illegal.
<P>
NBC Nightly News began Wednesday night (October 30) with three 
stories in a row on the campaign. In the third, Andrea Mitchell examined 
the Taiwan angle to the DNC/John Huang fundraising activities. She 
relayed allegations that a Clinton ally was "shaking down" Taiwan 
businessmen.
<P>
ABC or CBS coverage Wednesdsay night of this or any part of the 
DNC fundraising/Huang saga: Zilch. ABC didn't even air a full campaign 
story. CBS did relay Dole's newest target, as Phil Jones reported:
<BR><DD>
"Clinton White House ethical controversies also remained high on 
Dole's agenda. He took a swipe at Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 
government travel, while reminding supporters what they could do with 
the money from his 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "You ought to take a vacation instead of Hazel O'Leary flying 
around the world at your expense."
<P>
<a name="slow">
2) In late October 1992 a 3rd quarter GDP of 2.7 percent was 
announced. October 30 of this year the 3rd quarter number was released: 
Just 2.2 percent. 
<P>
Wednesday night CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced the 
bad news: "The government is out with its final official report on 
economic growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic 
slowdown. In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at 
an annual rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth 
rate of the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential 
candidates to put their own spins on today's economic numbers."
<P>
Phil Jones did a story with Dole's reaction, followed by Rita Braver, 
who began: "Mr. Clinton did not mention the sharp economic slowdown in 
the last quarter. Instead, he looked at the overall numbers for the year 
and claimed things are just getting better..."
<P>
Up next, Ray Brady identified the culprit: falling consumer spending. 
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy 
was starting to pick up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that 
expression, 'It's the economy stupid'? And George Bush went down to 
defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but not 
enough so that most voters will be feeling it."
<P>
Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"? Could it be because the media
kept putting the worst possible spin on 1992 economic news? Well, to
find out I sojourned into the MRC tape library. Let's start with CBS. 
On October 27, 1992, the day of the GDP announcement, Dan Rather 
asserted: 
<BR><DD>
"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again, but 
there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even if they 
are accurate, they may be too little too late to help President Bush 
because it was also announced today that consumer confidence in the
economy continues to fall."
<P>
Reporter Susan Spencer reported in from the Bush campaign: "He crowed 
today at upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though 
some economists warned that may not hold."
<P>
Rather was right about the number being inaccurate, but not in the
direction he thought. It was later revised upward to 3.9 percent for
the 3rd quarter.
<P>
On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show: "Today's 
unemployment report from the government appears hopeful on the surface.
It says the nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second 
month in a row. But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs 
program for teenagers. That program is about to end, and as Ray Brady 
reports, the picture ahead is bleak."
<P>
Brady: "...Bare minutes after the announcement, the Federal Reserve 
moved to cut interest rates to speed the economy. But those strikes and
layoffs at General Motors, and thousands of inner city kids soon to come
off those summer job payrolls. Those could mean bad news for next month's 
figures. After hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a 
tenth of a point again last month, most economists now predict next
month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent."
<P>
One month later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. Let's go to
the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News. Ray Brady skipped over his mistake
and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment 
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's 
largely because many Americans simply stopped looking for work, so 
they're no longer counted as unemployed....The fact is, 17 months 
after the recovery started, the economy is stuck in neutral, partly 
because business is running scared. It's not expanding like in a 
recovery, but it is cutting back like in a recession."
<P>
In between the two unemployment reports, on the September 15, 1992 
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began the broadcast: "Seven weeks now until 
election day and new figures out today indicate the economy is flat. 
The government officially reported today that retail sales plunged 
half a percent last month, biggest drop in five months, hardest hit 
appliances and automobiles. Another sign of a sluggish economy: 
consumer prices rose just three-tenths of a percent."
<P>
CBS was not the only culprit. Look at ABC and NBC.
<P>
<b>ABC's World News Tonight</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "In politics today, the economy as viewed from 
two sides. The government reports today that the economy slowed down 
over the summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 percent 
growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was campaigning in 
Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling off is necessary to 
keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news. 
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with 
Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say 
if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there could be a recession."
<P>
<DD>October 27, 1992
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] is more than economists had 
projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<BR><DD>
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big appliances 
and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But many economists say 
the report is not proof the economy is taking a sharp turn for the better."
<BR><DD>
The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President may 
complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he 
is so pleased about are not that definitive, according to a great many 
independent economic analysts."
<P>
<b>NBC Nightly News:</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "We're now down to five full days before the election 
and the President is mostly protecting his lead while Bob Dole is 
looking for any last minute opening. And today again he tried the 
national economy. The economy was slow, but steady going in the last 
quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means 
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low. But, 
Bob Dole has another vision. So, we begin tonight with NBC's David Bloom."
<BR><DD>
Bloom told how "Bob Dole predicted today that Bill Clinton's 
re-election would plunge the nation into another recession." Jim 
Miklaszewski then gave Clinton's more upbeat spin.
<BR>
<DD>October 27, 1992 Nightly News:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "The President tonight finally has an economic number 
that he can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking 
in today and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning 
around. The good number is the Gross Domestic Product, that's the rate 
of economic growth July through September. It hit 2.7 percent, that's 
well above what most economists predicted. But in this unusual economy, 
that's not enough, not with another report out today showing a sharp 
drop in consumer confidence."
<P>
All this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding
that "in September 1992, 98 percent of all sources on the evening news
criticized the state of the economy."
<P>
<a name="pressing">
3) Discussing the campaign with Cokie Roberts and Bill Kristol on 
Tuesday's Good Morning America, Charlie Gibson acknowledged media bias:
<BR><DD>
"Let me get to a second thing. Bob Dole is running around the country 
saying, 'Where is the outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic 
Party hiding this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out 
raising money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic National headquarters. Newsweek says you 
have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge gifts from people, 
businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist monks and nuns who have taken 
vows of poverty giving big amounts of money to the Democratic Party, and 
nobody seems to notice this. Somebody said the other day if the Republicans 
had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away 
with this?"
<P>
As noted above, Wednesday's World News Tonight didn't mention any of 
the topics raised by Gibson.
<P>
<a name="host">
4) So what are former CBS News anchor Connie Chung and husband Maury 
Povich up to? See for yourself, as USA Today's October 30 "People" section 
reported Povich's tale of the bedroom:
<BR><DD>
"Sharon Lawrence 'did me one of the great favors of all time,' the talk 
show host said on Tuesday's Fox After Breakfast. 'I've never met the woman, 
but the other night on the episode of NYPD Blue...her semi-nude shot. Connie 
and I were in bed and the shot comes on. I got very lucky. I really did. 
Thank you, Sharon Lawrence, until my dying day. One of the great nights 
of all time."
<P>
Wonder what happens when Maury orders up one of those pay-per-view 
cable movies?

<p>
<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#dnc">Washington Post's front page story on the DNC's decision to not file a FEC report on early October activities, followed later Tuesday by a reversal of that decision, and all on a day when John Huang gave a videotaped deposition, prompted the three broadcast networks to lead with DNC finances</a> Tuesday night.  But the networks also relayed the Democratic spin: Republicans do it too. NBC reported that "White House officials admit that both sides are dirty."
<li><a href="#attack">CBS Tuesday night labeled a Clinton attack "one the harshest,"</a> but it was more than harsh, it was downright preposterous.
<li>The <a href="#nyt">New York Times charged Tuesday that Bob Dole wants to destroy 32 years of civil rights work,</a> but the newspaper counts employer paid continuing education as a "civil right."  
<li><a href="#gorby">Tom Brokaw, hosting Tuesday's MSNBC InterNight, called Mikhail Gorbachev "a courageous, far-seeing prophet"</a> and said he hopes Gorbachev returns to office. 
</ol>

<a name="dnc">
1) Viewers of Tuesday morning's Today learned that
Republicans are "doing the same thing." As transcribed by MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens, 
<P>
<DD><i>Katie Couric asked Tim Russert</i>: "Tim, let's talk about the big news this morning. It's that the
Democratic National Committee will not file its required final
statement of campaign finances by November 5th. Which is really
unheard of. Why are they doing this?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert responded</i>: "Because they are afraid of what's in
there Katie, obviously. This has become an obscene process! It is
outrageous the amount of money that is pouring into both these
political parties! I do think the Democrats have probably taken
it to a new level, a lower level...."<br>
<DD><i>Couric then asked</i>: "Well Tim if Republicans are doing the
same thing what are people supposed to think?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert</i>: "Well I think If anything comes of this is that the
American people and the media and other people of good intentions
in the political process will say,  Hey we embarrassed ourselves!
We elevated or lowered, excuse me, this political process to
levels of cynicism where the American people said,  Oh you all
take foreign money.' And they finally, finally do something to
clean up this mess. Because it has become a sewer Katie."
<P>
<i>On the CBS Evening News Tuesday night, Rita Braver concluded
her story from the trail with Clinton</i>: "Aides say he will
probably deliver a speech on campaign finance reform later in the
week, trying to paint Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich as the people
who stopped tougher laws."
<P>
<i>Tom Brokaw opened the October 29 NBC Nightly News</i>: 
    "If this campaign has an unofficial motto, it is this:  Wake
me when it's over.' But, beyond the tedium of the day to day
campaigning, there's another much more alarming development this
year -- money. Huge amounts of money pouring into both parties,
raising very serious questions about influence and conflict of
interest."
<P>
    <i>That led into story from Andrea Mitchell in which she
asserted</i>: "Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse
Helms, have also tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of
these investigations will produce answers until months, or years,
after election day."
<P>
    Brokaw and Mitchell failed to distinguish between accepting
money from foreign nationals for campaign spending, which is
illegal, and getting money from Taiwan businessmen for a
foundation-run museum, as Helms did, which is legal.
<P>
    <i>Later, on MSNBC's The News with Brian Williams, NBC reporter
Jim Miklaszewski offered a nice spin that had the Clinton
campaign "admitting" the Republican are just a bad</i>: "On campaign
finance, White House officials admit that both sides are dirty.
The best defense: Republicans do it too."
<P>
<a name="attack">
2) Earlier in Rita Braver's piece cited above, she noted
that heckling from Ohio college students "provoked one of the
President's harshest attacks of the whole campaign on Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD><i>Clinton</i>: "I would be screaming too if I wanted a country that
took Head Start and Big Bird away from five year olds, school
lunches away from ten year years, summer jobs away from 15 year
olds and college loans away from 20 year olds."
<P>
    Harsh yes, but Braver could have noted the charge has no
basis in reality.
<P>
<a name="nyt">
3) <b>"Dole Attacks 32 Years of Civil Rights Laws"</b> declared a
October 29 <i>New York Times</i> headline. In an October 20 New York
review of Bill Clinton's civil rights record, reporter Steven
Holmes began: "In his nearly four years in office, President
Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of any
President in the last 30 years." Holmes insisted that George Bush
and Ronald Reagan "often seemed hostile or indifferent to civil
rights issues."
<P>
As pointed out to me by MRC analyst Clay Waters, The New York
Times has a pretty broad definition of civil rights. In a box
beside the Holmes story, the paper listed "promises in the civil
rights area that President Clinton made as a candidate in 1992."
Here are some:
<ul>
<li>"Lift caps on damage awards in sex discrimination cases."
<li>"Work to pass Motor Voter bill."
<li>"Support statehood for the District of Columbia."
<li>"Require every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training."
<li>"Expand Earned-Income Tax Credit."
</ul>
<a name="gorby">
4) Mikhail's Gorbachev's book tour brought him to MSNBC's
InterNight on Tuesday night, October 29. Tom Brokaw opened the
show:<br>
<dd>"It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on
your point of view. From the perspective of the West, the former
President of the Soviet Union of course was a courageous, far-seeing 
prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet 
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War."
<P>
    Thirty minutes later Brokaw concluded the interview with
another salute to the communist:<br>
<dd>"We always welcome you in this country, Mikhail Gorbachev.
We're especially pleased to have you tonight on InterNight. And
we offer our very best, of course, to Raisa Gorbachev and we hope
that you'll have a long and happy life. Perhaps one day again
we'll see you in political office in Russia. We know that you've
devoted your life to peace and to changing your country and those
of us who have gotten to know you count ourselves among the
privileged."
<P>
    From the perspective of a Western journalist, maybe, ignoring
both the internal collapse of communism despite Gorbachev's
efforts to save it and the role of Ronald Reagan.

<li><a href="#bash">Republican interest in drug dealer Jorge Cabrera and in money
from Indonesia is motivated by "foreigner bashing."</a> So says a
reporter for NBC News.
<li> A panel of <a href="#federal">federal judges on Friday asked the independent

Clinton's knowledge of who hired Craig Livingstone.</a> NBC's Tim

generated any network coverage.

</ol>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bash">
<P>
<font size=+2>1)</font> On Friday's Washington Week in Review on PBS (October 25),
NBC's Gwen Ifill opined: "In a year when you talk about, corporations 
who give $25,00 chunks of money, why are people particularly outraged
when people with last names like Cabrera and people from India
and Korea and Indonesia and China all of a sudden get, there just
seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing as a subtext in some of
the criticism."
<P>
    It took Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray
to tell her the obvious: "It is against the law for non-residents,
foreign companies, foreign governments to give money to political
campaigns. Now what's happening here is the money seems to be
legal residents, but some of them have admitted, I mean there was
this one woman who we talked to who admitted it wasn't her money.
Someone came and handed her $5,000, it was a money laundering
system."
<P>
    As for Cabrera, could it be that, well, he's now serving a 19-year
sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S?
<p>
<br>
<a name="federal">
<p><br>
<font size=+2>2) </font> On Friday a panel of judges authorized independent counsel
Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's
involvement in the FBI files matter.
<P>
     On the October 28 Today Sunday morning, NBC's Tim Russert
insisted: "This is dead serious. I mean the ethical problems
of the Clinton Administration are now troubling even to the most
partisan Democrats. The incident you're talking about is that
the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, requested
that the special prosecutor look into whether or not Bernard
Nussbaum, counsel to the President of the United States, lied
about Hillary Clinton's role in Travelgate. This is dead serious
stuff and I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an
election."
<P>
    So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? In Sunday's Washington Post Howard Kurtz reported that 
"it was not reported by the three network evening newscasts" Friday 
night. 
<P>
    That's not quite true, but it was hardly a major story. The CBS 
Evening News didn't mention the news. On ABC's World News Tonight
anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item. And how did Russert's NBC,
where he is Washington Bureau Chief, treat a story that he insists 
can't be dismissed nine days before election day? NBC Nightly News 
offered viewers only a brief item read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<P>
    In his Post piece, Kurtz quoted Russert's reaction to Dole's
liberal bias charge: "I find it ironic that Dole is criticizing the
media for not covering all the stories we broke. Whether it's the 
Indonesian gardener or the Buddhist monks, he should be crediting
the LA Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
I think his anger is misplaced."
<P>
    Hmmm. Which media outlets didn't Russert credit? Any of the 
networks, not even his own.
<p>
<br>
<a name="dole">
<p><br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>3) </font> Affirmative action and immigration have been winning issues 
for Republicans in California and by coincidence they are just the 
subjects that NBC's David Bloom has tagged "divisive." 
<P>
    After showing a clip of a Dole immigration ad, on the Saturday, 
October 26 NBC Nightly News, Bloom concluded: "But even many Republicans 
who believe Dole could have won here on a divisive issue like 
immigration, now say it's too late." The next night, Sunday, Bloom 
concluded his story from California: "Until now, Dole on the campaign 
stump, had largely shied away from divisive social issues like 
affirmative action for fear of alienating swing voters. Not anymore."
<p>
<br>
<a name="al">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>4)</font> In the beginning of the show story Sunday for This Week
with David Brinkley, ABC's John Cochran looked at how Republicans
are now separating themselves from Dole, suggesting to voters that
they need a check on a re-elected Clinton. He concluded with this 
bizarre analogy: "Going into the the homestretch, the campaign
is taking on feint overtones of the old protection racket with
Republicans increasingly sounding like the Capone gang, offering
protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob."
<p>
<br>
<a name="cbs">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>5) </font> Finally, a little reality check for Clinton. Here's an excerpt 
from Friday's CBS Evening News story by Bill Plante:
<P><blockquote>
    Plante: "But while Mr. Clinton walks the high road on the stump. 
His advertising, all of which he personally approves, has been 
overwhelmingly negative. He courted young voters today with a message 
of hope. A new ad courts senior voters with a message of fear."
<P> Clinton ad: "You've worked you whole life and hoped for a secure
retirememt. That's why it's so wrong that Dole and Gingrich tried
to slash Medicare $270 billion."
<P> 
   Plante: "Never mind that the President's own budget would have
cut future Medicare spending almost as much."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Now that the election is in the bag for Clinton it's safe for the
networks to scrutinize his claims.

<H3>Five items today:</H3>
<ol>
<li>In an address at the National Press Club on Thursday, <a href="#Perot">Ross Perot rejected the Dole campaign's overture to endorse Dole</a> and he criticized Bill Clinton's character. The three evening shows highlighted the first, but ABC's World News Tonight failed to report Perot's anti-Clinton comments. Both ABC and NBC charged that Bob Dole "lashed out" at Clinton." NBC's Gwen Ifill complained that "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts contributions from overseas." On CBS, Phil Jones said the Perot gambit demonstrates that Dole is "determined to try anything."
<li>After Wednesday's order proved fruitless, on Thursday a federal judge issued another order <a href="#huang">demanding the DNC to produce John Huang.</a> Of the broadcast network evening shows, only ABC's World News Tonight reported the effort to locate him.
<li>On CBS, Dan Rather offered an uncritical look at video of <a href="#devout">Bill Clinton hugging a "devout Catholic"</a> after convincing her that it was okay for him to veto the partial birth abortion bill.
<li>NBC's Lisa Myers contended on MSNBC that <a href="#tax">tax cuts are incompatible with balancing the budget.</a> By promising a tax cut, she charged, Bob Dole "seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<li>Republican House <a href="#chenoweth">freshman Helen Chenoweth</a> told Tom Brokaw that she's "just a plain spoken Western woman." Brokaw countered on Thursday's Nightly News: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right." 
</ol>
<a name="Perot">    
1) Thursday night (October 24) ABC's World News Tonight made
no mention of Perot's comments about Clinton's character. Instead,
ABC emphasized Dole's attack, saying he was "livid" when he 
criticized the media. Anchor Diane Sawyer announced: "In a speech 
in Florida Mr. Dole lashed out at the President and a lot of other 
people too."
<P>
<DD>Reporter Jim Wooten began: "Clearly frustrated by his stalled 
campaign, Senator Dole was fiercely critical today not only of the 
American media, but of the American public as well for not recognizing 
his virtues and the President's vices....As for the press, he was 
practically livid, telling an audience of the faithful in Pensacola
that the sins of the Clinton administration are being concealed by 
partisan newspapers and networks."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "Now we know the liberal media's not going to report on all 
these things because they want him re-elected. They like it the way 
it is. We need the media to tell the American people the truth and the 
truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a landslide."
<P>
    NBC Nightly News did run clips of Perot's attacks on Clinton, 
but in trying to lessen the damage to Clinton Gwen Ifill failed 
to distinguish between accepting money from foreign nationals, which is 
illegal, with getting money from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies 
or from naturalized citizens, which is legal:
<BR><DD>
    Gwen Ifill: "Ross Perot attempted to blast his way back into 
contention today with a scathing indictment of President Clinton and 
the Democratic party's fundraising tactics, which includes accepting 
money from abroad."
<BR><DD>
    Perot: "If you love this country and your children, how could you 
even consider voting for a candidate that has huge moral, ethical and 
criminal problems facing him as our country has problems to solve."
<BR><DD>
    Ifill: "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though 
he also accepts contributions from overseas."
<P>
    Next, David Bloom reported in from the Dole campaign. His piece
began:
<BR><DD>
    "Spurned by Ross Perot, an admittedly frustrated Bob Dole lashed 
out today at voters"
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "Wake up America."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "At President Clinton's ethics."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "This is a disgrace."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "And especially at the liberal media, who Dole blamed for 
trying to engineer his defeat."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "We need the media to tell the American people the truth, 
and the truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a 
landslide."
<BR><DD>
    On the CBS Evening News this is how Phil Jones concluded his story
on Perot and Dole: "Perot says he finds the whole Dole request to be 
weird. Was it an act of desperation? No says one top Dole aide. He 
calls it determined, determined to try anything."
<P>
<a name="huang">
2) Last Sunday, DNC General Chairman Chris Dodd promised that 
John Huang would be made available to the media. So far, no one's been
able to find the DNC fundraiser (and former Commerce Department 
official) responsible for bringing in the illegal $250,000 from 
South Korea and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other questionable
donations from overseas. On Thursday, a federal judge took action. As
reported by Brian Ross on Thursday's World News Tonight (October 24):
<P>
    Brian Ross on John Huang: "In Washington today, a federal judge 
ordered Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce 
John Huang to testify in a civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the 
Commerce Department for big Democratic contributors. The judge's unusual 
action came after Huang could not be found at his home in Glendale 
California or when U.S. Marshall's went to an address yesterday in 
Washington that the judge had ordered the Commerce Department to 
provide..."
<P>
    Reporter Mark Litke followed with a dispatch from Jakarta on 
the Lippo conglomerate's Asian empire and ties to Clinton.
<P>
    While ABC thus updated viewers on the Indonesian scandal, neither
CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News mentioned the scandal or Huang's
name. (CNN's Inside Politics did offer an anchor-read brief.)
<P>
<a name="devout">
3) Over video of Bill Clinton along a rope line talking with a 
teenage girl who at first is crying, then is smiling and, finally, is 
hugging Clinton, Dan Rather announced on the October 24 CBS Evening 
News: 
<BR><DD>
    "In Louisiana President Clinton had this tearful encounter today 
with a teenager. She said she was a devout Catholic and was upset with 
the President's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions. The 
President spoke with her awhile, saying he had vetoed that bill after
talking with women who might have died without the procedure. As you 
see, this seemed to satisfy the teenager who said she felt better and 
would tell her mother 'it's okay to vote for President Clinton,' 
unquote."
<P>
   Of course, Rather didn't bother telling viewers that the bill 
Clinton vetoed had a life or health of the mother exception.
<P>
<a name="tax">
4) MSNBC's News with Brian Williams on Tuesday night (October
22) ran a profile of Dole by Lisa Myers. It began:
<P>
    Lisa Myers: "The heart and soul of Dole's agenda is his economic 
program, built around the bold, some say extravagant, promise."
<BR><DD>
    Bob Dole: "We'll have a President who will cut taxes 15 percent 
across the board for every taxpayer in America."
<BR><DD>
    Myers: "With that promise, that half a trillion dollar tax cut, 
Dole seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 
35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<P>
<a name="chenoweth">
5) Thursday night Tom Brokaw narrated an "In-Depth" segment
exploring big money from special interests pouring into congressional
races. His case study: The Idaho race of GOP freshmen Helen
Chenoweth (targetted by labor unions) vs. Democrat Dan Williams.
<P>
    Brokaw asserted: "Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term 
Republican Congresswoman."
<BR><DD>
    Chenoweth: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I 
come from an innocuous state. I'm just a plain-spoken Western woman."
<BR><DD>
    Brokaw: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader 
for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum wage, 
trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hardliner 
on gun laws. So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists."
<P>
    Brokaw didn't make any negative comments about the views espoused
by the Democratic candidate. He concluded by noting that the two
candidates have debated, "But their campaigns are trapped in a cloud 
of money, saturating the air, polluting the political process, and 
that's a loss for everyone."
<P>
    So is a campaign trapped in a cloud of media distortion, polluting
the fair and balanced dissemination of political views.

<ol>
<li>Developments on the <a href="#foreign">foreign citizen fundraising</a> front continue, but TV network viewers don't hear anything about them. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported a major DNC donor had no money of his own to donate and a federal judge issued a subpoena for John Huang, now in hiding. None of the broadcast networks reported the first item; only one reported the second, but two found time to mention the sentencing of a Dole fundraiser. 
<li>NBC's Today on Wednesday reported nothing about the campaign during its two hour broadcast, but devoted a top of the show segment to a major crisis: Denial of <a href="#toilet">toliet paper to Detroit public school students</a>. 
<li>One Wednesday newspaper headline declared that Clinton is maintaining lead in California. Another the same day relayed that Dole and <a href="#catching">Republicans are catching up</a>.

<li>Dole's not gaining in the polls, so what's to blame. A CBS reporter Wednesday morning suggested "that his harsh <a href="#backfired">tactics may have backfired."</a> 
<li>A wealthy <a href="#actor">Hollywood actor and producer</a> identified, on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News, what ails America: Too much concern about making money. 
</ol>
<p>
<a name="foreign">
1) <b>"$325,000 Gift to Democrats Raises New Set of Questions:
Relative of Mahatma Gandhi Who Made Donation Say's he's Now in
Debt. DNC Calls Money Legal."</b> -- October 23 <i>Los Angeles Times</I>
front page.  
<P>
    It's illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to U.S.
campaigns, so the question in the case of Gandhi is whether
his donation really came from foreign nations.
<P>
    Keeping that in mind, here's the lead of the LA Times
story:<b> "The state of California says Yogesh K. Gandhi owes
$10,000 in back taxes. His California driver's license has
been revoked because he has failed to pay his traffic fines.
Claiming pauper status, he did not pay the $20 filing fee for
his divorce.
<BR><DD>"Yet Gandhi...gave a hefty a hefty $325,000 to the Democratic
National Committee....Gandhi emerged Tuesday as the latest in
a series of campaign donors whose contributions are raising
questions about the influence of foreign money in American politics.
Like the others, Gandhi's contribution was handled by John Huang,
the DNC fundraiser who brought in a series of six-figure donations,
some of which have proven illegal or suspect."</b>
<BR><DD>Speaking of Huang, he went into hiding last week to avoid the
media. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a subpoena for him
to appear.
<P>
    How were these two developments reported Wednesday night? The 
LA Times story was not reported by any of the three evening shows
-- not ABC's World Nes Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
    Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena for Huang. On
the CBS Evening News Dan Rather noted, without offering any 
specifics, how the Clinton team were trying to ignore the foreign
money angle and had asked the FEC to investigate. Eric Engberg then
did a Reality Check on how it takes years for the FEC to complete
an investigation. 
<P>
    But immediately after Engberg's piece, Dan Rather announced that
Simon Fireman, a former Dole fundraiser, had been ordered to pay $6
million in fines for laundering money to avoid contribution limits.
NBC's Tom Brokaw also mentioned Simon as he introduced a piece by
Lisa Myers on soft money fundraising by both parties. 
<P>
<a name="toilet">
2) Thirteen days until the election, but on Wednesday
Today couldn't find time for any mention of the campaign, MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens observed. But Today devoted the second
segment of the 7am half hour to a major crisis in Detroit:
access to toilet paper in the schools. 
<P>
    Interviewing David Snead, superintendent of the Detroit 
schools, Bryant Gumbel became enraged at the new rules which
restrict how much toilet paper students can use. He demanded:
"Hang on one second! One second! I saw a quote, one second!
David Snead I saw a quote from Charlie Fobbs. He is your Director 
of Housekeeping and Grounds for your school district. He said,
his words, 'They need to teach them, the students, to use only
the amount they need.' Isn't the matter of how much toilet paper
one needs rather personal?" 
<P>
    Gumbel's latest definition of civil rights: Unlimited access
to toilet paper. How long until Clinton proposes a federal
"Equal Access to Toilet Paper Act"?
<P>
<a name="catching">
3) Two contrasting headlines from Wednesday October 23:
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of the Los Angeles Times: <b>"Clinton Keeping 
Solid Lead Over Dole in State"</b>
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of Investor's Business Daily: <b>"California 
Vote Is Back in Play: Shrinking Gap in Polls Spurs a Heavy GOP Push"</b>
<P>
<a name="backfired">
4) On Wednesday's This Morning on CBS reporter Sandra 
Hughes offered her opinion of why Dole isn't catching up.
As caught and transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski, this is 
how she concluded her October 23 story: <b>"Dole criticized Clinton 
for raising taxes and breaking campaign promises. But over the 
past few days, his tough talking rhetoric has been noticeably 
toned down even though Dole won't admit that his harsh
tactics may have backfired."</b>
<P>
    Maybe if the media didn't condemn as "harsh" every anti-Clinton 
comment made by Dole, his pointing out some of Clinton's character
problems wouldn't have "backfired."
<p>
<a name="actor">
5) Starting this week and through election day, NBC Nightly
News is running a series called <i>"Fixing America"</i> in which various
leaders in different fields tell what they think should be done.
Wednesday night's offerings included this from actor/producer
Henry Winkler, aka "The Fonz" in Happy Days back in the 1970s:
<br><DD>
    "I think that we have to humanize America. I think that the 
worst thing that ever happened to this country was the quarterly 
report. The pride of process. The pride of what we do and the 
people who do it, the population, are being moved aside just so 
that we can show a profit three or four times a year. I think 
we're going to bottom line ouservelves into oblivion."
<P>
    Remember that before you put any money down to buy a ticket
to one of his future movies.

<h2>***Media Research Center CyberAlert***</h2>
<i>10/21/96</i><p>
<p>
</center>
<p>
<h3>Three items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>ABC's Cokie Roberts reported that <a href="#freshmen">Newt Gingrich and the House freshmen</a> "shut down the government."
<li>The <a href="#sandinistas">Sandinistas were just "socialists"</a> according to Peter Jennings. And ABC's Beth Nissen relayed that Daniel Ortega's theme song is Beethoven's Ode to Joy and his TV ads portray him as a "Latino Gandhi."
<li>The networks ignored the pardon issue for weeks and have yet to report anything about <a href="#livingstone">Craig Livingstone's assistant Mari Anderson</a> contradicting his story on the FBI files, but Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz thinks a panel of reporters would have raised the topics in last week's debate. 
</ol>
<a name="freshmen">
<hr>
1) On Friday's World News Tonight (October 18), ABC's Cokie
Roberts explored whether Democrats might take back control of the
House. When conservatives complain that the media are
misinforming the public about Medicare cuts and how the
Republicans closed down the government, reporters counter that
they are only reporting what "Democrats say." Well, Roberts said
they "remind voters" of how Republicans caused the shutdown, as
if no responsibility for the shutdown can be placed on Bill
Clinton. Here's the beginning of her piece:
<P>
"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need
19 seats. And as of today it looks like they could win them.
Democrats are taking special aim at the Republicans elected in
1994. They're endangered in part because their leader is so
unpopular. With the help of millions of dollars from organized
labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down
the government...."
<P>
<a name="sandinistas">
<hr>
2) Later on Friday's World News Tonight, ABC previewed
Sunday's election in Nicaragua. Peter Jennings announced:    
"Under the heading of 'Whatever Happened To' we go to visit a man
who a decade ago was a very big thorn in the American side. The
United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars to Nicaragua
to defeat the Sandinistas and Daniel Ortega was their commander.
Ultimately the socialist programs of the Sandinistas and Mr.
Ortega fell out of favor. But there is a presidential election in
Nicaragua this Sunday and Daniel Ortega is back."
<p>
Reporter Beth Nissen found that "Daniel Ortega has changed
his tune. Literally, from militaristic Sandinista songs, to
Beethoven's Ode to Joy." And, she told viewers how "The new
Daniel is portrayed in his campaign ads as contemplative,
reverent, a man who cares deeply about the poor, a kind of Latino
Gandhi."
<p>
<a name="livingstone">
<hr>
3) In a Friday piece reviewing Wednesday night's
presidential debate, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz
noted how the "average citizen" questioners didn't help Dole by
asking about Clinton's ethics. Kurtz then wrote: "If reporters had
been asking the questions, you can bet there would have been
aggressive demands to know whether Clinton planned to issue any
Whitewater pardons and who had hired Craig Livingstone and why
Dole was raising the 'character' issue and so on."
<p>
Hello. Has Kurtz been on Mars the past few weeks? Print
reporters, maybe. But which of the broadcast TV network reporters
who have yet to report the six month gap in the log book of who
accessed the FBI files, the fact that Livingstone's assistant
said he knew he was improperly obtaining Bush administration
files, and who never mentioned the pardon issue for more than a
week after Clinton raised the subject on the NewsHour, did Kurtz
expect to suddenly be interested in Clinton scandals? -- Brent
Baker

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<p>
<li><FONT  SIZE=-1>But first, a quick correction: The quote from the CBS
Evening News cited in yesterday's CyberAlert was incorrectly
attributed to Bill Plante. In fact, the quote came from Phil
Jones.</FONT>
<ol>
<li><a href="#worried">Before Wednesday night's debate reporters worried</a> about
Dole's more aggressive plan. NBC's Matt Lauer said it meant the
campaign "is now getting meaner." On CBS, Phil Jones worried
that in a "town meeting" format, Dole may be seen as "being too
mean." Dan Rather warned that Dole planned to unload a "carpet
bombing on character."
<li><a href="#face">On Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked</a> if Dole's tax cut
proposal is responsible for "the economic mess that the country
is in."
<li><a href="#quiz">A quiz question</a>: A man identified as a "Democratic
strategist" has been making the rounds of TV shows to provide
the pro-Clinton spin. He is married to which network
correspondent who is covering the Clinton campaign?
</ol><br>
<a name="worried">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> Today show news anchor Matt Lauer opened the 7am
newscast on Wednesday (October 16) by blaming Dole for causing a
mean campaign. As transcribed by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens:
"Good morning everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego."
<p>
On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones showed
a clip of him shouting questions about debate strategy at Bob
Dole as Dole got into his car:
<blockquote>
   Phil Jones: "Ethics?"<BR>
   Dole: "Maybe."<BR>
   Jones: "Do you worry about it backfiring if you get into that?"<BR>
   Dole shook his head, and Jones then explained:<p>
   "Well, attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole
because of the debate format. The candidates will be facing
voters who are asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole
has never been able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he
got back in his 1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing
he needs tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the
questioners who thinks he's being too mean."
</blockquote>
Introducing the next story from Rita Braver on the Clinton
beat, Rather asked: "Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing
for a kind of carpet bombing on character?"
<p>
<a name="face">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> Most analysts suggest that Dole's 15 percent tax cut
plan has not been a more effective campaign issue because people
don't believe he'll follow through. Not Bob Schieffer. He thinks
Dole's problem is that people believe he's committed to the
supply-side theory behind the plan. 
<p>
    On the October 6 Face the Nation, Schieffer asked Ross
Perot: "You mentioned the economic mess that the country is in.
The keystone of the Dole campaign at this point seems to be a 15
percent across the board tax cut. That seems to go against a lot
of the things that Senator Dole has said in the past. I know
that you personally would not have gone in that direction. But
do you think that is one of the reasons that the Dole campaign
is running behind as it is now? What do you think of the 15
percent tax cut? Is it at all realistic? Could that be done?"
<p>
<a name="quiz">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> Quiz answer: Rita Braver, the White House correspondent for
CBS News. Her husband: Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer who
played George Bush in mock debates with Bill Clinton in 1992. In
addition to Clinton, he served as a debate coach for Michael
Dukakis and Walter Mondale. Wednesday night he appeared on CNN
both before and after the debate, identified on screen as a
"Democratic strategist."
<p>
How convenient. Rita Braver gets the Clinton spin at work
and at home.

and reported that under Clinton America's cities are on the
rebound. Here's the introduction and beginning of their story of
the state of cities this election year:
<blockquote>
Peter Jennings: "Here in Detroit itself we've noticed a
difference. It was impossible to come here in years past without
the state of the city itself being an issue. Not this year, not
here. And as ABC's Dean Reynolds reports tonight, not in many
other places as well."</blockquote>

Dean Reynolds, over video of a building being torn down: 
<blockquote>
"In Detroit this morning it was down with the old. Down with the
high-rise symbols of urban rot to be replaced by new
neighborhoods. Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office."
Mayor Dennis Archer: "There is a sense that there is a
relationship between the city of Detroit and Washington and that
it is positive."

Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."

Bowen examined some hot House contests. As transcribed by MRC
analyst Steve Kaminski, here's how Bowen described the choice
voters face in a California district:
<blockquote>
    Jerry Bowen: "In the 22nd District along California's
central coast, freshman incumbent Andrea Seastrand is in the
fight of her political life. Challenged again by Democrat Walter
Capps, the college professor she defeated by less than 1 percent
of the vote last time. It is a contest of stark contrasts. The
55 year-old Seastrand: ultra-conservative, pro-life, pro-assault
weapons, anti-gay, anti-illegal immigrant."
<P>
</blockquote>
    After a soundbite from Republican Seastrand, Bowen continued: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"The soft spoken 62 year-old Capps, liberal down the line: abortion
rights, gay rights, gun control, opposed to the death penalty."

<LI><a href="#correction">A correction</a> and a clarification of previous MRC CyberAlerts. Plus, a fact checking error from ABC on Jack Kemp. 
<LI><a href="#flawed">A study shows a link between abortion and breast cancer,</a> but instead of giving equal time to study proponents and opponents, ABC declares it "flawed."

</OL>
<a name="correction">
<H3>1) A clarification and a correction of two topics from MRC CyberAlerts from last week.</H3>
<P>
First, the October 8 CyberAlert reported that on Monday night
(October 7) ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
fact check stories on the Dole-Clinton debate. In fact, CBS
Evening News did, but ABC's piece aired on Good Morning America,
not World News Tonight. In addition, CNN's Brooks Jackson did a
fact check piece for Inside Politics.
<P>
Second, the October 11 CyberAlert noted that unlike in 1992,
this year neither ABC's World News Tonight or CNN's Inside
Politics ran fact checking stories on the VP debate. That's
correct, but MRC analyst Gene Eliasen pointed out to me that
ABC's Good Morning America did run one Thursday morning.
<P>
<DD>ABC reporter Jack Smith asserted: "Both men indicated that
taxes are too high, right? But federal taxes as a portion of
household income are actually lower now than they were 15 years
ago. Kemp made this assertion."
<BR>
<DD>Jack Kemp: "Every time in this century we've lowered the tax
rates across the board revenues went up, not down."
<BR>
<DD>Smith: "Wrong again. The last time this was tried, in 1981,
real income tax revenues fell three years in a row and drove up
the deficit."
<P>
Reality Check: Following the 1982 recession, income tax
revenue grew consistently. As Norman Ture pointed out in Ed
Rubenstein's book The Right Data, "With the recovery beginning in
late 1982, budget receipts expanded rapidly, on the average by
slightly over 8 percent a year, through fiscal 1990."

<H3>2) On Friday, a study appearing in the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health, was released.</H3> It showed that
abortion is responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each
year. ABC's Peter Jennings Friday night (October 11) delivered
not a news report but a warning:
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings: "There was a study released at Penn State
University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had
abortions and the risk of developing breast cancer. And if you
see it around, remember this. It is not original research, but an
analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute
says those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and
because of that, various other scientists say today the Penn
State report is flawed."
<P>
Jennings did not have to worry: While on CNN's The World
Today Jeff Levine provided a full report about the study and its
critics, neither CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News even
mentioned the study.
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<H3>3) CBS has turned a self-serving Clinton anecdote into a 
prime time movie.</H3> Here's an exchange from Friday's Late, Late
Show with Tom Snyder:
<P>
<DD>Les Moonves, CBS entertainment division President: "The President
did actually pitch me a movie of the week idea which we ended up
shooting....It's unusual when the President of the United States
pitches you, actually a wonderful movie of the week."
<BR>
<DD>Tom Snyder: "What was it, a young guy from Arkansas becomes
President?"
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "No, it was about the Family and Medical Leave Act, a
true story that he was involved in where a young girl had visited
the White House. He'd come back from his morning jog, and this 13
year old girl was there in a wheelchair. The President went over
to her and she evidently was dying of leukemia and the father
went over to him and thanked the President for having passed the
Family and Medical Leave Act so he could be with his daughter.
She was going to die, but at least he could say good-bye. As the
President pitched it, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,
legitimately. It was very moving. We ended up shooting the movie
starring John Ritter as the father and the President appears in
it as himself."
<BR>
<DD>Snyder: "You will stop at nothing."
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "I will. I'm shameless for ratings, what can I tell you.
But we're not allowed to show it until after the elections."
<P>
To get to the truth of the anecdote, do we divide by six or by two?
<P>
<a name="dole">
<H3>4) In the media lexicon, anything about character or illegality is harsh and/or nasty.<BR></H3>
 Two examples:
<BR>
<DD>Monday night (October 14) this is how David Bloom began his
NBC Nightly News story: "In his harshest, most personal attack
yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton
Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is
slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal
campaign contributions."
<BR>
<DD>The night before, on ABC's World News Sunday, anchor Carole
Simpson asked: "The candidates are back on the road, but will
they take the high road or the low road?"
<BR>
<DD>Reporter John Donvan observed: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill
Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty."
<BR>
<DD>Dole: "Drug use has doubled because nothing has been done in
this administration. He's been AWOL. He's been AWOL before, but
now he's really been AWOL now."
<BR>
<DD>Donvan: "But did Dole get personal, dig into the President's
past, stir up the mud of Whitewater and other issues of
character? No, he isn't. And despite being urged to do so by some
members of his own party. Dole in person is still taking the high
road, hitting the President hard on his record but not going
after Clinton on his personal life and moral character. Some in
Dole's camp wish that he'd get nastier at this point with polls
delivering constant bad news to the campaign."
<P>
Following a clip of Dole saying he's "thinking about" being
tougher and a soundbite from Jack Kemp, Donvan concluded his
story: "Dole himself continues to be the gentleman on the stump.
That may make for a duller campaign than some would like, and
perhaps a losing one. But it lets the candidate play out this
possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman,
less like a nasty politician. John Donvan, ABC News, Hamilton New
Jersey."
<P>
Just what reporters want. Dole to lose while not damaging Clinton.

<a name="conservative">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>1)</font>On Thursday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones
concluded his piece on the Dole campaign with a conservative spin
on Kemp's debate performance: 
    "In private, off the record discussions, with both Dole and
Kemp aides there's a strong sense of disappointment in Kemp's
debate performance. They talk about missed opportunities, the
feeling that Kemp let the Vice President take credit for issues
like welfare reform. As one Dole aide asked cynically, 'Did he
study much?'"
<P>
<br>
<a name="extreme">
<P>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>2)</font>)Later in the October 10 CBS broadcast, Bob Schieffer
traveled to Ohio's 6th CD which encompasses the southern part of
the Buckeye state. For the House seat, Republican freshman Frank
Cremeans faces his 1994 opponent, Democrat Ted Strickland.
Schieffer stated as fact that the Republican House shut the
government down, ignoring the at least equal role of the
President in refusing to sign continuing resolutions or
appropriation bills. 
<P>
    Here's the second half of the story:
<P>
Schieffer: "Now the two are back for a re-match that typifies the
predicament many Republican freshmen are finding. The revolution
and its talk of changing things like Medicare backfired with some
voters. Just ask the Republican county chairman here."<br>
Roger Bennett, Clinton County Republican Chairman: "I think
they've lost confidence in Newt Gingrich."<br>
Schieffer: "Remember, he's the Republican, not the Democratic
chairman. Why is that? Did you just go too far?"<br>
Bennett: "I think he went too far and I think if you make a
mistake you back up and say, 'darn it I made a mistake,' and you
go back and do it over again the right way."<br>
Schieffer: "Where did he make the mistake? In shutting down the
government."<br>
Bennett: "I think that is the big thing because it involved all
the older people They were really concerned. It scared the
Dickens out of them."<br>
<P>
<br>
   Having established the GOP as the culprits for the shutdown,
Schieffer concluded by endorsing the Democratic candidate's view
that House Republicans are extremists:
<br>
Schieffer: "One reason Republican Cremeans, a Gingrich stalwart
in Washington, stresses the local angle here. Is your opponent
running against Newt Gingrich or is he running against you.
Cremeans: "Well, you'd have to ask him that. What I've tried to
do is represent the district."<br>
Schieffer: "For sure, his opponent promises the same. He's
learned a lesson too."<br>
Strickland: "And that lesson is that people want moderation and
when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or
from the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from
that."<br>
Schieffer: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland
and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are
running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time.
Bob Schieffer, CBS News, Chillicothe Ohio."<br>
<P>
<br>
<a name="fact">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2> 3)</font> After the 1992 VP debate, both ABC's World News Tonight
and CNN's Inside Politics ran fact checking stories which were
dominating by corrections of Dan Quayle. This year, The
Washington Post ran a piece October 10 citing errors made by Kemp
and Gore. The Post identified five errors made by Gore. But, this
year neither ABC or CNN ran a reality check piece.
<P>
    Of course, you can't always trust the fact checkers. Post
reporter Michael Weisskopf offered this "correction" on Kemp:
"Kemp...defended the tax proposal by arguing that every tax cut
in the 20th century has produced higher government revenue. But
many economists disagree. The huge Reagan tax cut in 1981
resulted in a tripling of the budget deficit over a dozen years."
<P>
   Talk about apples and oranges. Taxes were cut, but as the
numbers show, tax revenue grew faster than inflation in the
1980s. Spending soared even faster, leading to higher deficits.
<P>
<br>
<a name="pbs">
<P>
<br>
<font size=+2>4) </font> Speaking of Reagan bashing, MRC associate editor Tim
Graham caught some in Tuesday night's PBS Frontline special, The
'96 Choice. Actress Blair Brown, who narrated the show, stated:
"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt.
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining
battle of his career."
<P>
<br>
<a name="night">
<P>
<br>
<br>
   <font size=+2>5) </font> With several presidential biographers as guests, on
Thursday's (October 10) MSNBC InterNight Bryant Gumbel explored
presidential character. Much of the show was devoted to defending 
Bill Clinton's character. Here are a few of Gumbel's questions:
<blockquote>
    -- Talking about Clinton, Gumbel asked The Washington Post's
David Maraniss: "In the first two years this is a man who tried
his best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight
for gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    He tried to balanced the budget?
<P>
  <blockquote>  -- "Do any of those things of which Bill Clinton is charged,
when it comes to character, have much to do with governing
effectively, or with leading?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    Having failed to mention anything about lying and Clinton,
Gumbel moved on to Reagan.
<P>
<blockquote>    -- To Reagan biographer Lou Cannon: "Lou, I know you feel as
if Reagan had few, if any, character flaws. But let me ask you
this. When one sidesteps, or refuses to acknowledge the
consequences of their policies or actions, why shouldn't that be
viewed as a character flaw? Or when one lies. For example, let me
roll a clip and then we'll come back. This one deals with Iran-Contra."
</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- A segment later, he returned to Reagan, asking Cannon if
it was true "that while he appeared to be empathetic, his
policies caused enormous suffering for those who were least able
to afford it?"
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bob">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>6)</font> Appearing on NBC's Tonight Show Thursday night (October
10), NBC and MSNBC reporter/anchor Brian Williams told Jay Leno
the following anecdote (ALL CAPS = Williams impersonating Bob
Dole yelling):
<blockquote>
   Brian Williams: "I was watching his acceptance speech in San
Diego, which was really the speech of his life, it was a very
dramatic event. And I'm standing there with one of our younger
producers at MSNBC. She's 24 or something and I said 'What do you
think?' She said, 'You know, he scares me.' And I said, 'What do
you mean he scares you?' She said 'It doesn't matter what he's
trying to say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well
he's doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this
mental image. I'm playing with my friends on the rich guy's lawn
and the guy comes to the door, with his little pen, you know, and
says GET OFF MY LAWN!'" 
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Talk about image over substance. And not much sensitivity toward
the disabled.

<OL>
<LI><a href="#bozo">Dole's reaction to a man in a crowd calling Bill Clinton "Bozo"</a> generated media condemnation on Wednesday. Boston Globe and USA Today stories portrayed Bozo as part of a grand strategy. On Today, Katie Couric charged that the campaign "turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday" and she blamed "the right wing" for his new strategy. 
<LI><a href="#soft">Dole's intentions are scrutinized on Today, but Al Gore gets a softball interview</a> that began with this challenging question: "Many can see that you have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in our history."

</OL>
<P>
<a name="bozo">
<B>1)</B> On Tuesday a man in a crowd yelled at Dole "Please
get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on
his way out." But to believe some media reports you'd think
Dole set out Tuesday to launch a new campaign strategy based
upon insulting Clinton. 
<P>
Here's the headline in the Wednesday, October 9 Boston
Globe: <I>"Dole Goes On Attack, Calls Clinton 'Bozo.'"</i> The
subhead: <I>"Comment Draws White House Retort."</I> 
<P>
USA Today's headline declared: <I>"Dole Quips That He'll
Beat 'Bozo.'"</I> The lead of Judy Keen's story: <I>"Bob Dole
politely called his rival 'Mr. President' during Sunday's
presidential debate. But on Tuesday, he referred to him as
'Bozo.'"</I>
<P>
On Wednesday morning's Today Katie Couric talked with
Tim Russert. Here's part of their discussion, as transcribed
by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens: 
<BR>
<DD>Couric: "Let me just turn to the presidential campaign
very quickly. As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly
nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a
moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President
Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being
President. You heard that bozo exchange. Effective strategy
or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "I don't think it's an effective strategy.
I was rather surprised. I think Senator Dole was very
effective Sunday night in raising his favorable rating with
the American people. He didn't move many votes but at least
he was looked at in a much more favorable light with his
sense of humor and quickness."
<BR>
<DD>Katie Couric: "But the right wing thought he wasn't
aggressive enough?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "Well obviously he's responding to that
criticism and what he's saying is, 'My God, I haven't
reached 40 percent in the polls yet! I have 20 percent of
the Republican party still not voting for me. The only way
to get to them is by being more aggressive and negative on
Clinton.' The problem is Katie when you do that, what you do
is say to a large amount of women, the so-called gender gap,
they don't like that. And they have said repeatedly they
want a more positive campaign. It's a very risky, very risky
venture by Senator Dole."
<P>
<a name="soft">
<B>2)</B> Meanwhile, Al Gore gets a little nicer treatment.
Later on Wednesday, Today aired an interview with the Vice
President caught by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens. Here are
all the "questions" posed by Ed Gordon (a frequent host of
MSNBC's InterNight).
<P>
<DD>-- "Many can see that you have indeed been the most
powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with
the role that you played for four years?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "The debate is coming up. What do you want people to
come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What
should they know about Al Gore?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Biggest difference between you and Jack Kemp?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're
there to help the President. Now having said that, do you
want the job in 2000?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Any concerns that you all are overconfident with the
lead that the polls show and is there any concern that
because the lead is so large you might not be able to use
your coattails to usher in people into the House and the
Senate?"
<P>
Five questions, but Gordon couldn't squeeze in an
inquiry about Al Gore's hypocritical tobacco speech at the
Democratic convention.
<P>
<a name="race">
<B>3)</B> Speaking of sucking up to the VP, ever since a pro-Bush
independent expenditure campaign in 1988 highlighted
the Dukakis furlough of Willie Horton, for the media
Horton symbolized how the GOP "plays the race card."
Conservatives regularly pointed out, to no avail, how Gore
first raised the issue in a 1988 primary debate.
<P>
But in a story for CNN's AllPolitics.com Web site two
CNN reporters on Tuesday cited Gore's question not as an
example of racial politics but as a sign of Gore's
toughness. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski noticed the following
sentence in a VP debate preview story by CNN reporters Marc
Watts and Bob Franken:
<P>
<DD>"Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as
a Senator, he first raised what became known as the 'Willie
Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary debate."
<P>
In a February 13, 1992 CNN special on race and the
campaign, MRC associate editor Tim Graham reminded me, Ken
Bode placed all the onus on the GOP: "David Duke's
exploitation of white working class fears about blacks
echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically
notorious convict in America. William Horton, Jr., the focal
point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the
readiness of political leaders to exploit the racial
divide."
<P>
<a name="engberg">
<B>4)</B> Monday's CBS Evening News (October 7) included a
"Reality Check" segment by Eric Engberg on facts asserted
during Sunday's debate. Here's a piece of the story:
<P>
<DD>Eric Engberg: "Some facts got mangled."<BR>
<DD>Dole: "For the first time in history, you pay about 40
percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food,
clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this
administration."<BR>
<DD>Engberg: "Exaggeration. The most recent government study
says the average household spends $16,000 on the basics, and
only $6,000 on all taxes, including state and local taxes
outside the President's control."<BR>
<P>
As Engberg would say, TIME OUT! On Tuesday the Tax
Foundation released a report showing Dole was correct and
Engberg was wrong. The Tax Foundation discovered that the
government report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
"greatly understates taxes paid....Among the omissions, the
survey does not list the employee's share of Social Security
tax payments among taxes paid....Similarly, the BLS survey
does not report sales and excise taxes paid....Just as
important, the BLS survey results altogether ignore the
effect of indirect levies, such as business taxes, on
American households."
<P>
Factoring in all these taxes, the Tax Foundation
calculated that for households from $22,500 to $750,000
plus, taxes took a larger bite than the total for food,
clothing, and housing. The Tax Foundation found that
households in the $45,000 to $60,0000 category spent $16,000
as Engberg said on "the basics," but had a $25,000 tax burden. 
<P>
We need a Reality Check for the CBS Reality Check.

<a name="Dole">
<FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT>) On Tuesday night (October 8) ABC's World News Tonight
and NBC Nightly News aired stories on the big spending by labor
unions to defeat freshmen Republicans. The CBS Evening News and
ABC's World News Tonight featured pieces with clips of their
correspondent interviewing Bob Dole on his bus.
<BR>
<DD>
The big news of the day: Bozo. A man in a crowd yelled at
Dole that he should get bozo out of the White House. Dole shot
back: "Bozo's on his way out."
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw opened Inside Politics: "Was he borrowing
the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole
lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill
Clinton?"
<P>
On World News Tonight, ABC's John Cochran began his piece:
"Under pressure from critics in his own party to get personal
with the President, today Dole said he's ready to do just that.
In a series of interviews Dole admitted he was too soft on the
President in their first debate, especially on White House access
to FBI files on well-known Republicans...."
<P>
Noting that Dole failed to demand that Clinton promise not
the pardon those involved in Whitewater, Cochran ran a clip of
Dole explaining: "It would seem to me, particularly in the first
debate, when there's this myth out there about the mean Bob Dole,
if I'd done anything that even appeared to be stepping over the
line, that would have been the story."
<P>
Cochran continued: "That was exactly what happened today when
a supporter asked Dole to please get the bozo out of the White
House. Dole said bozo's on his way out."
<P>
Of course, Cochran made it the story. He didn't have to. The
CBS Evening News didn't mention the exchange.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="FBI">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2</FONT>) Cochran didn't use Dole's admission that he went too
easy on Clinton on the FBI files as an opportunity to report how
an aide to Craig Livingstone had contradicted his story. But he's
not the only reporter with an aversion to Clinton scandals. On
Monday's This Morning (October 7) Mark McEwen discussed the
debate with Bob Beckel and Fred Barnes. McEwen told Barnes:
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night."

<FONT SIZE=+2>3</FONT>) NBC's Today has also failed to report anything on the
deposition from Craig Livingstone's aide (see October 6
CyberAlert for details). But, on Tuesday morning Today's Matt
Lauer repeatedly pressed Newt Gingrich about his ethics case. 
<BR>
<DD>
Lauer asked Gingrich seven questions about the debate and why
he's so unpopular, then fired six questions about Gingrich and
the ethics committee. Here are the last six question posed by
Lauer in his October 8 interview with Gingrich:

<blockquote> "Are you completely sure, Mr. Speaker, that you have been
completely forthright and truthful in providing information to
this committee?"<BR>
<DD>"But wouldn't it seem somewhat obvious that there must be
something that's disturbing or distressing them completely. Why
would Republicans, on the subcommittee, vote to expand the
investigation if they haven't found something that disturbs even
them?"<BR>
<DD>"But can you think of a logical reason why they would do
that?"<BR>
<DD>"Do you envision any circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under
which you might be forced to resign based on this investigation?"<BR>
<DD>"So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt
Gingrich was not truthful with us in supplying information?"<BR>
<DD>Gingrich: "I don't think they can say that."<BR>
<DD> "If they did, would you consider resigning?"<BR>

with Elizabeth Dole. One of Couric's questions:
<blockquote>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for a
Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures, in
the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?"

Maybe he's just paying the price for a biased media.

<Li> On Thursday the <a href="#nasty">Dole and Clinton</a> campaigns released new TV
ads. Guess which one NBC's Brian Williams labeled "nasty." 
<LI>In front of cameras in the Senate press conference facility on
Friday, Senator <a href="#orrin">Orrin Hatch </a> released the deposition of a former
aide to Craig Livingstone. She said the FBI files were not
obtained by mistake and that there are pages missing from the log
tracking who looked at the files. Network coverage: Zilch.
<LI> The Wall Street Journal's <a href="#al">Al Hunt</a> spews some mean-spirited
venom, tagging a former Republican presidential candidate a
"hatemonger" (and it's not Pat Buchanan), calls one current U.S. 
Senate candidate an "extremist" while saying another symbolizes 
"hate." Special bonus: he trashes Kenneth Starr.

On Friday night's (October 4) CBS Evening News, reporter
Phil Jones explained what Dole has to do in the debate: "He's got
to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15 percent tax cut,
can be paid for without draconian cuts in social programs. He
wants to talk about the character issue, but he can't get
personal or look mean-spirited doing it."
<P>
    Avoiding a media tag of being mean-spirited will be pretty
tough. Just look at Thursday night's (October 3) The News with
Brian Williams on MSNBC.
 <P>   Williams announced: "We're going to take a look at the new
political ads that are out tonight. There are two of them. We're
going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which
takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory. Here it is now
in its entirety."
<P>
<DD>    And here's the "nasty" ad:
<P>
<blockquote>Dole ad narrator: "How to speak liberal."<BR>
Clinton video: "I can tell you this. I will not raise taxes on
the middle class to pay for these programs."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes right on the middle
class. How to speak more liberal."<BR>
Clinton: "People in this room still mad at me for that budget<BR>
because you think I raised your taxes too much."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes even on Social
Security."<BR>
Clinton: "It might surprise you to know that I think I raised
them too much too."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised your taxes and got
caught."<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
    Disjointed maybe, but nasty? Williams continued: "President 
Clinton is firing back with a new ad touting his achievements in 
office and once again tying Bob Dole to House Speaker Newt Gingrich."
<P>
    MSNBC showed the non-nasty ad which is all in color, except
for the video of Dole and Gingrich which is in black and white:
<P>
<blockquote>
Clinton ad narrator over video of scenes matching the text:
"Imagine. It's 11pm and you know where your kids are. At home.
President Clinton supports curfews so children are home and safe.
School uniforms to instill discipline. Ban cigarette ads aimed at
our children. Require teenage mothers to stay in school or lose
welfare.
<P> 
[black and white video of Dole next to Gingrich]: Dole and
Gingrich tried to slash school anti-drug programs. They'd take us
back.
<P>
[video in color of Clinton strolling under trees]: President
Clinton is looking forward. Helping parents to teach children
responsibility, protecting our values."

The front page headline in the Saturday, October 5
Washington Times declared: "Livingstone Lied on 'Filegate,' Ex-Aide 
Implies." The Washington Post also made the news its lead
story: "White House Contradicted on FBI Files: Ex-Aide Tells
Panel Staff Knew of Checks on GOP Officials." The Los Angeles
Times ran a story inside, but Saturday's New York Times had not a
word.
<P>
    Having watched all three broadcast network evening shows
Friday night, this was news to me. ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News and the NBC Nightly News did not mention the
development.(CNN's The World Today co-anchor Linden Soles did do a
brief item on it with a soundbite from Hatch.) What did TV
viewers miss?
<P>    
Here's the opening of Post reporter George Lardner's story:
<blockquote>"A former executive assistant in the White House security office,
contradicting accounts by her old boss and co-workers, told
Senate investigators this week that 'everybody in the office
knew' in the fall of 1993 that they were obtaining FBI files on
'people who were no longer working there.'
"The aide, Mari Anderson, an ex-Clinton-Gore campaign worker,
said they even joked about some prominent Republicans still listed
as current White House pass holders."</blockquote>
 <P>
   Later in the story:
<P>
<blockquote>"Asked about a six-month gap in the security office log
maintained to show who checked out files, Anderson said she was
confident some pages were missing from the copy the White House
provided the committee. She said she distinctly remembered making
checkout notations in the loose-leaf log during that six month
period, from March 29, 1994, to September 21, 1994."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Nixon only "accidently erased" 18 minutes. 
<P>
   So, did the front page treatment in both of Washington's
newspapers prompt network interest? No. NBC's Today on Saturday
didn't mention the news, but did find time to report that the
maker of M&Ms is test marketing 18 new colors. Saturday night,
ABC and CBS evening shows were bumped by college football in DC,
but NBC Nightly News aired nothing.  
<P>
    Minutes later on CNN's Capital Gang National Review's Kate
O'Beirne made the revelations her Outrage of the Week, observing:
"It remains to be seen if this prompts the outrage from the
people in the press is so richly deserves."
<P>
    Not so far. Sunday morning Sam Donaldson at least did ask
This Week with David Brinkley guest Leon Panetta a question about
it.
<P>
<BR>
    UPDATE 1: Last week I reported that none of the broadcast
networks reported the September 25 revelation of the six month
gap in the log. MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens has let me know that
CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) did air a whole piece that night
by Bob Franken.
<P>
    UPDATE 2: Last week I also reported that the networks failed
to note the FDIC report on how Hillary Clinton had deceived them.
Well, Friday night, a week and a half after the report made The
Washington Post's front page, it made NBC Nightly News, but only
through the hook of a chance to disparage Kenneth Starr for
speaking Friday at Regent University. 
 <P>
   NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reported: "Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic
Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White
House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for
political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
    Miklaszewski went on to summarize the status of Starr's
inquiry into the First Lady. Miklaszewski described the
FDIC report and aired the White House rebuttal.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT>
 On Saturday's Capital Gang (October 5) on CNN, Al Hunt,
Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor, was full of
hate. 
<P>
<blockquote>    -- "I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in
the Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of
hope personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms."<P>
    -- On Louisiana where Democrat Landrieu faces Republican
Jenkins: "In Louisiana, I think, Mary Landrieu is a bad
candidate, but she's going to win for three reasons. Woody
Jenkins is an extremist, Bill Clinton's going to carry Louisiana
and Newt Gingrich has scared those African-Americans. There'll be
a big black turnout."<P>
    -- His Outrage of the Week: "Kenneth Starr, the supposedly
non-partisan independent counsel investigating the Clintons, was
the featured speaker yesterday at a luncheon sponsored by right
wing hatemonger Pat Robertson, *whose Christian Broadcasting
Network and Regent Law School*. By pandering to Clinton-haters,
Mr. Starr appears to be abandoning all pretenses of impartiality.
He went into this job with a reputation as a fair-minded
conservative. He now looks more like a political hit man
desperately eager for a future Supreme Court appointment." 
    [* There is a word missing, but that's what he said.]

"softly."

feels free to interrupt him."
<LI>The <a href="#october">October 7</a> edition of Notable Quotables. If you make it

ABC <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced<BR>
Thursday night (October 3): 
<P>    "For days President Clinton has been dominating the news with
his efforts to ease the crisis between Israel and the
Palestinians. Today, Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage
with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's
work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy. Senator
Dole called the past three years rudderless and illusionary. He
claimed the President has squandered American power. The
administration has so far answered softly, but says there is more
to come."
<P>
    Reporter John Cochran went on the tag the speech as
"scathing." He reported: "In a scathing critique of Clinton
foreign policy, Dole rolled off a long list of what he called
failures, going back to the 1993 effort to restore order in
Somalia."
<P>
    What was the administration's response that earned Sawyer's
"soft" description? CBS and NBC viewers heard Press Secretary
Mike McCurry's retort. He played off Spiro Agnew's "nattering
nabobs of negativism" line (not generally considered "soft") and
asserted that Dole foreign policy advisers are "nattering
naysayers of gloom." ABC didn't show viewers McCurry's soundbite.
<P>
    On NBC Nightly News, David Bloom also used the term "harsh"
to describe Dole's speech: "It was Dole's harshest critique yet
of what he called Clinton's failed foreign policy." But a bit
later in his story Bloom put the tone in a better light, noting
that "After reviewing his speech over breakfast with retired
General Colin Powell, Dole chose his words carefully. His tone
was measured. He was playing politics, but he wanted to appear
presidential."
<P>
<BR>
<a name="gore">
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2)</FONT>
CBS reporter Rita Braver profiled Al Gore Thursday
night. Her October 3 Evening News piece included this rather
bizarre sequence: 
<blockquote>Braver: "He's in on every key White House meeting and
decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore
convinced the President to create a controversial national
monument in Utah. Of late, Republican have attacked him for making
a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer
caused by smoking."<BR>
Gore at Democratic convention: "It hurt very badly to watch her
savaged by that terrible disease."<BR>
Braver: "While for several years after her death he let tobacco
be grown on land he owned. Gore dismisses that attack as
politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he
feels free to interrupt him."<BR>
Gore, going to microphone in front of Clinton: "Could I add a
word since..."<BR>
Braver: "But above all Gore sees his job as making the President
look good. And he's been amply rewarded. It's no secret that if
Bill Clinton is re-elected he wants Al Gore to succeed him."
</blockquote>
<P>
    So, CBS acknowledges the whole premise of Gore's emotional
convention speech was a fraud, but it's wrong to even raise the
subject because he's so powerful he can cut in front of the
President at a podium.

away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a

<LI><a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> wonders if OJ Simpson "will ever get a fair shake in this country?" It's one of several liberal questions on race he poses to Johnnie Cochran.
<LI><a href="#moderate">The newly moderate</a> President Clinton attends a fundraiser packed with aging 1960s lefties and Hollywood celebrities with animus toward Republicans. 
<LI><a href="#faithful">Incredibly, a major newspaper</a> says it was an error to report that Bill Clinton and Dick Morris have been unfaithful to their wives.
</OL>
<P>
<a name="gumbel">
<B>1) Wednesday's Today (October 2)</B> carried the third part of
Bryant Gumbel's interview with Johnnie Cochran. And as he did on
Monday, Gumbel again used the segment as an opportunity to
promote his liberal views on race.
<P>
<DD>Discussing how much media attention the first OJ trial
attracted, Bryant Gumbel asked: "Do you think if those two
victims had been, say, Marguerite, his first wife, and Al
Cowlings, his best friend, that there would have been the same
amount?"
<P>
<DD>Johnnie Cochran responded: "Absolutely not. And I think any
person who wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."<BR>
<DD>To which Gumbel shot back: "Why? Because America doesn't care
about black victims?"
<P>
<DD>After Cochran's reply, Gumbel inquired: "Most white Americans
still charge that OJ's jurors didn't do their job. You talk about
a rush to judgment. They would claim the same. They would claim
the verdict was race based. Do you think their judgment of those
jurors is race based?"
<P>
<DD>Then, after asking if the complicated case merited more
consideration that jury gave it in a few hour of deliberation, 
Gumbel wondered: "Do you think OJ will ever get a fair shake in
this country. Will people ever let him live out his life and
accept the fact that he was acquitted?"
<P>
<DD>Fair shake? He's a millionaire football player who
successfully led a second career as a sports commentator, actor
and commercial spokesman. He then murders two people but is found
not guilty. How unfair.
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<B>2) At Boston's Fleet Center Saturday night</B> the Democrats
and Senator John Kerry held a $2 million fundraiser starring
several celebrities.  
<P>
<DD>During the Democratic convention, NBC's Tom Brokaw insisted
that since 1992 Clinton and Gore "have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center." Keeping that assurance in
mind, here's a bit of Boston Globe reporter Michael Grunwald's
September 29 story on the event: "Peter, Paul and Mary played
'Blowin in the Wind,' even though President Clinton has been
accused of doing just that. In fact, the legendary folk trio even
played 'Puff the Magic Dragon' -- and the President clapped along,
war on drugs notwithstanding....It was a long, strange trip at
the Fleet Center last night, as a parade of lefty rockers and
folkies brought back a slice of 1960s culture for a 1990s audience." 
<P>
<DD>These 1960s activists were in attendance to praise the
President. The Washington Post reported on September 30: "Mary
Travers said peace, justice and equality are still what the fight
is all about, while [Don] Henley praised the President for
protecting the environment and exhorted the audience to elect a
Democratic Congress 'so that there will be trees to hug,'"
<P>
<DD>Current stars also attended as the Boston Herald's Ed Hayward
reported that comedienne/actress Whoopi Goldberg announced: "I'm
glad to see some good-looking people in office. The other party
seems to have taken some ugly pills."
<P>
<DD>Isn't that the kind of language the media deem "nasty" when
uttered by a conservative?
<P>
<a name="faithful">
<B>3) The Internet Guild's Steve Allen caught this gem</B> while
doing a Nexis search. Under the "corrections and clarifications"
heading the September 5 Chicago Tribune corrected syndicated
columnist Linda Bowles: 
<P>
<DD>"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were 'guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven to
have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." 
<P>
<DD>So, this is an "error" but reporting "slashes" in Medicare or
school lunches is just solid reporting.

<LI><a href="#20/20"> To Hugh Downs on 20/20</a> Friday night, it's Hillary the world's most persecuted First Lady. And Barbara Walters comes at Bill Clinton from the left, charging the welfare bill was "too extreme."
<LI><a href="#headlines">You can't always trust what you read.</a> A local example of conflicting headlines based on the same facts. 
<LI><a href="#text">The text of the September 23</a> edition of Notable Quotables. Most of the quotes have not been in any CyberAlert messages. Among the quotes, the New York Times says the Republican Party has been "a vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the Goldwater campaign..." Plus, Time and Newsweek slobber over Al Gore.
</OL>
<a name="20/20">
<B>1) On Friday night (September 20) ABC's 20/20</B><BR> ran Barbara
Walters' interview with the Clintons. Introducing the second segment,
co-host Hugh Downs announced: 
<P>
<DD>    "She is, perhaps, the most criticized, the most scrutinized,
First Lady in history. Everyone has an opinion about Hillary Clinton,
and Mrs. Clinton has heard them all. How has her marriage changed in
these four years? What are her concerns now, both personal and political?
Barbara continues now with the President and the First Lady, the world's
most powerful couple."
<P>
<DD>    During that segment, Bill Clinton said he might have Hillary
work on welfare reform during his second term, a suggestion that he
may scale back welfare reform to please liberals. But instead of pursuing 
the possibility that his signature was nothing more than election-year
positioning, in the next segment Walters asked him:
<P>
<DD>"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the bill 
is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under the new bill a
60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy families will end. It's
been estimated as many as a million children will go hungry. What are
you going to do about that?"
<P>
<a name="headlines">
<B>2) In the Virginia Senate race,</B><BR> incumbent Republican John
 Warner faces Democratic challenger Mark Warner. Having both
candidates share a last name isn't the only confusing part about
following the race. Just look at these two headlines from
September 19 on a Mason-Dixon poll showing the Republican Warner
leading 54 to 34 percent.

<P>
<B>Mistake to Talk to Conservatives; Mistake Not to Talk to Liberals</B><BR>
"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian
Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the
religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes
to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in
reinvigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign
official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him
thanks for me.'"<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's David Bloom, September 14 Nightly News.</I>
<P>
<CENTER><I>vs.</I></CENTER>
<P>
"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd [at the NAACP convention].
That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to
speak at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he
was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and
an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here,
Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines
and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this
presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 Nightly News. </I>
<P>
<B>Fallows' Hillary Fan Club Application</B><BR>
"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman?
Probably so. From Primary Colors to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday
Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in
the World. Bill Clinton has suffered when judged on the age-old
standard of masculinity: military service. But female observers,
from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a
catty ferocity they would not apply to men. A man with a prim
exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter could
testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a
woman is an emasculating schemer." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New U.S. News & World
Report Editor James Fallows in an essay titled "She's Lois Lane"
in the September/October Mirabella magazine.</I>
<P>
<B>Ad Says Dole Opposes Time Off While Your Kid Dies: I Loved It!</B><BR>
"That family leave ad was right on the mark. You know, it
absolutely escapes me how somebody can be for family values and
yet be willing to deny a father the opportunity to spend time
with a critically ill child or a mother time with a newborn
without fear of losing their job." <BR><DD><I>-- Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt on the Clinton campaign's negative ads, CNN's Capital Gang, September 14.</I>
<P>
<B>Intensely Competitive Puff Pieces About Gore</B><BR>
"George Bush fumed about jokes that he had put his manhood in a
blind trust to serve as Ronald Reagan's Vice President. The
young Dan Quayle never convinced the country he had the gravitas
to be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private,
intensely competitive Al Gore has managed the contortionist's
feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's
re-election without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both
brainy, moderate Southerners with an abiding interest in the
plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each
other like competitive brothers." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.</I>
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss
does, tonight he is next door in the Old Executive Office
Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity
theory, open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific
metaphors in modern society. He's writing a speech, and the
elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet
Coke cans...Clinton may lead the country into the millennium,
but it is Gore who truly embodies the new century's
possibilities and anxieties."<BR>
<DD><I> -- Newsweek reporter Bill Turque, September 2.</I>
<P>
<B>As Opposed to Those Pro-Civil Rights Southern Democrats</B><BR>
"But most important is the Republican Party's recent record as
the vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the
Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's
`Southern Strategy' in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to
Nixon Democrats (later Reagan Democrats) in the northern
suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to
escape from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare
cheats and to impose law and order, and they fought against
affirmative action." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief
R.W. Apple on why the Dole-Kemp ticket isn't attracting black
support, September 19.</I>
<P>
<B>Clinton Makes Life Great, Dole Makes It Worse</B><BR>
"For most people in this country, life is awfully good. So
Clinton doesn't need to raise any issues. He just needs to point
to his record and promise more of the same. The people who don't
have a great life right now -- the 39 million people below the
poverty level, the 40 million people with no health insurance,
the 6.2 million people earning at or below the minimum wage --
are the people who really do have the issues. But Dole isn't
about to reach out to them, and they aren't about to vote for
Dole or the Republicans. That would make their plight worse, if
that's possible."<BR><DD><I> -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner
in his USA Today column, September 17.</I>

<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter Michael Duffy to
Alan Murray on PBS's Washington Week in Review, September 6.</I>
<P>
<B>The Media Encouraged Newt's Extremism</B><BR>
"The media's preoccupation with conflict in general deeply
affects the behavior of politicians, especially in Congress. An
ambitious politician knows that the sure way to command press
attention is with sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt
Gingrich built his power with media fireworks." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Former New York Times reporter Hedrick Smith narrating his PBS special
People and the Power Game, September 3.</I>
<P>
<B>Bigoted Bonnie</B><BR>
"TV viewers saw a well-orchestrated image of a moderated
Republican Party, portraying itself as pro-woman,
pro-minorities, and pro-tolerance. This is in sharp contrast to
the delegates on the floor, sixty percent of whom
self-identified as conservative Christians." <BR>

<a name="networks">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Last week</FONT> I reported that the network evening shows had
failed to mention a FDIC report which concluded that Hillary
Clinton had drafted a real estate document meant to "deceive"
federal regulators. The FDIC report was released last Monday,
September 23. Through Monday night September 30 it had yet to
generate a mention on any of the broadcast networks.
<P>
<I>What else went unreported on network evening shows last week:</I>
-- On Tuesday, September 24 a House committee held hearing on
how the Clinton Administration let criminals become citizens. The
Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers
yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight
subcommittee of  rampant' abuses in the Citizenship USA program
that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records
become citizens."
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- On Wednesday, September 25. Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a
six month gap in the log listing who at the White House accessed
the FBI background files. The Washington Times bannered the news
across page one the next day.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- also on Wednesday, The Washington Times reported that U.S.
Rep. John Mica had sent a letter to Clinton's drug czar demanding
release of a four month old Institute for Defense Analysis report
that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective
than Clinton's drug treatment emphasis. Just 9 percent of
Clinton's drug budget goes to interdiction.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting, but drug czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to respond at an October 1 House hearing.</I>
<P>
-- On Thursday, September 26, 170 members of Congress send a
letter to Clinton asking that he promise not to pardon any
Whitewater figures. In an interview last Monday on the PBS
NewsHour Clinton had said he thought Kenneth Starr was out to get
him and the President defended Susan McDougal's decision to
refuse to testify. The Sunday Washington Times had a story which
began: "House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government
if Republican demanded a vote on a resolution calling for
President Clinton not to pardon key Whitewater figures, Rep.
Spencer Bachus said yesterday."
<I>Network evening show coverage: One question from anchor John Roberts to analyst Laura Ingraham on the Sept. 29 CBS Evening News.</I>
<P>
What did they cover? Between last Thursday and Sunday each of
the network evening shows aired two stories on Newt Gingrich's
dealings with the House ethics committee. And on Sunday's Today,
co-host Jodie Applegate couldn't quite get her history correct,
asking Gingrich Press Secretary Tony Blankley:
    "Mr. Blankley, it was seven years ago that Newt Gingrich
called on Jim Wright, who was then the Speaker of the House, to
step aside because an investigation had begun into his affairs."
<P>
<I>Of course the investigation had more than "begun."</I>
<P>
<a name="headline">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) The House</FONT> wrapped up its work over the weekend. Monday's
USA Today headline over a page A13 story reviewing the session
under GOP control read: "A Lean, Some Say Mean, GOP Machine."
<P>
<a name="acceptance">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) Another sign</FONT> of positive progress: On the September 28
Saturday Night Live guest host Tom Hanks played Peter Jennings in
skit in which Jennings interviews Clinton, Dole and Perot. 
<BR><DD>Here's Tom Hanks as Peter Jennings: "Mr. President, we here
at ABC News are not in the business of making endorsements, but
everyone here is voting for Bill Clinton and I personally cannot
imagine how any decent person would not, in fact, do the same. In
light of this, which of your many achievements do you feel
important to emphasize as we head toward the election?"
<P>
<I>It's hard to tell parody from reality.</I>
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>4) Friday's Washington Post</FONT> "In the Loop" column relayed:
"Scuttlebutt at the Voice of America has it that former U.S. News
& World Report political reporter Steven Roberts is being wooed
to replace outgoing VOA director Geoffrey Cowan." New U.S. News
Editor James Fallows asked Roberts to step down a few weeks ago,
but the Post reported that "The VOA was thinking about Roberts
before new U.S. News boss James Fallows began the purge."
<P>
<a name="yes">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>5) On Monday's (Sept. 30) Today,</FONT> Bryant Gumbel began day
one of a three day series with Johnnie Cochran. While Gumbel did
ask about OJ's alibi and how even if the Los Angeles police
botched the investigation and employ racist, that it's hard to
believe a conspiracy, he also posed these two questions:
    "Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
    "Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal,
most white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's
out walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?"
<P>
<I>Hmmm? Could it be that not everyone is happy that he got away with murder?</I>

<LI><a href="#abc">ABC's World News Tonight</a>, which didn't report poverty and

<a name="abc">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Bad news is news, not good news. Right?</FONT> Not at ABC when
the good news benefits Clinton.
<P>
    On October 6, 1994 the Census Bureau reported poverty had
risen to a three-decade high. ABC's World News Tonight: No story.
On October 5, 1995 the bureau reported a slight drop in poverty,
but the gap between richest and poorest grew. ABC's World News
Tonight: No story.
<P>
    On September 26, 1996 the Census bureau reports median income
up and poverty down. ABC's World News Tonight: Big story
crediting Bill Clinton.
<P>
    Peter Jennings opened the show Thursday night: "On World News
Tonight this Thursday, a bloody day between Israelis and
Palestinians. The Census Bureau says that Americans are earning
more for the first time in six years. Family income is up."
<P>
    Barry Serafin reported in his story that median household
income was up 2.7 percent, but still lower than 1989. Serafin's
story continued:
<BR><DD>"The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4
million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than
the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped
to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent. What does it add up
to?"
<BR><DD>Professor Frank Levy, MIT: "Things are slowly getting better and
the people feel OK about it. It's not nirvana, but it's certainly
not doom and gloom either."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "And there was certainly no gloom and doom at the White
House where the President pounced on the new figures."
Clinton: "The news is remarkably good, and I'd like to share it
with you."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Citing the income gains the President declared that the
country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans"
<BR><DD>Clinton: "We have had the largest decline in the inequality of
incomes in America in 27 years."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Census Bureau officials, however, said that decline was
so small it was statistically insignificant. Still, there was
praise for today's generally upbeat report."
<BR><DD>Levy: "Well I think the credit is shared between the President
and Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good day for
Bill Clinton."
<P>
<DD>The New York Times reported June 30 that "the share of
national income earned by the top 5 percent of households grew at
a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan
administration, which was often characterized as favoring the
rich." ABC's World News Tonight that night: No story.
<P>
<DD>Immediately following Serafain, Jim Wooten reported on Bob
Dole in Florida. Wooten noted that Dole correctly pointed out
that poverty rose in Florida, then reported: "Still, the Senator
had much less to say about the numbers than about a President he
says is lying to older Americans, telling them Republicans will
cut Medicare, trying to frighten them into voting Democratic."
<BR><DD>Following a Dole soundbite, Wooten continued: "Then Senator
Dole tried to raise a bit of fear himself about Mr. Clinton's
plans for a second term."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He'll raise taxes again on the America people if he's re-elected."
Wooten: "The Senator insists that his principle campaign themes -- his 
bad news message about a limping economy, stagnate wages, high taxes 
and heavy deficits -- will eventually change the shape of this election. 
So far they haven't, but he keeps trying."
<P>
<DD>They might have a better chance if ABC weren't endorsing Clinton's 
claims while countering Dole's by saying he's also employing fear. 
<P>
<a name="what">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) On the September 25 Inside Politics</FONT> CNN's Bernie Shaw
took up the Dole charge that Clinton is really a liberal. To put
Shaw's question in context, here's how the exchange went with
Republican strategist Charlie Black and Democratic strategist
Frank Greer:
<BR><DD>Charlie Black: "People don't mind name calling if you call them
conservatives, which is what Bob Dole is. Teenage drug use has
doubled because Bill Clinton reduced the size of the White House
drug office 83 percent. How can you say he's had a good record on
drugs? Bernie, here's the problem. Bill Clinton wants the federal
government to run your life. He wants to take more and more of
your hard-earned money and then he wants to reward you a tax
credit if you behave the way he wants you to behave."
<BR><DD>Frank Greer: "It's the same worn-out rhetoric that they tried to
use in Congress and it didn't work."
<BR><DD>Bernard Shaw: "I understand the desire to talk about issues. I
understand that. A very innocent question. What's wrong with
being a liberal?"

Arizona electorate.
<LI>The Weekly Standard discovers that President Clinton hired his
<a href="#speech">speechwriter </a> from U.S. News & World Report because Clinton liked
how the journalist covered his 1992 campaign. That reporter now

<H3> 1)</H3> On Tuesday night's (September 17) World News Tonight, ABC's
Jim Wooten reported from Arizona on Bob Dole's campaign. Wooten 
asserted:<P>

<DD>"It's one measure of Senator Dole's problems that he even feels it 
<DD>necessary to campaign here in Arizona, Barry Goldwater's ultra-
<DD>conservative backyard. But the race is close here, quite close."
<P>
    Not "usually safe for Republicans," but "ultra-conservative." How
"ultra-conservative" exactly is Senator McCain? And if the state is so
"ultra-conservative" how could it possibly go for Clinton?

<H3>2)</H3> The September 23 Weekly Standard includes a profile of chief
White House speechwriter Donald Baer who had been Assistant Managing
Editor of U.S. News & World Report when he jumped to the Clinton team
in 1994. Writer Christopher Caldwell explained how Baer got his job:
<DD>    "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during
the 1992 campaign. While other journalists -- David Shribman of The
Wall Street Journal, Joe Klein of New York, Ron Brownstein of the Los
Angeles Times -- ignored the more sensational aspects of the campaign
for enthusiastic grapplings with 'Clintonism,' Baer wrote with extreme
empathy about Clinton's background.
 <DD>   "'I think it's a southern thing' says one of Baer's journalistic
colleagues, who also knows Clinton. 'Being of the South and still being
rooted there, yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself
in the larger world -- the two of them have a lot in common.' While
Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not necessarily a liberal.
Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism. This 
enthusiasm can appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. 
One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as 
'bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. 'Clinton was the moral 
leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"

<H3>    3) </H3>Last week the MRC released its study of prime time network
coverage of the party conventions. We found four times more extremist
labels were applied to Republicans as Democrats, but Democrats were
tagged liberal twice as often as Republicans were called conservative.
In addition, virtually all of the questions to both parties came from 
the left as the networks portrayed both the Republicans and Democrats
as too conservative. 

<DD>    Last week the Center for Media and Public Affairs also released
its study. CMPA examined not prime time but the ABC, CBS and NBC
evening newscasts during the two convention weeks. Some of their
findings:
<UL>
<LI> "Journalists continued to crowd out the politicians, taking
up 12 times as much airtime as the newsmakers. Reporters' comments
took up 75% of the speaking time in convention stories, compared
to only 6% for the four nominees. Other party officials and delegates
accounted for 10% of the airtime."
<LI>  Both parties' policies got even worse press than their 
candidates -- three to 1 negative overall. Five out of six sources 
(83%) criticized GOP policies, and two out of three (67%) rejected 
the Democrats' stands."
</UL>
<P>
    The Washington Post's John Carmody summarized the finding: 
"Comments on the two issues most talked about -- abortion during
the GOP meeting, welfare during the Democrats' -- suggested a 
left-liberal bent."

<LI>On Tuesday's Today show <a href="#gumbel"> Bryant Gumbel </a> interviewed Susan McDougal
from  jail in Arkansas. But instead of pressing her on why she
won't tell what she knows (for which she's been granted
immunity), Gumbel sympathized with her plight and portrayed her
as a victim of Republican politics. He asked: "Have you any doubt
that Kenneth Starr and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that
is purely political?"
<P>
<LI> CNBC cancels the <a href="#cal"> Cal Thomas </a> show, a decision Thomas says will
only fuel conservative feelings that the media are liberal.

1. Susan McDougal has already been found guilty of fraud
and been jailed for contempt of court for over a week for
refusing to answer questions about Bill Clinton's knowledge of
the fraudulent SBA loan deal. From the September 17 Today show,
here are some of Gumbel's questions to her, transcribed by MRC
intern Matt Turosz:
<P>
    Gumbel: Mrs. McDougal, let me start with you if I might. How
bad has confinement been there in Conway?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "How are you being treated by the authorities and the
other inmates?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "There are those who are obviously hoping that in
prison will prompt a change of heart on you part. Are you having
any second thoughts about refusing to answer questions?"
<P>
    Gumbel then posed his one and only tough question: "According
to reports, you were charged with contempt after being asked to
testify, about whether Bill Clinton knew about an illegal loan or
the purchase of a piece of property with some loan proceeds. Why
have you refused to answer that question?"
<P>
    McDougal responded by claiming Ken Starr had lied to her
before and failed to come through on a deal: "He used witnesses
against me with perjured testimony. Would you buy a used car from
this man. I certainly wouldn't go into a hearing without my
lawyer, into a grand jury room, and answer questions he asked me.
He has lied repeatedly. I won't deal with him."
<P>
    Instead of challenging her, Gumbel summarized her view: "So
basically you don't trust his promises of immunity from
prosecution in exchange for answers to his questions?"
<P>
    McDougal responded: "...He has lied about me. He has lied
during the trial. He has lied after the trial. And he has said
many times give us a proffer, something against the Clintons,
something that we can use, and we'll make all your problems go
away. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not how America works, and
that not how I want to deal with him."
<P>    
Gumbel next queried "Is there any amount of time in jail that
might make your either (A) change your mind or (B) have second
thoughts about trusting Mr. Starr and his deputies?"
<P>
    McDougal answered: "I told you earlier, I become stronger
everyday in my conviction everyday that I sit here."
<P>
    Gumbel then asserted: "Have you any doubt that Kenneth Starr
and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that is purely
political?"
<P>
    McDougal: "I don't believe anyone in America doubts it....I
want to know were I can go to complain about these people's evil
agenda to overrun me to get to the President."
<P>
    Gumbel took the same approach in talking to her lawyer:
"Bobby McDaniel, you said that your client is being used as
political pawn. Have you any legal recourse but to sit there and
watch this unfold?"
<P>
    A couple of questions later Gumbel returned to McDougal and
again bought her premise: "Given that you think this is all just
a Republican witch hunt, do you expect the pressure to ease
somewhat after the election?"
<P>

2. On Monday CNBC announced the cancellation of the weekend
interview shows hosted by Cal Thomas, Al Roker and Gerry Spence.
Thomas's last show (6:30pm and 1am ET Sat. and Sun.) will air in
early October. The Washington Post's John Carmody on Tuesday
quoted Thomas suggesting that the decision will "further the
already deep suspicion among conservatives that the news media is
overwhelmingly liberal."
<P>
    I'll let you know when Thomas finds another outlet and,
hopefully, a more prominent time slot.

<br>
<B>Dear MRC Member</B>,
<BR>
<P>
What happened to the conservative revolution we were all so excited about a year and a half ago? On Election Day 1994 the GOP captured both the House and the Senate, Clinton's socialized health care plan had been demolished, his agenda was in ruins. Most conservatives were celebrating the death of liberalism. 
<P><blockquote><I>I wasn't. I publicly warned that the conservative movement had no idea what was about to hit it.</I></blockquote>
<P>And did it ever. The left-wing press launched the most vicious, dishonest character 
assassination campaign I've ever seen. Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and others were vilified daily. The media flat out lied, thousands of times in 
fact, about the Contract with America, saying the "cuts" were going to put women and children, the poor and the elderly, on the streets -- hungry and naked. Clean air, clean water, our national parks -- everything was endangered. 
All because of those "tax cuts for the rich."
<P>You know I'm not exaggerating any of this.The left-wing press stopped at nothing in its attacks. Just look at how they accused the conservative talk radio community of responsibility for the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history -- the Oklahoma City bombing. It defies belief.
<P>And look at the damage the liberal media caused. Today the Contract with America is 
in shambles. Newt Gingrich has the worst approval rating of any politician in America. And 
Bill Clinton -- considered politically dead one year ago -- is enjoying his highest ratings ever, and leading Bob Dole by 20 points according to some surveys.
<P><I><blockquote>The national press has turned much of America against our ideas by distorting 
everything we stand for. Theirs is an awesome power -- and they are using it.</blockquote></I>
<P>At a national press conference, which took place on June 5, I announced that the 
Media Research Center at <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> 
has launched the biggest political counterattack in history to stop these `60s-era elitists once and for all. 
<P>The MRC has been quietly working on our<B> "Tell the Truth!" </B>campaign for months, 
test-marketing it to conservative activists and voters each week. In the past few weeks my staff and I have been interviewed for ABC's <I>Nightline</I>, CNN's <I>Crossfire</I>, CBN's<I> 700 Club</I>, C-SPAN, CNBC, and many other national media outlets. 
<P>A powerful forum for the MRC is talk radio. In the past month, we've conducted over 50 radio interviews which have aired on hundreds of stations, and reached millions of voters. MRC spokesmen have appeared on nationally syndicated shows like the 
<I>G. Gordon Liddy Show</I>, the  <I>Ollie North Show</I>, and the <I>Michael Reagan Show.</I> And, when Rush Limbaugh invited me to host his radio show recently, I used it to show millions of Americans just how distorted the left-wing press has become.
<P>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We are combining our sophisticated media 
research operation with advanced technology to produce the most comprehensive and 
creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal media.
<blockquote><I><P>The MRC <B>"Tell the Truth!"</B> campaign is hitting the liberal press in a way it's never been hit before. We have one message for the left-wing "news" media: Your days of 
unchecked bias are over. </I></blockquote>
<P>I am confident that this critically important campaign will end the media's non-stop 
attacks on conservatives, and put an end to their incessant support for Clinton and his ilk. Because of the urgency and importance of this campaign, your generous gift to the MRC is more vital than ever.<U> Thank you for helping us.</U>
<BR>

<p>
<H3>    Only one item today:</H3>
<P>       
<BR>
    Bill Clinton snubbed the Christian Coaltion conference over the weekend, 
but the media reacted a bit differently than when Bob Dole decided to not 
address the NAACP. 
<P> 
    Friday night none of the network evening news shows mentioned Clinton's
decision not to appear, though all did pieces on the conference. The issue
came up only on CNN's Inside Politics. In July, all the networks aired stories
about Dole not going to the NAACP convention. (Dole made a surprise appearance 
at the Christian Coalition meeting on Saturday and offered an introduction to
Jack Kemp who had been scheduled.) 
<P>
    Neither ABC or CBS had an evening newscast Saturday night on 
Washington stations because of college football, but NBC did not
get bumped for sports, so let's compare NBC's coverage.
<P>
On the July 10 NBC Nightly News, Jim Miklaszewski reported from the
NAACP gathering:
<P>    
<DD>"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as no surprise to Bob 
Dole. Dole had been invited to speak at the convention yesterday, but declined.
He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball 
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<P>    
After explaining how the crowd was very anti-Republican, Miklaszewski
concluded his story: "By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those
racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans 
that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."
<P>
On Saturday night's (September 14) NBC Nightly News, David Bloom 
reported:
<P>
<DD>    "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition 
despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might
send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters."
<P>
    Bloom concluded his story:
<P>
<DD>    "Clinton's campaign spokeman said in a statement 'watching Bob Dole arm 
in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued 
by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, 
in re-invigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign official 
was all smiles, saying, 'if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'"
<P>
    Anchor Brian Williams then announced: "The Christian Coaltion claims 
almost two million active members and is a potent political force in 31 states, 
but its voice is no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians. NBC's 
Bob Abernethy has our report."
<P>    Abernethy then began his bizarre story on "conservative" Christians:
<P>
<DD>"The Christian Coalition's organization, money and grassroots activism have 
made it one of the most important voices in the country for conservative values, 
especially opposition to abortion. The coalition's success has troubled other
Christians who agree with many of its objectives, but are uncomfortable with
its partisianship, and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its
neglect of the poor. One group of coalition critics is the Call to Renewal. 
It heard today from children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman."
<P>
    Abernethy went on to look at Jim Wallis of Sojourners, a left-wing 
crusade. He never got to any "conservative Christians."
<P>
 Let me summarize the differences in approach to one major candidate 
failing to appear at one of the conventions:
<P>
<OL>
    <LI> Dole's snub is big news. Clinton's is not.
    <LI> Dole's decision was "an insult to all African American voters." 
Clinton's was not an insult to all Christian-American voters.
    <LI> Dole's address to the Christian Coalition "might send the wrong message 
to moderate, swing voters." Clinton's appearance before the left-wing NAACP did 
not.
    <LI> Dole's speech prompted NBC to air a bizarre story citing only liberals 
about how the Christian Coalition does not represent all conservative Christians, 
many of whom are "troubled" by its policy views. Clinton's NAACP address did 
not prompt NBC to do a story on how the NAACP does not represent all liberal 
African-Americans or even all African-Americans, nor any consideration of how 
the NAACP's policies "trouble" anyone.
</OL>
<P>
    Tom Brokaw insisted at a June National Press Club appearnace: "We've 
worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do." Hard to tell.

ads were little more than character assassination. Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, 
ABC and CBS portrayed Dole as the villain who has dirtied the until now clean campaign. Only
NBC looked at Clinton's role. On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings announced: "The campaign for President took a 
nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out
at the Democrats for what he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the kindest 
thing Mr. Dole had to say." Reporter Jim Wooten showed clips of Dole complaining about Clinton and of Dole raising the medical records issue. Then he explained:
<P>
<DD>		"Press Secretary McCurry was asked by reporters today if the
		records would show indication of a number of diseases, including
		a sexually transmitted one. He said, no."
<P>
McCurry: "This has been put into play no doubt by those who seek to destroy the President. The President's physician reported on May 24th of this year he was in excellent overall health. Shecould not have done that if any of the allegations about diseases were true."
<P>
Wooten, concluding his piece: "It was bound to come to this no doubt as Senator Dole has been under considerable pressure from his campaign tacticians to begin attacking the President on
issues of personal character. So far he's resisted. Today may have been a signal that he's changing his mind."
<P>
  <DD><I>  So Dole's to blame for a reporter asking about a "sexually
transmitted" disease.</I>
<P>
    Then, Peter Jennings got to the second part of the how the campaign "took a nasty turn today" premise. Immediately after Wooten
finished he introduced the next story: "The President is going to
come under further Republican attack with the release next week
of the House Committee on Government Operations and Oversight's
report on the firings at the White House travel office."
  <P>  On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton
as victim theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole re-opened one of his
favorite lines of attack today about President Clinton's health
records. Phil Jones is our man with the Dole campaign, Phil."
Jones provided a very short piece which dealt only with the
medical records issue, and concluded: "Dan, this campaign is
headed exactly where everybody expected it to go: personal..."
  Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers what so upset
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for
a way to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is
taking off the gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
    Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative
television advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of
running a campaign of fear, of engaging in character
assassination."
    After a clip of Dole, Bloom continued: "At the Democratic
National Convention two weeks ago the President made this
pledge:"<P>
<BR>
<DD>Clinton: "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of
insults. The American people deserve it."
<DD>Bloom: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have
run only 42 positive ads with
<DD> 4,200 negative ads running across
the country."<BR>
<P>
Clips of Clinton ads, including: "If Dole sits here [Oval Office]
and Gingrich runs Congress what could happen. Medicare slashed. A
woman's right to choose gone."
  <P>
  Following another Dole soundbite of Dole and reaction from
the Clinton campaign, Bloom concluded: 
"Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget next
week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen
drug use, ads even tougher than this one."
Ad: "Bill Clinton said he'd lead the war on drugs and change
America. All he did was change his mind."
Bloom then ended his story by forwarding the "nasty" theme: "At a
Dole rally today the music blared 'get ready.' Get ready, that
is, for a very nasty campaign."

The Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press will be releasing the results of their survey of 1,508
people. Here are some of the more interesting findings:
<P>
<BR>
-- All in all, how would you rate the job the press has done
in covering the presidential campaign so far?
<P>
<DD>          44% Good
<DD>          29% Only fair
<DD>          13% Excellent
 <DD>         11% Poor
<P>
-- How much influence do you think news organizations have on
which candidate becomes President? (Posed only to the 1,141
registered voters in the sample)
<P>
<DD>          64% Too much
<DD>          30% About the right amount
<DD>           4% Too little
<P>
-- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bill Clinton's election campaign? (Again,
registered voters only, but this time sample of 565)
<P> 
 <DD>        67% Fair
     <DD>     24% Unfair
<P>
    -- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bob Dole's election campaign? (565 registered
voters)
<P>
       <DD>    65% Fair
<DD>           25% Unfair
<P>
    -- Who do you think most newspaper reporters and TV
journalists want to see win the presidential election -- Bill
Clinton, Bob Dole or Ross Perot? (Posed to sample size of 576)
<P>
         <DD>  59% Clinton
           <DD>17% Dole
<DD>            1% Perot
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    So, the media are fair in coverage of both candidates, but the
public thinks that the media have too much influence on who wins and
perceives that reporters hope Clinton will win. Very confusing. --

<h4>Final Report on 1996 Television Network Convention Coverage:<br>

TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice as Often, But Fire Liberal
Questions<br>
Both Parties Too Conservative for the Networks</h4>
</center>

    Alexandria, VA -- The television networks substantially
increased the number of labels they applied to Democrats during
their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers
to a barrage of questions from the left. For Republicans
gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the
issue. For Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the
right on welfare reform became the media focus. Adding up both
questions and statements made by reporters to one another,
abortion or exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an
issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers heard about welfare
reform 43 times in Chicago.<p>

    After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter
during the August political conventions, the Media Research
Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This
analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN (starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the
joint NBC/PBS broadcast.<p> 

    <b>Key findings:</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged
conservative. Studies of the 1984, 1988 and 1992 conventions
found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats.
In 1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118
conservative labels during the GOP conclave, but just 38 liberal
labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans
were tagged 59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more
extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled 119 times (44
moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).<p>

    In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured
about half as many liberal tags with 16. In San Diego, the
networks focused most of their labeling on conservative
delegates and speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged --
three moderate and two conservative labels. The Republican
platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform
was never described as liberal. See page 3 for a summary table
and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.<p>

<li>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left
side of the political spectrum. On 51 occasions in San Diego
Republicans were hit with questions from the left, especially
about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six
inquiries from the right. Two weeks later instead of questioning
Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the left,
the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President
Clinton's decision to sign the welfare reform bill, but just 11
questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same
treatment, hearing 131 questions from the left compared to 17
from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46
questions from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a
table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.<p>

<li>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative
tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite some pretty vitriolic
speeches. In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans
with terms like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or
described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34 times. Democrats were
hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their
convention, but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more
with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992, the networks
questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but
never once raised the subject against Democrats at their
convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of the
contrast.<p>

<li>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely
acknowledged. The Clintons are under active investigation by an
independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references
to Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast
aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN, only one. Topics never
mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and
the special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as
Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy. Controversies about Republicans,
such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.
</ul>

<center>
<h3><a name="best">Best</a> and Worst, from page 2 of the 15 page report:</h3>
</center>

<b>Best Network: ABC News </b><br>
    Posed the fewest ideological questions at both conventions,
had the least disparity in blaming the parties for being too
negative and, given the amount of airtime, were the most willing
to identify Democrats as liberal.<p>

<B>Worst Network: CNN</B><br>
    Failed to take advantage of their added airtime to offer
viewers something beyond just more of what the other networks
showed. CNN had the greatest disparity in the agenda of
questions posed, with 23 from the left to just three from the
right.<p>

<B>Best reporters</B><br>
<ul>
<li><B>Sam Donaldson, ABC News:</B> In San Diego he refrained from
gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for being too intolerant.
In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson
offered a balanced appraisal of the party delegates, noting that
the Democratic delegates "are far to the left of the mainstream
just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In
the midst of hoopla over Bill Clinton's speech, only Donaldson
realized that while he gave a "great speech," the "record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."<p>

 <li><B>Lisa Myers, NBC News: </B>One of the few reporters to pose
questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has
generally opposed efforts to cut off benefits to illegal
immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why
would hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here
illegally?" Then she asked her about how people who saw her
speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the
degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do
you think you went too far?" On the first night in Chicago,
Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats
control the party.<p> 

 <li><B>Brian Ross, ABC News:</B> Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared
early in prime time with stories on corporate contributions and
union influence, ABC's Ross deserves recognition despite the
fact his pieces did not air in prime time. In a series of World
News Tonight stories, Ross went after the big money contributors
to both parties. Ross raised unique issues, such as "the giant
media corporations...very much in the middle of the mix." In San
Diego he noted that "the ABC hospitality suite was a lobbyist's
dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor: "His name is
Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a labor union the
FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become one
of the Democrats' top money people."<p>
</ul>

<B>Worst reporters:</B><br>
<ul>
 <li><B>Maria Shriver, NBC News:</B>  Seemed baffled why a rape victim
would have anything to do with the GOP and her interview with
Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more like
two old friends sharing tales of their suffering than a
dispassionate interview. Just after Jan Licence addressed
Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why
[speak] at a Republican convention? So many people have said
that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
Shriver's interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had
been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver posed questions
like, "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did
that applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people
have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" And,
noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered, "How did
that affect you when you heard about that?"<p>

<li><B>Judy Woodruff, CNN:</B> In San Diego she demanded that
Republicans explain why there weren't more female delegates, but
in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on the appeal of
their pro-partial birth abortion stand, she worried about
welfare reform going too far. Woodruff peppered Mrs. Clinton
with six welfare questions, all from the left. She pleaded with
her to stop it: "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned
her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her
disagreements with the President to herself in private, but
there were times that she felt it was important to disagree
publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, then what?"<p>

<li><B>Tom Brokaw, NBC News:</B> Found Republican speakers threatened
to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald Reagan,
and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised
the speaking power of Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the
GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived meanness
on the part of the country." In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's
speech which attacked conservatives, he admired how his words
grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least mention
Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald
Reagan in San Diego he took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have
to learn how history will judge his time in office -- the
deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told
rape victim Jan Licence: "This is a party that is dominated by
men," so, he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever
thought about what happens in America with rape?"

<LI>
Why did Rep. Jim McDermott go through all the trouble of intercepting Republicans' phone calls with a scanner, when he could have just looked up the transcripts in their FBI files?
<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Spectators shivered, the choir sang ``Amazing Grace'' and ``America,'' and William Jefferson Clinton was sworn in at the nation's 53rd presidential inaugural. In a speech which, for all its brevity, was heavy with boilerplate, Mr. Clinton did enounce his political position. ``Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. . . . We need a government humble enough not to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves.'' Possession-theories of his political success ignore his characteristic tropism toward a pragmatic-sounding centrism, a spot to the right of left. In practice, Clintonism may be as porous as a colander (what tools? what problems?). But the political counterarguments have to be made. If Clinton's enemies will not make them, they face a frustrating four years.


<P>
<hr>
<P>
<LI>When Congress passed the welfare bill last year, skeptics warned that Republican governors, chafing under the bill's work provisions and spending restraints, would become a major obstacle to its implementation. Sure enough, GOP governors led by George W. Bush (Tex.) are already agitating to reverse the bill's cutoff of Supplemental Security Income benefits for legal immigrants. Any backtracking on this provision would be a substantive and political disaster. There are now more aged non-citizens than citizens on SSI; the number of non-citizens on SSI has exploded from 370,000 in 1989 to more than 800,000 today as immigrants have taken advantage of this welfare spigot. Republicans were right to shut it off. Moreover, any fiddling with the SSI provision will go through the Senate Finance Committee, where Republicans have nominal control only (liberal Sens. Jim Jeffords and John Chafee account for the GOP's two-vote margin on the committee), which means that any changes on SSI will be accompanied by other ``fixes,'' such as expansions of Medicaid coverage and new mandates on the states. Congressional Republicans should send a clear message to their brethren in the governors' mansions: Hands off welfare reform.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>The new welfare bill limits the amount of food stamps that able-bodied, childless adults under age fifty who work less than twenty hours a week may receive. New York Gov. George Pataki has not sought a waiver to stop these cuts in his state, prompting this dispatch from the <I>New York Times</I>: ``Advocates for the poor and religious leaders . . . are particularly disturbed, they say, because food stamps, unlike other welfare programs, are paid for solely by the Federal Government.'' Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, asks, ``Isn't the job of a governor to make sure he maximizes federal revenues?'' Isn't that in one of the <I>Federalist Papers</I>?


<P>
<hr>
<P>
<LI>Proponents of tax reform have from time to time questioned the political wisdom of trying to reform the tax code with one bill. A proposal by Alan Reynolds and Stephen Moore transforms the politics of tax reform by applying the free-market principles of choice and competition. They would leave the current tax code alone, but allow anyone to opt out by paying an ``alternative maximum tax,'' or MaxTax, of 25 per cent (with only one break, a credit for payroll taxes paid). It would be impossible to claim that this flat tax would raise <I>anybody's</I> taxes, and it would lower tax rates for millions of Americans. In addition, the difficult transition problems that have concerned technical analysts of tax reform would melt away. (Deductions would not have to be phased out; they would simply become optional.) Reynolds and Moore have managed to marry policy wonkery, political savvy, and conceptual elegance.
<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>To clear his name (and do some good) after the Christine Keeler sex scandal, disgraced British war minister John Profumo worked for three decades with underprivileged boys in London's East End. Spiro Agnew waited 21 years before his bust was installed in the Capitol alongside those of the other former Vice Presidents. To restore his own reputation as a brilliant political advisor, fetishist and adulterer Dick Morris required six days, and he now dominates the Sunday-morning talk shows, where he promotes his 359-page memoir. If present trends continue, public officials caught in ethical scandals will some day need no rehabilitation time at all. For instance, a President convincingly accused of sexual harassment might skip directly over the damaging allegations and proceed with the duties of his office as if nothing had happened.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Five months after becoming two of the first four women to enter the Citadel, Misses Messer and Mentavlos are leaving. They were forced to sing obscene songs and drink iced tea until they vomited; their sweatshirts were doused with nail-polish remover and ignited. But this is just this kind of behavior that has made the Citadel famous. As appalling as it may seem, setting freshmen on fire is apparently a tradition in Echo company, of which the girls were members. In her farewell statement, Miss Mentavlos asked her male classmates to ``take a long look at how they view their girlfriends, wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters.'' However, by attending the Citadel, Miss Mentavlos endeavored to remove herself from those categories, and from the respect accorded to them. It seems that her fellow students indulged her.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


<LI>In his syndicated <I>Washington Post</I> column, Mark Shields teases <I>NR</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page for having made ``bum predictions'' about the bad effects of President Clinton's 1993 tax increases. Shields's rebuttal consists of listing positive economic trends that followed the tax increase, which he assumes must therefore have been caused by it. Those trends could use some perspective. The President's vaunted ``11 million jobs'' amounts to 1.9 per cent growth each year -- roughly the average rate for the last 25 years, <I>including recessions</I>. It's a far cry from the 2.4 per cent annual job growth registered during the low-tax years of 1983 - 89. Interest rates were falling globally before Clinton's tax; they reversed course soon after it passed, and resumed falling only around the time the Republicans took Congress. The deficit is down mostly because of that fall in interest rates, plus reckless defense cuts and the winding down of the S&L bailout. Tax revenues have increased because of the economic upswing that was well under way when Clinton was elected, but compared to the pre - tax-hike years, revenues are a smaller proportion of an economy that is growing more slowly. And Shields is counting his chickens too soon: the final installment of Clinton's tax hike came in April 1996. Already there are signs that the economy is running out both of workers and of savings. (If the Administration responds by trying to talk the dollar down, get ready for a hard landing.) Shields concluded his column: ``It doesn't hurt to admit publicly you have been wrong.'' Tell it to the President.

<LI>In the ongoing battle over Wisconsin's schoolchildren, a state judge, Paul Higginbotham, has again blocked the use of state funds for a voucher program that includes religious schools. His ruling acknowledged the ``sad plight of Milwaukee's public-school system'' (``sad'' is a mild word for a system in which only one-third of the students entering high school -- and only one-quarter of the black students -- graduate). But Judge Higginbotham found, predictably, that using tax dollars for anything connected however remotely with religion was unconstitutional -- ignoring the facts that a) nowadays, the religious content in most parochial schools is distinctly secondary; and b) the public schools themselves inculcate a religion, though not one having anything to do with the God of anyone's fathers. Judge Higginbotham's word is not the last one: the Milwaukee-based Parents for School Choice will take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary; meanwhile PAVE (Partners Advancing Values in Education) will continue to provide private vouchers to as many children as it can.

<LI>An ``Inaugural Gala'' on January 22 featured Vice President Al Gore as the keynote speaker and Tipper Gore as presenter of a Lifetime Achievement Award to Robin Chandler Duke of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Pretty brinky to use ``lifetime'' in an award to a person whose ``achievement'' was campaigning to shorten millions of lifetimes to nine months, or less.

<LI>``I am of Ireland, and the Holy Land of Ireland . . .'' Whether one thinks of Ireland as a holy land or, with some of her angrier sons, as a ``priest-ridden nation,'' one tends to think of her as a Catholic country still. John O'Sullivan's report in these pages a few years ago that Dublin was now scarcely distinguishable from any other European capital came as a shock. But not long afterward voters approved a constitutional change permitting divorce, and the first divorce has now been granted. Banning divorce doesn't necessarily keep marriages intact, as witness the tens of thousands of long-separated couples who signed up to obtain divorces as soon as the referendum passed. But one hopes that in moving into this new era, Ireland will cast an eye (not cold) on the wreckage that America's current no-fault laws have caused, and go slow.

<P><LI>Mexico pays its debt to the U.S., ahead of schedule; we make a cool $500 million in interest; investor confidence is restored. Is it too good to be true? In a word, si. As anyone who has spent time there recently can attest, Mexico is more chaotic than ever. Drug trafficking, violence, and official corruption have never been worse, and despite the rah-rah boosterism that permeates Wall Street generally -- and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> in particular -- Mexico hasn't begun the privatization and deregulation needed to get its economy moving again. Virtually all the money used to pay the U.S. was borrowed from other lenders at exorbitant interest rates. Our bailout of Mexico two years ago meant, in effect, that we guaranteed the loans Mexico used to pay us off. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso is again overvalued, and the current-account deficit is growing. It may soon be time for another successful rescue.

<LI>Until recently, no one would have bet that Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his Liberal Party would not be easily returned to office in the election expected this year. But this month, Chr&eacutetien's government was forced to make a public apology to Progressive Conservative former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. In a letter to Swiss government authorities, the Chr&eacutetien government had charged Mulroney and two others with accepting $3.75 million in kickbacks from the sale of Airbus passenger planes to the Canadian national airline in 1988. The accusation was then leaked to the media by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While Mulroney is widely said to have presided over the most corrupt government in recent Canadian history, the Liberals have been unable to provide evidence linking him to the Airbus scandal, and they now stand accused of using state power against a political opponent. The right-wing populist Reform Party, which stresses government integrity, is well positioned to benefit and expand its support beyond its western base. With unemployment remaining stubbornly at 10 per cent (despite Chr&eacutetien's promise of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''), defeated Liberals may soon swell the figures.

<P><LI>After so much bad news from the academy, it is a pleasure to hear something very different. At Dartmouth there is traditionally a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in the middle of the campus. The Glee Club turns out to sing carols, and many students join them. This December, the administration decreed that no songs with any religious content would be sung. The Glee Club was obliged to make do with ``Frosty the Snowman'' and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' The next night, however, the Glee Club appeared at the tree unofficially and, joined by hundreds of students, sang ``Silent Night,'' ``Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,'' and ``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.'' This was not the sort of Free Speech that Mario Savio had in mind, no, not at all.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> Louisiana Independent Federation of Electors, Inc. (LIFE) is arguably the most powerful political force in New Orleans. Operated by the city's mayor, the cocksure 39-year-old Marc Morial, and his political associates, it exerted a decisive influence in November's elections, putting a small army of workers on the street on election day. It is to monitor the activities of just such big-stakes political players that Louisiana and the Federal Government have campaign-finance laws. And it is exactly to escape such scrutiny that LIFE flouts all of them, failing to register or file reports with the Louisiana Board of Ethics, the Louisiana Secretary of State's office, or the Federal Election Commission.
<P>
LIFE is an outlaw political group at least in this sense -- and perhaps in others as well. After months of combing through New Orleans election records and interviewing city residents, Republican Woody Jenkins's campaign has compiled a stunning array of evidence to suggest that Democrat Mary Landrieu's slim 5,788-vote victory over him in November's Senate race was tainted by widespread corruption, including the outright buying of votes. 
<P>
At the center of the alleged misconduct in Louisiana are LIFE and the well-heeled gambling interests that helped deliver New Orleans for Mary Landrieu by more than 100,000 votes. The Jenkins campaign conducted a dozen interviews with New Orleans residents -- all of them living in the inner city -- who say they were promised cash for voting. With the understanding that the names of the interviewees would be withheld, the Jenkins campaign allowed <I>NR</I> to review the tapes. The number of illegal votes accounted for in the interviews isn't more than fifty or so. But the illegal practices recounted seem to implicate Mayor Morial's political organization in blatant wrongdoing, and to suggest a larger pattern of illegality that puts the integrity of Miss Landrieu's victory in serious doubt.
<P>
 <LI> One New Orleans woman explained to a Jenkins investigator that she ``was sitting on my porch when this nice person drove up in a . . . car and asked me whether or not I was registered voter or not. And I told him I was but I didn't feel like going. And he said, 'Well, if I paid you would you go then?' And quite naturally, a ride and the money, I got up and dusted off my little pants and got in the car.'' The woman, who couldn't read, says the man, working off a yellow (LIFE-produced) sample ballot, marked how she was to vote and then took her to three different locations where she voted and signed her name ``X'' each time.
<P>
<LI> A New Orleans man told a Jenkins investigator that he went to three different polling places and voted at each four or five times. He says he was paid $60 for each stop, was carried in a van with several other people, and was handed a yellow sample ballot that fits the description of the LIFE sample ballot (differently colored sample ballots, distributed in massive quantities on election day, are the hallmarks of the various New Orleans political organizations). The man says he didn't have to sign in or stand in line at the various polling places.
<P>
<LI> ``Well, my friend had asked me did I want to go vote,'' another New Orleans woman told a Jenkins investigator. ``She said they was paying people to go vote for this person. I say who was the person? She say Mary, Mary Landrieu.'' The woman got in a van that had three bench seats behind the driver and was driven to three polling places and given a LIFE sample ballot off which to vote. She was promised $25 for each stop. ``Hey, hey all I got was $25!'' she complains in the interview. ``We went to three places. The agreement was we was supposed to get $25 each place.'' As consolation, she was given a Mary Landrieu T-shirt: ``They promise you, and then they going give us ol' stanky T-shirt with her picture on it.'' (She threw the T-shirt away in a dumpster.)
<P>
All the interviews follow a similar pattern: An election worker promises someone money to vote; he transports him to the polls in a car or van full of people; he gives them a LIFE ballot to show them for whom and for what to vote; the voter either signs his name at multiple polling places or doesn't sign at all or, in one case, signs someone else's name. Some of the interviews suggest a fairly well-organized effort. One woman says that she was taken in a van to a polling place where she voted twice, once in her own name, the second time in a name given to her by the driver. She says the driver selected who would vote at which polling places.
<P>
The interviews also suggest that polling commissioners -- often long-serving local residents who are cozy with the neighborhood's political operators -- were active participants in the illegalities, allowing selected voters to jump lines at polling places and to vote without signing their names or being checked for identification. One man who says he stood in line for an hour and a half at one polling place complained to a Jenkins investigator that twice he saw four vans pull up full of people who were allowed to jump the line and vote immediately: ``They wasn't signing the book or nothin'. Just goin' in and comin' back out.''
<P>
It's not an accident that multiple voters would end up with LIFE sample ballots in their hands. An integral part of Mayor Morial's patronage-fed political machine, LIFE had an enormous presence on the streets of New Orleans on election day. Among the roughly one thousand LIFE street workers were more than a hundred unclassified city employees -- i.e., political appointees --  assigned to its headquarters for the day (another hundred were assigned to other Democratic campaigns throughout the city). In theory, such work is voluntary. In practice, city workers seem compelled to do the mayor's political bidding. 
<P>
According to a sworn affidavit by Victor M. Ortiz, a former assistant city attorney, his immediate supervisor, City Attorney Avis Marie Russell, convened a meeting on Monday, October 28, at which she said ``that it was mandatory . . . that all unclassified employees report for campaign activities for Nov. 2 and Nov. 5 or that there would be 'consequences.''' Mr. Ortiz maintains that on election day Miss Russell told him to report for campaign work or resign. She disputes his account. But in a letter responding to his resignation, she writes, ``At no time during my tenure as City Attorney have you indicated <I>any</I> problem with participating in campaign activities'' (emphasis in original).
<P>
All along, the Jenkins campaign has maintained that it was the intersection of interests between the LIFE machine and gambling companies that created the conditions for election-day corruption on a massive scale. There were local-option initiatives on the ballot in New Orleans asking for voter approval of video poker, riverboat gambling, and a New Orleans land-based casino. Altogether, gambling interests spent an estimated $8 to $10 million statewide. The New Orleans - based Harrah's Jazz, the currently bankrupt licensee for the land-based casino, was authorized by a federal judge to spend some $1 million. Mayor Morial opposed the New Orleans casino when he was a state senator, but conveniently switched convictions last year, putting LIFE on the side of the flood of gambling money.
<P>
It made for a perfect confluence of interests: LIFE with its deep roots in the community, the gambling interests with their deep pockets. While the gambling interests had no particular stake in electing Mary Landrieu, they would have wanted to help their crucial new friend, Marc Morial, for whom electing Miss Landrieu was a key political goal. Harrah's, according to a campaign-finance filing immediately after the election, hired about a thousand street workers on November 4 and 5. This effort was in some ways indistinguishable from LIFE's. In interviews with Jenkins investigators, 13 out of 20 randomly selected Harrah's election-day workers admitted to either handing out LIFE literature or picking up their Harrah's paychecks at LIFE offices. (Harrah's says it distributed all checks to workers directly.)
<P>
Evidence implicates both LIFE and the gambling interests in vote hauling. In Louisiana it is illegal for a political organization to pay its workers (although they can volunteer) to drive voters to the polls because the practice has traditionally been associated with vote buying. Not only were LIFE ballots apparently handed out in the vans transporting multiple voters, but the Jenkins campaign has obtained a handful of rental agreements between LIFE workers and a rental company just outside New Orleans for vans. Also, in a transcript of a taped conversation between what the Jenkins campaign identifies as a ``confidential source'' and a man named ``Ted,'' who appears to work for a gambling company, the two discuss driving people to the polls in company vans.
<P>
The question now is what the Senate is going to do about all this. Based on the evidence produced so far there should, by rights, be a national firestorm of outrage at practices in Louisiana (remember the uproar when Christine Todd Whitman consultant Ed Rollins just let the words ``walking-around money'' cross his lips?). The chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee is now considering Jenkins's evidence, and will decide probably in February whether to launch its own investigation. Mary Landrieu has taken the air out of some of the weaker aspects of Jenkins's case (for instance, ``mismatches'' between signatures on voter-registration cards and precinct registers), but her response to the alleged multiple voters is essentially ``It couldn't happen here.'' If a Senate investigation confirms and expands on the evidence gathered by Jenkins, people should go to jail and a new Senate election be called.
<P>
Any suggestion of a new election, of course, will provoke howls of protest from Democrats. Mary Landrieu's defenders will maintain that she has not been directly implicated in the fraud and that no one has produced evidence of exactly 5,789 illegal votes, both of which will probably prove to be true. But when a six-year term in the U.S. Senate is at stake, the integrity of the result should be beyond a reasonable doubt. Allowing elections to stand that have been tainted by Third World electoral practices undermines the foundations of American democracy. As one soulful multiple voter told a Jenkins investigator, ``The way things is going. I mean . . . it makes you not want to get out there and participate.'' Tell it to Woody Jenkins.
