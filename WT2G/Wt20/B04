<H2>Loumic Resources (VSE:LOO) - 500% Gain Possible </H2>
<P>
Could Loumic Resources appreciate in value like Mountain Province did... ?
<P>
With a 300% increase in price since the end of January 1996,  Loumic Resources looks posed to advance again.  Hitting a high of $.60 cdn and falling back to $ .50 cdn per share during the week March 18th to 21st , investors saw the stock gain $ .05 per share to close at $ .55 cdn per share on 168,000 shares of volume on Friday March 22, 1996.  Trading was strong on Monday morning with Loumic moving up to $ .60 cdn per share again  in the first several hours of market trading to end the day at $ .59 up $ .04 cdn per share on a volume 220,000 shares.  
<P>
Upon the closing of the markets Friday the company announced, that the it has entered into an
agreement with a  Coquitlam, B.C., based company to acquire an undivided 70% interest in additional offshore mineral  concessions  comprising  approximately  300  square kilometres in Sierra Leone. These concessions are beside the mineral concessions in which the company is reacquiring an interest from Orion  Resources as reported in company news releases of February 16 and 21 1996.   
<P>
What makes this small resource company on the Vancouver Stock Exchange so exciting to watch is that the mineral concessions that it has obtained in Sierra Leone are the only offshore properties available in the region and that the concessions are located beside concessions held by De Beers, the worlds largest diamond producing and marketing conglomerate.
<P>
In approximately (3) to (4) weeks Loumic Resources will release results from current dredge sampling  operations on its recent acquired offshore concessions.  The sampling operations are being undertaken by the Malaysia Mining Corporation.  Note extensive sampling of these concessions reveal a large diamond count  positive enough that the Malaysia Mining Corporation to continue exploration. 
<P>
Previous bulk samplings have shown the distribution of small and larger stones  indicates good  potential  to  locate  significant diamond reserves on the offshore leases.  Exploration and bulk sampling on  adjacent  offshore  leases  to  the northwest being  tested  by  a  subsidiary  of  DeBeers,  is reportedly spending 
$13 million on a bulk sampling program, a clear indication that they might have found something of value.
<P>
Early indications of the current bulk sampling program are that the results will be excellent   However the results could be released in a conservative form to prevent small locally owned prospecting ships in the area from dredging illegally on the concessions.  
<P>
Continue to watch for news releases on this stock.  Volumes and trading activities of the past several days indicate that this junior could be a clear winner.  If it performs as other such diamond plays on the Vancouver and Alberta stock exchanges have, (ie: Mountain Province Mining ) then the possible appreciation if further
diamond counts are good is tremendous. Investors can call the company investor relations at (604) 688-2012 
for complete details.

<H2> Apex Resorts Corporation Could Begin to Rise </H2>
<P>
<P>
As per the February 28, 1996 company news release, Apex Resort is having a very successful 
ski season.  A record number of ski visits have been recorded, very little native road blockades 
and excellent ski conditions could give Apex its best ski season ever.  Skiing should last well into
the spring.  The most important point to note from the recent company news releases is that 
Mr. Mel Reeves was appointed President of Apex Resorts Corporation.  
<P>
Mr. Reeves is very respected in the Vancouver business community, very business astute and 
has dealt with the provincial government in past business dealings.  Upon Mr. Reeves arrival to 
Apex Resorts his first task was to attempt to bring the corporations debt situation under control, 
and resolve it in the Company's favor. (Specifically the corporations $ 8 million owed to the 
Bank/Provincial Government - required when the native road blockades started several years ago.)
<P>
Resolving of this $ 8 million outstanding with the government is believe to be close.  A deal that 
will turn this  $ 8 million into a non - trading preferred type share with dividends payable most
likely many years out.  Upon this happening the company would be debt free, people close to the 
company say this could easily add  $.30 to $ .60 cents to the current price of the company stock.  When 
this rise occurs it will probably happen in two or three stages.   Following closely to the approval stages of this type of conversion/government deal passing through the governments appropriate approval bodies.  Looking at current trading activities and several recent company news releases and company activities one can
conclude that a deal of this nature is near completion.  Upon this announcement the stock will probably rise quickly.
<P>
Further great potential news is that the company is also entertaining joint venture proposals with 
respect to the further development of the resort's substantial real estate holdings on the mountain, 
currently dramatically discounted due to the current road access situation.  
<P>
Upon  the company debt being  eliminated, and the company proceeding with its current business 
objectives for the Apex Ski Resort, Apex Resorts Corporation becomes a company with a strong
potential of being a takeover candidate.  Possibly another reason why one might look at Apex Resorts
Corporation as an investment opportunity.
<P>
Recent movement of the company stock from $ .014 to $ .024 cents indicates many
investors feel that this company is finally in for some long awaited good news.  Note
the current trading in the company stock suggests investors are accumulating stock 
at the $ .20 to .24 cent level.  Important benefit to note of the Apex stock is that it is very 
liquid, meaning one can purchase or sell the stock whenever one desires.  No appointment necessary.
<P>

<H2>International Panorama Resources Corp.</H2>
<P>
<B>Leading the development of  "The Golden Land"</B>
<P>
<P>
International Panorama Resources Corp. (VSE:ILP), is one of the few mining companies selected by the 
government of Myanmar (formerly Burma) to develop the country's rich mineral resources.  Following in the
footsteps of renowned mining entrepreneur, Robert Friedland, International Panorama successfully launched
operations in Myanmar after the introduction of political and economic reforms.
<P>
International Panorama is developing a gold deposit with the potential for an open-pit, bulk mining 
operation at Thayetkone, in Central Myanmar .  Identified by the company as being at least 1.5 km by 1.5 km, the deposit is located adjacent to the 50 tons/day pilot gold recovery plant at Thayetkone.  Veins up to 1 km
long and 1.5 km wide, carry gold grades to 1 ounce/ton.  The deposit has ready access to water, hydropower
and rail transportation.  The 1,400 sq km property is situated on the Shan Fault, a major 2000 km long fault
zone which is closely associated with gold mineralization over a 1,200 km strike length in Myanmar.
<P>
Significant changes have taken place in the global mining scene over the past few years.  Currently at the forefront of change is Myanmar.  The government's stated economic objectives include the establishment of a
sound market-oriented economic system, with reduced state involvement and increased foreign investment.
<P>
It is likely that Myanmar will be admitted as a full member of ASEAN over the next few years.  Foreign investment in Myanmar is accelerating, with over US $3 billion in investment projects approved to October 31.  
Thailand, Singapore and the United Kingdom are the leading contributors.  Japan may resume official lending
to Myanmar soon, while very substantial Japanese private-sector investment is already in the pipeline.
<P>
With approximately 4.5 million shares issued and a strong management group in place, International
Panorama Resources vast land position in Myanmar has positioned the company as a major participant in the
development of Myanmar's mineral wealth.  Continuing success in Myanmar will have a significant impact on the price of International Panorama's share price.

<p>
<center><font size=6><b>EMERGING GROWTH
STOCKS</b></font><br>
<font size=3><i>Covering the V.S.E. , Junior Gold Stocks, and
Special Situations - Volume V, No. 2</i></font></center>
<hr>
<center><h3>MARKET COMMENTARY<br>
-Voisey Bay Fever Strikes V.S.E.-</h3></center>
The market soared in the second half of April, fuelled by Voisey
Bay and diamond fever, as investors scrambled to jump aboard these
two area plays (Diamond Fields and Mountain Province's respective
mineral discoveries).  Trading expanded through month end,
finishing on a high note, with a 24 point (3%) rally on the highest
volume recorded so far this year, and taking the composite index
back up through 800, up 17% from the lows recorded in March.<p>
Throughout May and June, the market consolidated these gains, and
digested the many news reports and analysis in the media on these
two emerging area plays.  Apart from all the background noise, we
view April's strength as further confirmation that, at least on a
technical basis, the V.S.E. market index is the healthiest it's
looked in well over a year, and appears to be setting the stage for
the next bull run.  We view the current sideways activity as a
normal consolidation, and see at least four bullish signals in the
charts below.<ol>
<li>Recent index high is higher that    previous one (Dow
Theory).<p>
<li>Index trading well above it's short-term (10 week) Moving
Average.<p>
<li>Index recently challenging its long term (40 week) Moving
Average.<p>
<li>R.S.I. (Rel. Strength Index) recently broke into a positive 
area from negative.</ol><p>
The same applies to the stocks in Calgary.  While this exchange
does not have the exposure to Voisey Bay that Vancouver does, it
seems that the entire oil and gas sector took a huge hit last year,
and also looks ready for a big move.<p>
A low priced example from this sector with positive cash flow and
excellent growth potential is enclosed in this issue (Wayburn Oil
and Natural Gas, WON.C, $0.34C).<p>

<center><h3>AREA PLAY SPECULATING<br>
-Voisey Bay-</h3></center>
No doubt, Diamond Fields has hit upon the most important North
American metal discovery in decades, and Discovery Hill (the
precise location of the huge and extremely rich nickel-copper-
cobalt deposit), Voisey Bay is destined to become one of the
world's great mining camps.  The discovery is still not well known
outside Canada and I believe the play has a lot of steam left to
it, which is why you probably want to be involved in some way.  The
question remains for potential investors, just how to approach
Voisey Bay at this stage, while reducing the potential risks
associated with investing (really speculating) in all area
plays.<p>

With regard for overall timing, this seems a good time to take a
limited position (limited due to the very high risk).  While the
initial staking rush in Labrador and buying spree on Howe Street
has subsided for now, my guess is the whole area will get very hot
again later this summer, as news on exploration results starts
coming out in earnest.  Many of the stocks that ran up in March and
April after announcing property acquisitions are now pulling back,
some by as much as 50% and are poised to move again.  Just
remember, those marginal players that don't hit pay dirt this
summer could fall right back to their 52 week lows this winter.<p>

As far as which stocks to buy, it is the nature of a wildcat play,
especially at its' early stages that it is impossible to tell who
will get lucky, so I really hesitate to recommend anything.  I'll
just mention a few I am watching - <b>NDT Ventures</b> (NDE.V -
$4.00) is the largest claim holder in the area and therefore a good
barometer of the play, <b>Freeport Resources</b> (FRI.V $1.40 to
$2.00) apparently has the serious interest of numerous seniors in
it's holdings, maybe a buy at $1.40, and my low priced issue is
<b>Fairhaven Resources</b> (FRH.V $0.30 to $0.40), previously a
dormant Pezim shell company, recently refinanced and in on a
property with another large Pezim company,<b>Prime Equity</b>
(PQE.V $2.36).  The Fairhaven issue has warrants to buy the stock
at $0.46, currently trading at around $0.07, good for almost a
year.  Results from an airborne survey should be released in the
near future.<p>

<h3>-Summary-</h3>
Wayburn is an exceptional, low-risk emerging producer I have been
following since it started trading in January, 1994.  The company
is debt free, has positive cash flow, and inspite of excellent
results in the oil patch, I have remained neutral on the stock for
technical and market reasons, until this time.  These conditions
have reversed, and now I am giving Wayburn my strongest buy
recommendation for it's outstanding value and growth prospects over
the next six to twelve months.<p>

<h3>-Development History-</h3>
Wayburn concentrates on low risk, high yield in-fill drill projects
that provide a high degree of success.  The company used it's
financing to fund a seven well drilling program which <b>garnered
five producers, all located in Southern Saskatchewan</b>.  Wayburn
has interests ranging from 25% to 10%, and is netting around 100
Bbl/d which translates into an average cash flow of $28,000 per
month.<p>
<center><table border>
<caption align=bottom><font size=1>(Taking $22.50 per Barrel, at
the wellhead, this translates<br>into $2137.50 per day gross cash
flow, netting Wayburn an average of $28,000 per

Now, Wayburn is actively evaluating larger acquisition prospect
that would bring in anywhere from $1 to $5 million (CND), and
provide a maximum 3 to 3.5 year payout from cash flow.  They have
retained the services of accomplished 30 year veteran Landman, Mr.
Larry Blonde to assist in locating and acquiring new projects, and
are considering more than 50 packages that are currently on the
market (Canadian and US).<p>
<h3>Goldston, Saskatchewan<br>
-Fall Drilling Planned-</h3>
On April 26, 1995, Wayburn's management successfully negotiated a
low risk drilling program in Goldston, Saskatchewan, Canada on a
1/3 before pay out and 1/4 after pay out basis.  The operator is a
well-known private company, Postell Energy.  The letter of intent
outlines a project which has the potential of becoming a multiple
well development project.  Drilling is scheduled to begin no later
than fall 1995.<p>

The program consists of 3 wells initially and has the capability of
a maximum of 12 wells, depending on results obtained.<p>

The plan is to begin with a low risk vertical infill well expected
to cost $300,000 (CDN) and which is projected to yield at least 60
- 75 BOPD initial production.<p>

<h3>-FINANCIALS-</h3>
Cash flow from current operations (which should expand sharply
before year end) amounts to about $340,000 per year, or about $0.08
per share.  Therefore, at the current price of $0.34 per share, the
stock trades for  about 4 times cash flow.  At this time, the
company is reserving over 60% of its cash flow for new production
acquisition, and carries no debt.<p>
<h3>-CAPITAL STRUCTURE-</h3>
The company went public with an IPO of 1,500,000 shares at $0.55 in
January, 1994, which raised $825,000 and was used for drilling and
exploration expenses.  Of the 4.3 million shares currently
outstanding, 2.2 million are held by directors and insiders, and
are escrowed until 1998.  There are no shares due to become
eligible for trading from previous financing, and there are
approximately 200,000 options outstanding, priced at $0.35 and
$0.32.<p>

<h3>-MANAGEMENT-</h3>
What impresses me most about Wayburn is Management's ability, and
determination to grow the company and add shareholder value just as
rapidly as possible, but without exposing shareholders to undue
risk, or causing heavy stock dilution.  For example, the president
works long hours but forgoes a regular cash salary, and elects
instead to get paid in stock.  Cash flow is reserved for expansion,
and the company sticks to low-risk drilling projects.  I guess this
should come as no surprise, as management has a large stake in the
company, and has every reason to want to see it, and the share
price grow.<p>

<h3>-TECHNICALS-</h3>
The stock had a rough aftermarket, no doubt in large part dragged
down by the rest of the oil and gas sector.  The stock had been in
a steady decline until it hit bottom at $0.20, first in January,
and then again in late February, forming a double bottom.<p>

In March it broke through the major trend line and moving averages,
and made a recent high of $0.38.  Support is forming at $0.30 and
the stock has now clearly reversed it's previous decline and turned
decidedly bullish.<p>
<h3>-RECOMMENDATION-</h3>
With cash flow where it is today, the stock is cheap at $0.40 or
less by industry standards, and should probably fetch more, $0.50
to $0.60.  I expect however, we will see substantial increases in
cash flow in the coming months and year for Wayburn - 70% to 100%
by year end, and between 3 and 5 times current levels or more in
the next 12 months.  Given a conservative price to cash flow ratio
of 5- I have targets of $0.70 by year end (higher on speculation)
and $2.00 to $4.00 longer term.<p>

<center><h3>MARKET COMMENTARY<br>
-VSE Index Recovering From Voisey Bay Sell-Off, Separation Jitters 
-</h3></center>

While the major markets continue setting all time record highs, 
the V.S.E. composite index is only now just beginning to recover from a 
decline that started in August, when several high profile newsletter 
writers were urging investors to take profits in the higher
priced Voisey Bay area play stocks.  Selling resumed during the 
referendum on separation in Quebec in late October.  And now we are 
seeing a third wave of selling, the traditional year-end tax-loss 
selling season, combined with a general lull in exploration and 
promotional activity by V.S.E. listed companies.<p>

We haven't made a single buy recommendation since the beginning of 
this decline, because I could see it would last.  However, this 
series of corrections has taken a great deal of price speculation out 
of the market.  For example, <b>Prime Equities (PQE.V)</b>, a large 
claimholder in Voisey Bay which ran up to $6.00 shortly after we 
mentioned it at $2.36 in July is now back down to $1.30 or so.  
Another Murray Pezim company, <b>Goldnev Res. (GNZ.V)</b> has fallen to a 
multi-year low of $0.38 from a high of $2.94 in June!  We have no 
idea exactly when, but you can bet these two will be trading at much 
higher prices, sometime in 1996 (whenever Pezim decides it's time to 
run them again).<p>

Now, we feel the index has thoroughly corrected from the sharp rise we 
saw in the first half of 1995, and has formed a solid base from which it 
will rally from, very likely early in the new year. <b>Accordingly, we are 
enclosing our top three buy recommendations for year end bargain hunters 
on page 2.</b> Read why our favourite nickel-copper prospect is a property 
which is actually a few hundred kms outside Voisey Bay.  Also learn why 
<b>Montello Res. (MEO.C)</b> tripled to $0.65 after we mentioned it at 
$0.22 in 
our July sneak preview section, and why we expect to see a similar move 
like this in the very near future.<p>

IB's main asset is a hot nickel-copper property located in the Ungava 
region of Quebec, approximately half way between Voisey Bay and the 
Falconbridge Raglan Deposit.  Base metal values exceeding 20% have shown 
up in trenching, and the property is being drilled right now.  I 
understand that at least one extremely influential newsletter writer has 
recently taken a very substantial position in the company, and that a 
Swiss group will be doing the same in the new year.  Do they know 
something we don't - could this be the next big discovery after Voisey 
Bay?  Be careful buying this one as it had already started to move, 
however I do see IB trading well above $1.00 sometime early in the new 
year.  You can contact the company at 681-4421 in Vancouver, or 
1-800-889-2280 for further information.</td>

Montello is a great stock to trade.  It's main asset is a lamphorite 
diamond pipe prospect near Hinton, Alberta.  In October, the stock ran up 
to $0.65 on the news of a $4 million joint venture deal with Kennecott. 
The price fell off immediately afterwards, in part due to market 
conditions, but also due to a decision by the company to delay a drilling 
program until February (the market was expecting drilling immediately). 
Chuck Fipke, the founder of DIAMET, who made the first diamond discovery 
in Canada is convinced the property contains a lamphorite pipe (this 
would be the first of it's kind in Canada).  This is a "no-brainer" trade 
- buy right now in the $0.25 range, sell half on the drilling hype in 
February, and hold the rest in case drilling is successful - you could 
see a move to $1.50 - $2.00 if that occurs.  Contact the company at 
1-604-689-7199 for further information.</td>

<td>
One tactic I have been using successfully is to try and time my purchases 
just prior to a substantial financing by the company.  This is a prime 
candidate.  PFG has what are believed to be two "company making" gold 
prospects in Argentina.  The company wasted an entire year (1994) waiting 
for an Arabian group to finance them.  That fell through, however this 
year Barrick Resources has signed a potential $14 million letter of 
intent with them, and is deciding whether or not to proceed.  The company 
is also discussing financing at this time with various brokerage houses.  
This time lag however has done damage to shareholder confidence, causing 
the stock to fall to a 52 week low.  With financing possibly just around 
the corner, this could be an excellent time to pick-up a few shares.  You 
can reach the company at 1-604-689-1976 for more information.</td>

<h3>IPC - INT. PROFIT CONCEPTS</h3>

For those of you who are interested in commodities and global 
investments, I encourage you to check out this company.  It's operated by 
Mr. Ron Weibe, a seasoned options trader who has high level contacts 
throughout the globe, and the backing of R.K. Financial, a venture 
capital firm.  Right now, Ron is offering a guaranteed 18% on the 
smallest of investments, and is currently investigating opportunities 
arising from the Japanese banking crisis.  To learn more about these and 
other opportunities, contact Ron at 1-800-294-6850 Ext. D119, to receive 
an information package and subscribe to his newsletter.


<h3>INTERNET STOCKS</h3>

As you are probably well aware by now, Internet stocks are all the rage 
and are likely to stay that way for some time.  I figured something was 
up when my good friend, Robert Spiers (author of Small-Cap Stock Analyst) 
was calling me from the other side of the country to get me to look at 
some new NASDAQ IPO that was about to come out called Netscape.  Of 
course, now we need to be careful considering the astronomical P.E. 
ratios these stocks are commanding.  Still though, internet has enormous 
future growth potential and EGS is going to start researching the ones 
that are not already trading over $100.00!  One is I.D. Internet Direct 
(IDX.V), $2.25 previously Arling Resources (name changed December 6).  
Another is a new listing in Calgary, Cybersurf Corp.  (CY.C), $0.80.  It 
traded as high as $1.40 when it opened on December 8, but has fallen back 
below $1.00 since then.  More on this play to come in future issues of 
EGS.<p>

<H2><CENTER>BEST BET SCORECARD..... </CENTER></H2>
<BR>
Best Bets for the 4th Quarter were announced on October 18th. Initially,
SEVEN (7) &quot;Best Bet&quot; companies were selected. A new one was added
on November 11th. One was removed on November 17th. Another was removed
this week. There is important commentary following this scorecard.<BR>
<P>
<PRE>COMPANY			TICKER / EXCH.		OCT 18		NOV 22 		% CHG.

Primo Resources*  	PRI / Vancouver		0.61		0.87		+ 44%

Fairmile Gold		FLA / Alberta		3.10		2.22		- 28%

Strathmore Resources	SMR / Vancouver		0.83		1.85		+ 96%

Sino-Forest		TRE.A / Toronto		1.51		1.35		-  11%

Asquith			ASQH / Toronto OTC	2.40		2.80		+ 02%

Enterprise Development	ED / Alberta		0.50		0.80		+ 60%

Anvil Resources**		ANV / Alberta		0.60		0.82		+ 36%

Canada Payphone   	CPY / Vancouver		2.80		2.20		- 21%
    (Added on November 11th at C$2.80/share)	

Leigh Resources (VSE:LRC) is hereby included in the Best Bets 
scorecard, effective November 23rd, at future percentage changes 
will be calculated at the November 22nd closing price of 
C$2.35/share.
	</PRE>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>COMMENTARY.....</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
*Primo (VSE:PRI) replaced Vior Explorations on November 17th. For a BREAK-EVEN
on this replacement on the Scorecard, PRI must gain another C$0.22/share
between now and December 31st, to offset VIO's loss. Initially featured
as a Wild Card at C$0.61/share, PRI was upgraded to a Best Bet on November
18th.<BR>
<BR>
** Anvil (Alberta:ANV) replaced an OTC BB stock (non-reporting issuer),
of which I am discontinuing all Internet coverage, until the company becomes
a &quot;reporting issuer.&quot; For a proportionate BREAK-EVEN on this replacement
on the Scorecard, ANV must gain an additional C$0.23/share. If one carefully
analyzes ANV's stockchart, it should become abundantly clear that, historically,
ANV leaps above C$1/share during their drilling programs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER>DEVELOPMENTS.....</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
<BR>
Asquith Resources should be starting to drill in the very near future. Anvil
Resources has already started drilling their BC copper property. FLA announced
their drilling program should start soon -- this may be a minor drill program,
with a bigger one to follow after the New Year. Primo's joint venture partner,
Golden Peaks, should soon announce a drill program -- more trenching assays
are expected. Enterprise Development may soon start drilling one of their
Tunisian oil concessions. Canada Payphones may have significant news for
us in mid-December.<BR>
<BR>
One should keep their eyes open on the other Wild Card Stocks I selected.
Companies such as Leigh Resource (VSE:LRC) and Miranda (VSE:MAD) may soon
be &quot;stocks to watch.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>--OLDIES, BUT GOODIES......</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
I was pleased that several previously featured companies in Hot Stocks Review
continued advancing in share price this past week and set record highs.
Shareholders should pat themselves on the back for the superb gains they
have realized in these stocks.<BR>
<BR>
Vantage Enterprises (VSE:VEC), initially featured at C$2.50/share this past
summer, closed at a record high of C$7.40/share -- up 196%. Dil Gujral has
repeated his CLP success with VEC as he personally guaranteed me he would.
Mr. Gujral has always kept his word to me. I consider him to be miles above
most of the Howe Street players. (See Hot Stocks FLASH, September 12th 1996
or find the story on your Bloomberg terminal, published 16 September 1996).<BR>
<BR>
Morgain Minerals (VSE:MGM), which I brought to your attention nearly a year
ago at C$1.05/share, closed at a record high of C$2.65/share -- up 152%.
Last winter, an editor at The Venture Capital Update promised me that MGM
might repeat MPV's success. <BR>
<BR>
National Healthcare Manufacturing (VSE:NHM), which was initially featured
this past Spring at C$2.80/share, closed at a record high of C$6.75/share
-- up 141%. I met with Mac Shahsavar, NHM's CEO, several times. He repeatedly
insisted that NHM was not another &quot;VSE deal&quot; and that it was a
&quot;real deal.&quot; He was right and NHM currently trades on NASDAQ,
as well as the VSE. (See Hot Stocks FLASH, April 10 1996 or find the story
on your Bloomberg terminal, published 16 April 1996.)<BR>

I began telling you about Enterprise Development (Alberta:ED) over the
past year. I recently placed ED on my Top Ten &quot;Best Bets&quot; List
(Number #7). It has recently come to my attention that a very bullish analyst
report may soon be released, citing the engineer's report on the recently
acquired Tunisian oil properties. One source tells me that those oil properties
may add C$2/share to ED's share price. On Monday, ED was the second most
actively traded stock on the Alberta stock exchange, closing at C$0.60/share
(bid: 60/ask:62), with 467,222 shares trading hands. Contact Garry Kilbourn
at 403-237-6950 for additional information.<BR>

<P>
<H2><CENTER>INTERVIEW WITH <BR>
PRIOR RESOURCES' GEOLOGIST....</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
I spoke by telephone with Ron Tammekand, geologist for Prior Resources
(Alberta:PQL). The first words out of his mouth were, &quot;We got some
good results.&quot; Followed by, &quot;Better structure near the surface&quot;
and &quot;Have to do infill drilling.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that Tammekand was handed the task of drilling 18 itsy-bitsy
teeny shallow holes into fairly mysterious Mexican terrain about the size
of 20 football fields......yet he did come up with a five foot section in
Hole #7, which turned up better than 1/2 ounce of gold/ton and 1 ounce of
silver/ton. The rest was ahhh, a start, if one looks at these things with
any ray of hope. Yes, the Internet rumors on Silicon Investor are true,
but this time, the shoe is on the other foot, it is PQL that does NOT want
to talk to the majors right now.......... (that would just delay any imminent
infill drilling!)<BR>
<BR>
What Tammekand now needs to do is convince his bosses that they should
raise another few bucks to put some more money into the ground; C$500,000
is the figure he tossed out. PQL has around C$300,000 in the till (as I
have been led to believe), so they may soon commit to 10,000 feet of Reverse
Circulation (R/C) drilling. In other words, Tammekand would like to poke
about 100 holes in this property so he can properly size it up. He even
wants to re-drill all of the previously drilled holes with R/C drilling....
more trenching, more mapping, etc. He stressed to me, &quot;It's not a sure
thing, there is still a lot of risk to it.&quot; Interesting.....most PQL-watchers
would tend to believe that PQL was more of a &quot;sure risk&quot; than
a &quot;sure thing.&quot; Yet now, PQL's geologist is, in his own way, more
optimistic than before.<BR>
<BR>
Which, I guess, is why is he designing a drilling program to &quot;prove
up&quot; roughly 200,000 ounces of gold (his words, not mine). PQL still
has another 8 holes to release, yet now even Tammekand is talking about
infill drilling.... sooner rather than later. I now understand why Dalton
DuPasquier got excited a few weeks ago and publicly started discussing an
infill drilling program. Perhaps, I was right, in some earlier remarks,
that perhaps this time PQL may come up with the goods. Stranger things have
happened.<BR>
Suggestion: Badger their IR people at 800-972-6564 and find out when infill
drilling is to start....<BR>

<P>
Area plays in Indonesia and Voisey's Bay continue to appear like SELL situations.
While the DJIA and TSE 300 Index continue to set new highs, most lightweight
speculators continue to avoid the high-risk western Canadian stocks. The
senior markets continue to follow the &quot;October trend&quot; found in
the previous US presidential election, whereupon these markets rise until
election day (this year it's November 5th) and then quickly retreat during
November. <BR>
<BR>
That &quot;cautious optimism&quot; has not translated into the western Canadian
markets. Technically, the VSE index showed a sell on September 27th. It
appears that the VSE Index will sink below its July 24th low, before we
see any upturn in these markets, probably around January 10, 1997. The speculative
markets depend upon the unsophisticated low net-worth &quot;gambler&quot;
to fuel any appreciation and most gamblers are avoiding them. Last week's
FBI sting caused many to hesitate before plodding into the thinly traded,
highly manipulated OTC Bulletin Board marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
Fighting against such odds, one must become EXTREMELY selective in their
speculations over the next 90 days. More than likely, you will see a substantial
retreat in many of your speculations. Now is the time to phone each of the
CEOs of the companies in which you have invested and find out what their
plans are, throughout the latter part of October and November, with regards
to earnings projections or drilling plans. Should you find anyone hesitating
in their responses.........run for the exits.<BR>
<BR>
One example is High Grade Ventures (VSE:HGV), which has had a spectacular
runup since July, after hiring MarketMedia to provide a &quot;shareholder
enhancement program.&quot; Technically, HGV is overbought. Further, Patrick
Kephart, owner of HGV's PR firm, was previously employed by Atlantic Capital
Corporation, which was recently accused by the SEC for paying bribes to
various stockbrokers in three states in a stock-touting scheme. (Bribing
stockbrokers can be hazardous to a stock promoters' health.) The Atlantic
case involves even more bribe money than the recently announced FBI sting!<BR>
<BR>
Another example is Coral Gold (VSE:CLH), which has seen their share price
collapse from well above C$6/share to nearly C$3/share since their &quot;imminent&quot;
takeover by a major failed to immediately materialize in late July or early
August. Their news release of the &quot;Rothschild agreement&quot; seemed
to coincide with a desperate attempt to prevent their share price from sinking
further. Newsletter recommendations from Dines, Sarnoff and Wheeler to buy
CLH have miserably failed. It could be a long hard winter for CLH, before
they see the light of day.<BR>
<BR>
Yet another example is Gold Canyon (VSE:GCU), whose joint venture partner
(Santa Fe Gold) walked away from the Springpole project. Aside from the
PR spin on their recent news release, with the appointment of a new president,
one should carefully study GCU's news release and realize that GCU is liable
for the recently completed summer drill program and all on-going costs associated
with this project. Recommendations, again from Sarnoff and Wheeler, should
come to no positive result for GCU.<BR>
<BR>
The point I am making is this: Results, not promotion, will fuel a stock's
depreciation or demise. Study your companies with an even more jaundiced
eye over the next 3-4 months. (Please note that each of the above companies
paid HSR various amounts to be reviewed in previous editions of HSR -- see
HSR website for disclosure information.)<BR>
<P>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>BEST BETS....</CENTER></H2>
<P>
I have avoided issuing any sort of &quot;Best Bet&quot; selections over
the past seven months, for various reasons. At a time when the speculative
markets look exceptionally weak, I continue to emphasize looking for the
underlying value in each company. This vague term, underlying value, may
be defined the company's checkbook balance, their management team, their
geologist, their stock promoter(s) or the product or service offered by
the company. Best Bets are not the &quot;flavor of the month&quot; and do
not mean they will necessarily skyrocket for a quick flip. At a time when
I foresee a painful short-term future in the speculative markets, I like
the following speculations. Unless otherwise specified, one should understand
that each of the companies below have previously purchased a $9800 advertisement
in the print version of Hot Stocks Review, unless otherwise noted. Those
who have long followed HSR have come to realize that companies which offer
the most potential, receive the most coverage while others do not, irregardless
that each paid the same amount for the same advertisement. Risk factors
such as market collapse (bid off) or the collapse in gold (or another commodity)
are not taken into account in compiling this list.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #1</B>: Vior Exploration (Montreal:VIO). The area play in the
Sept-Iles region of northeastern Quebec, plus other factors, demonstrate
that VIO may attract wide global interest throughout the fourth quarter
and possibly beyond. VIO has never paid for advertising in HSR.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #2</B>: Fairmile Gold (Alberta:FLA). No surprise here. The
size of the Buffalo Valley project, the amount of FLA's successful shallow
drilling in that area and the possibility of the motherlode on their deep
drilling continue to make me a believer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #3</B>: Transformation Processing (OTC BB:TPII). If this company
does what they have been saying they are going to do, then TPII might make
the Wall Street Journal before the year is out.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #4</B>: Strathmore Resources (VSE:SMR). Uranium is going to
make news during 1997. SMR is strongly positioning itself to attract the
interest of a major, both in potential acquisitions of uranium reserves
and in building up their board &amp; management team.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #5</B>: Sino-Forest (TSE:TRE.A). Flippers can stay away from
this stock. Their recent financing confirms that they are back on track.
John Thompson's previous play, Pembridge (TSE:PEM), has nearly tripled since
I first featured PEM in HSR. Sometimes, slow but sure is better.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #6</B>: Asquith Resources (CDN:ASQH). Both the size of their
gold property and the grades they've been finding hint that perhaps the
next Bre-X Minerals could be in Africa. ASQH could be the biggest surprise
of 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #7</B>: Enterprise Development (Alberta:ED). A recent acquisition,
a new trading range and new coverage on this tiny oil exploration company
make me feel bullish on their prospects. Once their story is widely told,
ED should attract very strong interest. Large outstanding share position
bothers me.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Numbers #8, #9 and #10</B>: These slots remain blank as these three
companies could quickly move to the top of the list. They will be featured
in the upcoming NEW email service in November for all paid HSR subscribers.
Who knows? They may or may not be any one of those listed in the WILD CARD
section below.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>WILD CARDS</CENTER></H2>
<P>
I've been following these companies very closely for months and months.
Any one of these companies could move onto the &quot;Best Bet&quot; list,
but have various flaws, at this time, which keep them off that list. Abrupt
changes are expected in the high-risk spec arena and one never knows when
exactly a company WILL hit on a drill or land a major contract that could
bring them earnings. So, I created this list of companies which you should
begin closely following or inquiring about.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #1</B>: Miranda (VSE:MAD). There is a reason why the stock
has not retreated further since mid-August. Why is that? There is something
in the works.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #2</B>: Primo Resources (VSE:PRI). Drilling is around the corner.
Their Argentinean joint venture appears to be turning out better than initially
expected. I don't see how PRI has more than two dimes of risk at the current
level versus a potential triple in rewards.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #3</B>: Anvil Resources (Alberta:ANV). I interviewed ANV's
geologist, overseeing their Yalakom Mountain copper/gold project, and read
Paul Hawkins' report on this property. Watch and see why I included ANV
in this list. Historically, flippers have failed to lose on ANV when they
purchase the shares under C$0.70 and exit above C$1/share. Perhaps this
time, there may be an extra surprise.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #4</B>: Abitibi (VSE:ABB). When they drill in west Timmins,
I'll feel more comfortable about this company. Their joint venture in the
Cranbrook area, though, gives ABB longevity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #5</B>: First Choice (VSE:FSD). I like Peter Dasler and his
exploration plans on Knob Hill (Vancover Island). Drilling to start soon
<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #6</B>: Interactive Processing (OTC BB:IAPI). If IAPI survives
the winter, and turns the corner, then this tiny company could become a
success.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #7</B>: Nu-Dawn Resources (VSE:NDN). NDN could be six months
away from their &quot;dream come true.&quot; When, and if, this occurs,
NDN would move right to the top of the Best Bets list.<BR>
<BR>
<B>** Number #8</B>: Prior Resources (Alberta:PQL). Drilling on their Mexican
property could turn up the goods. That alone would probably cause one insider
to buy back all the stock he used to own. Assays forthcoming any day now
-- from what I've been told, PQL may soon announce infill drilling, which
is a very positive sign.<BR>

<H2>A Word About Guyana Gold Corp.</H2>
<P>
<I>
In a recent development, Guyana Gold (TSE Symbol: GUY) has concluded negotiations whereby the Zimbabwean government will assume its interest in the Sabi Gold Mine for $11,000,000, the proceeds of which the company is reinvesting in three highly prospective concessions in Brazil. GUY now trades at C$0.75 per share and, following the settlement, has C$0.45 per share in cash and significant blue sky potential from its new Brazilian properties.
<P>
It is our belief that, due to the caliber of Guyanas management and the quality of their Brazilian concessions, the Company has a very promising future.  However, the contract between London Taylor and Guyana Gold matures on October 3, 1996 and during Guyana&s restructuting period the affiliation between our two companies will be interrupted. Even so, this is a company that we will continue to watch closely, albeit on an informal basis and not in the pages of the LTG Client Company Update. For investors also interested in staying in touch with Guyana, contact the company direct at 1-604-687-3992. </I>

<P>
Adrian Resources owns a 52% interest in one of the worlds largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits: The Petaquilla Mineral District in Panama. The total geologic resource stands at 3.74 billion tons containing 31.8 billion pounds of copper, 9.8 million ounces of gold, and 962 million pounds of molybdenum. A scoping study conducted by Flour Daniel Wright has estimated the present value of the concession to be 
US$955 million at US$1.00lb copper.
<P>
<I>The company recently announced its commencement of a Normal Course Issuer Bid through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Adrian will purchase up to 500,000 shares of its stock which is approximately 1.64% of its outstanding share float.  This buy back is in addition to the 1,160,200 shares of ADLRF that the company bought in 1995.  The decision to buy back shares was prompted by managements belief that the current market price is well below fair value.</I>

<P>
Boron is scheduled to become a leading supplier of industrial minerals when it takes its Aguas Blancas concession in Northern Chile into production in 1998. This concession contains the worlds largest proven deposits of high grade iodine, and large quantities of sodium sulfate and sodium nitrate, the later being used in the manufacturing of upscale potassium fertilizers. Revenues in its first year of operation are estimated to be US$51 million. LatInvest Securities Limited, a specialist investment bank, is serving as financial advisors with the goal of raising US$60 million to construct Borons iodine, sodium sulfate, and potassium nitrate processing plant on Borons Aguas Blancas property.
<P>
<I>The company has received a commitment from ABN Amro Bank N.V. to underwrite a US$46 million debt financing for Borons development of the Aguas Blancas project.  ABN Amro, a major international bank based in Amsterdam, has a strong presence in Chile and is one of the leading providers of mining project finance in the world.  This package, which provides US$37 in debt financing with working capital of US$4 million and a cost overrun provision of US$5 million, is expected to be completed by the end of 1996.  Borons management is now focusing on the construction details for its industrial chemical plant and the establishment of a market for its products.</I>

<P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Chase Resources and its affiliated exploration company, Delta Gold Mining Corp., have engaged in an intensive exploration and land acquisition program in the Philippines, Chile and, most recently, Indonesia. This has paid off with the acquisition of a number of highly prospective properties, including the Cikondang Gold Mine in Indonesia and the Taysan deposit in the Philippines. Taysan alone is estimated to contain an estimated resource of 2.5 million ounces of gold and 3.6 billion pounds of copper. Mining giant BHP is a major shareholder in Chase/Delta and is involved in the joint development of the Taysan deposit. For more information, call Chases Audio Text Number, 1-800-836-4012
<P>
<I>Chase has recently commenced its drill program at the El Paso prospect within the Batangas F.T.A.A. in the Philippines.  This drill program will test the Abasan Ridge area, where previous trench samples indicated values of 28 meters with grades of 0.92% copper and 0.26% gold.  Also in the Philippines, Delta Gold has acquired 100% interest in the Trinidad Project.Deltas ongoing exploration of this project has uncovered indicators of three new gold zones.  The previous owners of the Trinidad identified  a reserve of 109,000 tonnes containing a grade of 16 grams per tonne.  The amalgamation of Chase and Delta has been delayed because the exchange ratio of Delta shares for the new Chase shares must still be determined.  The formal establishment of this exchange ratio is imminent.</I>

Since 1992, Goldbelt Resources has, through a series of strategic partnerships, built a substantial presence in the mineral rich former Soviet Republic of Kazakstan. With four primary concessions in the companys coffers, and the financing of production facilities at their Leninogorsk gold project well advanced, investors can look for Goldbelt to transition from an exploration company into a producer within the next 18 months. For more information, call Goldbelts Audio Text Service, 1-800-836-4013.
<P>
<I>Goldbelts geologists, accompanied by senior Kazak geologists, have completed field checking 50% of the 314 known prospects and mines located on Goldbelts two exclusive exploration licenses in north central Kazakstan.  Thus far, eight areas have been identified to have the geologic potential for large tonnage gold deposits (greater than 50 million tonnes).  Ground and airborne electromagnetic surveys are in progress to look for additional deposits.  The engineering pre-feasibility study phase has begun at the Abyz Deposit.  This study should be completed by the end of October 1996.</I>

International Panorama is a Canadian exploration firm with a global portfolio of gold, nickel, copper and cobalt properties.  The Company is focusing on its recently acquired US$6 billion copper/cobalt tailings project in Zaire.  The agreement has been ratified by the Zaire government
<P>
<I>The company has retained the firm of Dump and Dune Drillers of South Africa to begin a 300 hole drill program on the Zaire copper/cobalt properties.  This drill program is expected to be completed by the end of October 1996 and is in the first phase in support of theCompanys feasibility study.  Agreements with world renowned engineering firms are being finalized to complete a bankable feasibility study by March 1997.  This document will define the scope of the project, confirm reserves and metals grades, establish plant design and determine capital operating costs.  Concurrent with the drilling program metallurgical tests are conducted on the tailings samples to find the most efficient recovery techniques for the potential 255 million pounds of cobalt and 1.3 billion pounds of copper, currently valued at over US$6 billion.  International Panorama owns a 51% interest in this project joint venture with Zaires state-owned mining enterprise Gecamines.</I>

Silver Standard is a silver exploration with a corporate mandate to secure a portfolio of properties containing a minimum total defined in-ground resource of 250,000,000 ounces of silver by 1997, and to become a significant silver producer within four years. Silver Standard, which has multi-million ounce concessions in Bolivia, Mexico and the Russian Far East is a top recommendation of a number of leading analysts, including Doug Casey, Jim Blanchard, Adrian Day and Rick Rule
<P>
<I>Satisfactory progress has been reported by Silver Standard on its due diligence work and feasibility study at the Lunnoe property in the Russian Far East.  This property contains nine known mineralized zones on which proven,  probable and possible  resource  of 120 million ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold have been outlined thus far.
<P>
Underground cross-cut sampling across the Number 9 zone, which contains much of this resource, has confirmed grades ranging from 8.69 ounces of silver per ton over 101.4 feet to 13.28 ounces of silver per ton over 119.8 feet, plus significant gold values. An additional $4 million of working capital has been added to Silver Standards treasury from the recent exercise of warrants by Teck Corporation.   The company has also added a fourth project to its operations in Mexico with the recent option agreement to explore the 84 hectare La Morelense concession in the state of Veracruz.  In Bolivia, Silver Standard is about to commence a 5,000 meter diamond drill program at El Asiento. Other potential acquisitions are being reviewed.</I>

<P>
Yuma is an exceptionally well managed company pursuing a three-tiered strategy for copper production from its Chilean Sierra Gorda Project.  The first stage, now completed, involved the acquisition of the Dona Ada copper processing facility.  The second phase will involve the construction of copper sulphate facilities at Sierra Miranda, Tuina and Dona Ada.  The final phase will consist of the construction of a Solvent Extraction - Electrowinning (SX-EW) plant at Sierra Miranda for the annual production of 40,000 metric tonnes 
(88 million pounds) of copper cathodes.  During construction, production will continue at Dona Ada and will be increased as the additional copper sulphate facilities are introduced >
<P>
<I>Yuma assumed operation of the Dona Ada copper processing plant on September 1, 1996 by making a US $2.0 million payment to the Chilean owner.  This entitles Yuma to 100% of the plants estimated US$200,000 monthly pre-tax profits from the production of approximately 880,000 pounds of copper.  This copper will be produced in the form of an enriched leach solution and sold to Anglo Americas Mantos Blancos SX-EW facility for conversion into copper cathodes.
<P>
The recent granting of the water rights for the Tuina Mine by the Chilean government has allowed Yuma to obtain a 74% interest in the project from International Mahogany Corp. and North Lily Mining.  This clears the way for the construction and start-up of operations at Tuina.
<P>
The feasibility study of the Sierra Gorda Project, being performed by Bateman Engineering of Tucson, Arizona is advancing.  A program of approximately 15,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling is under way for the definition of the ore reserve at Sierra Miranda.</I>

Over the past five years, Chase Resources and its affiliated exploration company, Delta Gold Mining Corp., have engaged in an intensive exploration and land acquisition program in the Philippines, Chile and, most recently, Indonesia. This has paid off with the acquisition of a number of highly prospective properties, including the Cikondang Gold Mine in Indonesia and the Taysan copper-gold deposit in the Philippines. Taysan alone is estimated to contain an estimated resource of 2.5 million ounces of gold and 3.6 billion pounds of copper. By September 1996, Chase and Delta will be amalgamated into a single company. Mining giant BHP is a major shareholder in Chase/Delta and is involved in the joint development of the Taysan deposit. For more information, call Chase's Audio Text Number, 1-800-836-4012.
<P>
<I>The official merger of Delta Gold Mining into Chase Resources is on track to occur in the first half of September. Once the merger is complete, the "new" company will retain the name of Chase Resources and a listing will be sought on the NASDAQ. In advance of the merger, Delta Gold Mining announced an update on its seven active exploration projects, including the most advanced of these projects, the Cikondang Gold Mine in Indonesia,  which has been allocated an exploration budget of $1 million.

<I>Goldbelt's price has steadily recovered from a set-back suffered when, to satisfy a legal judgment, a court awarded 3.1 million shares of its stock to another mining company. For investors, the important factors are (a) that these shares had been issued prior to the judgment, so that no dilution of existing shareholders resulted, and (b) the fundamentals of the company have not changed. If anything, they have gotten better as the company has greatly expanded the scope of its drilling program in Kazakstan.

Adrian Resources currently owns a 52% interest in one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits: 
<P>
<B>The Petaquilla Mineral District in Panama.</B> The total geologic resource stands at 3.74 billion tons containing 31.8 billion pounds of copper, 9.8 million ounces of gold, and 962 million pounds of molybdenum. A scoping study conducted by Flour Daniel Wright has estimated the present value of the concession to be US$955 million at US$1.00lb copper. Adrian trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol, ADL and on the Nasdaq, symbol ADLRF.
<P>
<I>The Teck Corporation, Adrian's strategic partner in the Petaquilla, continues to work on its bankable feasibility study. This study is on schedule for release in November of 1996. Teck's study has identified yet another mineral in Petaquilla's massive reserves: In addition to copper, gold and molybdenum, a significant amount of recoverable silver has been identified within the copper concentrate. Based on $5.00 silver, the silver reserves identified thus far translates into an estimated $6 million of additional net annual revenue.</I>

<P>
Over the past five years, Chase Resources and its affiliated exploration company, Delta Gold Mining Corp., have engaged in an intensive exploration and land acquisition program in the Philippines, Chile and, most recently, Indonesia. This has paid off with the acquisition of a number of highly prospective properties, including the Cikondang Gold Mine in Indonesia and the Taysan copper-gold deposit in the Philippines.  Taysan alone is estimated to contain an estimated resource of 2.5 million ounces of gold and 3.6 billion pounds of copper. By September 1996, Chase and Delta should be amalgamated into a single company. Mining giant BHP is a major shareholder in Chase/Delta and is involved in the joint development of the Taysan deposit. For more information, call Chase's Audio Text Number, 1-800-836-4012.
<P>
<I>* Additional trench results from the El Paso prospect --  located within the Batangas FTAA in the Philippines --  has identified two new zones of mineralization containing significant percentages of gold and copper. These results add to the substantial copper content discovered in late May along El Paso's three large copper and gold mineralization zones where soil sampling has already uncovered values of 0.58% copper. 
<P>
* Delta Gold recently entered into an option agreement to acquire large mineral concessions on Samar Island, Philippines, which will effectively double Chase's property assets upon completion of the pending Chase/Delta amalgamation.  
<P>
*In other news, drilling at the Mejilliones Project in Northern Chile has reported encouraging results. As only a very limited portion of the property, of which Chase has the right to acquire 75%, has been explored thus far, and additional drilling is scheduled for this summer, you'll want to watch for more news in the weeks and months ahead.</I>

Metallica Resources, with one of the most respected management teams in the mining exploration industry, is in the process of developing the Cerro San Pedro gold/silver concession in Mexico. An extensive drill program on the property has so far identified a resource of 2.5 million ounces of gold and 68 million ounces of silver... ranking Cerro San Pedro among the three largest gold/silver deposits in Mexico. A bankable feasibility study is currently in the works. Once it is released, the decision to enter  production should quickly follow.
<P>
<I>The first drill results from the 1996 ore reserve expansion program at the Cerro San Pedro gold-silver project have returned grades of 1.10 grams per ton gold and 31.2 grams per ton silver over a 160 meter interval. This 50  meter step-out hole is located north of the previously defined reserve area and will be followed up with at least 8-10 additional drill holes in July.  The full feasibility study for the Cerro San Pedro is underway, and the company expects completion in the first quarter of 1997.

<P>
Yuma is an exceptionally well-managed company that is pursuing a two-tiered strategy that will result in its becoming a mid-tier copper producer in the near future. 
<P>
The first part of the strategic plan is to complete the acquisition of the Dona Ada copper cement plant on September 1, 1996, thus allowing for the production of 5,100 tonnes (11 million pounds) of copper per annum.  In conjunction with the copper cement production that will provide a positive cash flow to the company, Yuma will construct copper sulphate plants at the Tuina and the recently acquired Sierra Miranda sites to produce copper sulphate crystals for shipment to the cement plant at Dona Ada.
<P>
The second part of the strategy will result in the building of a Solvent Extraction Electrowinning (SX - EW)
plant at Sierra Miranda for the production of copper cathodes.  Once the SX-EW plant is operational, the copper sulphate plant will be moved to Dona Ada.  Both Dona Ada and Tuina will continue to produce copper sulphate crystals for shipment to Sierra Miranda and conversion into copper cathodes.  Total production of copper cathodes at the Sierra Miranda plant is estimated at 40,000 tonnes (88 million pounds) per annum.
<P>
<I>* Yuma has made significant progress on the financing for its SX-EW and copper sulphate plants.  In the near future the company is planning to announce the details regarding the equity portion of its total financing package.

Since 1992, Goldbelt Resources has, through a series of strategic partnerships, built a substantial presence in the mineral rich former Soviet Republic of Kazakstan. With three primary concessions and the financing of a production facility at their Leninogorsk gold project in its final stages, investors can look for Goldbelt to transition from an exploration company, into a sizable producer within the next 18 months. For more information, call Goldbelt's Audio Text Service, 1-800-836-4013.
<P>
<I>First Marathon Securities has completed the private placement of 8 million special warrants for Goldbelt, raising C$8.4 million for the company. In May the market responded very favorably to results released by the company from its second step-out drill hole on the Abyz copper/gold deposit in Kazakstan. These drill holes show a continuance of the high grade intercept and further extends the known resource. Goldbelt has moved a diamond
drilling rig onto its 100% owned Kakbit deposit where previous trench samples have uncovered a number of highly prospective gold, silver, copper and zinc anomalies. Stay closely in touch for additional drill results in the near future.</I>

Guyana Gold Corporation is a moderate-sized producer (12,000 ounces annually) from its Sabi Gold Mine in Zimbabwe. An upgrade is underway which is slated for completion by the latter half of 1998. This upgrade is anticipated to increase production to a significant 40,000 ozs a year at a projected cost of less than $226  per ounce. The company has also begun an exploration program on its Sabi concession which is designed to double the present resource of 1,200,000 ounces during the first six months of drilling. For an audio update on Guyana, call their Audio Text Number, 1-800-334-2191. Or, visit their web site at: <B>HTTP:\\WNN.GUYANAGOLD.COM.</B>
<P>
<I>Guyana's on-site team of geologists continues the drilling program which began in March at the Sabi mine. So far, this program has already identified additional reserves of 300,000 ounces of gold, bringing total reserves to 1.5 million ounces. As part of their expansion, it was recently announced that they have acquired additional property adjacent to their Sabi mining lease. This new property contains a small established mine and an estimated resource of at least 100,000 ounces of gold. The drilling program at the Sabi is at a very exciting stage, and additional results should be released in June.</I>

Metallica Resources, with one of the most respected management teams in the mining exploration industry, is in the process of developing the Cerro San Pedro gold/silver concession in Mexico. An extensive drill program on the property has so far identified a resource of 2.5 million ounces of gold and 68 million ounces of silver... ranking Cerro San Pedro among the five largest gold/silver deposits in Mexico. A bankable feasibility study is now scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1996, after which a decision to enter production should quickly follow.
<P>
<I>In addition to progressing on the bankable feasibility study on their Cerro San Pedro gold-silver deposit, the company has recently taken steps to widen its exploration program by entering into a joint venture agreement with Compania Minera Taura, a private Chilean mining company.

Yuma is an exceptionally well managed company which is pursuing a two-tiered strategy that will result in its becoming a mid-tier copper producer in the near future. The first part of the strategic plan calls for putting  the Tuina and Dona Ada mines into production in 1996.  It is estimated that the Tuina alone will generate up to 13,200,000 pounds annually of high quality copper cathode once production commences. The second part of the strategy calls for the building of a large processing facility on the Dona Ada, and "contract processing" copper sulphide crystals and copper oxide ores for other mines in the region. This will boost production to over 80,000,000 pounds of copper per annum. 
<P>
<I>Yuma has officially completed its acquisition of the Tuina copper mine from International Mahogany Corp., and North Lily Mining Ltd. Additionally, the company has signed an agreement to acquire the Dona Ada copper-cement plant, a producing mine with some US8.5 million in annual production. The centrally located Dona Ada will be the site of a far larger processing facility, including a large electrowinning (EW) where final processing of copper sulfate crystals into copper cathodes is done. Negotiations are now well underway for the financing needed to build the $80 million facilities at the Dona Ada.</I>

<A NAME="Ju">The buyer's strike that has plagued Canadian juniors since June started to end last week. As you may recall, the reality checks delivered by the Timbuktu and Cartaway disasters helped push speculators to the sidelines, a move reinforced by the senior market's micro-correction in July. Despite a rising chorus of bearish warnings that the longest running bull market in history was on the verge of collapse, New York has since charged ahead to a record high of 6,219 as of Friday, November 8. While investors have largely ignored the bears, these warnings did not go unheeded by speculators, whose phenomenal success with Canadian juniors in 1996 satiated greed and calmed the usual desperation for big and quick profits that characterizes speculation. From June until now speculators have kept a nervous eye on the "dangling sword" that the senior market's apparent toppiness represented, while they awaited liquidity for the $10 billion bonanza delivered in 1996 by Diamond Fields, Bre-X and Arequipa. While partial recycling of these hard value profits fueled the junior stocks during the first half, it appears that the proceeds from the Diamond Fields and Arequipa takeover bids have stayed on the sidelines. Bre-X itself has not been taken over, but the stock has traded so heavily in the $15-25 range ($150-250 pre-split, with retail investors on board below $25 pre-split) that it is safe to conclude that much of the Bre-X paper has shifted from retail shareholder accounts to institutional accounts. That institutional money has been sucked from conservative capital pools invested in mutual funds whose managers as a group have allocated the minor spec component into high profile juniors like Bre-X. Retail investors have been reluctant since June to reinvest their windfall profits in other junior stocks because those profits carry a big capital gains tax liability and the junior market was not only trapped in the downtrending "cup-half-empty" phase of the seasonal cycle, but vulnerable to getting whacked if New York did keel over. Retail speculative buying is driven by the expectation of profits "tomorrow", not "next year". The thinking that set in was "hey, if I buy this stock now it means my tax burden next April will be even worse, and with the trend going against me, I'm at risk of "losing" either way". Sounds perverse, but keep in mind that Americans resist paying down mortgages because they like to claim the interest as a tax deduction.
<P>
<A NAME="Us"><font size=+1>US election outcome pulls speculators from the sidelines back onto the field
</font size>
<P>
As always happens when buyers go on strike, speculators have encountered liquidity problems trying to sell their Canadian juniors, especially during the past two months. The high-flyers of 1996 have consequently pulled back sharply, putting many speculators in specific loss positions, but not in overall net loss terms. The smarter ones have already cut their losses by taking their losses to offset earlier gains. The downtrend, however, has reached a standstill, which is evident in the large bid-ask spreads on many juniors. This condition implies that prices have dropped low enough to defuse the "dump at any cost" mood. Normally I would say it is still too early in the tax loss selling season for bottom-fishers to switch from lurking at the bid to reaching for the offer, but this year the turnaround trigger lies in the US election, which gave the market exactly what it wanted: a Republican controlled house and senate that ensures ongoing fiscal conservatism, and a Democrat president to veto the loonier initiatives launched by Republican extremists. The outlook for continuing moderate growth and subdued inflation suits investors just fine. It is clear that in the post-election debate over the economy's and market's direction the bulls are beating the bears as a vision of "a 10,000 Dow before a 3,000 Dow" settles in. I do not care to comment on the wisdom of this mentality, but I am prepared to predict it will nail that "dangling sword" securely to the wall for at least another six months in the eyes of speculators. With only two months to go before the arrival of 1997, "tomorrow's spec profits" are rapidly becoming "next tax year's profits". The timing is right for speculators to move their money from the sidelines back into Canadian juniors, particularly ones that do not have a heavy overhang of shareholders underwater at much higher prices. Juniors that spent 1996 treading water in terms of stock performance but got things accomplished in terms of fundamentals are ready to rocket out of the bottom into the new year with hardly an interruption. As this group turns the VSE index into a visible uptrend, the 1996 high-flyers will follow suit. But you should be aware that this group of "underwater" stocks is very likely to suffer a setback in mid-December as the Johnny-come-latelies realize they should do some tax loss selling and switch the proceeds into "fresh" stories. I think the tax-loss selling pressure on most of the Canadian juniors is over, but not for that small group of heavily traded stocks down 50% or more from their 1996 peaks. This latter group will also be vulnerable to the annual year-end shuffle of institutional window-dressing as fund managers purge losing positions from the portfolio so that they don't show up in next year's mutual fund prospectus.
<P>
<A NAME="Jn"><font size=+1>$1-5 juniors destined to post biggest gains in the Year of the Blowoff
</font size>
<P>
My recommendation is to avoid 1996's high profile stocks until mid-December, but bottom-fish aggressively now for the also-ran juniors who are set to capitalize on a surge in market interest in 1997. I think the senior market is good for at least one more major leg in 1997, during which speculative interest in Canadian exploration juniors will soar, especially as new major discoveries lurch onto the scene. I believe juniors in the $1-$5 price range with strong management, capital and a diverse portfolio of projects at various stages of exploration will post the biggest gains in 1997, shooting for double digit dreamland. The promise of liquidity and information flow coupled with promotional infrastructure will draw large audiences of speculators to these stocks. Cheaper stocks are not likely to be as rewarding, because if management hasn't already got its act together, it is probably too late to participate in the giant 1997 Blowoff that is brewing. Calling 1997 the Year of the Blowoff may be a harsh and cynical way of putting it, but with the longevity of the senior bull market an open question, and the poor odds that as many world class discoveries will be made as there are serious juniors looking for them, you can bet that the "industry" will be focused on shifting its paper into the hands of new audiences attracted by the exceptional recent track record of Canadian juniors. The accompanying promotion campaigns aren't likely to kick in until the new year, so speculators already familiar with how the systems work would be wise to take their positions during the next two months. In short, what I am saying is the upward ramping chart pattern popularly known as the January Effect is now underway two months early. The downside risk lies in the large profits that are still embedded in the Canadian juniors. I would venture that many stocks have been able to sustain hefty market caps for the simple reason that shareholders who bought positions at lucrative prices using Bre-X style profits have held off taking profits until the new tax year arrives. Unless new capital is injected into the Canadian juniors through takeover bids of stocks like Adrian, Farallon, Intl Curator and Aber, or through the arrival of new audiences, the tax-gain selling pressure that will greet the higher profile juniors in the new year may force them into a downtrend one might call a Reverse January Effect. Such a development could spill over into the rest of the market.

<A NAME="Ca"><font size=+1>Canadian stock market poised to outperform US markets</font size>
<P>
I have been talking about the Canadian spec market from the domestic perspective of Americans, as though their moods about their own stock market and economy dictate the trend of Canada's stock market. There is reason to think that a sneeze in the United States won't necessarily cause Canada's stock market to catch a cold this time around. Canada's central bank has been dropping the prime rate relentlessly over the past two years in an effort to stimulate an economy whose unemployment rate is stuck at 10% compared to 5.2% in the United States. As a result the prime rate stands at 4.75%, a level that hasn't been seen since the fifties. Even though the US prime rate stands at 8.25%, the Canadian dollar has risen to about $0.75 and is still regarded as undervalued. Canada's inflation hovers at 1.5%, half that in the United States. From the American perspective it now looks like Canada's economy should soon start to respond positively and offer an excellent window for investment growth before inflation creeps back into the picture. If you ignore the potential for a Quebec induced currency crisis, and consider that interest rates can't be pushed too much lower, the Canadian dollar is set to rise. The stage has been set for a boom in Canadian equities as Canadian investors move their money into stocks in search of better returns, followed by American capital which sees the comparative uptrend in Canadian markets supercharged with the potential for a currency exchange gain. Over the past few years Canadian stocks have suffered from the opposite perception. This special attractiveness of the Canadian stock market would offset the fallout from a near-term correction in American equity markets, provided such a correction does not spiral out of control into a devastating shock to the system. Given the recent track record of junior resource stocks, this sector is a natural destination for both investment and speculation dollars. (To appreciate the scale of the accomplishments, just ask yourself when the global news has ever before covered a story involving the extortion bid by a dictator's kid for a $1 million monthly nose-picking retainer and a 10% carried interest in a multi-billion dollar gold discovery by a Canadian junior? Frankly, I find the affair quite disgusting, and would not be surprised if it becomes the symbolic lever that helps the Indonesian people toss out the sleazebag military once Suharto joins his wife. Bre-X already has about 50 million ounces gold, and the extra 100 million ounces it might still find are worthless because they won't see the light of day for another 50 years. There are limits to how much ore a single mining operation can process, so unless Busang's grade improves, Bre-X stock has limited upside in net present value terms. In terms of comparative value and potentially higher gold prices, 50 million ounces in a single deposit is nowhere near as valuable as 50 million ounces in five deposits. I don't expect speculators to hang around with Bre-X positions once we are in the new tax year.) The only thing missing from the equation is an uptrend in commodity prices, a development that does not presently form part of anybody's expectation set. If prices for metals like copper, gold, silver, and, heaven forbid, zinc, started heading up, Canadian resource stocks would become the hottest investment on the planet.
<P>
<A NAME="Tw"><font size=+1>Two Bottom-Fishing Windows: Now, and again when tax-loss selling switches to tax-gain selling</font size>
<P>
If I am correct in calling the turnaround out of the bottom for Canadian junior resource stocks as happening right now, the publication of my 100 bottom-fish picks for 1997 in early December will not be very good timing for bottom-fishing purposes. The September-October issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, which is a complete review of my 100 bottom-fish picks for 1996, went to the printer on October 29, but did not get into the mail until November 5 thanks to a pile of last minute election propaganda that slipped into the queue ahead of me. Although I hinted in that issue that the breakout from the bottom was coming early this year, I am now sufficiently convinced to make a point of telling my Kaiser Express subscribers that the timeliness of the stocks classified as bottom-fish or seasonal buys is immediate. Most are comparable in quality to the leading new candidates on my 1997 bottom-fish short list. Read my September-October issue carefully and act now to avoid the crowd and higher prices in December. On the other hand, if we do get back to back rounds of tax-loss selling in late December and tax-gain selling in early January, bottom-fishers could experience a welcome market lull during which they will have ample time to take advantage of the 100 Bottom-Fish Picks for 1997.

<A NAME="Un"><font size=+1>Unkind chalk mark commentary on truth machine verdicts</font size>
<P>
The truth machines have been whittling away at a number of my Kaiser Express picks over the past year, in particular <b>Peruvian Gold (PVO-V: $2.57), Teuton Resource Corp (TUO-V: $0.87), Gerle Gold (GGL-V: $1.12)</b> and <b>Cons Callinan Flin Flon (CFF-V: $1.42).</b> The chalk marks have already delivered rather nasty verdicts on these stocks, even though the fat lady's turn to sing isn't even in the lineup yet. At this point I would suggest that tax loss considerations be the only logic in contemplated sales, for these stocks are close to a bottom. I am working on getting clear pictures of the truth machine verdicts, and will publish my conclusions in a future Kaiser Express. As for the Voisey's Bay East play, it looks like any extension of the Eastern Deeps is going to be very deep, if it exists at all. <b>Columbia Yukon (CYR-C: $0.46)</b> and <b>Intl Canalaska (ICA-V: $0.60)</b> drilled through uninspired geology to a depth of 860 metres before packing it in for the season. The Voisey's Bay East play isn't dead yet, but I regard Columbia Yukon's short term value primarily in tax mitigation terms. Speculators who had the fortune of ignoring Columbia Yukon should regard our liquidation binge as a bottom-fishing opportunity. Those who chose <b>Lucero Resource Corp (LCR-V: $1.15)</b> as their Eastern Deeps Extension hedge made the better choice and will soon be very happy. Lucero is in the process of nailing down a land package in Mexico that Jim Dawson thinks has exceptional potential. We are still three weeks away from knowing whether or not Lucero is on track with a Farallon style "district" story. I own shares in Gerle, Peruvian Gold, Columbia Yukon and Lucero.

<A NAME="Ke"><font size=+1>Keep an eye on First Choice</font size>
<P>
One stock to put on your watch list is Peter Dasler's <b>First Choice Industries (FSD-V: $0.31)</b>, which is busy drilling the Knob Hill prospect in northern Vancouver Island. The target here is an El Indio type high sulphidation gold deposit within the upper levels of a porphyry system. First Choice has drilled several short holes that have yielded sulphides over 300 ft, with lead-zinc-copper and arsenopyrite mineralization evident. The gold grade, invisible until assayed, will make or break this play. Dasler, who is the underlying owner of the prospect under option 65% to First Choice, is pretty excited about the core, but not enough to have sent it in for rush assaying. His optimism is based on an associated arsenic-gold soil anomaly, which suggests to him that this stuff will run a decent gold grade. If it does, and assays are expected within a week, First Choice is sitting on a major new discovery. The stock is somewhat of an orphan whose key supporters have been back-dooring each other over the past year. But the company does have one large shareholder whose paper doesn't free up until late December. This individual operates his own PR machine, which you can bet will be hooked up to First Choice if the core assays gold. At this stage I suggest nobody buy the stock, just watch it closely for assay results and be prepared to act swiftly if we get long intersections of 1 g/t gold or better. It is preferable to own this stock at higher prices when we know the company has the goods. First Choice can be reached at (800) 473-9444. I own a small position in First Choice.

<P>
Two juniors of the variety that I think will do very well in 1997 are <b>Energold Mining Ltd (EGD-V: $1.48)</b> and <b>Sonoma Resource Corp (SNA-V: $1.64).</b> Energold is a graduate from my 1996 Bottom-Fish List and Sonoma is a graduate from the 1995 list. Neither had a major play in 1996, but did spend the year straightening out organizational matters, raising money and preparing for a big exploration year in 1997. Energold is the more illiquid of the two, but both stocks appear to have resistance at the $2 level and accordingly speculators should not chase these stocks beyond $2 until there are further corporate developments. I own a small position in Sonoma.

<font size=+2><b>Energold</b>: Dominican Republic Country Play</font size>
<P>
<b>Energold Mining Ltd (EGD-V)</b> maintained a fairly low profile during 1996 while management waited for the outcome of elections in the Dominican Republic and for the Eldorado-Gencor-HRC reorganization deals to close. Energold had been created in 1994 by Fred Davidson and Walter Sellmer, whose Latin American quest ended in 1995 when Eldorado assigned to Energold an option to acquire a package of concessions in the Dominican Republic which Canyon and Battle Mountain had assembled and wished to unload because of political uncertainty. Eldorado became a key shareholder in Energold, and boosted its equity stake to a current 42% interest in April 1996 when it bought out an offshore venture capital group's 3.2 million Energold shares. Eldorado has been a passive investor; although the Davidson/Sellmer group control only 20% of Energold's 13.4 million fully diluted shares, they run the company and control the board with 3 directors compared to Eldorado's 2 directors. The relationship is friendly, and buttressed by investments Eldorado insiders have made in Energold.
<P>
The centrepiece of Energold's property portfolio is the EL Centenario gold deposit on the El Higo concession, a shallow epithermal system estimated to host 1,094,000 tonnes of 6.7 g/t (0.2 opt) gold or about 220,000 ounces on the basis of 35 holes drilled by Canyon/Battle Mountain. Drilling late last year was interrupted when environmentalists prodded a jurisdictional dispute between the mines and forestry departments over six trees that the drilling contractor had chopped down. Management suspects that the fuss was related to political posturing for the upcoming election in 1996. One year later (Sept 26/96) Energold received permission to begin a 50 hole reserve delineation drill program expected to take 3-4 months. Management concedes that El Centenario is not a world class contender, and thinks the upside limit for a gold reserve is about 400,000 ounces.
<P>
The Dominican Republic covers the eastern two-thirds of the Hispaniola Island in the Caribbean. Since the arrival of Columbus in the 15th century DR has suffered a sordid history of foreign military occupations and internal dictatorships. The proximity to Cuba and the United States has ensured repeated political intervention by the USA during the past century. In 1966 Joaquin Balaguer was elected president and for the next 30 years succeeded in being "elected" to seven presidential terms totalling 22 years during which he imposed his conservative "law and order" philosophy that required suppression of the opposition. Balaguer's election rigging efforts failed in 1978 when a moderate leftist became president, who was replaced by a social democrat in 1982. During the eighties DR fell victim to inflation and a debt crisis that enabled Balaguer to be re-elected in 1986. With the aid of election fraud he was re-elected in 1990 and again in 1994, but the last affair caused such a domestic and international uproar that his term was cut in half and new elections scheduled in mid-1996. The May 16 election and the June 30 runoff between Leonel Fernandez and Jose Francisco Pena Gomez may represent a watershed in DR politics. Although Fernandez beat Gomez by less than 3%, the loser graciously acknowledged defeat (unprecedented in DR history) and outside observers confirmed that there was virtually no evidence of electoral fraud. Fernandez, who is only 43 years old and grew up in New York before returning to DR to train as a lawyer, is described as "slightly right of centre" (outgoing president Balaguer voted for him) and committed to free-market economies. The loser, Gomez, has formed an alliance between his PLD party and Balaguer's old party, the PRSC, to control DR's senate and lower house in a situation that appears similar to the United States. Gomez, described as "slightly-left-of-centre", however, also favours free markets and foreign investments. During the past two months a change in political atitude has become obvious, in particular with regard to the mining sector, which the new government sees as a major way to boost the agriculturally based economy.
<P>
For Energold, which ventured into the Dominican Republic when political risk was still spelled with capital letters, this development promises to attract investor interest. Two other earlybirds, Falconbridge and BHP, have been joined by MIM in a "staking" rush. Energold itself has amassed over 180,000 ha, and because of restrictions on the number and size of concessions a single party can control, has been busy farming projects out to others while retaining rights to back in for 60% by reimbursing expenditures. The real story, however, which will put the Dominican Republic on the institutional map is a proposal by Eldorado and Gencor to test a proprietary extraction technology on the refractory sulphide ore at the Pueblo Viejo Mine. Pueblo Viejo is a world-class deposit Eldorado estimates has a geologic resource of about 464 million tonnes of 2 g/t (0.058 opt) gold using a 1 g/t cutoff. Between 1975-1992 the state mining company, Rosario Dominicana SA, has produced 5 million ounces gold and 22 million ounces silver by open-pit mining the over-lying oxide ore which is now largely depleted. The refractory nature of the sulphide ore has meant that the underlying 32 million ounce gold reserve is non-commercial. If Gencor/Eldorado can demonstrate commercial extraction with Gencor's BIOX bacterial oxidation technology, they will make a unique development proposal to the Dominican Republic.

If mining Pueblo Viejo's sulphide ore is feasible and a development deal is struck, the spotlight will shine on the remaining relatively unexplored potential of the Dominican Republic. When investors realize that the Hispaniola Island is an accretion of numerous island-arc terranes assembled from the Cretaceous period onward, and that the Pueblo Viejo deposit is hosted by sedimentary rocks within a maar crater diatreme complex, they are going to recognize the language of Kalimantan and Busang. Falconbridge was present because DR hosts nickel deposits, but the arrival of two Australian mining giants and their acquisition campaign in the vicinity of Pueblo Viejo suggest they recognize certain similarities with the geology that turned Bre-X into a household name. While the region has likely been scoured for exposed oxide deposits, the potential for hidden sulphide deposits similar to Pueblo Viejo is relatively untouched. Once it becomes apparent that Pueblo Viejo's refractory problem is solvable, Energold's large adjacent land position will become an especially hot exploration target.
<P>
Energold presently has about $2.5 million working capital that includes proceeds from a recent private placement of 923,077 shares at $1.30 that was taken down by a number of prominent promoters, brokers and newsletter writers. Energold's Fred Davidson is not known as a strong promoter, but the elite audience he has cultivated ensures that when the timing is right there will be no shortage of market support. The feedback I get from Eldorado is that it perceives Energold as an exploration company specializing in Central America and the Caribbean. The acquisition efforts in the Dominican Republic over the past year were guided by Energold management, but it would not be unreasonable to expect Eldorado to steer a flow of potential projects toward Energold in 1997. At this point Energold does not have an institutional shareholder base, but with Eldorado as a shareholder anchor, it is just a matter of time. The stock is thinly traded, and hard to buy at current levels. It has no overhang of "underwater" paper, but selling from impatient shareholders should materialize around the $2 level. Energold can be reached at (604) 681-9501.

<font size=+2> Sonoma: a play on Argentina and the Cerro Toro prospect</font size>
<P>
It's taken Pat McCleery longer than he expected, but he finally has <b>Sonoma Resource Corp (SNA-V)</b> properly financed and positioned to become a major Argentina play in 1997. Over the past few years Jim Keighley and Ron Brown have pooled their collective knowledge of Argentina and satellite imagery data to assemble a million acre land package consisting of 30 prospects in six regions of Argentina. The top priority is the 2,000 ha Cerro Toro project in Argentina's San Juan province. Located on the Argentine side of the El Indio gold belt, Cerro Toro hosts a north south striking colour anomaly of 3,500 m by 1,000 m that Ron Brown first discovered in 1982 while working for St Joe Minerals. Sampling work late last year revealed a series of high grade polymetallic vein swarms in the Central Zone that appear to repeat themselves over a width of 300-400 metres and a strike length of 1,350 metres. One channel sample yielded 16 ft grading 32.2% zinc, 19 opt silver, 2,26% copper, 0.46 g/t gold and 0.5% lead. Because the Central Zone is littered with talus Sonoma decided early this year to build a road into the property in order to bring in heavy equipment, but by the time the road was finished the southern hemisphere's winter had arrived. Although Cerro Toro itself has an elevation of 3,000-3,500 metres and can be worked year round, the main road climbs a 5,000 metre pass that is closed during winter from June through September. Sonoma's bulldozers have been ripping open the Central Zone since October as part of a 10,000 metre trenching program. While the individual high grade veins are only 1-2 metres wide, they appear to be set within a stockwork of disseminated mineralization that represents an El Tambo style bulk tonnage target of 50-100 million tonnes. Trenching and IP geophysical survey results are expected in January, at which point Sonoma expects to be ready to drill the Central Zone. Geophysics is also underway on the South Zone, which, on the basis of fine grained mineralization, Sonoma believes to be the uplifted portion of a major copper-gold porphyry system speculated to underly the Cerro Toro prospect. Sonoma believes it has made a major new grassroots discovery. Because Sonoma is well financed and owns Cerro Toro 100%, confirmation would turn Sonoma into a huge success story.
<P>
Sonoma has projects in San Juan, Cordoba, San Luis, Rio Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz provinces, any one of which could lurch onto the front burner as a result of ongoing field work. For now the focus, however, is on Cerro Toro. Fully diluted Sonoma has 22.8 million shares, of which about 17.1 million are presently issued. Of these 5 million trade as special warrants under the symbol SNA.WT.L. Each special warrant consists of one share and a 1/2 warrant which were sold in October by Loewen Ondaatje through a brokered private placement of 5 million special warrants at $1.10. Sonoma has about $2.5 million working capital, plus $5 million in escrow pending prospectus qualification of the special warrants, expected to take 2-3 months. Full dilution would inject another $8.4 million into the treasury. Sonoma has a well rounded management that includes Dan Kunz as president, Pat McCleery, Chet Idziszek, and Bill Rand. They have attracted a strong shareholder base that includes the likes of Adolf Lundin and Doug Casey. If results over the next six months let Cerro Toro live up to its potential, Sonoma will be a major play in 1997. Sonoma can be reached at (800) 763-3255.

<A NAME="Ba"><b>Gerle Gold Ltd</b>(GGL-V: $1.46) announced on September 18 that 15 out of 98 shallow reverse circulation holes had intersected kimberlite. Apparently Gerle has been sitting on this information for more than a week, though judging by Gerle's recent sell-off to $1.35 and Wednesday's lacklustre market action, this secret has had a tight lid on it. The news release provides no details about the type and size of the kimberlite. A winterized camp is being established in the "area of interest" and diamond core drilling is expected to begin in about a week. Meanwhile results of a ground geophysics survey are being studied and kimberlite samples will be sent for caustic fusion analysis.<BR>
<P>
I talked to Gerle's Ray Hrkac Wednesday afternoon, and was able to glean the following additional information about the discovery. Precise details were not forthcoming because Monopros is unwilling to make any disclosure until it has a better understanding of the discovery. The RC holes were drilled to a maximum depth of 100 ft. The 15 holes that hit kimberlite are within what Hrkac describes as an "extensive area" close to the head of the indicator mineral train on the North/Central claims of the Doyle Lake project south of Mountain Province's 5034 pipe. When I pressed Hrkac about the meaning of "extensive", the best I could get was that it is considerably larger than the area encompassed by the 5034 pipe. Some of the holes stopped in kimberlite, others passed through it into granite. Kimberlite holes were also interspersed with non-kimberlite holes. The kimberlite material appears to be uniform in all the holes. Its facies type has not yet been classified (ie crater, diatreme, hypabyssal). At this stage Monopros does not know whether it is dealing with a large crater facies, a cluster of small diatremes, or a fissure system. Hrkac stated that the lack of outcrop within the "area of interest" clashes with the density, size and texture of the train's indicator minerals, though he did concede that the area includes a number of untested "gaps" in the form of lakes and swamps as well as places where overburden is so thick the RC drill failed to reach bedrock. No indicator mineral analysis has yet been done which would allow a comment on the relationship of the kimberlite's chemistry with the excellent chemistry of the indicator mineral train. Even in the area of the kimberlite intersections the geophysics is too confusing to distinguish between kimberlite and country rock.<BR>
<P>	
About the most I can express about this discovery is that Gerle has finally hit kimberlite. We can't say 'pipe' until Gerle has drilled several deep holes into a kimberlite body. And we can't say diamondiferous until the RC samples are processed. Hrkac was unable to give me a time frame, but did indicate Monopros was treating it on a rush priority basis. This kimberlite discovery is only the beginning. Apparently on the basis of indicator mineral distribution in terms of type and size within the general train, Gerle's consultant, Felix Kaminsky, feels that several distinct sources have fed the train, which travels westward as far as the Noble Peak/Southerena/Monopros JV. My optimism in Gerle's Doyle Lake project, which admittedly had started to flag in the face of the company's inability to hit kimberlite, has been restored. Below $2 the stock is a strong buy. I would be reluctant to pay more until diamond drilling gives us a sense of what sort of kimberlite body (ie tonnage implications) we are dealing with, and to what degree the kimberlite is diamondiferous. However, the Second NWT Diamond Wave I talked about in the March-April 1996 issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report appears to be underway, and may blow the lid off market valuations of key NWT diamond plays. Aber's continuing success in establishing grade and value for the A154, A418 and A21 pipes is pushing that play ever closer to the point where RTZ must make a decision about buying out <b>Aber Resources Ltd (ABZ-T: $23.65)</b>. On September 17 <b>Mountain Province Mining (MPV-V: $5.10)</b> announced a special warrant financing of 3,075,000 units at $4.90 to be brokered by Eagle Partners on a best efforts basis. Eagle is where diamond analyst John Hainey hangs his hat these days. Hainey is quite capable of doing his homework, and probably has not missed the rumours that values won't be reported for the carat parcel from the 113 tonne bulk sample, whose final grade results are imminent. So when the results are finally reported and come nowhere near the original 5 ct/t and $100/ct fantasies of certain offshore tout sheets, I don't expect Mountain Province's price to tank and Eagle to wave the "market out clause" flag. With many of the key NWT diamond plays now operating on an all-season basis, the arrival of winter marks the beginning of the next speculative cycle for NWT diamond stocks.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="Vo"><font size=+1> Voisey's Bay East: hey look, a troctolite!</font size>
<P>
The Voisey's Bay East play received a bit of a shot in the arm recently when <b>NDT Ventures (NDE-V: $1.00)</b> and <b>Lucero Resources Corp (LCR-V: $1.11)</b> announced that a gravity survey on Project 122 just east of the VBE-1 project of <b>Columbia Yukon (CYR-C: $1.22)</b> and <b>Intl Canalaska (ICA-V: $1.26)</b> revealed a structure interpreted as a "200 metre thick ultramafic/troctolite body at a depth of approximately 300 metres below surface". A map published by the JV shows this structure entering from the VBE-1 claim in the north, swinging southwards, and then exiting the property about midway eastwards onto <b>Absolut's (ALR-C: $1.10)</b> property, where it appears to coincide with a deep east-west fjiord that likely coincides with one of the strong east-west fault structures that cut the Voisey's Bay region. The NDT/Lucero news release throws in "ultramafic" as an alternative to "troctolite", but this appears to have been thrown In for the cause of conservatism. The way I heard the story the original troctolite interpretation was made by an individual who has done extensive work interpreting the gravity surveys on the main Voisey's Bay block for Diamond Fields. In other words, the 122 project probably does host a troctolite body. Anywhere else in Labrador such a claim would hardly even deserve a yawn. But in the Voisey's Bay East area the hypothesis has been floated that the geological system that hosts the Eastern Deeps ore may extend much farther east from the original Ovoid discovery than even Diamond Fields' wildest optimists imagined when they stopped staking to the east where dull-looking anorthositic rocks replaced the troctolitic/gneissic rocks that hosted the discovery mineralization. The NDT/Lucero news is the first published evidence that the third dimension may be much more interesting than initially thought, though we are still a long way off from seeing evidence of nickel-copper massive sulphides. None of this has kept the price of NDT from sliding lower, though this may be largely due to the likelihood that the key players behind NDT blew off most of their paper earlier in the year on the back of the Project 44 drill play with Takla Star near Nain. Columbia Yukon and Intl Canalaska meanwhile have finally obtained a drill permit for the VBE-1 claim and will soon begin drilling the first of a several deep geological holes. From what I have heard this hole is in the northern part, and may be aimed at the western extension of the "troctolite" NDT/Lucero have interpreted on their property. At this stage the Voisey's Bay East play is still a wild gamble, but the news from NDT/Lucero leaves me optimistic that drill logs may soon cause this play to catch fire.

Two of my bottom-fish, <b>Borneo Gold Corp (BNO-V: $11.25 halted)</b> and <b>Goldstake Explorations (GXP-T: $2.75)</b> exploded to new highs on extraordinary volume this week. Borneo gapped up on Monday after announcing that a 800 metre by 2,000 metre porphyry breccia intrusive known as the Monsan Prospect had been identified as the lode source of alluvial gold being mined in the area. The news release featured enough qualitative geological detail mixed with talk about visible gold to get any geologist dreaming about the project's exploration potential, but it provided no quantitative details in the form of assays and mineralization extent to explain why the stock suddenly deserved a $300 million market cap based on the 30 million or so fully diluted Borneo shares. In a followup news release prompted by the VSE Borneo confessed that actual sampling had only just begun and that the presence of high grade gold had only been visually observed. The VSE has decided that Borneo should stay halted until Borneo has had opportunity to put all these "bonanza grade ore shoots" into a quantitative perspective based on assays and sample distances. Given the slow pace of exploration work in Indonesia, Borneo may be off the board for a long time. Investors who sold probably have less reason to fret than those who didn't.<BR>
<P>
The following day on September 17 Goldstake produced a feeble news release that "caused" the stock to charge from Monday's $1.18 close to a high of $4.70 before settling back to $3.55 on mind-boggling volume of 6.6 million shares. The news release stated that grades ranging from 0.29 opt gold to 3.38 opt gold had been obtained, but neglected to mention whether these were grab samples, trench samples or drill core assays. The news release also alleged that the work had extended the mineralization in the Ann and Joy Zones from 400 metres to 2,400 metres. The remaining 75% of the news release was devoted to a geological lesson on the Lihir type gold deposit, which Goldstake's geologists think could be the model for the Soreang concession on Java. But consider the wording: "the discovery is a major step toward confirming that the Soreang concession could host a Lihir-type deposit". Sloppy readers may think that Goldstake was sitting on a Lihir deposit, but in reality it is a confession that Goldstake does not yet have sufficient evidence to make the claim that the Soreang's geological setting fits the Lihir model.
<P>
Probably under pressure from the TSE Goldstake provided a more detailed news release on September 18 that mainly regurgitated previous data reported last December about the property's "massive epithermal sulphide" bodies (ie high grade polymetallic stringers and veinlets). Goldstake revealed that the only results it had were four chip samples taken randomly from "unmapped" old trenches and mine workings along strike from the Ann and Joy Zones. This is not a new property. It was worked during the eighties by an Australian company called Pelsart, and at one time was under option by Andrew Milligan's Camino Resources. Based on the vague information so far produced, this recycled Java prospect is hardly deserving of the $100 million market cap based on 30 million or so fully diluted shares. Incidentally, Goldstake has yet to report that any of the private placement financings announced earlier this year have actually closed. This stock is a trading opportunity for speculators who think they are good at playing the greater fool game. For the rest of us it should be sold or avoided.

<A NAME="Ma"><b> Mansfield Minerals Inc</b>(MDR-V: $8.80)  Investors who have been betting that the company's Cerro Samenta copper prospect in Argentina's Salta province may turn out to be a multi-billion dollar clone of the La Escondida deposit 100 km to the west in Chile (2.2 billion tonnes 1.6% copper) received a rude shock on August 27 when Bob Bishop issued Fax Alert #61. The night before <b>Corriente Resources Inc</b> (CTQ-T: $4.40) had announced the staking acquisition of 60,000 ha adjacent to Mansfield's Cerro Samenta property. What caught Bishop's attention was an option to acquire 100% of 6,000 ha from a private party for 2 million shares and US $1,350,000 cash in stages. A payment of $150,000 was due September 4, with anything further "subject to confirmation of satisfactory claim title". Beyond a statement that these claims cover an "area of known porphyry copper mineralization" there was nothing in the release to indicate that it was something special. But after talking to both Corrien! te and Mansfield Bishop concluded that Mansfield's "Escondida" lookalike prospect was actually owned by a local prospector who had optioned it to Corriente. In other words, Corriente was a buy because it had latched onto title to what had been touted by Mansfield and Teck as a major copper discovery, and Mansfield, whose price already implied a project valuation of $400 million for Cerro Samenta, was a sell because it probably lacked title to the grassroots discovery the Leask brothers had made as a result of the regional exploration program initiated in 1994. Bishop's Fax Alert caused Mansfield to plunge before the VSE halted trading and forced Mansfield to make a release on the property dispute. In Kaiser Express 96-8 I suggested that Mansfield could emerge as another major success story for the Canadian juniors, though I felt that the stock's price was ahead of the facts, which consisted of two large geophysical anomalies, a copper-porphyry geological setting, some high grade s! urface samples, and undisclosed trench values. Mansfield was featured as a $0.50-0.75 bottom-fish in the Nov-Dec 94 issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, and to those individuals who still held a position I suggested that they hang on for a homerun. This new property dispute, however, requires me to reassess the wisdom of hanging onto Mansfield.
<P>
I have talked to Mansfield's Gordon and John Leask as well as Corriente's Ken Shannon. I was unable to obtain an articulate description from Ken Shannon about the dispute, and came away with the impression that the Samenta option is somebody else's idea. As of July Corriente management owned only 738,000 shares (Shannon = 604,000) out of 19.6 million fully diluted shares, plus options on a further 980,000 shares. There are no 10% or bigger shareholders. Last March Corriente completed a private placement of 3 million units at $3.50 brokered by James Capel and First Marathon. My guess is that it was not Ken Shannon, whose strength lies in the technical arena, who talked this financing into existence. While mineral exploration is a dog-eat-dog business, it is out of character for a straight-shooter like Shannon to embark on a deposit snatch campaign without having an intimate understanding of the case, or, if he does, be unwilling to convey it. I don't know from whom Bob Bisho! p got his version, and why at this stage he sides so heavily with Corriente, but the details he has presented collide seriously with the version I obtained from the Leask brothers. Truth lies in the coherence of details, and the most detailed side of the story has come from the Leask brothers, though I must confess that I found their sketchiness on certain names and dates perturbing. I am not convinced that I have the full story, but I do believe the presentation below accurately depicts the story as told to me by the Leask brothers. Since I cannot verify any part of it, acceptance will have to be based on a judgement about the integrity of the Leask brothers. At the very least, I hope it will coax greater details from both sides of the dispute so that investors can intelligently take sides.
<P>
According to Mansfield's John Leask, the Cerro Samenta property was discovered late 1994 when the exploration crew found copper exotica float while walking a road cut in Argentina's Salta province. Upon further investigation Mansfield discovered porphyry style copper mineralization in two areas now known as the North and South Cerro Samenta properties. Mansfield checked out the title status, discovered that the area covered by the North Cerro Samenta showing was open, and made successful cateo application in November 1994. Mansfield noted that the South Cerro Samenta area was covered by a claim held by an individual whose identity Leask could not recall off the top of his head (personally, if I were in his shoes and possibly standing on a multi-billion dollar Escondida lookalike, such details would be etched into my memory). Mansfield also noticed that the government map showed a cateo applied for in February 1994 by a Jorge Darocca directly on top of the South Cerro Sament! a area. Mansfield checked out the coordinates and discovered that the map location of Darocca's cateo was inconsistent with the cateo's documented description. An official informed them that the claim location maps were notoriously unreliable. In any case, and this is a key aspect of Mansfield's claim that Corriente has zero chance of securing title to South Cerro Samenta, the ground to which Darocca supposedly laid claim in February 1994 was at that time controlled by a valid cateo held by a third party (the Mystery Man) and thus was not available. The Leasks decided to monitor the status of the underlying cateo, which apparently was cancelled in late 1995. Mansfield promptly applied for a cateo to cover the South Cerro Samenta area. This waiting game appears to be a key reason why Mansfield's enthusiasm for Cerro Samenta was muted until early 1996. According to the Leasks Darocca did not start kicking up a fuss until July 1996 when he connected with a North American predator who!  specializes in claim disputes. This group, whose desire to keep its identity secret the Leasks inexplicably feel obliged to respect, did its due diligence and apparently concluded that Darocca's claim was a non-starter. Once it became clear that Darocca was determined to pursue his claim, arrangements were made for a government survey to establish the actual claim locations. Because Mansfield had verified its claim location with GPS coordinates, there was no question that Mansfield's South Cerro Samenta claim was properly located. Darocca, however, did not use GPS to verify his coordinates. The government official's unofficial interpretation of the reference points used by Darocca placed his claim at best within 700 metres of Mansfield's South Cerro Samenta, and at worst 4.6 km away. In this respect Bishop's Fax Alert has the problem backwards: it is the reference points for Darocca's cateo that are in question, not those for Mansfield. Nobody disputes that Darocca's cateo is valid. The dispute boils down to the actual physical coordinates of the cateo. Darocca appears to believe that the map defines the location, but apparently it is the written description that defines the location. At this stage the  "judge's" decision is not yet official, but the innuendo has already been floated by the Corriente camp that the decision was fixed in the Argentine tradition of corruption. For Corriente to win control of South Cerro Samenta via its option on Darocca's 6,000 ha cateo, at least two things have to be established: one, Darocca's cateo actually covers the area of South Cerro Samenta, and, two, this ground was open when Darocca made application for a cateo. Unfortunately, and I find this quite annoying, neither Mansfield nor Corriente is willing or able to provide claim maps depicting their respective perceptions of reality.<BR><BR>
<P>
One conclusion I can draw at this stage is that even if Darocca's version of his claim location turns out to be correct, it apparently covers only the South Samenta anomaly. The property has two IP high, Mag low, resistivity anomalies. The North Samenta has dimensions of about 1 km by 1.6 km, with an exposed window of supergene chalcocite mineralization at the southern end. Trench samples from this area were sent in for assaying in mid-May. The second anomaly has a similar intensity with dimensions of 1 km by 2 km, located 4 km to the south of the North Samenta anomaly. This area has a known copper showing which may have been the target of Darocca's staking effort in early 1994. The geological model is that the Cerro Samenta hosts two possibly connected copper porphyry systems that have extensively leached caps. The theory is that the leaching process led to supergene enrichment below the low grade leach cap (ie the initial chalcopyrite copper mineralization was dissolved b! y percolating water and precipitated out as chalcocite at a deeper level), and the hope is that Cerro Samenta hosts a thick blanket of high grade chalcocite similar to that at Escondida, whose thickest section ran 250 metres of 3% copper. If the IP anomalies represent thick, high grade copper mineralization, and Darocca's cateo is verified in Corriente's favour, then Mansfield would end up with the northern half and Corriente with the southern half. In other words, the worst case scenario for Mansfield does not leave Mansfield and Teck (earning 60%) out of the picture.
<P>
On August 30 Mansfield finally released assays for the 11 trenches sampled earlier this year. 8 trenches were barren because they exposed the copper-depleted leached capping. Trenches 98E and 100N, which are perpendicular to each other, cut the "potassic core" and averaged 123 m of 0.51% copper and 93 m of 0.47% copper respectively. This mineralization, whose grade is probably subeconomic, is not the target. Trench 93N yielded 48 m of 0.45% copper, which represents an average of both leached capping and supergene enrichment. Grades for 3 metre intervals reached as high as 1.6% copper where supergene material was present. The trench results look disappointing, but at this stage they are meaningless. What Cerro Samenta needs is drill holes that establish the presence of a chalcocite blanket with a meaningful thickness grading 1% or higher copper. A drilling program is expected to begin in mid-September. In the case of drilling the Escondida prospect in 1981, significant miner! alization was not hit until the sixth hole. Given the high expectations already built into Mansfield's price, a market that has already become leery about Teck's tortoise-like assaying and results releasing policies, and the title uncertainty that clouds at least part of the Cerro Samenta prospect, it is my view that profit-taking above the $5 level would be a prudent strategy. As for Corriente, if the "judge" makes his survey interpretation official, which reportedly favours Mansfield, it will require lengthy litigation to establish title. Because of the deal Corriente cut with Darocca, its only exposure will be the $150,000 payment and direct legal costs. Because Corriente does not have any other prospects that obviously justify the $80-100 million market cap the stock is presently sporting, I expect Corriente to pursue this issue indefinitely to keep shareholders from unloading Corriente in favour of cheaper Latin American alternatives. Until a much clearer picture emerges about the legal potential of Corriente's Darocca option, shareholders should use the current market strength to lighten up on Corriente.

<A NAME="Hi"><font size=+1> <b>Highwood:</b> chronic beryllium disease lawsuits spell trouble for Brush Wellman</font size>
<P>
Readers of the August 25 New York Times may have noted an article by Barry Meier entitled "The Dark Side of a Magical Metal" which spanned nearly two full pages. The focus of the article was chronic beryllium disease, a respiratory ailment caused by exposure to airborne beryllium particles. Beryllium is the specialty metal that <b>Highwood Resources Ltd</b> (HWD-T: $1.14, HIWDF-NASDAQ) hopes to bring into production. The merger between Mountain Minerals and Highwood has been completed and has put Royal Oak in firm control of the Thor Lake beryllium deposit. The NYT article is relevant to Highwood because its target is <b>Brush Wellman Inc</b> (BW-N: $19, 15.9 million issued), the world's largest producer of pure beryllium and beryllium alloys with sales of $370 million in 1995. Exposure to beryllium is harmless except for about 1-5% of the population which has an immunological vulnerability to beryllium believed to have a genetic root. In 1949 the United States established a maximum work! place standard of 2 micrograms per cubic metre on which Brush Wellman has leaned heavily ever since. Actual cases of CBD have been treated as caused by exposure through accident or negligence. But by the mid-eighties evidence had begun to emerge that factory employees such as secretaries who never came physicially in contact with beryllium nevertheless had developed beryllium sensitivity and in some cases come down with CBD. Sensitivity to beryllium causes scar tissue to build up in the lungs that reduces the ability to absorb oxygen and eventually kills the victim. The NYT article featured a picture of three victims with tubes up their noses permanently attached to oxygen tanks. By 1990 Brush Wellman was aware that the federal standard may be inadequate. Since then victims have launched a spate of lawsuits claiming compensation. The official party line is that the resolution of these cases will have no material affect on the company. Indeed, a class action suit filed April 2, 1996 was dismissed on July 12, 1996, though the time limit for filing an appeal has not expired. However, the thrust of the NYT article was that Brush Wellman ignored the warning signs and may not escape substantial liability claims. My interpretation of the situation is that the potential for ballooning CBD compensation claims is not going to go away. In a worst case scenario Brush Wellman may find itself in financial jeopardy, a development that would help break its dominant grip on the beryllium marke! t. But even if this does not happen overnight, the liability threat may soften up the vicious circle that has prevented alternative beryllium producers from breaking into the market. That vicious circle is the reluctance of industrial users to sign supply contracts with would-be producers for fear that failure of the alternative production to come on stream could leave the user stranded without a secure supply of beryllium. The inability to secure purchase commitments, not economic feasibility, was the reason Hecla decided in 1990 not to proceed with development of Thor Lake. To some degree Brush Wellman's control of the market is already under siege, as indicated by an anti-dumping complaint it filed against a Kazakhstan producer. Against this backdrop of offshore production and Brush Wellman's contingent liability problems, industrial users will likely be less afraid to offend Brush Wellman by entertaining purchase commitments for beryllium from new potential producers like High! wood. Highwood recently visited the Thor Lake property and has initiated permitting for removal of a bulk sample presently stored on the site. Highwood plans to use the sample for metallurgical testing and marketing. Should we be worried about the CBD liability risk the Thor Lake deposit may pose for Highwood? Not really. Genetic screening can identify most individuals who should never be near the stuff. As for airborne exposure, tougher standards will be developed and implemented. For litigation to be successful against Brush Wellman, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Brush Wellman suppressed information and knowledge that the federal standards were inadequate. Success will hinge on legal theories about the extent of Wellman's obligation to investigate the inadequacy of federal standards, and during the course of such investigations to warn employees that they may have a serious CBD risk even though all health and safety standards are being met.
<P>
Highwood has 18.1 million (20.1 million fully diluted) shares issued. The sloppiness in the market is typical of a merger where shareholders of one of the companies suffered a rollback. Between now and the end of the year I expect the stock to creep towards $2. Management will not promote the Thor Lake story until it has reached a deal with owners of a 30% reversion right. If Thor Lake is not in production by 2000, which it definitely will not be,  a 30% working interest reverts to a pair of offshore investors who funded Highwood during its early days. Since this group is not interested in contributing costs, and is a sizable shareholder in Highwood, a deal which leaves them with some sort of carried interest and assures fast-track development is a sensible course. Once such a deal is announced, we can expect Highwood to acquire a much higher profile. Highwood now has a solid base as an industrial minerals producer, a beachhead in China where it is exploring various rare ea! rth and specialty metal opportunities, the flagship beryllium Thor Lake deposit, and the 100% owned Ilimaussaq yttrium deposit in Greenland it also plans to develop. This Nasdaq-listed package is bound to be an easy sell; subscribers of the Premium Kaiser Express should take a serious look at Highwood before it rises onto the radar screen of American brokers.

<A NAME="Vo"><font size=+1><b>Voisey's Bay East:</b> stirring the pot with unsubstantiated rumours</font size>
<P>
<b>Columbia Yukon</b> (CYR-C: $1.00) and <b>Intl Canalaska</b> (ICA-V: $1.14) came to life Friday August 22 on rumours that Diamond Fields (Inco) had intersected massive sulphides at about a 600 metre depth only 500 metres from the Columbia Yukon boundary. Although this rumour generated plenty of buying activity, it could not be confirmed. At this stage all that can be said is that grid lines for geophysical surveys have been cut right to the boundary. Columbia Yukon hopes to have permits in hand shortly to begin drilling a 3,000 ft hole in mid-September. Because of the recent interest by the likes of Falconbridge and Inco in optioning ground to the east of the main Voisey's Bay block, intense curiousity has developed about what the rocks do in the third dimension. This first of six proposed holes by Columbia Yukon will be watched very closely, not for broad intersections of massive sulphides, but for geological variety revealing that a lot more is going on at depth to the east than the older anorthosites on surface might suggest. If the drill logs showed the presence of gneisses and troctolite at depth, speculation would build rapidly about how far eastwards the Eastern Deeps nickel-copper ore does extend. That explains the market's strong response to the "500-metres-from-the-boundary" rumour. While Columbia Yukon indicates that potential suitors for the VBE-1 block appear to have gone away, rumours persist that <b>NDT Ventures</b> (NDE-V: $1.25) and <b>Lucero Res Corp</b> (LCR-V: $1.16) are wrangling with Inco on a farmout deal. By now no junior will do a deal with Inco that does not include an anti-inventory clause, typically in the form of no vesting of any interest unless the property is in commercial production by a certain date. If indeed a deal between Inco and Lucero/NDT does materialize over the next month or so, it would likely be a very aggressive one. For a while at least the notion that Inco was sandbagging the VBE-1 claims would send Columbia Yukon and Intl Canalaska soaring. However, there is another way to interpret an aggressive Inco deal. At best such a deal would secure Inco a 60% interest, less than the 75:25 split of the Voisey's Bay ore it shares with Voisey's Bay Nickel Co. Inco has enough nickel ore to do serious damage to the nickel market. Without a doubt it will do its best to squeeze its competitors by flooding the market with low-cost Ovoid ore, thought not to such an extreme as to render its other nickel operations hopelessly sub-economic. Any scenario which forces Inco to replace Ovoid ore with more expensive ore from another property would be contrary to Inco's interest. But this scenario would still be preferable to one where a competitor gets hold of Voisey's Bay East ore and cranks it into production at ma! ximum throughput. An aggressive deal need not mean that Inco is convinced that the Eastern Deeps extends beyond the main DFR block. Inco may think that there is probably nothing on this ground, but as a form of insurance it is tying up the ground long enough to rule out the remote possibility that high grade ore is present. In other words, Inco views the "need" to get vested as only a small risk, which it nevertheless must take on. This subtlety, however, will be lost on most investors, who will greet such a deal as a powerful endorsement of the Voisey's Bay East hypothesis. Columbia Yukon would be the primary beneficiary, because its right to earn 70% by carrying the property to production makes it the obvious takeover target if ore was found on the VBE-1 claim. Over the next eight weeks Columbia Yukon will emerge as a hot trader, especially if initial drilling on VBE-1 demonstrates that this area has very interesting geological potential for nickel-copper ore, either in the form!  of mineralization hosted by basal remnants of a magma chamber or feeder dyke extensions. The best way to play Voisey's Bay East is to tuck away cash-rich Lucero for the long haul, and buy Columbia Yukon as a short-term speculation. At current prices the market isn't putting too much Voisey's Bay faith in Lucero, so the damage from a flop is minimal. In the case of Columbia Yukon, the downside risk is serious, but the upside leverage is exceptional. Both stocks are strong contenders to at least double before the end of the year. Contrarians might take a look at NDT, which is finally in a price range where the leverage is reasonable. NDT has sufficient working capital to generate fresh news on other fronts, or tag along in the Staghorn lake area if the Cdn States/Cartaway drilling lucks into some significant massive sulphides. NDT can easily bounce back from its current oversold position and yield a double.

<b>Brief updates on other fronts</b>
<P>
Wedge drilling by <b>Cons Callinan Flin-Flon</b> (CFF-V: $2.35) is closing in on another down-hole geophysics target the company expects to hit by the end of the first week of September. We are still looking for 20 metre plus intersections of high grade copper. With <b>Fancamp Resources Inc</b> (FNM-V: $1.47) on the rise, <b>Freewest Resources Canada</b> (FWR-TM: $1.14) looks like a smart buy, especially in view of a recent announcement that it has staked a new copper-nickel-cobalt prospect in Quebec 275 km northeast of Chibougamau. High grade copper-nickel-cobalt showings were discovered through followup prospecting of geophysical anomalies identified within a 40 km by 5 km corridor of layered anorthosite.<b> Arizona Star</b> (AZS-V: $12.85) and <b>Bema Gold</b> (BGO-T: $10.50) have enjoyed a good run thanks to further results from the Cerro Casale copper-gold porphyry deposit in northern Chile. However, the copper grade is low, as is the gold grade outside the high grade breccia zone. I have not had a chanc! e yet to look at results in detail, but it strikes me that building ounces out of 0.2-0.3% copper and 0.01-0.03 opt gold mineralization and applying the $50/oz valuation yardstick may be inappropriate. Profit-taking is advisable, though keep in mind that we may be on the threshold of a mania where major mining companies are taking over juniors with increasingly aggressive logic (ie Barrick's takeover of Arequipa).

In recent weeks I have frequently heard two notions that I believe are dead wrong. One is that a major senior market setback never happens during a US election year, and the other is that the Canadian juniors will enjoy a September rally once the summer doldrums are behind us. I do not believe speculative juniors have any chance of a broad-based revival until New York's Dow Jones index has settled into the 4600-4800 range, and while I cannot predict how swiftly and when this breakdown will happen, I am convinced it will happen before the election. On the assumption that New York will find solid support in the 4600-4800 range, a breakdown below which signals a long term general bear and a terminal prognosis for speculative markets, I think this year August-October will turn out to be prime bottom-fishing season, with a strong spec market rally breaking out in November and carrying into the new year with a boom that may make the first half of 1996 appear like a warmup exercise.<BR>
<P>
While we may credit the likes of Timbuktu and Cartaway with triggering the evaporation of the bull market in speculative juniors, the real culprit keeping speculators on the sidelines is not loss of confidence in the Canadian exploration initiative, but rather anxiety about the fate of the senior equity bull market. The pullback in NASDAQ stocks parallels the Canadian spec market, and has nothing to do with the reasons given for the Canadian bear market. Net mutual fund inflows during the first half of 1996 exceeded the total for 1995, but have now turned negative. The warnings about a major correction are now too obvious to miss, and the cassandras prophecizing an all out redemption run fueled crash are no longer dismissed as a lunatic fringe. From a speculator's viewpoint the prospect of a market meltdown is akin to a sword dangling precariously from a hook on the wall. If your head is exposed and the sword falls, your head will be lopped off.
Count on the September Rally to be a no-show.
<P>	
Last year's Voisey's Bay driven spec market was interrupted by a similar fear I labelled downdraft anxiety. Last year, however, we were treated to a September rally, an annually predicted event that only occasionally materializes. The September rally theory is premised on the idea that brokers and investors go on holiday during the summer while the juniors head into the field to conduct work programs. The absence of results and market interest is explained as the summer doldrums. When people go back to work in September and results start to flow, market activity is supposed to rekindle. The problem with the Canadian exploration juniors is that the seasonal half-full to half-empty cycle is a very powerful pattern. By definition a September rally is shortlived. The cups must be emptied before they can be refilled to the half-way mark for the next year's cycle. Anticipation of this psychological necessity inevitably turns the "September Rally" into a selling binge. In years where everybody has their pink tickets ready for the September Rally, it turns into a no-show. This year's September Rally is shaping up to be a no-show because the junior spec market did not crash, but simply disappeared. The bids disappeared so quickly everybody was hung before they knew it. Daily volume on the VSE has dropped below 20 million shares and brokers are grumbling about how dead things are. At today's close of 1104 the VSE Composite Index is still up 39% for the year, but we might as well accept that it will not take much for the VSE to be back in the bottom-fishing range of 750-800. The lack of liquidity has kept the Canadian juniors from collapsing, but this is an illusion that a senior market meltdown would shatter as it prompts investors to seek liquidity at any price. Speculators are now in the mode of waiting patiently for bids to reappear which they can fill.<BR>
<P>
What the Canadian juniors need is the sword off the wall and on the floor. This is where the supposed election year sanctity of the stock market becomes troublesome, for if true, we speculators are in for a long bear market. There seem to be two reasons why Americans have great faith the market will not crash during an election year. One is the empirical observation that it has never done so and thus never will, and the other is that the President is so powerful he can actually control the stock market's behaviour. Both reasons are nonsense. The stock market is an organism that not only responds to external stimuli, but also generates stimuli that spawn feedback loops with potentially chaotic outcomes. It is precisely because the market is conscious of its own patterns, some of which are at odds with the market's interest and thus undesirable, that the market's behaviour can become unpredictable. When the market achieves a high degree of self-consciousness, as it now has, even the contrarians have to throw up their hands in despair. This year we have witnessed a struggle between the market's awareness of being over-valued and the belief that it will not respond negatively to this condition until after the presidential election. However, once the election has happened this struggle no longer exists, and unless the market no longer feels itself over-valued by conventional yardsticks, the market should be expected to head downwards big time. Because the market is well aware of this destiny, it will discount this outcome well before its time has arrived. This is the sword speculators have been anxiously eyeing for several months now.<BR>
<P>	
What makes the sword so troubling is the concern that a market correction may spiral out of control into a vicious circle of asset deflation and corresponding recessionary economic behaviour. If New York breaks below 4600 the next stop is 4000, by which time speculation in Canadian exploration juniors will be a vague memory. A rapid move to 4600, however, will likely mobilize the central bank to inject liquidity by slashing interest rates and re-establishing stability. The US Fed has indicated that it believes the strength of the US economy is attributable to the undue economic confidence the equity bull market has instilled among investors. During the eighties consumers spent on the basis of inflated real estate values. During the nineties they are spending on the basis of inflated investment portfolios. Greenspan's agenda is likely to cool down investment growth as an engine of inflationary economic growth, not destroy it. If during the next three months we see a rapid decline in the Dow to the 4600-4800 level accompanied by a successful stabilization effort, it will translate into the turning point for speculative Canadian juniors. If this happens before the election, then no matter who is president, 1997 will see a resumption of the long run equity uptrend. The next president, barring a tragedy, will usher in the next millenium. We should not overlook the psychological impact the millenium countdown could have for both the stock market and economy, on a global scale. Resource stocks have not yet had their day in the sun.
<P>
The collapse of copper and the return of gold to its trading rut have tempered enthusiasm for resource exploration plays, but these are short term developments of relevance only to producers and near-producers. The importance of the Canadian exploration juniors is that they find valuable new orebodies. In addition to the world-class success stories of Diamond Fields, Bre-X, and Dia Met, we now can add Arequipa Resources. While Arequipa's Pierina deposit in Peru is not yet a proven world-class orebody, Barrick's $27 per share cash takeover bid certainly is world-class. The $915 million bid is an aggressive move by Barrick I hope is not driven by the same jilted bride thinking that moved Placer Dome to buy out Mt Milligan after failing to lock up Eskay Creek through its bid for Stikine. Barrick is rumoured to have snubbed Bre-X during its early days, and to have been in turn snubbed by Bre-X when it later informally offered 5-6 Barrick shares for 1 pre-split Bre-X share.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Ba"><font size=+1>Barrick's Takeover Bid for Arequipa another feather in the Canadian junior cap</font size>
<P>
Since it is unlikely another gold major will slug it out with Barrick for the right to find the missing root of the decapitated Pierina deposit, the takeover bid will likely be accepted. I suspect that the only reason Arequipa has not yet publicly embraced the $27 offer is because certain shareholders would prefer the option of a tax free rollover into Barrick stock. The one ploy Arequipa may pursue is to convince Barrick to allow Pierina to be separated from the rest of the property portfolio assembled by David Lowell, such as Mac Watson did with Freewest and Harker-Holloway. I suspect, however, that Barrick is paying the big premium for the whole works, not just Pierina. If so, it will signal how important the Canadian junior exploration effort has become in the eyes of the majors. This will not be a case of a major having to buy out a $5 billion nickel-copper deposit from a junior which had the good luck of listening to an accountant who argued it would look better if a US $88,000 option payment was made just before year end so that a $500,000 exploration expenditure could remain on the books. It would be a tribute to the ingenuity and agility of juniors in assembling prospects in third world frontiers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Br"><font size=+1>Brace yourself for a flood of special warrant conversions</font size>
<P>	
The Canadian junior spec market is presently suffering from a severe lack of liquidity that I fear will not be remedied before the last quarter. Until the senior market sword has clanged harmlessly to the floor, I recommend  a defensive strategy of selling both winners and losers while keeping stocks with limited downside and projects that won't be made or broken until next year. I expect at least one more major downward lurch in the juniors coinciding with a further senior market decline before a true bottom is created. A bottom in September and October followed by a rally in November would be a deviation from the typical pattern, and certainly inconvenient for my upcoming November-December 1996 Bottom-Fish List. Speculators should be preparing their own bottom-fish wish lists right now and be ready to start accumulating them as their downtrending chart patterns bottom out into troughs. In particular they should watch well-financed and still expensive juniors who loaded their treasuries during the first half with special warrant financings. Many of these stocks have tiers of cheaper private placements that are now coming free trading, and, in the style of Essex, we can expect this paper to drive prices lower before the institutions get their special warrants converted. It appears that institutional investors have to carry their special warrants at cost until they are converted to free trading paper through the receipting of a qualifying prospectus. That was a curse during the uptrend when the mutual fund's NAV was not permitted to show paper profits, but is a blessing as stock prices head underwater. However, now that the spec market is bearish and mutual fund holders are turning cranky, you can bet that fund managers will be eager to get losing positions off the books before anybody notices and starts asking the manager about what possessed them to buy this stock at that price. While the managements of junior companies are generally not anxious to speed the prospectus along, they now have reason to get the job done and the sell-offs over with while there is still a crummy bear market to blame for the lack of liquidity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Ne"><font size=+1>Nearly $10 billion frozen in limbo, waiting to be unleashed by the last quarter</font size>
<P>	
There are a couple other reasons for my forecast that the spec market is due for a rally in the last quarter when it would normally be under pressure from tax-loss selling and the empty cup blues. The current slump is giving investors plenty of time to generate losses to match their profits. The quest for offsetting losses will help stocks lower during the next few months. Consider also that between Diamond Fields, Bre-X and Arequipa there is about $10 billion in new hard wealth that is sort of frozen. The Diamond Fields/Inco merger is on hold until at least August 31 pending resolution of the Exdiam lawsuit. Inco's Mike Sopke, ridiculed for being outwitted by Friedland, has had the last laugh as he watches Friedland twist in the wind. Under the pretense that a Texas lawsuit might actually succeed in its claim that everything anybody ever did for Diamond Fields was really for the benefit of Exdiam Corp, in which Jean Boulle's family has a 23.5% interest, and not for the benefit of Diamond Fields shareholders, Inco has refused to close its merger with Diamond Fields. To ensure its dominant role in the world nickel market Inco is paying a 200-300% strategic premium for Voisey's Bay. The longer control of Voisey's Bay stays out of anybody else's hands without Inco having to pay anything, the better off is Inco. Even in a worst case scenario where a Texas jury awarded Voisey's Bay to Exdiam, Inco has nothing to worry about because it is unlikely the Canadian government, smarting over the imperialistic ambitions of the Helms-Burton anti-Cuba law, would allow a Canadian deposit scooped by a US court to be turned into a cash cow that would destroy a Canadian icon like Inco. The Exdiam legal dispute has escalated into a battle of titanic egos that is beyond an out-of-court settlement. When it becomes apparent that the Exdiam lawyers cannot extract a payoff to go away, they will likely drop the Voisey's Bay deposit ownership claim from the suit and concentrate on winning some or all of the paper Boulle and Friedland own. While just about everybody's hackles are raised by Exdiam's broader claim, only a handful care about the outcome of a dispute between Friedland/Boulle and Exdiam. How much beyond August 31 Inco can stall the merger is unclear, especially since Falconbridge has recently rattled its chains to indicate that it is still interested in acquiring Voisey's Bay. But I am confident the Exdiam litigators will pave the way enabling the merger to close.<BR>

I expect Diamond Fields shareholders to get liquidity by the last quarter of 1996. By then Bre-X may also have entered an arrangement which gives Bre-X shareholders security that the entire value of their investment is not at risk of going up in smoke thanks to a political conflagration in Indonesia. The Arequipa deal will also have put nearly $1 billion into the jeans of shareholders, many of whom will be Canadian residents with a sudden need for flow-thru deductions. All this liquidity could arrive on the scene just when the Canadian juniors are breaking out of a bottom. Assuming the US Fed's stock market tinkering doesn't wreck both the economy and the market, the stage will have been set for an extraordinary year in 1997. Meanwhile, all we can do is wait and keep are powder dry.

<A NAME="Te"><font size=+1>Teuton & Minvita: keeping a lid on the Clone Project</font size>
<P>	
One of the nice things about bear markets is that market activity tends to be driven by results, not trends. It is much easier to spot unusual activity possibly indicative of good news leaking out. Several weeks ago Teuton Resources Corp (TUO-V: $2.40) and Minvita Enterprises (MVE-V: $2.35) spiked up at a time when most of the market was hurrying south. It looked very much like excited drill crew coming out of the bush hoping to make a quick buck but oblivious to the fact that the wind was blowing the wrong way. The stocks pulled back but stabilized and did not develop the downtrend characteristic of this market. A news release on July 19 indicated that 28 holes comprising 12,000 ft had been drilled, of which 5,000 ft was at the lab for assaying. The release was prompted by a bizarre Navarre release reporting that "rumours of...GOBS OF GOLD are to be heard in the bars, cafe's, in the grocery stores and at the gas stations all over town (Stewart)". Teuton's Dino "the Clam" Cremonese was not very helpful beyond saying that 7% shareholder Homestake was happy. While it is likely that visible gold was intersected at the Clone Project, the real story here is zone structure, with the assays of almost secondary significance when they eventually arrive. I think the Clone project will be a big newsmaker during the next four months and suggest that it would be a good idea to nibble at the stocks below $2.50, with preference, subject to liquidity, given to Minvita.

<A NAME="Fa"><font size=+1>Fancamp & Freewest: Probing the Great Red Spot</font size>
<P>
Fancamp Resources Ltd (FNM-V: $1.25) and. Freewest Resources Canada (FWR-T: $1.10) have completed airborne magnetic surveys over 370 km of the Kalahari Suture Zone in Botswana. According to Fancamp's Peter Smith much of the KSZ has been interpreted to have a 200-400 metre cover of sediments and Kalahari Sands, not as shallow as we might have wished, but certainly not as deep as Smith might have feared. MPH's analysis has identified numerous targets interpreted as potential ultramafic intrusives or carbonatites, confirming the theory of Bob Mason and Peter Smith that the KSZ represents perhaps the greatest untested mineral frontier in the deposit rich continent of Africa. Fancamp's Botswana Elephant Hunt may turn out to be the coup of the next century. Beyond speculative geophysical interpretation the only exploration tool is drilling, and because of the sheer quantity of targets and expense of prospecting with a drill, Fancamp and Freewest plan to carve the KSZ into segments and farm out exploration to majors and possibly other juniors. One phenomenal target on the 50:50 Fancamp/Freewest Central Block that consists of an intense 10 by 13 km magnetic feature will not be farmed out. Dubbed the "Great Red Spot", this target sits at the juncture of the KSZ and the Zambezi Rift, a prime location for a layered intrusive complex. The target happens to straddle the boundary of a claim block acquired by Falconbridge last year after it spent six weeks reviewing data Fancamp supplied supporting the theory that the KSZ may be highly prospective for base metal deposits. Readers of the January-February 1996 issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report may recall that Falconbridge considered this a brilliant idea it intended to pursue for its own account, though it did ungenerously offer Fancamp the opportunity to earn an interest in any ground Falconbridge would acquire by assuming the exploration funding burden. As it turned out, thanks to Mac Watson's Freewest poor Smith and Fancamp weren't as down and out as Falconbridge may have thought. They managed to scoop most of the KSZ before Falconbridge made its move, and would have acquired the two blocks Falconbridge did get if it hadn't been for a misunderstanding about the availability of this ground. The Great Red Spot may be just a big blob of iron, or it could be a monster deposit that puts Voisey's Bay to shame. Fancamp and Freewest plan to drill several deep geological holes into this target before yearend in an effort to obtain a better understanding of the underlying formation. Because of the anomaly's size investors should not hold their breath in expectation of a discovery hole into the guts of an orebody. Just a bit of base, precious or platinum metals smoke will be sufficient to drive speculators and the majors wild. In light of the airborne magnetic survey results I am very optimistic that eventually Fancamp and Freewest will make a major discovery in the KSZ. However, it may take years to make or break this story. At this stage every speculator should make an effort to have at least some exposure to the KSZ play either through Fancamp or Freewest, and then hope that these stocks go down in price. A rule of thumb for the current market is to buy or hold only stocks you wish would go down so that you can own more at a cheaper price. The only juniors which qualify for this strategy are those whose medium term work programs are funded, whose story is not at risk of being destroyed by near term results, and which have the potential to become very expensive overnight thanks to the arrival of results or a highly receptive audience. In the case of the Botswana elephant hunt, it is worth noting that Fancamp and Freewest have yet to benefit from investors who have cashed in their Diamond Fields chips for solid Inco paper.  I see no urge to chase either Fancamp or Freewest above $1.30, and will be personally hoping the stocks drift down to the $0.60-0.70 level between now and the end of the year.

<a name="Ge"><font size=+1>Gerle Gold: pipes, come out from wherever you are!</font size>
<P>	
Investors have not taken kindly to the failure of Gerle Gold Ltd (GGL-V: $1.35) to intersect kimberlite this summer. On June 26 Gerle announced that it had killed 32 out of 40 priority geophysical targets by drilling or surface inspection. The market, thinking that Gerle was moving from high priority to low priority targets, was not happy. What many investors did not appreciate is that because kimberlite is softer than the country rock in the Slave Craton, glaciers will have preferentially gouged out the kimberlite to form holes that show up as lakes or swampy depressions in the NWT. Land-based geophysical targets thus have a lower probability of being kimberlite. So why did Gerle start picking off land-based targets instead of angle drilling lake targets? By the time Gerle mobilized in May, the ice was too soft for ski-equipped planes to transport a heavy diamond drill. So Monopros told Gerle to fly in a lighter reverse circulation drill and, instead of having the crew twi!
 ddle its thumbs, dispatch the crew on what amounted to a condemnation campaign. I interpret this decision as a sign of how serious Monopros is about Gerle's Doyle Lake project. By July the lakes in the NWT were free of ice and Gerle was able to fly in a diamond drill rig using a float equipped plane. Gerle has not revealed how many lake targets it has angle drilled and what degree of success it has obtained. Reading between the lines I suspect Gerle has come up empty. So from where do the indicator minerals come from? It may be that the geophysical techniques so far applied are irrelevant. Gerle has indicated it is still experimenting with different geophysical approaches. It also appears that Monopros is pursuing a strategy of ever more closely spaced sampling in an effort to pinpoint threads and their terminals within the overall paintbrush-like swath. In the end Gerle may have to drill fences until it hits kimberlite. If this is the case and there are pipes on the property, it is only a matter of time before a discovery is made. However, the not so pleasant scenario that has started to haunt me is the possibility that small dykes may have shed the indicator minerals on Gerle's property. A diamond studded dyke is not likely to be regarded by Monopros as an economic resource. What I don't know is whether small dykes can shed the sort of train Gerle has identified. Until we hear Gerle has explained its indicator minerals through a series of small dykes, there is still hope for an overnight breakthrough. The cup is certainly half-empty for Gerle and seems on an unveering course towards emptiness. At this stage all I can say is hold your positions and hope the stock's price gets real cheap so that we can load up just before the stock gets halted.

A delayed reaction to the Cartaway and Timbuktu disasters slammed the Canadian juniors in early June. The chart pattern for the VSE index and virtually every active junior turned into a cliff-hanger as the seller's strike broke and buyers went on strike. The fallout from these examples of speculative frenzy completely out of control combined with two other serious trend reversals. Copper, whose recent volatility and inexplicable price strength during the past year had confounded metals analysts, broke down when it was revealed that a Sumitomo trader had racked up $1.8 billion in losses and a hoard of copper inventory in an apparent scheme to manipulate the copper market. Gold also broke down below $390 when inflation data showed that inflationary pressure was not yet apparent in the US economy, which was clicking along very nicely in terms of job creation. Since the latter must inevitably give rise to inflation, the conclusion is that interest rates can only head higher, ma! king comparative equity and debt yields as well as bottom-lines poorer. Add to that the andecdotal stories about stock buying waiters and cabbies, "this time is different" and "long live equities" ballads, and the unchecked proliferation of Cartaway style debacles in the NASDAQ market, and you have a hurricane-of-the-century warning for the overall stock market. Because the Canadian junior stock market is a small world with widespread media coverage that ensures nobody misses the message, this sector has taken its reality check to heart early and scurried to the sidelines.<BR>
<P>
What do we do now? The answer is not obvious because the Canadian juniors are usually the last to crash. The speculation game for Canadian juniors is not over until we have a crash on a par with the October 1987 crash. In other words, it's not over until the senior market wails its death song. That song is not scheduled until late this year, though such events are notorious for their unscheduled arrival. Speculators have never successfully pre-empted their own demise. But they are now using the Canadian market's lull as an excuse to do nothing. The summer doldrums are around the corner, and who knows, New York may crash when everybody is on vacation.<BR>
<P>
If you are sitting on big winners like Diamond Fields, Bre-X and Arequipa, now is the time to take profits and use them to pay down mortgages, buy things you can enjoy, add up next April's tax liabilities, and put enough money aside in T-bills to take care of that problem. Then restructure what remains of your portfolio. The most optimistic outlook is that the senior market will demonstrate that the predictions of its imminent demise are completely wrong, even if the US Fed notches up its interest rates. As New York pushes toward 6,000, worries about a crash will subside (not necessarily with justification), and speculators will begin to chase after Canadian resource juniors once more, provided leadership emerges in this market. Right now the Canadian resource junior market is missing a positive trend. Most of the high-flyers have pulled back from their May highs, and now face a host of shareholders muttering: "when it gets back to where it was, I'll sell". The high flyers ! like Arequipa, Farallon and Valerie Gold still have bad risk-reward leverages and cannot head higher without stunning results except in the context of greater fool spirals. To get this chilled out market to warm up, the leadership must come from unexpected quarters.Arizona Star and Mansfield: tomorrow's market kick-starters?<BR><P>
Two examples of potential leaders are Arizona Star Resources Corp (AZS-V: $6.60) and Mansfield Minerals (MDR-V: $9.70). Arizona Star and 50:50 partner Bema Gold have discovered that a huge gold-enriched sulphide copper porphyry resource underlies the Cerro Casale deposit in the Maricunga District of northern Chile. Hole 19 graded 1,805 ft of 0.066 opt gold and 0.68% copper, including 794 ft of 0.123 opt gold and 1.14% copper within breccia, which in turn included a bonanza zone of 188 ft of 0.329 gold and 1.12% copper. Hole 18, 660 ft northeast of #19, intersected 1,037  ft of 0.027 opt gold and 0.12% copper in oxides, and then carried on 972 ft in sulphides that graded 0.024 opt gold and 0.4% copper. Previous drilling had concentrated on an oxide resource to a depth of about 800 ft where a 2 million ounce low grade gold resource had been established. 17 earlier holes had bottomed in copper-gold porphyry mineralization over an area of 2,600 ft by 1,150 ft. What the first tw! o deep holes, #18 and #19, now tell us is that a) Arizona Star has a gold-enriched copper porphyry deposit of the sort seen in the Philippines and Indonesia, and, b) the porphyry contains significant breccia zones that carry high gold grades. The presence of a large copper-gold sulphide resource (100-200 million tonnes) completely changes the focus for Arizona Star, whose oxide gold deposit looked like a marginal production situation. The oxide resource will have to be stripped to get at the sulphide resource, but instead of being a capital cost, it can pay for itself and more while the sulphide resource is developed. A 40,000 ft drill program is now underway to establish grade and tonnage for the sulphide resource. At 42 million fully diluted Arizona Star's $6.60 price implies a project cap of $550 million. Its parent, Bema Gold (BGO-T: $5.45), controls about 30% of Arizona Star and will likely pursue an amalgamation as the project becomes further developed. Arizona Star is heading higher, and should be bought with a $10 near term price target in mind. Bema, which is going through its Refugio producing pains, is a safer alternative. <BR>
<P>
Mansfield Minerals (MDR-V: $9.70), a bottom-fish from my 1995 list, has traded as high as $13 on speculation that it has made a grassroots discovery of an Escondida style copper deposit (2.1 billion tons 1.6% copper) in northern Argentina. Last December Teck optioned 50% of the Cerro Samenta prospect for $9.1 million in cash and exploration over 5 years, with Mansfield having the option of dropping to 40% in exchange for Teck arranging production financing. Teck's Bill Meyer has recently been quoted in the Canadian media as declaring Cerro Samenta as the best copper porphyry prospect he has ever seen. The prospect was discovered in November 1994 when Mansfield's Gordon Leask insisted on walking a fresh roadcut during a regional exploration program. The discovery of "exotica" float led to the discovery of two chalcocite porphyry zones with surface grades as high as 1.5%. The showing was previously undocumented and the company did not make a big deal about the discovery until!  after permit concessions were granted In late 1995. Based on a 50 metre deep canyon that cuts one of the zones, Mansfield estimates that a chalcocite copper enrichment blanket at least 50 metres thick is present on the property. The zones correlate with two distinct geophysical anomalies. Trenching is now underway and rumours suggest that high grade values are being obtained. At 17.2 million fully diluted Mansfield and its 50% interest imply a project cap of $333 million. This may be rich considering that no holes have yet been drilled, but cheap if Cerro Samenta's enrichment blanket ends up having a thickness of 200-250 metres in the style of Escondida 55 miles to the west. Teck hopes to be drilling within a month. I am loathe to recommend buying a stock with a $300 million project cap prior to any drill holes, but I feel comfortable telling anybody who owns it to hang on until we get drill results. Mansfield is an elephant shot that is a strong candidate for the Canadian Junior Icon Club. More so than Arizona Star, Mansfield's success would give the market a big boost. While this may sound like a broken record, a strategic alternative to Mansfield is Lucero Resource Corp (LCR-V: $1.19), Mansfield's former partner in the Argentine exploration initiative. Lucero is still sitting on 350,000 Mansfield shares which will be released from pool in quarterly installments. Lucero has al! ready built its warchest to $6-7 million, so doesn't need to sell the Mansfield paper when it comes free. Lucero has more upside than downside, so owning this stock makes good defensive sense.<BR>

<P>
While we wait for the likes of Arizona Star and Mansfield to restore the market's faith in the Canadian junior exploration boom and trigger a resumption in the speculation boom by late summer, the best strategic buy right now which is virtually immune from a market crash are Mountain Minerals (MIM-T: $0.37) and Highwood Resources ltd (HWD-T: $1.32). MIM and HWD have just announced that the merger terms will be 3.521 MIM for 1 HWD. That is worse than a Highwood shareholder such as myself would have preferred, but it is excellent for MIM shareholders. Information circulars have been mailed out and the AGM will be July 31. Royal Oak's John Smrke has indicated that the only source of potential resistance, a pair of Swiss investors who own 1.1 million shares of Highwood, are on side. A deal with them regarding the 30% interest in the Thor Lake project that reverts to them in 2000 is also in the works. The merged company will survive as Highwood, which also trades on NASDAQ under!  HIWDF. I discussed the two companies in the May-June issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report (went in the mail June 14) and in Kaiser Express 96-4 on March 29. The outlook is pretty much unchanged, so suffice it for me to say that Royal Oak's goal is to build the merged company into a specialty metals powerhouse. This process will take several years, but the important thing to keep in mind is that Highwood's success will not "happen" because something is "found"; its success will be "made to happen". That is the formula that works best in a bear market. If you don't for a second believe that the best of times for the junior spec boom are still to come, then Mountain Minerals and Highwood are perfect for you. They are at rock bottom and carry virtually no paper overhang. Because Mountain Minerals is by far more liquid, and the merger ratio is only 3.521:1, the best strategy for anybody seeking size is to buy Mountain Minerals to a limit of $0.50. Mountain Minerals can be reached!  at (403) 261-3999 or Royal Oak at (206) 822-8992. Environmental review panel gives nod to Canada's first diamond mine<BR>
<P>
On Friday morning June 21 the Canadian government's NWT environmental assessment review panel released its recommendation that the Dia Met/BHP diamond mine at Lac de Gras be permitted to proceed subject to certain conditions. These conditions appear to be mainly the creation of monitoring bureaucracies to ensure that environmental and socioeconomic impacts do not exceed expectations. The review panel also urges the federal government to get on with land claims settlements and come up with a system to establish when an exploration project is advanced enough to ensure exclusion from settlement selection (the latter is of importance to the overall NWT diamond hunt). The panel also recommends that the government set up procedures for diamond valuation, probably to ensure that NWT diamond production doesn't escape taxation. A formal goahead decision won't be rendered until Cabinet sits again, which won't be until August. From a practical perspective diamond mining in the NWT has!  been given the green light, which should be a boost for other juniors in the region. Given that not much has gone right for the Canadian resource juniors during the past couple months (ie Cartaway, Timbuktu, copper's price collapse, gold's southward trek, extortion lawsuits and the chilling out of Canadian junior spec fever), there has been a sense of caution best described as a tribute to the notion that "when it rains, it pours".<BR>
<P>
One interesting note is a comment in the June 10 Northern Miner which states that the capital cost is now pegged at US $750 million. The BHP and Dia Met agreement says that BHP will arrange financing up to US $500 million. An earlier agreement between Dia Met, Chuck Fipke and Stu Blusson decrees that the latter individuals have a carried interest. The implication is that Dia Met will have to fund 49% of capital costs above $500 million. Dia Met has suffered a low profile because it lacked a fiscal sponsor for the simple reason it didn't need such backing. A window may now be opening for the brokerage industry to get behind Dia Met. The Northern Miner article also stated the hitherto unrevealed $89 carat value for the 0.33 ct/t Leslie Pipe. This value confirms that cash flow for the final 15 years of BHP's 25 year mining plan will pale compared to the first ten years as the plant is fed $34 rock from the Fox and $29 rock from the Leslie pipes. However, two new pipes, the Jay!  and Sable, have emerged as substitute candidates. A 1,096 t bulk sample yielded a grade of 0.98 ct/t and an average value of $64/ct. If a 9 ct gem stone valued at US $17,556 is removed from the parcel, the Sable pipe's value drops to $48/ct. The stones from the Jay pipe, which yielded 2.01 ct/t from 476.8 tonnes, have yet to be evaluated. Nothing has been said about tonnages. BHP has also revealed that the values it publishes represent a 10% discount from the commercial dealer valuations it has obtained. In other words, for the sake of comparison with values reported by other companies, BHP's diamonds should be marked up 11%. The 10% discount is likely intended to reflect the 10% "marketing" fee the CSO collects for handling a producer's rough diamond supply.<BR><P>
Now that the risk of government rejection of the mining plan has been largely eliminated, purchase of Dia Met Minerals (DMM.B & DMM.A - T) shares is timely. Dia Met's A shares at $21 continue to trade at a discount to the more liquid B multiple voting shares at $23. Because both classes participate equally, and future financings are likely to be in the form of the A shares, investors should favour the cheaper class for the long run. With about 28.7 million fully diluted shares for the combined classes, the market is presently valuing the Dia Met/BHP at about $2.1 billion (CAD) or US $1.5 billion. Based on published data the diamond mine will initially be churning out about US $400 million worth of rough diamonds per year. BHP has not revealed internal operating cost estimates, but I estimate that during the first ten years they will run 20-30% of gross revenues. Payback should be within several years and Dia Met will then become a cash cow. The stock has not had much hype d! uring the past two years, and although it has doubled this year, this reflects more a rebound from last year's review panel uncertainty and accompanying subdued information flow than excessive speculation. Investors looking for a strategic place to park their speculative capital while they wait out the hurricane warnings should give Dia Met a serious look.<BR>

<A NAME="Ge"><font size=+1>Gerle Gold: Boyd Warner ownership uncertainty to continue.</font size>
<P>
Gerle Gold (GGL-V: $2.60) is busy drilling on its Doyle Lake project south of Mountain Province's Kennedy Lake project. So far Gerle has killed 10 out of 40 initial targets either by drilling or surface inspection. As Winspear found at Snap Lake and Mountain Province is finding at its Carl Hicks anomaly, geophysics is proving to be ineffective as a target definition tool. A new round of indicator mineral sampling has been completed and is being processed by Monopros on a rush basis. I have heard that a section 84 appeal has been filed in Ottawa on the cancellation of the Boyd Warner claims. Gerle, pointing at the weak and unsworn defence provided to the NWT Mining Recorder by Golden Rule, the purported owner of the Boyd Warner claims, plans to carry on exploration as if its ownership is secure. Gerle shareholders worried about an adverse decision six months or later down the road should not consider Golden Rule as a hedge. Last year an attempt was made to assign ownership o! f the Boyd Warner claims to John Dupuis' Inukshuk Capital. Whatever agreement underlay this transfer attempt is probably still intact, and at the least represents a potential lawsuit for Golden Rule if the latter should try to keep whatever Gerle may find on the Central claims. Golden Rule, incidentally, makes no mention in its annual report that it is the beneficial owner of the Boyd Warner claims. Because lawyers automatically exhaust every avenue of appeal, Golden Rule's section 84 appeal could be the company just going through the motions. Nevertheless, Gerle investors should keep the ownership risk in mind. If it is any comfort, Boyd Warner, who comes from a respected and honourable NWT family, verbally informed the NWT Supervising Mining Recorder, Annette McRobert, that "he was contracted to stake this ground for Tyler". McRoberts gives no weight to this statement because it was not provided in writing. But she does report it as an aside in her decision, something she is unl! ikely to have done if she regarded Warner as "mixed up" or a flake. Until Gerle hits a kimberlite, it is a hold.<BR>

<A NAME="Mou"><font size=+1>Mountain Province: under Timbuktu pressure.</font size>
<P>
Diamond speculators should keep a close eye on Mountain Province Mining (MPV-V: $5.40). The stock has based out in the $5-5.50 range where it dropped from the $8 level when it revealed that the first 24.6 tonne bulk sample graded 3.09 ct/t, or 2.28 ct/t counting only stones with one dimension 2 mm or greater. Although the new president, Jan Vandersande, indicated to me that he wanted a 200 ct parcel before shipping the stones off for appraisal, rumours have it that he is in Europe obtaining valuations right now. The market's negative reaction probably prompted this plan change, as has talk that the stones are now expected to average $50/ct. That would still give a value of $100-150/t. If reports of a 20 million tonne resource with an unusually high degree of stone distribution homogeneity hold up under further bulk sampling, and the values come in as expected, investors will soon start paying much closer attention to MPV and the 5034 pipe. At $5.40 the Kennedy Lake project ! has a value of only $256 million compared to Gerle's $154 million. In comparing the valuations one must keep in mind that MPV must foot 50% of all costs, whereas Gerle is carried through production. Because of the uncertainty of funding dilution, MPV is better compared to Aber, presently sporting a project cap of $1.5 billion. The best explanation for the price weakness of MPV is that the company has become dependent on Lytton's backers for financial support. One of the biggest buyers of MPV until recently has been Ron Brimacombe's Yorkton Calgary office. This is the same office that buried itself in Timbuktu, settlement of which trades has resulted in liquidation of other positions. I would venture that control of MPV's destiny is shifting back into the market place, and given Vandersande's determination to plug the information leaks that have in the past plagued MPV and undermined its credibility, the stage has been set for new financial backers to arrive on the scene. MPV has b! een courted by a number of majors, but at this stage a farmout that gives 50% to a major would be a giveaway, even if MPV gets carried to production with favorable payout rates during the payback period. One sensible route for MPV is to let a major get its toe wet through a private placement. A representative of the major should join the board, and the stock should become part of a voting trust in favour of management. A merger with Camphor on arithmetic terms that reflect capitalization and property interest should be pursued. This would create a 60% controlling stake in Kennedy Lake that it would make sense for a major to acquire through a takeover bid. On the assumption that MPV's funding strategy is drifting in this direction, the stock below $6 is a strategic buying opportunity that takes advantage of the Timbuktu factor. As for concern that MPV is a one-pipe wonder, I am convinced that it is only a matter of time before one or more pipes is found in the vicinity of the Carl Hicks anomaly.<BR>

<A NAME="Pe"><font size=+1>Peruvian Gold and Laramide </font size><P>
Peruvian Gold (PVO-V: $3.80) has settled back into the range of $3.50-4.00 after the predictable cancellation of the $10 million financing First Marathon had promised to broker. Given the market's reality check and subsequent reluctance to assume the third dimension for surface showings, Peruvian is no longer itching to go to $10. The company has about $3 million working capital, more than enough to complete a proposed drill program. Heavy monsoon rains have halted work now, but David Henstridge expects to be back on the site no later than August. The length and strength of the rainy season varies, but once the rain stops, it is only a 6 hour drive from Quito and 10 minute helicopter sling job to get a drill on site. Peruvian is also considering an underground adit to sample and drill the sheeted vein system at El Encanto in Ecuador. For now the stock is a hold, and those who sold should watch for buying opportunities triggered by a general market crisis.<BR>
<P>
Investors should regard any private placement announced before June with suspicion until the company confirms that it has closed. With the cup now half empty instead of half full, institutions and other investors are applying much more critical standards before agreeing to put money in a junior's treasury. In cases like Laramide Resources Ltd (LAM-T: $1.36), which has just announced a private placement of 4 million special warrant units at $1.10 by Newcrest Capital and Griffiths McBurney, the non-closing risk is much lower. While First Marathon is destined to become a lame duck in the arena of institutional financings for junior resource companies thanks to Cartaway, others like Newcest, Griffiths and Whalen are emerging as funding leaders. Laramide, which I featured in the May-June issue as one of my anti-promoter flow-thru picks, is a much stronger buy to the $1.50 limit now on the assumption this financing closes.No statement or expression of opinion, or any other matter herein, directly or indirectly, is an offer to buy or sell the securities mentioned.

<H2>"Hey Waiter,the menu said octopi, not calamari!"</H2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
For several days last week during the burgeoning hype about the giant nickel-copper octopus Cartaway was hauling up from the depths of its Cirque property in the Okak Bay area of Labrador, the VSE made successive daily volume records. On Thursday Cartaway galloped to $26 on news that hole #3 had intersected 67.5 metres containing four zones of "heavy" sulphide mineralization estimated to contain 5-10% chalcopyrite, a copper sulphide which should have a corresponding grade of 1.5-3.5% copper. This time around the presence of pentlandite, the nickel sulphide, was also observed. While the first two holes of net-textured to massive sulphide mineralization with "significant visible chalcopyrite", of which according to Walter Nash massive sulphides represented only a few 3-4 metre intervals, left only fools dreaming about Voisey Bay ovoid style grades and intervals, hole 3 looked like the real thing. In fact, it had one infamous risk-reward arbitrager who had just dusted 1.2 mill! ion shares probably wondering if he had once again blown the big one. But only for a bit. On Friday May 17 the fun ended abruptly when Cartaway was halted and the satellites sold off sharply on rumours the assays needed rechecking. What, so good like Timbuktu's they couldn't be true? No, laddy, so bad they couldn't be true.
<P>
The biggest interval of 32 metres from hole #2 graded a pathetic 0.166% copper, 0.087% nickel, and 0.045% cobalt. The budget conscious, surplus proud ASE, still smarting from the "rube capital" title it earned for its handling of the Timbuktu affair, watched its trading facility choke on the onslaught of Cartaway sell orders and demonstrated it was really only suited for the peanut league when it stopped Cartaway trading to prevent a total system crash. It's a good thing so few people take seriously the assays for the Franklin Lakes project of Naxos, which imply one of the richest mineral deposits in the world. The really bad news for Cartaway came on Tuesday when the company announced that the richer intervals in hole #3 graded no better than 0.23% copper, 0.189% nickel and 0.082% cobalt. When trading resumed on May 21 Cartaway opened at $2, down a whopping $21 or 93% from Thursday's $23 close. The fury with which Cartaway paper was blown out says only one thing: instituti! onal fund managers caught with the most hideous embarassment of their careers on their books wanted only one thing: Cartaway off their books before anybody noticed. The stock subsequently bounced back to $4 before settling out at $2.78, reflecting once more its previous classification as an expensive junior with a large portfolio of grassroots Labrador properties.
<P>
Four primary questions have come my way during the past few days.<BR>
<P><UL>
<LI>How could experienced geologists over-estimate the copper sulphide ? <BR> 
<LI>Content in core by more than factor of ten? What does this mean ? <BR>
<LI>For the Labrador play ?  What does this mean for the flow of institutional money into Canadian juniors? <BR><LI>And what does this mean for the future of the biggest spec boom in juniors in 15 years?<BR>
</UL><P>
On the first question the blame is being placed on a field geologist who logged the core and provided estimates of the chalcopyrite content. Walter Nash and no doubt quite a number of independent experts are rushing to take a peek at the infamous core. Was the chalcopyrite estimate reasonable in terms of visual appearance? If so, was it reasonable to apply visual standards to previously unassayed mineralization? The market wants an explanation that reassures it no deliberate deception was made.
<P>
On the question of Labrador, it is obvious that the cup has abruptly gone from half-full to half-empty. When Cartaway grabbed hold of the Cirque tentacle and made noises it had grabbed hold of something big, the market rushed to the table expecting a feast of octopi. Instead, chefs Nash and Ivany served up calamari. This pattern of great Voisey Bay expectations followed by disappointing reality, all accompanied by the blowoff of paper created last year, was predicted. What hadn't been predicted was that it would happen on such an extravagant scale. The consequence is that investors will greet Labrador rumours and news releases with suspicion for the rest of the exploration season. It is possible that further drilling of the Cirque anomaly may lead to better results, but next time around the market will want to see a number of high grade intersections that spell out a 3-dimensional body with an economically significant volume and grade before it starts to assign world-class ! orebody valuations. For the Labrador play the best dedicated exploration bets beside Cartaway (CWA-C) continue to be Castle Rock (CTP-V), United Compass (UCR-V), Columbia Yukon (CYR-C) and NDT Ventures (NDE-V). The best strategy, however, continues to be to monitor these plays for positive field developments and hold the secondary plays like Eastfield (ETF-V), Lucero (LCR-V), Aranlee (ARB-V), Birchwood (BIR-V) and Freewest (FWR-T) which have a primary focus elsewhere. As for Layfield (LAY-V), the company will seek shareholder approval in June for a 5:1 stock consolidation. Had the Cirque delivered the goods, the rollback plan would likely have been cancelled to preserve Layfield as a highly liquid ersatz Cartaway play. However, now that the Cirque's potential has dropped to no better than any other prospect in the area, Layfield is little more than a widely distributed stock that will fall victim to the fate of most junior rollback candidates: after the 5:1 rollback the stock will drift from its post-rollback level of $2-2.50 back to $0.30 where new insiders will create fresh paper to motivate them to find a new life for Layfield. Judging from NDT's inability to say anything interesting about the Layfield property, there probably isn't any compelling reason to own the stock on its own merits.
<P>
On the question of what effect the Cartaway debacle will have on the institutional money that has been pouring into the Canadian juniors, I think it will be very positive. Not positive in the sense that more will come chasing into the market, but positive in the sense that it will be deployed more prudently within a risk-reward context. The quest for the next Bre-X or Diamond Fields is foremost in the minds of both retail and institutional investors. What people have been forgetting is that good exploration results are the exception to the rule, not the norm. And extraordinary discoveries like Busang or Voisey's Bay are extraordinary exceptions to the rule. Equity fund managers continue to experience a heavy inflow of money, are under pressure to deliver high returns, but are hamstrung by a yo-yo senior market that one week is destined for 6,000 and beyond, and the next week slipping toward 5,000 and oblivion. Meanwhile the worldwide exploration landscape is being altered b! y an explosion of well financed junior exploration companies staffed by geological talent pools frequently drawn from the folds of major mining companies. They are being funded by retail and institutional investors as well as major companies, which are effectively shifting exploration to the public market driven juniors while they concentrate on their core business: acquiring, developing and mining orebodies. The institutional money has recognized the enormous leverage that these juniors represent, and so long as the juniors pursue a formula of raising more money than they need and constantly replenishing their property portfolios with new prospects to replace the duds, the downside risk is slow and gradual. Since these juniors are mainly companies trying to conjure an economic asset out of thin air, in other words prove that a heap of rocks is really a valuable orebody, their valuation boils down to relating the risk of finding nothing to the reward of finding something valuable. Investors who got burned by Cartaway did so because they ignored the fact that while the reward implicit in the stock's price grew, there was no corresponding decline in the risk that no reward would be delivered. Fear and gr! eed that they were missing the next Diamond Fields drove investors into Cartaway. The disastrous result translates into a reality check that will also break the "seller's strike" that has permitted market valuations to soar.
<P>
Cartaway has done the junior exploration market a big favour because it reminds investors to assess speculative stocks in terms of their risk-reward leverage. At $26 Cartaway sported a $800 million project valuation without any assays in hand, not even from surface sampling or trenching. Exploring a deposit is a gradual process that can involve some results based quantum leaps in valuation, but rarely does exploration produce one giant leap from nothing to world class orebody. That does not mean plays like Arequipa and Fortune Minerals won't yield multi-billion dollar deposits. But just because they have this potential does not mean investors should be willing to price these stocks as though extensive drilling has already turned the potential into reality. This year we have seen heavy price inflation for a number of high-powered stocks so that 12% of VSE listings represented 58% of the VSE's entire market capitalization. I believe the Cartaway experience will help reverse t! his trend, which is the stock equivalent of an ever smaller segment of the population controlling an ever larger portion of the total wealth. Both retail and institutional investors will start looking for smaller deals where the market cap has plenty of room for upside if the company starts delivering the promised reward. If I am correct both retail and institutional money will continue to flow into the Canadian resource exploration juniors, but they will do so at the lower market cap end of the spectrum. The rebellion against all risk-no reward plays has begun.
<P>
The diversification of investor interest is very healthy for this market because it will result in a broader base of companies who get sufficiently financed to carry on the orebody hunt. Cartaway's fall from grace will help this process because the Masters of the Universe behind Cartaway, a small group of First Marathon brokers who owned most of the very cheap 14 million shares which came free trading on May 5, have had their feathers clipped. Thanks to their involvement with Diamond Fields, this group had emerged as a dominant financing force in this market that had tremendous influence over institutions. During the height of the Cartaway hype these Masters of the Universe were personally up over $200 million on paper, and dreaming about being up $1 billion. While they probably won't spend too much time in the penalty box for sharing those feelings with their institutional clients, it may be long enough for other, less influential brokerage firms to pick up the ball and in! troduce product from a broader field to the institutional money. Such a development would make this market's destiny less vulnerable to the whims, fortunes and woes of a very small elite. In terms of the big picture, New York has just made a new high at 5,700 and is in no immediate danger of melting down. The emergence of a new breed of junior exploration companies with healthy treasuries in excess of $5 million earmarked for serious exploration around the world has created a foundation that will bring forth a parade of discoveries, many of them modest, a few world-class. Should New York fail us and unleash a hurricane, these companies will see their prices flattened. But like reeds when the wind has stopped blowing they will snap back. The attitude is developing among investors that while a senior market driven setback is inevitable, its timing is uncertain and irrelevant, for the junior driven global hunt for mineral deposits has become a fixture of the future.
<P>
Two juniors that I feel are ripe for institutional funding are Major General Resources (MGJ-V) and Rio Amarillo Mining (RIO-V). Rio Amarillo is currently awaiting results from hole 10 on the Aicha tourmaline breccia target in Peru. This target has been a real teaser for Rio's Hal Waller, who had just about given up that the Bellota Pipe would yield any significant tonnage of polymetallic mineralization when hole 10 produced a 142 metre intersection that should have been only 7-10 metres long. Except for a 50 metre section of massive pyrite Waller expects to be barren, much of this intersection is expected to run gold, silver, copper and zinc grades, albeit not spectacular grades. Rio Amarillo now thinks there is a lot more going on at depth than initially expected and plans to carry on drilling. While Aicha may at best lead to a medium sized underground mining operation, the blue-sky for Rio Amarillo investors sits with the Portovelo prospect in Ecuador which Rio has starte! d to drill. This property covers an old gold vein mining camp where Rio hopes to discover a large disseminated stockwork gold deposit. With 14.3 million fully diluted, working capital of $3.5-4 million, an excellent geological talent pool, and a range of properties in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, Rio Amarillo at $1.51 is a steal. You cannot yet put your finger on what will make this company a winner, but it is the sort of stock you should have and could have easily bought all year. After unsuccessfully pursuing a cheapskate strategy of waiting for the stock to get cheaper, I finally took the plunge last week and bought a small position in the $1.55-1.65 range. Investors should not be afraid to own the stock up to $2, where its market cap is still only $30 million. Once the stock has broken through $2 it will likely attract an institutional audience and will be in a price bracket where management is confortable raising additional funds.
<P>
Major General is another stock whose cheapness has worked to its detriment. Major just raised $1.4 million at $0.80 through a private placement that took no time to sell out. By now the company has at least 28 million shares fully diluted, and is or was owned by just about everybody who has heard the by now tiresome "irons-in-the-fire" touts from Bob Bishop and myself. The biggest problem with Major has been the absence of leadership since late 1994 when Bill Coulter was appointed interim president. He stepped down late last year for health reasons. Dick Atkinson is finally looking for an aggressive new president, and if one is found, the market will no doubt applaud. Companies trading at distressed prices thanks to missing pieces that could easily be filled are excellent buys. Major plans to spend a good part of the money on a 20 hole drill program on the new Orion gold zone discovered west of the 150,000 oz high grade Hammerdown gold deposit on the Rendall-Jackman propert! y in Newfoundland. Bernie Kahlert thinks Orion is the fault offset and upfaulted deeper portion of the system that fed the Hammerdown veins and is optimistic that a substantial medium-grade gold resource can be developed. Rendall-Jackman needs a bigger gold reserve to make a standalone mining operation feasible. Major has been described as a Canadian mutual fund, but it may soon be known as a Greenland diamond play. Last year while sampling for heavy metals like nickel and copper, Major started picking up kimberlite indicator minerals. This constituted the first evidence that kimberlite emplacement occurred in Greenland. So far only a handful of indicator minerals have been found, of which only G9's have been identified. Major has beefed up its land position to 2,300 sq km.
<P>
While in Vancouver last week I had a chance to review the diamond indicator mineral data for Major General, Mountain Province and Gerle Gold. On May 10 the NWT Supervising Mining Recorder had released her decision on the Boyd Warner claims, which was to cancel them and allow the overlying Central claims of Gerle and Kidme claims of Major General and Southernera to stand. Golden Rule has until June 10 to file a Section 84 appeal in Ottawa. An appeal would be surprising, especially considering that Golden Rule and Tyler did not trouble to make "sworn" responses to the Mining Recorder's request for submissions nor provide supporting documentation. From what I saw in Vancouver, I can make two predictions: Mountain Province will find a diamondiferous kimberlite on the Carl-Hicks anomaly it is presently drilling, and Gerle will find at least two diamondiferous kimberlites on its claims. Major has two distinct mineral trains that cross its property in a northeasterly direction. On! e clearly originates from MPV's Carl Hicks anomaly. The other leads directly to the cluster of anomalies on Gerle's ground. Gerle is presently mobilizing for a drilling program that will carry on all summer. An attempt will be made to drill targets on Phantom Lake before winter breakup, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Major has a 24% interest in the Kidme claims, which are not part of the Misty Lake JV with Monopros. The Gerle train has a spur on the Kidme claim between the Misty and Central blocks that could well indicate a pipe. Part of Phantom Lake, through which the main train passes, sits on the Kidme claim. At current prices of $2.75-3.00 Gerle without a diamondiferous kimberlite is overpriced. So was Dia Met in early 1992 when the only published information was the Point Lake micro counts. That is why I am holding Gerle for the long haul. Major General will be a wonderful ersatz play for Gerle because its ground may be very strategic, and I can think of a half dozen other reasons to own the stock at current prices. Major General should be accumulated to the $1.30 level and watched for some event that would trigger a breakout.

<font size=+1>Cartaway's Cirque Discovery</font size><BR><P>
One year ago VSE daily volume hit 50 million shares on the back of the Voisey Bay nickel-copper discovery. I predicted in Kaiser Express 95-3 we were on the threshold of the biggest spec boom in 15 years and that we
would hit 100 million share days before the year was over. Naturally, the rest of the year saw only lower daily volumes. On Thursday May 9 the VSE hit 67.4 million shares on the back of the Cirque nickel-copper (maybe) discovery. This time I am keeping my mouth shut. Next week I will be in Vancouver to attend the Vancouver International Mining Investment Conference, which runs at the Hotel Vancouver from 
May 12-14.<P>
<P>
<B>Cartaway: serving up another Voisey's Bay deposit?</B><BR><P>
Results are now driving the speculative resource stock market. The biggest splash was made by Timbuktu Gold, which published assays for a hole that switched from anomalous gold in the first 100 ft to grades 
of 1-5 opt gold over the next 200 ft. It did not occur to the ASE, the brokerage firm sponsors of Timbuktu, 
nor the company's management to halt trading immediately until these numbers could be confirmed. Now the ASE, which has shunned the development of information systems comparable to the VSE because of "budget and manpower constraints" while building up a $12 million surplus, looks like the rube capital of the stock business. The biggest rubes are the brokers who fell for those glorious numbers, suspecting neither a methodology problem nor, heaven forbid, a salt job. After churning $50 million or so worth of paper the stock is now halted while the hole is redrilled with a diamond drill. The rumblings are that the news will not be happy. So, of course, the first question people ask when Cartaway catapults to a $300 million project valuation on about $36 million worth of trading is whether investors are being loaded onto another cattle car destined for Timbuktu.
<P>
While I may have my beefs about the way the brokers behind Cartaway Resources Corp (CWA-C: $9.50, 
33 million fully diluted) manage the allocation of risks and rewards among themselves and their clients, I have 
never doubted the credibility of the people running Cartaway. When you have Noranda's former eastern Canada exploration manager, Walter Nash, running the exploration program and writing the news releases, you have no doubts that the information is presented in anything but the utmost professional manner. 
May 8 Cartaway announced the first two of six holes planned for the 100% owned Cirque property south of Okak Bay and northwest of Alliger Lake in northern Labrador. The target was an elliptical magnetic-EM anomaly 400 by 250 metres. This target has been interpreted as a pipe-like,  southeasterly plunging sulphide body. There is no mineralized outcrop, and though float that graded nickel-copper-cobalt had been found in the area,  the target was regarded as a blind target. Optimism that it might represent another Voisey Bay style deposit was drawn largely from its proximity to the nearby Canadian States property, where arrow nickel-copper massive sulphide mineralization had been intersected last fall.
<P>
Cartaway's first hole nipped the western edge of the anomaly and yielded several short sections of network-textured to coarse-grained massive sulphides. The second hole was drilled vertically from the same setup and
intersected 4 zones of net textured to massive sulphide mineralization to a depth of 123 metres, including 
32 m between 9.5 - 41.5 m depth. The news release does not reveal the extent of "massive" intervals, but does
emphasize "significant visible chalcopyrite" mineralization within the zones. I did not have the opportunity to talk to Walter Nash before writing this Express, but I presume that he did not mean he spotted copper within a
few narrow massive sulphide bands here and there. Although the sulphides are mainly pyrrhotite, the sulphide found most often in conjunction withthe nickel sulphide, pentlandite, no mention of the latter was made.
I have heard that the chalcopyrite has been eyeballed at 5%, meaning it should grade 1-2% copper, and that nickel is present. At this stage the $300 million market valuation is premature. We need assays to establish grade and more holes to give us some geometry to estimate tonnage. The geophysical anomaly would suggest a 10-15 million tonne body to a depth of 50 metres. Anything deeper is open to the imagination. There does not seem to be any doubt the Cirque zone will run nickel and copper. The question is what the grade will be.
<P>
If the Cirque turns out to be a large high grade nickel-copper deposit, it will signal that the Voisey Bay deposit Inco is buying for about $5 billion is not an isolated freak occurrence within the Nain Province. 
That should certainly attract the attention of Falconbridge, which has a $100 million war chest as a consolation price for losing the takeover battle for Diamond Fields. Despite the implications of the discovery for Labrador in general, market interest will tend to concentrate in the immediate area of the new discovery as investors dream about how big this octopus may be and how far its tentacles reach. The area of interest will be what I last year called Kingurutik North, which stretches about 30 km east and west of the Cirque discovery and is bounded by the exempt mineral lands at Okak Bay to the north and at Alliger Lake to the south. Cartaway's immediate neighbours  will receive heavy market attention. To the south is the 50:50 JV between NDT Ventures (NDE-V: $3.70) and Layfield Minerals (LAY-V: $$0.79). 
<P>
<B>Layfield</B>, which has about 26-30 million shares fully diluted, traded over 12 million shares on Thursday. A private placement of 4 million shares and 4 million warrants brokered last year to a Howe Street Who's Who list has come free trading. The liquidity of Layfield and its location just south of the Cirque discovery promises to make this stock the market's ersatz Cartaway play. Because Layfield's market action will track that of the pricier Cartaway, speculators can treat it as a sort of Cartaway option. I purchased Layfield on Thursday for this reason. 
<P>
<B>Eastfield Resources</B> (ETF-V: $1.50) will be the flagship for the ground to the east of the Cirque property. Eastfield shares 25% of the Alliger West block with each of Athbaska Gold (AHB-T: $0.85), Warner Ventures (WVL-V: $0.98) and Island-Arc (IAR-V: $1.50). The most leveraged stock immediately to the east is Warner Ventures, with about 6 million fully diluted.  Eastfield et al will be releasing results early next week from a six hole program completed on the Alliger West block. Drilling of a geophysical target intersected massive magnetite. Management does not have high expectations for this core, but is optimistic it will run minor nickel and copper. The geophysical survey used to identify targets last year on the Alliger group had the capacity to penetrate only about 50 metres. Deep EM surveys have been undertaken on the project and results are expected in a few weeks. If they reveal deeper targets, this group of stocks should heat up in anticipation of a summer drill play.
<P>
<B>NDT Resources</B> and its other Staghorn Lake partners, Aranlee Resources (ARB-V: $1.50), Birchwood Ventures 
(BIR-V: $0.90), Essex Resources (ESX-V: $4.15) and Lumina Investments (LMI-V: $0.80) have properties in the vicinity of the Cirque which will likely attract attention. Essex has pretty much become a Bolivian play, and Aranlee will likely develop its Argentina focus with the help of two recent appointments, Tony Williams and Clive Johnson. That leaves Birchwood as the most uncommitted participant. Columbia Yukon 
(CYR-C: $2.37) and partner Silverstone Resources (SVT-V: $0.94) quietly announced several short sulphide intervals from drilling on the ML 1506 claim that adjoins Cartaway to the north. Columbia Yukon describes them as "nickel bearing", so these holes should be watched. Castle Rock (CTP-V:$1.59) and United Compass 
(UCR-V: $2.76) expect to be drilling by the end of May on their Okak Bay property further to the north. One pair of companies further to the east that bear watching are Ivory Oil (IVY-V:$1.10) and Spokane Resources (SKN-V: $1.05), which are joint ventured 55:45 on the Tasiuyak Bay property. They have traced a north-south troctolite dyke with up to 60 metre widths over 2 km. This dyke carries anomalous copper and nickel values and could be interpreted as a "tentacle". Last  year Diamond Fields supposedly expressed interest in this dyke, but never followed through. I have not heard that there are any important EM anomalies associated with this dyke, so its potential will have lie deep.
<P>
<font size=+1><A NAME="Pe" >Peruvian: 870 metre strike length established for high grade gold</font size>
<P>
Peruvian Gold (PVO-V: $5.60) reported trench results for #5 and #7 on Thursday that confirmed the company may be sitting on a million ounce plus gold deposit. Trench 5 yielded 37.2 ft of 0.13 opt gold and Trench 
7 yielded 77.4 ft of 0.61 opt gold. This establishes medium to high grade gold mineralization over a strike length of 870 metres, with widths ranging 11-52 metres. The next stage will be to drill test the zone. The sensible thing for Peruvian to do now is to hit up its financial backers for a private placement of 2 million or so units at the $5 level. The stock is itching to push towards the $10 target, but needs a financing to turn the
light green.<BR>

<font size=+1><A NAME="Co">Cons Callinan: still in hanging wall stratigraphy</font size>
<P>
The eleventh hour is turning out to be a very long hour for Cons Callinan Flin-Flon (CFF-V: $3.19). Based on interpretation of the April 26 to hit the target within 40-100 metres. Instead, the drill punched through 
44 metres of weak sulphides with minor copper and zinc mineralization before carrying on in what is still being described as hanging wall stratigraphy. This mineralization was unexpected at this level of the stratigraphic sequence, which remains identical to that which hosts the Callinan zones presently mined by HBMS. The failure to hit the target has been explained through the recognition that the stratigraphy's dip has
steepened from 45B0 to 65B0. The latest projection is that the target horizon will be interesected 
80-100 metres deeper. Drilling has slowed down to 10 metres per day when it hasn't stopped altogether due to equipment failure. At this rate we can stop worrying about Callinan for another 1-2 weeks. Until word gets out that the Callinan footwall has been penetrated without intersecting massive sulphides, the game will still be on. In  addition to the two massive sulphide zones alluded to by Minorco in its 1994 annual report, Callinan now has hopes that the unexpected 44 metre disseminated sulphide zone is related to a third zone that later wedge drilling can probe. At this point investors should decide to hang on for the end or bail out.

Cons Callinan Flin-Flon (CFF-V: $3.80) is 40-100 metres away from intersecting Flin Flon's Sister. Drilling was suspended at 1,610 metres on Tuesday to allow for a downhole geophysics probe to take a look. The probe indicates that a massive body lies dead ahead somewhere between 40-100 metres. Drilling has now resumed, and at the recent rate of 18 metres per shift, two shifts per day, the target should be intersected by Friday or at the latest by Monday. The market had weakened earlier in the week as investors got the eleventh hour jitters amidst delays caused by broken drill rods. CFF has been drilling steadily since November 22 except for a three week break in late December. Callinan believes that the 300-330 metre wide 100% owned War Baby claim covers the down-plunge projection of the stratigraphy that hosts the Callinan deposit presently being mined by HBMS.  Callinan has a 6 2/3% net profits interest in the Callinan claim north of 
the War Baby claim. Within days we may get confirmation that a second world-class deposit sits underneath downtown Flin-Flon.
<P>
I introduced the Callinan story on Sept 18, 1995 in Kaiser Express 96-10 ($2.25 buy limit, $5 12 month target), where I argued that circumstantial evidence and rumours suggest that HBMS had discovered a significant new zone down plunge from the known Callinan reserves. HBMS is controlled by Minorco, a unit of South African controlled Anglo American. HBMS has been doing substantial underground development and exploratory work on a project it claims is subeconomic. It has refused to disclose any information to 
Callinan, even though the parent, Minorco, a multi-billion dollar company, disclosed in its 1994 annual report that two new zones of copper and zinc mineralization had been found at the Callinan Mine. In Minorco's words, "these new zones occur significantly deeper but in the same sequence of rocks that host the current Callinan mining operations". Callinan's Mike Muzylowski believes that HBMS may have found a deep orebody comparable to the now depleted 70 million ton Flin Flon deposit. The War Baby claim straddles the Callinan stratigraphy projected about 3,000 ft down plunge from the known Callinan zone, and covers about 1,600 ft of plunge. The stratigraphy dips at about 45 B0. HBMS has drilled two deep holes, one on the northern, up-plunge border of the War Baby claim, and another on the southern, down-plunge border of War Baby where the Callinan stratigraphy is projected to be at a depth of about 7,000 ft. For the past 12 months HBMS has been wedging off both holes, drilling a fan of holes to define "something". These are expensive holes, and you can bet your life HBMS is not conducting an academic study. Rumours have indicated that spectacular zinc-copper core has been pulled from these holes. Given that a Flin-Flon style volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit will be stratigraphically controlled, the obvious conclusion is that the War Baby claim covers the middle of a very important zone. Callinan expects its intersection to represent a true width of the deepest third of the body that lies within the War 20baby claim boundaries, and is hoping to get 30 metres or better of massive sulphide core. Once it has intersected the zone, it plans to back up and wedge drill a fan of holes to define the geometry of the zone.
<P>	
What should Callinan shareholders do in the eleventh hour? For those who bought Callinan last year when I recommended it and have stuck it out, hold your positions. If massive sulphide core is hit, the town of Flin Flon will know about it instantly, the stock price will spike up before management knows about the hit, and trading will be halted for disclosure. When trading resumes there will be heavy speculation based on visual "assays" of  the core. I expect the stock to shoot through $5. To go higher will depend  on the width and grade of the intersection. With only 14 million shares fully diluted, Callinan could head into double digits upon receipt of strong assays. Given HBMS's perseverance on both sides of War Baby, it is unlikely the grades will be sub-economic. Speculators will be hoping that the grades are very high, ie 5%+ zinc, 5%+ copper, and gold credits. When more data is available I will try to put the value potential into perspective. If drilling intersects weak sulphide mineralization, the stock will likely gap down to the $1.50-2.00 level. Callinan will drill at least 4 wedges before giving up. However, downhole geophysics has indicated an off-hole anomaly at 1,550 m hole depth. This may represent a separate zone. At the end of this program Callinan would  have $3 million working capital and be in good shape to find itself a new life.
<P>
The purpose of this drill hole is to give Callinan the leverage needed to force HBMS to renegotiate the deal on the main Callinan property. Callinan is pushing for a formal audit of the accounting HBMS uses to render the 
Callinan Mine uneconomic. HBMS has never said there is nothing there on the Callinan ground. It has simply hidden behind the extremely high threshold of what is material for one of the world's biggest mining companies. I suspect that once the cat is out of the bag, HBMS management will have to sit down at the negotiating table to hammer out a deal that consolidates the War Baby "zone" with the rest of the ore. Speculators willing to gamble on this hole, or interested in exploiting the volatility that will accompany the mystery associated with the information flow during the next few weeks, may want to grab a position before the stock breaks $4.00. Those who prefer a bird in the hand over two in the bush should take their 
100% profit. CFF: (604) 669-5598

<font size=+1><A NAME="La">Labrador: a summer of trading opportunities</font size>
<P>
Speculation about the Labrador nickel-copper hunt is starting to heat up on rumours that Diamond Fields is hitting massive sulphides on new targets. Last week local investors got all worked up about rumours that Diamond Fields had made a discovery very close to the eastern border of the main Voisey's Bay block. This brought substantial buying into Intl Canalaska (ICA-V: $1.20), which owns 100% of the VBE-1 property that adjoins to the east. JV partner Columbia Yukon (CYR-C: $1.89), which has less fully diluted stock out and stands to earn 70% of the VBE-1 property by carrying all costs to production, was largely ignored. Subsequent rumours placed the new DFR discovery about 5 miles east of the ovoid, or about halfway between 
 the ovoid and the Intl Canalaska border. That cooled off the market. Right now the metaphor for the Voisey's Bay deposit is that of a deeply buried octopus. Confirmation of a discovery well east of Eastern Deeps would be significant because it would signal the existence of another octopus whose tentacles might extend under the VBE-1 claims and possibly even the claim NDT and Lucero own 50:50 east of VBE-1. Canalaska has found encouraging smoke on the VBE-1 claims which it plans to follow up with deep EM geophysical surveys in mid-May and drilling in June.
<P>
The general exploration strategy this year in Labrador's Nain Province is to search for deep-seated octopi like the Eastern Deeps deposit using deep EM geophysics and deep drilling. Last year's exploration pass pretty well killed the potential for another near-surface deposit like the 30 million tonne ovoid zone. Short near surface intersections of magmatic sulphide mineralization will be treated as possible tentacles of a deeper octopus to be followed up with downhole geophysics and deeper drilling. This stage will be accompanied by lots of hype. Investors should realize that key Labrador players like Castle Rock (CTP-VB: $1.47), Cartaway (CWA-V: $3.50), and NDT Ventures (NDE-V: $3.00), as well as their smaller JV partners, have huge quantities of paper hanging over the market. The only discoveries that count will be ones that have copper and nickel grades better than 1% and tonnages in excess of 20 million tonnes. Inco is not likely to accept mill 
feed from smaller deposits. To have an economic nickel-copper deposit in Labrador, it will have to be big. Unless spectacular holes of 50 metres plus and high grades are pulled, the significance of drill results will be 
an open question. You can bet that the existing shareholders who got papered up last year will be selling into volume generated by encouraging results. Speculators should treat the 1996 Labrador exploration season as a 
 trading play. Buying and holding for elephant confirmation will be the most effective way to lose your money. Better to buy back at a higher price when size potential has been confirmed than get suckered into the trap of not wanting to miss the next Diamond Fields. I expect that majors like Falconbridge, RTZ and Gencor who got skunked in the DFR takeover game will be watching very closely and will be eager to do farm-in deals. I do think that if any juniors pull very good results that clearly indicate a sizable discovery, the majors will move much more quickly to take equity positions. But be forewarned that there will be lots of false rumours about takeover bids. One possible new wrinkle that may change the complexion of the Labrador play this summer is the emergence of platinum group mineralization. The Voisey's Bay deposit does include platinum group credits, but they have been ignored by DFR because their recoverability is likely incompatible with nickel-copper recovery processes. Platinum group metals tend to be associated more with disseminated sulphides than massive sulphides. It is quite possible that some layered sulphide intersections that don't look too promising for nickel or copper sulphides may kick back important platinum group grades. The economics of a platinum deposit would be a new ballgame unaffected by the size of the Voisey's Bay deposit. Nobody is talking about platinum group targets, but keep this prospect in mind as a wild card.
<P>
The action in the next while will likely centre in the Okak Bay area where,Cartaway Resources Corp 
(CWA-C) will soon start drilling the 100% owned Cirque property. This property adjoins the Alliger West property owned 25% each by Eastfield Resources Ltd (ETF-V: $1.16) and Warner Ventures 
(WVL-V:$0.97), both bottom-fish that popped up several weeks ago on news that magmatic segregation style mineralization had been intersected. The core,  however, was high on magnetite but low on sulphides. Assays are several weeks away and are not expected to be barnburners. The target was identified with geophysics that had a maximum 50 metre penetration. A new grid of geophysics with a 200 metre depth penetration is planned to see if Eastfield et al have the tentacle of an octopus. Success by Cartaway next door would certainly boost optimism in the Eastfield camp. Eastfield appears to be much more excited about a target in Alliger Lake on the Alliger South block it shares 75:25 with Mongolia Gold (MGR-V: $1.39). Initially dismissed as a lake bottom sediment anomaly, this target is now believed to contain a significant linear magnetic feature that the planned geophysics program will further illuminate. Of the bunch Eastfield remains the most strategic buy because it has interests ranging 25-75% in all three Alliger blocks and has a life beyond Labrador. Work on the 50:50 JV with Prism Resources (PRN-V: $0.85) on the Tonopah Gold Project in Nevada has begun. This program is geared towards bringing the low grade gold resource of 250,000-300,000 ounces on the Three Hills/Hill of Gold property to the feasibility stage by this fall and testing for new reserves. Eastfield 
recently completed a private placement of 1,200,000 units at $0.79. There is no hurry to buy Eastfield, but below $1.30 it is a good indirect bet on Okak Bay with lots of gold-related upside. Also in the Okak Bay area, to the northwest of Alliger Lake on the ML 1506 block, Columbia Yukon and Silverstone (SVT-V) are starting a drill program to follow up on nickel-copper-cobalt showings.

<P>	
If you want exposure to Labrador but don't want to be a trader of stocks like NDT, Cartaway and Castle Rock, the perfect stock right now is Lucero Resources Corp (LCR-V: $1.18). NDT has indicated that it plans to follow up with more work on ten claim blocks, including the one east of VBE-1. Lucero has $2.9 million working capital and owns 670,000 shares of Mansfield Minerals (MDR-V: $3.80) worth about $2.3 million which Lucero is free to sell after May 31. A 10,000 ft drill program is planned in late July for the Wolf project in central British Columbia. The program is designed to make or break the epithermal gold potential of this prospect on which Lucero has worked since 1987. Insiders recently reloaded with restricted stock through a private placement of 1,000,000 units at $0.60. And the company has been actively looking for copper and gold prospects in Chile.  Lucero has 14.4 million fully diluted, working capital of about $5 million that could be boosted by $1.2 million through the exercise of 806,250 warrants at $1.50 by June 29, 1996, exposure to Labrador, and the blue-sky of a new exploration focus in South America. The timing is right for 
 judicious positioning in the $1.00-1.50 range during the next four weeks.   LCR: (604) 682-7041

<font size=+1><A NAME="Ge">Gerle Gold: waiting for NWT Mining Recorder decision any day</font size>
<P>	
The latest buying surge in Gerle Gold (GGL-V) is likely due to a strong recommendation it received in the March-April issue of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report. Dated April 15 and mailed April 20, this issue is devoted to the NWT Diamond Hunt. In it I argue that the second exploration wave is underway in the NWT diamond play and that the Lac de Gras pipes of Dia Met and Aber may not be the richest and most valuable pipes in the NWT.  Based on indicator mineral data Gerle believes its North and Central claims cover a cluster of diamond pipes. A decision by the NWT Mining Recorder on the Boyd Warner/Central claims is expected any day. If the ruling goes in Gerle's favour, it means Gerle will own the entire cluster, not just part of it. Gerle plans to start drilling by mid-May and intends to drill throughout summer. Apparently there are no large lakes on Gerle's ground, and the targets are at worst associated with small lakes that can be drilled from shore. Subscribers who bought Gerle as a result of my March 6 Kaiser Express 96-3 should definitely hold their positions. Weakness due to an adverse decision by the Mining Recorder should be treated as a buying opportunity. (JK owns shares in GGL) GGL: (604) 688-0546

<font size=+1><A NAME="Pe">Peruvian Gold: medium tonnage high grade deposit new target model</font size>
<P>
The latest trench assays for Peruvian Gold (PVO-V: $3.75) spell bad news for hopes that the 60% optioned El Encanto project in northern Ecuador hosts a bulk tonnage gold deposit. The distribution of mineralization is showing that there is some sort of control to the gold within the system of porphyry veining. The good news is that instead of a 100 million ton deposit of 0.05-0.07 opt gold, we are likely looking at a medium tonnage deposit of 5-10 million tons of 0.1-0.3 opt gold. Trench 1 yielded 0.15 opt gold over 171.4 ft.  Trench 3, 100 metres upslope of Trench 1, yielded 23 ft of 1.33 opt gold. Trench 2, about 35 m downslope from Trench 1, yielded only 49.2 ft of 0.11 opt gold and was the basis for concern during the past few weeks. However, trenches 2A and 2B just above and below trench 2 yielded 29 ft of 0.85 opt gold and 47.7 ft of 0.17 opt gold. Trenches 4 and 6 failed to expose enough bedrock to sample. The key to the El Encanto project will be trench 5, 300 metres downslope from trench 2, and trench 7, 600 metres downslope from trench 2. These two trenches have provided broad sampling widths. Assays are expected within two weeks. If these two trenches have values similar to trenches 1-3, we will have a zone with a minimum 800 metre strike length, widths ranging 15 to 50 metres, and a vertical drop of 400 metres. An extensive drill program will be required to confirm grade consistency and establish depth. I suspect that drilling of this gold zone will yield the sort of long and high grade intersections that this market is eager to go nuts about. Bottom-fishers who bought cheaply should take this opportunity to sell at least 25% of their position. More aggressive speculators and traders should hang on for much 
higher prices on the heels of positive results for trenches 5 and 7 in about two weeks. (JK owns shares

<font size=+1><A NAME="Ma">Mazenod Lake and Olympic Dam Mania</font size>
<P>	
Fortune Minerals (FORM-CDN) was halted at $27 on Thursday. I have not seen the news, but hear Fortune has intersected the right type of mineralization on its Olympic Dam prospect in the NWT. Satellites were up on heavy trading: Avalon Ventures (AVL-V: $1.35), GMD Res Corp (GMD-V: $6.30), Alto Industries
(ATO-V: $0.90), Starcore (SOE-V: $1.05) and Moss Resources (MRS-T: $1.05). Fortune clearly has the best ground, while the rest have strategic ground in the belt. Moss, which has optioned 40% of 31,758 claims 
 from WMC, has the best mystery ground because its claims have extensive Paleozoic cover that hides the sort of evidence that makes the Fortune property exciting. If Fortune has a big Olympic Dam style deposit, the most likely location for another one, based on what can already be seen on the rest of the claims in the belt, is on the Moss ground. More on the Mazenod Lake play as it evolves. (JK owns MRS shares)

<B<Highwood Resources Ltd:  Under New Management</B>
<P>
Most people including myself missed a news release on February 27, 1996 that Mountain Minerals Co Ltd (MIM-T: $0.30) had bought 2,758,771 shares (34.7%) of Highwood Resources Ltd (HWD-T: $1.10, also HIWDF on NASDAQ) at $1.233 each from Conwest Exploration. Conwest is an oil & gas company which had inherited control of Highwood during the eighties when its mining subsidary funded exploration on Highwood's Thor Lake property in the NWT. Conwest was run by ultra-conservatives obsessed with cash flows and returns on equity, and seemingly oblivious to the dynamics of speculative venture capital markets. As a result Highwood has been a market dog since 1988 when Gren Thomas lost control and the push to turn Thor Lake into a beryllium producer fizzled out. Strangely, the market greeted the change of control as a turn for the worse, and sold Highwood down back to its cash breakup level of about $0.80. The stock has since bounced back to the $1.10 level on the strength of accumulati! on by investors such as myself who find it hard to believe that the arrival of new management spells anything but a brighter future for Highwood. After some further digging I have concluded that Highwood is an exceptional buy all the way to the $2 level. Because the stock is relatively illiquid at current prices and has not traded above $2 during the past six years, it is impossible to predict when and where stock will come out. New management is still sorting out its plans for Highwood, but has indicated that dilution of Highwood stock is not on the near-term agenda. I regard Highwood as an important medium-term component of any speculative portfolio, especially for investors concerned that a market crash will ambush this junior bull market later this year. With its focus on rare earths and specialty metals as well as its new home under the wing of the aggressive Royal Oak organization, Highwood is the sort of stock that would flourish in a post-crash bear market when investors a! re eager for exotic plays. The best strategy for investors is to buy some stock up to a $2 limit, wait for the self-fulfilling prophecy to wear itself out, and then do some serious accumulation. Management is not ready to push any buttons yet that will bring new audiences into Highwood's orbit (when and how remains Peggy Witte's secret), but I am confident Highwood will be launched on a double-digit moonshot sooner than later.
<P>
<B>What makes me so bullish on Highwood?</B> At the minimum Highwood is a clean, cash rich shell with intact TSE and NASDAQ listings. We are experiencing the strongest junior resource market in more than a decade, so it makes sense to press this vehicle into service sooner than later. The TSE listing will make institutional financings a piece of cake, and the NASDAQ listing ensures that American brokers can start recommending Highwood to their clients immediately without worrying about penny stock rule paperwork and blue-sky registrations. With working capital of $6.3 million and only 8.2 million fully diluted shares, Highwood at $2 would have a market cap of only $16 million, which is peanuts compared to the pie-in-the-sky valuations of today's hot exploration plays. Peggy Witte and her Royal Oak management team have a reputation for aggressive growth strategies. Royal Oak, which prefers to be a known as a gold producer, holds a 43% equity stake in Mountain Minerals (19.5 million!  shares). Mountain Minerals, in turn, appears to be Royal Oak's vehicle for the development of non precious and base metal assets. Because Royal Oak's upside has become pretty much a function of gold price trends, the American network that helped build Royal Oak is due for a blue-sky distraction. Furthermore, Mountain Minerals, perceived as a plodding industrial minerals producer, would benefit through the appreciation and eventual sale of its investment in Highwood.
<P>
Highwood also happens to be more than a cash-rich shell. The company owns 100% of the Thor Lake property about 100 km southeast of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Highwood acquired the property in 1976 and together with Placer established a resource of 70 million tons of 0.03% tantalum, 0.4% niobium, 3.5% zirconium and 1.7% combined rare earths before Placer pulled out during the early eighties. By the mid-eighties the focus had shifted to the beryllium potential of the T-Zone within the larger complex, where 497,000 tons of 1.4% beryllium oxide and 1.3 million tons of 0.66% BeO have been outlined. In late 1986 Hecla optioned 50% and spent $4 million on a feasibility study that included metallurgical and marketing research. Hecla dropped the option in early 1990 when it became apparent it could not secure purchase commitments for future production. The beryllium market is dominated by Brush Wellman, whose Spor Mountain open-pit mine in Utah accounts for ! more than half the world's production. Optimism that Thor Lake would soon be in production evaporated when the peace dividend arising from the collapse of communism resulted in major cutbacks in the defence and aerospace industries, both major consumers of specialty metals. Further price weakness in the rare earth/specialty metal sector materialized as Chinese production came on stream. Highwood and others have spent at least $11.5 million on Thor Lake, and Highwood still carries on its books $6.26 million of its own expenditures. For the past five years the market has discounted Thor Lake as a long term sleeper. It appears that Royal Oak is eager to take a fresh look at turning Thor Lake into a commercial production situation.
<P>
The rare earth/specialty metals market is dominated by a few major producers such as Molycorp and Brush Wellman who have both the supply and supply contracts locked up. Two key forces will help new producers break into this market: one is demand driven by new applications, the other is technological breakthroughs in processing. Although the defence and aerospace cutbacks that followed the end of the Cold War hurt demand for rare earth and specialty metals such as beryllium, new demand for consumer and industrial applications will develop as the military declassifies top secret information about the properties of these elements. At the same time the users are demanding higher purities. Owners of existing deposits who can develop cost-effective techniques that yield higher grade concentrates from their particular style of mineralization will have a wedge that can help them secure supply contracts. While breaking into this market is normally a "chicken-and-the-egg" problem for!  newcomers, a window of opportunity may be opening up for companies like Highwood. Peggy Witte's metallurgical background may be no small factor in Royal Oak's decision to secure control of Highwood through Mountain Minerals. The beachheads Royal Oak has established in China through Asia Minerals and Mountain Minerals also open up possibilities of deals to exploit abundant rare earth/specialty metal deposits in the Inner Mongolia region of China. A precise game plan does not yet exist, but management has confirmed my speculations are on the right track.
<P>
<font size=+1><A NAME="M0">Mountain Minerals: buy before it stops being a bore</font size>
<P>
What about Mountain Minerals, which has 45.3 million shares issued and 60.9 million fully diluted?
<P>
Mountain Minerals used to be called Trader Resource Corp, which listed in the VSE in 1983 and spent the first phase of its life exploring the Yellow Giant gold prospect on Banks Island in British Coilumbia under the guidance of Bob Dickinson. The Yellow Giant had seen decades of earlier exploration that yielded numerous high grade zones, but Dickinson's goal was to test the property's bulk tonnage potential. Financed by European institutions, Trader churned out wonderful high grade gold intersections which attracted the mining arm of Australia's Elders IXL Ltd. Elders pumped $4.5 million into the treasury in 1987 and emerged as the new boss of Trader, which achieved its TSE listing on May 28, 1987. After the 1987 market crash Trader lost its focus and bounced around as various groups squabbled over its destiny. In 1993 Royal Oak emerged with control and arranged in March 1994 ! for Trader to acquire an industrial minerals producer called Mountain Minerals Co Ltd for $7.4 million. The stock surged from the pennies in 1993 to the $1 level, where First Marathon brokered a private placement of 11,977,000 units at $0.90 on March 1, 1994 to fund the acquisition. The institutional placees probably never knew what hit them, for the stock promptly headed south, eventually bottoming at $0.15 in late 1995. On Jan 3, 1995 Trader changed its name to Mountain Minerals Co Ltd.
<P>
This "boring" industrial minerals producer, which is expected to eke out earnings of about $500,000 and cash flow of about $1 million on revenues of $10-11 million for the year ending Dec 31/95, is a classic bottom-fish emerging from a period of transition. Most of the revenue comes from three divisions: a) barite, which is used as a filler by the automotive and paint industries, and as a drilling mud component for the oil & gas industry, b) silica, which is supplied to Consumers Glass in southern BC, and c) limestone, which is supplied to the central Alberta market. While these operations can be tweaked to improve the bottom-line somewhat, they cannot contribute to significant earnings and revenue growth. The latter must come from new acquisitions and progress in two other divisions. MIM has a Chinese JV that sources barite feedstock from mom & pop operations and produces a filler product for Asian markets. After a bumpy start this project appears to be on track. MIM contr! ols two zeolite deposits near Kamloops, British Columbia that have been undergoing testing for two years. Mine permitting has been completed and MIM plans to market zeolite as a feed and fertilizer additive for the agricultural industry.
<P>
If speculators are to get excited about Mountain Minerals, it certainly won't be about what the company is already doing. Industrial mineral companies only catch the attention of investors when they exhibit a strong growth pattern. But based on the rumblings I am hearing from Royal Oak's Graham Eacott and MIM's new president, Garry Lynkowski, the company will soon stop treading water. If MIM plans to build shareholder value through a growth by acquisition strategy, it will need higher stock prices. As of Sept 30/95 MIM had working capital of $2.2 million, long term debt of $2.4 million and a book value of $13.4 million ($0.30/share). In anticipation of a growth by acquisition campaign, investors should feel comfortable buying Mountain Minerals to the $0.60 level. If MIM negotiates any major acquisitions, it will likely obtain bridge debt financing through its parent, Royal Oak. If the market likes the value added implications of the acquisition, a cash injection in the form!  of 11,977,000 warrants (held by institutions) exercisable at $1.00 until August 15, 1996 becomes a realistic possibility. The key to a higher profile for Mountain Minerals will likely be Highwood. For further information call Royal Oak's Graham Eacott at (206) 822-8992 or Mountain Minerals' Garry Lynkowski at (403) 261-3999. John Kaiser owns shares in Highwood.

George Soros is known as the most powerful and profitable investor in the world.  His Quantum Fund made an astonishing $ 1.1 billion in a single month.

In it, Soros reveals the secrets of his investment strategy and gives his opinions and prediction on current financial trends. Includes his innovative "theory of reflexivity", which underlies not only the investment strategies which have made him "a superstar among money managers" (NY Times), but also his unique view of world events.

In the 1970's Wall Street legend Jim Rogers made what he describes as "more money than I knew existed in the world" managing the Quantum fund with George Soros. At age 37 he retired. In 1990 he and his girlfriend set off on a motorcycle trip around the world, not only to travel, but to learn about the world's developing countries and investment markets by actually going to them. Twenty-two months and 65,076 land miles later and after talking to businessmen, bankers, investors and regular people all over the globe, he tells you who's sinking and who's swimming and where you can make a million and where you can lose your shirt.

<DT><A NAME="what"><STRONG>What is Information Literacy?</STRONG></A>
<P>
<DD>Information literacy is the ability to locate, evaluate, manage, and use information from a 
    range of sources for problem solving, decision making, and research.
    <P>
    With the increasing availability of information through conventional and new
    technologies, information literacy has quickly become one of the most vital
    sets of skills for the twenty-first century.  
<P>
<DT><A NAME="whatliblit"><STRONG>What is Library Literacy?</STRONG></A>
<P>
<DD>Library literacy is a very significant component of information literacy.  One could describe 
    library literacy as <STRONG>the ability to learn what library information can help you, 
    where and how to find it, and knowing how to retrieve and manipulate it in ways that are 
    useful to you once you do find it</STRONG>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="why"><DT><STRONG>Why should I care about Library Literacy?  Isn't
    it merely a buzzword for librarians?</STRONG></A>
<P>
<DD>Information has always been a vital resource conferring advantage on those able to make 
    intelligent use of it.  However, in the emerging information-based world economy of the late 
    twentieth century, information is becoming as valuable as traditional resources such as land, 
    labor, and capital.  In other words, information is gold.  This unprecedented growth in the 
    access to and value of information requires an information-literate work force.
    <P>
    Access to information technology such as the Internet does not confer 
    automatic information-literate status one the person fortunate enough to have such access.  
    Merely having access to information is not enough--to really flourish in the information age, one needs to 
    be library literate.
    <P>
    Library literacy is not an instantly acquired skill.  Instead, it's an ongoing process. 
    To survive, we really need to keep on learning--knowledge tools are changing and developing so 
    quickly that no one can ever afford to stop learning nowadays.  The ideal characteristics of a 
    library-literate person are: an inquiring mind, a sense of the interconnection and limitations 
    of all fields of knowledge, and a repertoire of learning skills.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="imp"><STRONG>Why is Library Literacy important in higher education
    and scholarship?</STRONG></A>
<P>
<DD>The amount and complexity of information with which people have to deal is
    growing exponentially. As a result, no course of study in higher education
    is adequate unless it helps to develop students' ability to deal with the
    burgeoning information in their fields. Faculty and librarians should work
    collaboratively to ensure that students graduating from Carleton College can
    recognize and use library tools and resources they're likely to encounter in
    graduate school, professional school, industry, and other vocations.

<A NAME="more"><H2>How to Become Library Literate</H2></A>
<P>
A way to initiate your commitment to library literacy is to take advantage of
<A HREF="index.html">instruction opportunities</A> offered by our library staff.
If you prefer the &quot;learn-on-your-own&quot; style, we suggest you
investigate the <A HREF="/resources.html">Library Resources</A> link on our main
library web page.  In addition, here are some additional links where you can
learn more about using our library:

the Carleton Library was renamed the Laurence McKinley Gould Library in honor of this former polar explorer, Carleton faculty member,

<H3>Loan Services & Instruction Librarian</H3>
<P>
<strong>Check out my <a href="/webtutorial/welcome.html">HTML</a> and 
<A HREF="/websearch/welcome.html">Web Search</A> resource pages.</strong>
<p>
Greetings.  As you can see, I have a dual title (not uncommon at small college libraries).  
<P>
<strong>Loan Services</strong> refers to all aspects of lending for the Gould Library.  My loan services responsibilities, which I began in January 1996,  include management and policy for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/circ/circ.html">Circulation</A>, and
<LI><A HREF="/reserves/reserves.html">Reserves</A>
</UL>

<P>

<strong><A HREF="/instruction/index.html">Library Instruction</A></strong>, often referred to as <strong>Bibliographic Instruction</strong> or simply <strong>BI</strong>, is the education of library users to become effective information retrievers.  I share my instruction responsibilities with <A HREF="http://www.library.carleton.edu/staff/carolyn/carolyn.html">Carolyn Sanford</A>.  My instruction responsibilities include:
<UL>
<LI>serving in a scheduled on-call Information Services rotation (helping walk-in users) 
<LI>offering tailored in-class presentations for students and faculty (as needed for their course offerings)
<LI>holding one-on-one appointments with students and faculty (for in-depth consultation)
<LI>promoting general Internet competence as part of the library's mission to deliver electronic information to the Carleton Community (networked information "literacy") 
</UL>

From April 1992 through August 1996, I was also primarily responsible for Library <strong>Systems</strong>, which refers to the use and implementation of computerized information tools.  My systems responsibilities at that time involved managing the operation of electronic information products for the Carleton Library, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/muse/muse.html">Muse</A>, the
library's online catalog
<LI>Muse's "behind-the-scenes" components of circulation, reserves, cataloging, inventory, serials control, acquisitions, etc., which library users generally don't see
<LI>the Library's other <A HREF="/electronic/electronic.html">electronic resources</A>, such as locally mounted databases, CD-ROMs, and Internet resources
</UL>

<P>

Beginning with fall term 1996, I have handed over much of the day-to-day Muse responsibilities to our new colleague, <A HREF="/staff/scott">Scott Salzman</A>, so that I can focus my talents and energy on user instruction and devote more time to managing the library's other electronic resources.


<P>   
As you might expect, these are very exciting (and busy) times for librarians.  The rapid pace of technological change, as well as concepts such as "the information superhighway" and "the virtual library," are offering unprecedented opportunities and challenges for our profession.
<P>
I rely heavily on a 
<A HREF="/studentworkers/index.html">cadre of student workers</A>.  If you're interested in information technology, maybe you'd like to <A HREF="/studentworkers/jobs/jobs.html">work for me</A>.  
<P>
If you'd like to read more about my student workers, I recently authored a chapter in a book on this topic.  The chapter's entitled, 
"Student Employees Enhance Internet Expertise for a Liberal Arts
College Library." The chapter appears in <STRONG><CITE>The Internet Initiative:  Libraries
Providing Internet Services and How They Plan, Pay, and Manage</CITE></STRONG> published
in 1995 by the American Library Association.  It's located in our library under:  <KBD>Z674 .I59 1995</KBD>

<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<CENTER><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE FOR THE CARLETON COLLEGE LIBRARY</H2>
May 6th 1985</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>The mission of Carleton College is to create a complementary and supportive,
demanding environment in which students can pursue their education, and where
they can test their interests and abilities and develop a capacity to make
informed, responsible judgments with respect to themselves and the world around
them. The purpose of the library is to support this mission by facilitating the
interaction between users of information and recorded knowledge to the degree
possible within human and economic limitations. To promote this interaction,
facilities, materials, and services of a quality commensurate with that of the
academic program are required. The curriculum should be the primary criterion
for determining the focus of the library in molding these components, if we
acknowledge that the focus of the college is on the teaching of undergraduate
students and that this focus will not change in the forseeable future.</P>


<P>The library must provide an atmosphere that promotes study, encourages
scholarly pursuits, and fosters the academic excellence that is the primary
goal of the College. It does this by maintaining physical space where
individuals and small groups can comfortably engage in formal scholarly
activities or in the serendipitous pursuit of knowledge that a good library will
engender. Space must also be provided, along with necessary furnishings and
equipment, for the convenient storage, retrieval, and use of recorded knowledge
in whatever form may be required by the curriculum, and to the degree feasible,
by the research and other interests of the community.</P>


<P>It is the responsibility of the library to maintain a quality collection of
materials that furthers the purpose and mission of the institution as a whole in
meeting the needs of the undergraduate student. The primary emphasis should be
on those materials likely to be used by faculty in preparing their courses and
by students in doing research related to their studies. Faculty scholarship in
the College is, of course, essential, and it is a secondary mission of the
library to facilitate this by providing the basic materials faculty need to
carry on research to the degree possible within the limited resources available.
However, the intensive collecting of materials that are unlikely to be used by
students in order to support faculty research, or the building of highly
specialized resources to support advanced studies that will never be part of the
Carleton curriculum are outside the scope of the library program at Carleton for
the following reasons:</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>It is far less costly to send faculty to major research collections
than to attempt to duplicate and maintain such collections here.</P>
<P></P>

<LI><P>Faculty needs are usually more long-term and allow for better
planning than those of students.</P>
<P></P>

<LI><P>Faculty have greater access to other collections, interlibrary loan,
and similar forms of resource sharing than do students.</P>
<P></P>

<LI><P>There is no agenda to develop graduate programs, to grow into a
university, or to change the basic focus of the college to anything other
than its undergraduate program.</P>

</UL>


<P>The library must provide services to its users that are designed to
facilitate the identification, location, delivery, and use of recorded
knowledge. If the curriculum determines the focus of the library, then these
services need to be integrated into the teaching and research fiber of the
College. This can be accomplished only through an active and continuing dialogue
between faculty, library staff, and students that has as its goal the
development of maximum facility in the use of recorded knowledge by students.
This is consistent with the goal of the College to prepare students for lifelong
growth and continuing education. The service functions of the library include
the following:</P>

<UL>

<LI>
<P>Maintain library materials in an easily accessible, logical, and
orderly arrangement that conforms to accepted standards and best
meets the needs of all users of the library, and also, manage the
distribution, use, and retrieval of library materials while providing
for their protection and preservation.</P>
<P></P>

<LI>
<P>Identify, through encouraging, facilitating, and coordinating the
active participation of the faculty, the bibliographical and other
resources needed to support present and anticipated curricula and
to develop and manage outstanding undergraduate collections in the
subject fields emphasized at Carleton, and also, maintain a
general library collection suited to the interests and needs of an
educated person as represented by a Carleton undergraduate.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Prepare clear, accurate records in accordance with standards generally
accepted by academic libraries in whatever formats, consistent with
reasonable cost, best facilitate the work of users in identifying
materials pertinent to their needs, make it possible for us to participate
in resource sharing arrangements with others, and expedite the internal
operations of the library.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Provide assistance to users in the manipulation and interpretation of
bibliographical records to identify, locate, and efficiently utilize
library materials and information from any source that is pertinent
to their research, study, or other interests.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Develop, in conjunction with faculty, instructional programs and other
aids to the use of the library and its resources that are designed to help
students make the most efficient and productive use of their time, develop
skills that will enhance their ability to independently utilize this and
other libraries, and gain maximum benefit from our investment in the
library. To this end, the Library Committee will develop a program
statement for library instruction to achieve the following goals:</P>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <P>To educate every student to appreciate the value of the library
    as a means to further one's knowledge about a subject.</P>
    <P></P>
    <li>
    <P>To teach students how to effectively manipulate bibliographic
    systems to collect the relevant, timely, and authoritative
    information necessary to the problem solving process.</P>
    <P></P>
    <li>
    <P>To contribute to students' understanding of specific academic
    fields by acquainting them with the combination of research methodology, 
    organization of knowledge, and types of library resources unique to each
    field.</P>
    </ul>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Arrange easy access to materials that the library does not own by
negotiating and maintaining cooperative arrangements with other
institutions, utilizing cost-effective means of rapidly identifying,
locating, and obtaining needed materials within current legal
restrictions on the use of borrowed materials, and facilitate the use
of borrowed materials within the community.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Manage the business of the library efficiently according to established
principles of library management and in accordance with College policy,
and also, gather, review, and evaluate information on the procedures,
programs, and policies of the library in order to seek means of
improving its effectiveness.</P>
<P></P>

<li>

<P>Keep abreast of the needs of the Carleton library users and of new trends
and technologies that facilitate library operations and services, and
that make the most efficient use of available resources to meet the needs
of all users.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>Foster cultural awareness and appreciation of the book and other library
materials as aesthetic entities by creating displays, etc., and also,
seek out aspects of the collections that might be utilized or developed
to provide a feeling of uniqueness to the library.</P>
<P></P>

<li>
<P>The degree to which the library is fufilling its stated purpose can be measured
by the degree to which its three basic components--facilities, materials, and
services--are reflective of, supportive of, and relevant to the academic
program of the College as expressed by its curriculum.</P>

<CENTER><H2>COLLECTION MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR THE CARLETON COLLEGE LIBRARY</H2>
May 6th 1985</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

<P>Many members of the Carleton community are regularly involved in selecting
library
materials. In pursuing this task, they must deal with a universe of knowledge
that is
vast and constantly changing, along with a universe of publication that includes
an
annual production of over 200,000 monographs in Western languages alone. Given
the
magnitude of the task of determining the tiny fraction of available materials
that
our limited financial resources will allow us to acquire, it seems appropriate
that
we make an effort to agree on guidelines, establish functional working
relationships,
and list what needs to be agreed upon to come to a consensus of what our
objectives
are in managing our library collections.


<P>A stated program will clarify our collection development objectives to our own
constituency and to other institutions we cooperate with. This will help
eliminate
unwanted redundancy, permit more narrow purchasing in some areas and divestiture
of
others, and provide confidence that titles not purchased can be made available
through resource sharing. It will also help establish a framework of priorities
needed to allow systematic, equitable coordination of expenditures that will
permit
us to use available funds in the wisest possible way. We will be better able to
identify costs and alternatives for meeting goals, and to justify any increases
in
budget that may be needed. Other major benefits of a stated program are that it
will
provide a standard against which the effectiveness of our existing practices and
the
adequacy of existing collections can be measured, stimulate a heightened sense of
accountability in decision-making, and influence book selection more than ever
before
by a keen sense of community priorities.


<P>The process of constructing a written program will serve us as a planning tool
and
a communications device. By stating assumptions, using a systematic approach to
knowledge, and preserving the ideas and insights that emerge from the process, we
will be able to reduce uncertainty and ensure that we touch all of the subject
areas we have in the most equitable way possible within the constraints that we
have, and that no subject areas are overlooked. The intent is to define a living
program that will be subject to review and change as the needs and priorities of
the College change, not to set rigid rules. Deviation from standards and
guidelines
for good reason should be perfectly acceptable, so long as there is an
understanding that a deviation is being made and a consciousness of a purpose
that
justifies it.


<P>What we hope to accomplish is to define and to evaluate the status quo, to
develop a
perspective on selection that incorporates all areas of human knowledge, to
identify
new areas of research or new knowledge interests that need to be accomodated by
the
library, and to identify traditional biases in book selection. The process begs a
healthy questioning of selection practices that may make the responsibilities for
collection development more rigorous, but which will help us to do what we do
more
effectively.



<H3>Goal</H3>


<P>The goal of the library collection at Carleton should be quality, not necessarily
quantity. A collection may be said to have quality for its purpose to the degree
that
it is relevant and appropriate in quantity to each discipline taught, to the
level at
which it is taught, and to the number of faculty and students that use it.
Quality can
deteriorate either when appropriate new material is not added, or when unneeded
material is retained. We need the highest possible percentage of materials that
are
likely to be used by those working within the institution's current and
anticipated
academic program. We do not need the tiny fraction our financial and physical
resources can accomodate of the vast body of material that might possibly be of
use to
someone sometime, but for which no specific relevance to current needs can be
seen.


<P>Our purpose is to define what a quality collection for meeting the needs of
Carleton
is, and to establish guidelines for managing our collections in a manner
consistent
with our definition.


<H3>General Considerations
</H3>

<H4>Currency</H4> Emphasis should be on the collection of current materials, since we have
already reviewed and passed judgement on materials published during the past
several decades in the continuing process of book selection. This does not,
however, preclude our acquiring materials of historical interest pertinent to the
curriculum, filling in older materials in new areas of emphasis in the
curriculum, or obtaining materials that may have been overlooked or not purchased
because of personal biases of a selector or selectors in the past.


<H4>Completeness</H4> We should complete collections needed to support our academic
programs,
but we should not seek completeness for its own sake. Seldom-used earlier volumes
of
many periodicals, for example, are readily available from MINITEX. We should also
avoid succumbing to the collector's enthusiasm for assembling all the minor works
and all the variant editions of an author if the materials we have are sufficient
to
support the curriculum.


<H4>Duplication</H4> When the library purchases a duplicate of something it owns, it
forgoes
purchasing something it does not own, thus reducing the total resource available
to
users. Therefore, the purchase of duplicates is always discouraged, though the
following circumstances may justify limited duplication:
<ol>
<p><li>

Multiple demand and heavy continuous use are anticipated, i.e., users
would not have reasonable access without an additional copy.
<p><li>

<P>For extensive reserve assignments. However, library funds should
never be expended to provide a subsidy for avoiding the purchase
of required texts by students.
<p><li>

<P>When required for efficient operation of the library. There are,
for example, a few heavily used basic sources without which neither
the Science Library or the Main Library could effectively function.
</ol>

<P>Library funds will not be used to purchase duplicate copies or other materials
for the sole use of individuals, academic department offices, or administrative
offices.



<H4>Cooperative Development</H4> All collection management decisions will be made in the
context of cooperation with the St. Olaf library. The goal is to build
complementary
collections to expand the resources available to both college communities. An
entirely new level of cooperation will become possible when a union catalog,
including order, in-process, and circulation files becomes available. The
emphasis
will then shift from avoiding duplication of the occasional title to avoiding
duplication of most materials for which a substantial, continuing local need is
not
envisioned.


<H4>Preservation</H4> We must take all possible measures to preserve the materials we need
to have available for use. It is not part of our mission, however, to attempt to
preserve materials unlikely to be used here because they might be lost to the
world
of scholarship if we did not. If there is any question that material not relevant
to current or anticipated programs is unique, it should be offered to a research
library that collects comprehensively in the field, to be disposed of as they see
fit.


<H4>Language</H4> Since English is the language of instruction, the assumption is that
materials in English can be used by more members of the community than those in
other languages. We will normally favor text in English, with the exception of
materials needed to support foreign language curricula, materials where the
primary
interest is not the text, materials essential to a subject that are not available
in
English, and materials that are significantly superior in the original.


<H4>Geography</H4> The collection will generally focus on those geographic areas included
in current and anticipated curricula, or which we have agreed to cover through a
cooperative agreement with St. Olaf and/or other institutions.


<H4>Censorship</H4> The <U>Library Bill of Rights</U> statement of the American Library
Association
is considered part of this collection development document.




<H4>Gifts</H4> The library solicits and encourages gifts of useful material, provided
they meet our collection management criteria, and, provided that there are no
restrictions attached regarding their arrangement or disposition. Gifts provide
many valuable additions to the collection. The following conditions apply to
gifts:

<ol>
<p><li>
<P>Gift materials will be added under the same criteria that apply to
purchased materials. We will not add gift items simply because
they are available to us, or because we do not already hold them.
<p><li>

<P>The library will not accept gifts with conditions as to their
disposition or location except by express permission of the library
director.
<p><li>

<P>The library reserves the right to dispose of unneeded gifts in
whatever manner it sees fit.
<p><li>

<P>Duplicate copies received as gifts will be added only if the
circulation record of the existing copy suggests a single copy is
not sufficient to meet the demand. This does not preclude the
exchange of a gift copy in good condition for a worn or mutilated
existing copy.

<p><li>
<P>The library cannot legally appraise gifts for tax or inheritance
purposes, but it may assist donors in locating prices in book
auction records, etc.
</ol>


<H4>Classes of Material
</H4>

<H5>Paperbacks</H5> A book is purchased in paperback only when it is unavailable in hard
copy at a reasonable price, or a cost saving can be realized by purchasing a copy
in paperback of the same quality as the hardcover version. In general, paperback
books are bound before being added to the collection. Exceptions are the Hubbs
current reading paperback collection and added copies for reserve expected to be
needed for the current year only.


<H5>Textbooks</H5> The library will not normally add textbooks to the collection unless
they constitute a major reference or research work in the field that is not
otherwise available.


<H5>Juveniles</H5> Books for children, young adults, etc. will not be added to the
collection unless specifically needed for use in a course.


<H5>Editions</H5> Variant editions of a title will be added only if they are &quot;standard&quot;
editions or contain substantial changes. This does not apply to updated editions
in scientific and other fields where currency is of importance.


<H5>Rare Books</H5> The library does not normally purchase rare materials, but it does try
to acquire as many examples of various periods and styles of printing, binding,
book illustration, etc., as possible by gift. Materials that are not rare, but
are
fragile, of unusual format, or otherwise in need of special care and protection
are
kept with the rare books.


<H5>Periodicals</H5> The management of serials requires a higher degree of selectivity
than that of books. Initiating a serial subscription implies an ongoing and
costly commitment for many years to come in terms of payments, binding, and
storage. Responsibility for selecting periodicals is shared by faculty and the
library staff. The annual subscription list is essentially pre-selected, the
result of many decisions made over previous decades. The library staff
coordinates periodic reviews of titles of interest to the various departments to
identify items that might be dropped and to gather suggestions for titles to be
added. The results of these reviews are combined and reviewed by the library
staff, taking into account St. Olaf current and planned holdings, interlibrary
loan request records, etc. A list of all planned adds and drops is circulated to
the faculty for comment before changes are made. Because serials costs are
rising at a much faster rate than book costs, every effort is made to hold the
number of subscriptions to the minimum consistent with need, and to coordinate
holdings as much as possible with other Northfield libraries.


<P>The library will normally rely on interlibrary loan for periodical backfiles it
does not hold. Exceptions might be made for material in great demand, as
evidenced by interlibrary loan requests, limited backfiles needed to support a
new area of study, or needed backfiles that for some reason are not available
through interlibrary loan. Microform would be the normal medium for added
backfiles.


<P>Ordering of single issues/volumes, or scattered and incomplete sets of
periodicals
is generally discouraged. Copies of single issues of periodicals for reserves may
be freely ordered for use without cataloging, to be retained only as long as a
current need for them exists. In those rare instances where it appears that a
continuing need for a single periodical issue exists, the library will bind the
issue and add it to the periodicals collection.



<H5>Newspapers</H5> Approximately 40 current subscriptions to major national and
international newspapers are maintained. A few of the major indexed ones are also
received on microfilm. Most newspapers are retained 1-3 months, or until
microfilm
copy arrives. The titles received change little from year to year, but the
library
is happy to receive suggestions for substitute subscriptions that might better
serve the educational program of the college. Any titles suggested will be
reviewed with the periodicals lists. The only newspaper files permanently
retained
in print are Carleton publications.


<H5>Documents U.S.</H5> Government Documents are a special class of materials that are
acquired and maintained under Federal regulations. Management of this material
is covered in a separate policy statement. Documents other than those of the
U.S. Government are treated as books or periodicals, as the case may be.


<H5>Microform</H5> Microform is an invaluable means of storing and making available
material that is bulky and will receive relatively low use, that will deteriorate
rapidly, or that is rare, expensive, or otherwise unavailable. Examples are
newspapers and the American Cultural Series. Microform is normally avoided for
material that is expected to receive heavy use. Printed copies of materials we
hold on microform should not be ordered unless heavy use is anticipated or some
special feature that the film does not provide, such as color illustrations, is
needed.


<H5>Maps</H5> The library collects only those maps placed on deposit by U.S. Defense
Mapping Agency. U.S.G.S. quads are maintained in the Geology Department.


<H5>Other Materials</H5> This policy addresses only those materials--books, periodicals,
newspapers, microform, documents, maps, spoken word recordings--currently
comprising the library collections. Statements regarding the collecting of
other materials will be developed at such time as the library begins collecting
them.


<H4>Separate Collections
</H4>

<H5>Science Library</H5> No distinction is made between the Science Library and the Main
Library for the purpose of general collection management guidelines. Particular
needs of science disciplines will be covered by specific policies to be developed
for each discipline, as they are for other disciplines.


<H5>Archives</H5> Since the Archives is located in the Library and is administratively
under
the College Librarian, the Library/Bookstore Committee recognizes a
responsibility
to advise on policy for the Archives as a part of the Library. A separate policy
statement will be prepared for Archives.



<P>This document states the general goals and guidelines for the library and for
collection management at Carleton. It is the first of three stages in the
process of creating an instrument that will be a reflection of the nature of
the Carleton curriculum and an expression of faculty library needs. It is
intended to foster consistency and good communication between those engaged
in book selection. The completed policy will constitute a commitment of those
selecting library materials throughout the College to maintain the collecting
program described and to make periodic and carefully worked out adjustments
over the months and years ahead that will enable it to serve as a dependable
living instrument of College policy.
<P>
<hr>
<P>The next step will be for faculty in each department to prepare, with the
assistance of a librarian, a 2-3 page document outlining their overall program,
areas of common concern with other departments, points in the general collection
management guidelines that may need to be amplified for the discipline, other
concerns specific to the discipline, a brief overview of the broad fields of
interest to the discipline, and general levels of collecting for each field.


<P>The final stage will be a systematic department by department review that will
collectively touch on all fields of knowledge. The result of this review will
be a detailed profile listing the specific subject areas in which Carleton is
collecting library materials and the level at which collecting is being
carried on in each subject area.


<P>The completed document will enable members of the faculty to be aware of what
is being collected in each subject area of interest to them, whether or not
it falls within a field of general interest to their discipline. They will
also be able to suggest changes in the profile and to comment on all
contemplated changes before they are made.

To borrow material from the Carleton library you must be
registered in the library's circulation computer system and have been issued a
library barcode ID.<BR><BR>

You must present your library barcode ID for any circulation or reserve
transaction. No other form of identification is acceptable.<BR><BR>

Carleton students, faculty and staff are registered automatically and may
pick up their library ID card at the library's circulation desk.  St. Olaf students,
faculty & staff may register the first time they use the
Carleton library.

All others should inquire about their eligibility for a library barcode at the circulation desk.  
A form of identification, such as a driver's license or campus food service card, may be required

<STRONG>Renewals</STRONG><BR><BR> 

Renewals are permitted for renewable items that do not have a hold placed on them. Renewable items are reserve items, term loans, and five week loans.

General collection and open reserve items may be renewed:
<UL>
<LI>before the item is overdue by viewing your circulation record 	on Muse and selecting renew
<LI>by writing "please renew" on the reminder notice and returning the notice to the circulation desk
<LI>in person at the circulation desk
<LI>by e-mail to circadmin@muse.library.carleton.edu
</UL>
Closed reserve items may be renewed:
<UL>
<LI>before the item is overdue by viewing your circulation record 	on Muse and selecting renew
<LI>in person at the circulation desk
</UL> 
Sorry, but we cannot accept renewal requests by telephone.
<BR> <BR> 



<HR><A NAME="H&R">
<STRONG>Holds & Recalls</STRONG><BR><BR> 

A hold may be placed on material that is already checked out. Placing a hold on an item is the 
equivalent of being placed on a waiting list for that item. 
<BR><BR>  
Material is subject to recall if the current borrower has had it for more than two weeks. 
<BR> <BR> 
If an item is recalled it must be returned within four days of the date of recall. 
<BR> <BR> 
Recalled material must be picked up within four days of the date of the notice of availability.
<BR> <BR> 



<HR>
<STRONG>Overdues - General Collection</STRONG><BR><BR> 

The day after an item is due the library's computer system will send a<STRONG> reminder notice.
</STRONG> At this time you should renew or return this item. A week later, if you have not renewed 
or returned the item, an <STRONG>overdue notice </STRONG>will be sent. Two weeks after the item 
was due, a second overdue notice will be sent and your account will be blocked from further 
transactions. A month after the due date you will be billed for the replacement cost of the item.
<BR> <BR> 
You are responsible for the timely return of all materials, whether or not you receive any 
reminder or overdue notices from the library.
<BR><BR> 

<A NAME="OVERDUES">
<STRONG>Overdues - Reserves</STRONG><BR><BR> 
The process for overdue open reserve material is similar to that for general collection material, 
except the interval between overdue notices is three days.
<BR><BR>
The process for closed reserves is different because a system of fines applies. The fine for an 
item being 10 minutes to 60 minutes late is $1.00. An item that is more than one hour late but 
less than two hours late has a fine of $2.00. There is an additional $5.00 fine for each hour 
after that, up to a maximum of $27.00.
<BR><BR>
In addition to the fine incurred, students who keep closed reserve material overdue for more than 
7 hours are referred to the Academic Standing Committee for disciplinary action.
<BR><BR>



<HR><A NAME="NONCIRC"></A>
<STRONG>Non-circulating Material</STRONG><BR><BR> 

The following types of
materials do not usually circulate. Special permission may be given for a
special need. Consult a librarian.<BR> 
<UL> 
<LI>Reference books 
<LI>Special collection books (consult the College Archivist) 
<LI>Microfilm, microfiche

<P>
<DL>
<DD><strong>Library Instruction</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Bibliographic Instruction</strong>
or simply <strong>BI</strong>, is the education of library users to become effective information retrievers 
and consumers.
<P>
<DD>As you might expect, the proliferation of information resources of all types as well as the rapid pace of technological 
change (including concepts such as the "information superhighway" and the "virtual library")
are offering unprecedented opportunities and challenges for our students and faculty.

<BR CLEAR=left><H3>Library Barcode ID</H3>

Anone who would like to borrow material from the Carleton library must be
registered in the librarys circulation computer system and have been issued a
library barcode ID.<BR><BR>

You must present your library barcode ID for any circulation or reserve
transaction. No other form of identification is acceptable.<BR><BR>

Carleton students, faculty and staff are registered automatically and may
pick up their library ID card at the main library circulation desk. Students,
faculty & staff from St. Olaf may register the first time they use the
Carleton library. All others should inquire about their eligibility for a
library ID card at the circulation desk.  A form of identification, such as a driver's
license or campus food service card, may be required to secure the library card.
<BR><BR><BR>
<HR>

<A NAME="LOANS"></a>
<H3>Loan Periods for Reserve Items</H3><p>
There are two classifications of reserve material:<br>
<UL>
<LI><strong><A NAME="OPEN">Open Reserve</a></strong> Open reserve is for optional 
course-related reading. Materials circulate for <strong>two days.</strong> These materials may also be used
in the Library without checking them out.
<br>  
<LI><Strong><A NAME="CLOSED">Closed Reserve</a></strong> Closed reserve is for required 
course-related reading or for optional material needing greater security. Materials 
circulate for <strong>two hours</strong>, or on an overnight basis.<p>
</UL>
Items placed on reserve include Carleton and St. Olaf library materials as well as personal 
copies and photocopies. We do not place items on reserve such as periodicals, special 
collection books, and books from libraries other than Carleton or St. Olaf. Interlibrary 
services is not to be used for obtaining items for reserve.
</ul><br><br>


<HR>
<A NAME="FINES"></a>
<H3>Overdue Penalties for Reserve Items</H3>
The process for overdue open reserve material is similar to that for general
collection material, except the interval between overdue notices is three
days.<BR><BR>

The process for overdue closed reserve material is different because no
overdue notices are sent, and a system of fines applies:<BR><BR>

<table>
<td>10 minutes late to 60 minutes late:<td>$ 1.00<tR> 
<td>More than 1 hour but less than 2 hours late:<td>$ 2.00<tR> 
<td>More than 2 hours but less than 3 hours late:<td>$ 7.00<tR> 
<td>More than 3 hours but less than 4 hours late:<td>$12.00<tR> 
<td>More than 4 hours but less than 5 hours late:<td>$17.00<tR> 
<td>More than 5 hours but less than 6 hours late:<td>$22.00<tR> 
<td>More than 6 hours but less than 7 hours late:<td>$27.00</table><br><br>

In addition to the fine incurred, students who keep closed reserve material
overdue for more than 7 hours are referred to the Academic Standing Committee
automatically for disciplinary action.<BR><BR>
<HR><BR>

<A NAME="ON"></a>
<H2>Placing Material On Reserve</H2>
<br>
<br>
<STRONG>Plan Ahead</STRONG>--Requests for material to be placed on reserve should be 
made two weeks before the material will be needed.  Make sure your 
material is on reserve before making assignments.  <I><STRONG>Due to the volume of 
material placed on reserve, the library cannot offer same day or rush requests for placing
items on reserve.</STRONG></I>When bringing materials to the Reserve Office, indicate your 
name, the course name and number, and whether the materials should be on open or closed 
reserve.  If you wish the Library to purchase any materials to be placed on reserve, 
please notify the Library Acquisitions Department one full term in advance.

</UL>


<HR>
<A NAME="PHOTOCOPY"></a>
<STRONG>Photocopying</STRONG>

<p>
The Library may place excerpts from copyrighted works on reserve for faculty members in 
accordance with copyright guidelines similar to those governing formal classroom 
distribution for face-to-face teaching. These guidelines apply to library reserves, which 
functions as an extension of classroom readings and reflects the student's right to 
photocopy for personal scholastic use. Photocopies may be placed on reserve for class 
assignments and other educational activities, such as advanced independent study and 
research.
<P>
All reserve photocopies must be submitted by the course instructor. <STRONG><I>The Library 
cannot photocopy articles for placement on reserve.</STRONG></I> Please include citation 
information on the first page. Reserve photocopies will be returned to you at the 
conclusion of each course, along with a list of all items on reserve for your course. 
Please save the list if you plan to place the items on reserve again. 
<P>
Examples of photocopied materials which may be placed on reserve include:
<UL>
<LI>a chapter from a book
<LI>an article from a periodical or newspaper
<LI>a short story, short essay, or short poem, whether or not from a collective work
<LI>a chart, diagram, graph, drawing, cartoon or picture from a book, periodical or newspaper
</UL>
You should follow these guidelines when submitting photocopies from copyrighted works for 
placement on reserve.
<UL>
<LI>The amount of material should be reasonable in relation to the total amount of material 
assigned for one term of a course, taking into account the nature of the course, its 
subject matter, and its level. Library reserves should not take the place of a purchased 
textbook, but rather supplement the other course material.
<BR>
<LI>The number of copies should be reasonable in light of the number of students enrolled, 
the difficulty and timing of assignments, and the number of other courses which may assign 
the same material. One copy per 10 -15 students is usually sufficient.
<BR>
<LI>Each copy of the material should contain a copyright notice on the first page. This 
notice consists of: "Copyright   [year], [name of copyright owner]". An example would be 
copyright  1983, Alice Walker. Such a notice is often already present on the first page 
of a journal article. The information needed to compose such a notice is usually available 
on the title page of the work.
<BR>
<LI>Only photocopy the material if doing so does not harm the market for the work. (In 
general, the Library should own at least one copy of the work.) The number of articles or 
chapters photocopied from a single journal issue or book should be limited. A collection 
of copies comprising an entire journal issue or book will not be accepted for reserve. The 
reserve use of the same photocopied materials in multiple courses or successive years 
usually requires advance permission from the owner of the copyright.

<BR>
<P>Works in the public domain (not protected by copyright) may always be placed on reserve, 
within the space limitation of 5 copies per item.
<P>
Copyrighted works may also be placed on reserve in excess of the guidelines (but within 
the space limitations of 5 copies) when permission to engage in such practice has been 
obtained from the copyright owner.
<P><BR>



<STRONG>The U.S. Copyright Law is as follows:</STRONG><p>
<UL>
<LI>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the
making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material.
<LI>Under certain conditions specific in the law, libraries and archives are authorized 
to furnish a photocopy or reproduction.  One of these specified conditions is that the 
photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, 
scholarship, or research."  If a user makers a request for, or later uses, a photocopy
or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use", that user may be liable for 
copyright enfringement.
<LI>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its 
judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
</UL><br>



<STRONG>How To Obtain Permission To Copy</STRONG>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the instructor to obtain permission from copyright owners to 
photocopy in excess of the guidelines described above. In some instances, the publisher 
may assess a fee for the permission. This fee would also be the instructor's 
responsibility. The American Association of Publishers suggests that the following 
information be included in a permission request letter to the copyright owner:
<UL>
<LI>title, author and/or editor, and edition of materials to be duplicated
<LI>exact material to be used, giving amount, page numbers, chapters, and, if possible, a 
photocopy of the material
<LI>number of copies to be made
<LI>purpose of duplicated materials
<LI>form of distribution (classroom, newsletter, etc.)
<LI>whether or not the material is to be sold
<LI>type of reprint (ditto, photography, offset, typeset)
</UL>
<P>
The request should be sent, together with a self-addressed return envelope, to the 
permissions department of the publisher in question. If the address of the publisher does 
not appear in the material, it may be obtained in The Literary Marketplace, published by 
the R. R. Bowker Company and shelved under call number PN161 .L5 in the Gould Library 
Reference collection.
<P>
The process of granting permission requires time for the publisher to check the status of 
the copyright and to evaluate the nature of the request. It is advisable, therefore, to 
allow enough lead time to obtain permission before the materials are needed. 
<P>
The Copyright Clearance Center also has the right to grant permission and collect fees for 
photocopying rights for certain publications. Dealing with the CCC, when applicable, can 
often prove more efficient than dealing directly with publishers.  Their address is:

<p><cite>Library Lingo</cite></p>

<p>Copyright 1987, 1990 by C. Berger and Company</p>

<p>Printed in the United States of America

<p><b>Special thanks</b> to Dr. Andrew Torok of Northern Illinois University, Maureen Morrissey, Linda Ferguson, Janet Russell, and the entire CBC staff for their assistance with this project.</p>

<h3 align=center><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>

<p align=center><i>"All words are pegs to hang ideas on. "<br>
Henry Ward Beecher</i></p>

<p align=center><i>"A very great part of the mischiefs that vex
this world arise from words."<br>
Edmund Burke</i></p>

<p>Whether one agrees with Beecher or Burke probably depends on one's most recent brush with jargon. Certainly it's true that specialized language has the ability to either improve or impede the communication process. To improve it is the purpose of this publication.

<p>This glossary attempts to do two things: to sort out those special words and acronyms bandied about so freely by librarians and information specialists and to provide concise definitions that can be quickly understood by non-librarians.

<p>As you go through the glossary, please note that when a term within a definition is in <i>italics</i>, that term is included with its own definition elsewhere in the glossary. The terms are listed alphabetically and in the back you will find them categorized to show relationships.

<p>Many sources were checked in developing <cite>Library Lingo</cite>. Some of the definitions are amalgams, with an effort toward simplification. Others are taken from these sources:

<p>*Reprinted with permission of the American Library Association, definitions taken from <cite>Glossary of Library Terms</cite>, <cite>ALA Glossary of Library Terms</cite>, and <cite>The ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science</cite>, copyright 1969, 1943, and 1983 by ALA.

<p>**Reprinted with the permission of Gower Publishing Company Ltd., definitions taken from <cite>Harrod's Librarians' Glossary and Reference Book</cite>, 5th and 6th editions, copyright 1984 and 1987 by Gower.

<dt><b>book sizes</b></dt>
<dd>There is much confusion about the definition of book sizes and little consistency in usage.  The common book trade designation of sizes was based originally on the relation to a sheet of paper measuring approximately 19 x 25 inches. When folded once to make two leaves (4 pages), it was a folio; when folded twice to make four leaves (8 pages), it was a quarto; when folded to eight leaves (16 pages), an octavio; when folded to 12 leaves (24 pages), a duodecimo or twelvemo; when folded to 16 leaves (32 pages), a sixteenmo, etc.  This is the historical background of book sizes and isthe basis of terms still used in the rare book trade.  In exact bibliographical descriptions, as in describing rare books, the historical definition applies.<p>
  However, present trade practice almost invariably refers to a measurement of the height of the binding, not the size of the leaf.  Usual library practice calls for the use of centimeters, the measurement again referring to the height of the binding.<p>
  With the present variety of paper sizes, all dimensions are approximate:<p>
  Folio, F, over 30 cm. (approx. 15 in.) high.<br>
  Quarto, 4to, 30 cm. (approx. 12 in.) high.<br>
  Octavo, 8vo, 25 cm. (approx. 9 3/4 in.) high.<br>
  Duodecimo or twelvemo, 12mo, 20 cm. (approx. 7 3/4 in.) high.<br>
  Sixteenmo, 16mo, 17 1/2 cm. (approx. 6 3/4 in.) high.<br>
  Twentyfourmo, 24mo, 15 cm. (approx. 5 3/4 in.) high.<br>
  Thirtytwomo, 32mo, approx. 5 in. high.<br>
  Fortyeightmo, 48mo, approx. 4 in. high.<br>
  Sixtyfourmo, 64mo, approx. 3 in. high.<br>
  Other sizes include:<br>
  Double elephant folio, approx 50 in. high<br>
  Atlas folio, approx 25 in. high<br>
  Elephant folio, approx 23 in. high<p>
  Any book wider than it is high is designated as oblong and such descriptive note is abbreviated "obl." or "ob." and precedes such terms as quarto, octavo, etc.  If the width of the book is less than three-fifths of its height, it is designated narrow and such descriptive note is abbreviated "nar."  If the width of the book exceeds three-fourths of its height, but is no greater than its height, it is designated square.  (Bookman's Glossary)</dd>

<TITLE>Superintendent of Documents Classification System</TITLE>
</Head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<center><H1>The SUDOC Classification System</H1></center>
The Documents Collection is shelved by SUDOCS (Superintendent of Documents)
number.  The basis of this system is to group together Government Publications
by author, author meaning the department, commission, or agency that issued the
publication.  It is an alphanumeric system.<BR>
<P>
<H4><EM>How it works</EM></H4>
A sample number is <TT>J 1.14/7: 983</TT><BR>
Each agency, commission, department, conngress, et. al. is assigned a letter
designation usually based on the name of the agency.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><TT>A</TT> = Department of Agriculture
<LI><TT>C</TT> = Department of Commerce
<LI><TT>X,Y</TT> = Congressional Publications
</UL><BR>
These letter designations place the material on shelves <EM>by department or
agency</EM> in A - Y order.<BR>
<P>
The letter designation is generally followed by a set of numbers.  These
numbers specify the particular agency within the department, the type of
publication, and the specific publication number or edition.<P>
For Example <TT>J 1.14/7: 983</TT> is the SUDOCS call number for the 1983
edition of <STRONG>Uniform Crime Reports</STRONG>.<BR>
<TT>J</TT> = Parent agency or in this case the Department of Justice<BR>
<TT>  1.14</TT> = The subagency or in this case the Federal Bureau of Investigation<BR>
<TT>       7</TT> = Type of publication or in this case the <STRONG>Uniform Crime Reports</STRONG><BR>
<TT>         983</TT> = Specific publication or in this case the 1983 edition<P>
Another Example <TT>L 2.3: 1757</TT> is the call number for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics <STRONG>Bulletin no. 1757</STRONG>.<BR>
<TT>L</TT> = Parent Agency - Department of Labor<BR>
<TT>  2</TT> = Subagency - Bureau of Labor Statistics<BR>
<TT>    3</TT> = Type of publication - in this case a bulletin<BR>
<TT>       1757</TT> = Specific publication - Bulletin # 1757<BR>
<P>
There are some government agencies which receive special treatment in the
assignment of SUDOCS numbers.  One of the most common of these is Congress and
its working commitees.  The working committees of congress such as the
appropriations, judiciary, etc. are assigned a combination letter/number
designation.<BR>
For example, <TT>Y4.J89/2:AR5/5</TT> - designates a publication entitled
<STRONG>The Right to Keep and Bear Arms</STRONG>.<BR>
<TT>Y</TT> = Congress
<TT>   J89</TT> = Commitee on Judiciary
<TT>       2</TT> = Senate Judiciary (1 stands for House)
<TT>         AR5.5</TT> = represents the specific publication - the
<EM>AR</EM> is taken from the most significant word of the title, in this case
<EM>Arms</EM>.<BR>
<P>
In order to find a peice on the shelf, it is important to know that numbers are always treated as <EM>whole numbers</EM> (not decimals as in dewey or LC classifications) and that any punctuation (periods, slashes) separates whole numbers from each other.  Letters within distinct parts of a call number are shelved alphabetically.<BR>
For example,
<PRE>
  <U>1</U>.201:    is shelved before    <U>2</U>.2:
  1.<U>3</U>:      is shelved before    1.<U>201</U>:
 12.<U>2</U>:      is shelved before   12.<U>2/2</U>:
 Y4.<U>AP</U>6/2:  is shelved before   Y4.<U>AR</U>5/2:
 Y4.<U>V</U>64/3:  is shelved before   Y4.<U>W</U>36:
</PRE>

<DT><NAME="what is"><STRONG>What is Muse?</STRONG></A>
<DL>Muse is the pet name for Carleton Library's OPAC 
<A HREF="http://www.library.carleton.edu/catalogs/regionalcats.html">
(online public access catalog)</A>. 
More specifically, Muse is an integrated library computer system from 
<A HREF="http://herald.usask.ca/~scottp/iii.html">Innovative Interfaces Inc.</A> 
(referred to as III) running on a DEC Alpha 3000 computer.
<P>
<DT><NAME="whycall"><STRONG>What Call it Muse?</STRONG></A>
<DD>In classical mythology, the Muses were the daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus. They were not only divine
singers, whose chorales and hymns delighted Zeus and other gods: they also presided over thought in all 
its forms:  eloquence, persuasion, knowledge, history, mathematics, astronomy.
<P>
From the classical period the number of Muses was standardized to nine, and the following list was 
generally accepted:  Clio, Polyhymnia, Euterpe, Terpsichore, Erato, Melpomene, Thalia, and Urania.<A HREF="#*">*</A>  
It was only gradually that each came to be attributed with a specific function, and these vary from 
one author to another.  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Calliope, the first of them all in dignity, was said to be the Muse of epic poetry,
<LI>Clio of history,
<LI>Polyhymnia of mime,
<LI>Euterpe of the flute,
<LI>Terpischore of light verse and dance,
<LI>Erato of lyric choral poetry [and erotica],
<LI>Melpomene of tragedy,
<LI>Thalia of comedy, and
<LI>Urania of astronomy.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="*">*Grimal, Pierre, <STRONG>Dictionary of Classical Mythology</STRONG>, New York, NY : Blackwell, 1986</A> 
<P>
<DT><NAME="access"><STRONG>How to Access Muse</STRONG></A>
<DD>Muse is available at the College Library, or you can access it remotely via telnet:
<KBD><STRONG>muse.library.carleton.edu</STRONG><KBD>
<P>
Note: Most computers on the Carleton campus will connect to Muse via telnet if you supply the word:   
<KBD><STRONG>muse</STRONG><KBD>
<P>
However, you need the full address listed above to access Muse from outside the Carleton community.
<P>
<DT><NAME="usefor"><STRONG>What do I use Muse for?</STRONG></A>
<DD>Muse is the primary finding tool for materials owned by the Carleton Library, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>books (both owned and on order)
<LI>other book-like items such as subject bibliographies, indexes, encyclopedias, handbooks, dictionaries,
	almanacs, atlases, etc.
<LI>many U.S. government documents (1976- )
<LI>periodical titles (journals, magazines,  newspapers, etc.)
</UL>
<P>
These items are <CITE>not</CITE> found in Muse:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>full text of periodical articles
<LI>most video and films owned by the Media Center
<LI>most U.S. government documents published prior to 1976
<LI>scores and recording owned by the Music Department
</UL>
<P>
<DT><NAME="review"><STRONG>Reviewing Your Patron Information, Renewing Items, & Placing Holds on Checked-Out Items</STRONG></A>
<DD>At any time, you can check the status of items you have borrowed from the library and when they're due back. 
If you discover that you need more time to use a book you've already checked out, you can renew the loan on the item.  
If you discover that a book you want is checked out, you can place a hold on that book yourself.
<P>
<DT><NAME="status"><STRONG>Status of Library Materials</STRONG></A>
<DD>Not only is Muse a catalog, but it also controls circulation of library materials. This means that an item's 
status is displayed along with the call number.  If a book is checked out, you can see its due date.
<P>
<DT><NAME="email"><STRONG>E-mail of Overdue Notices</STRONG></A>
<DD>If you wish, you can request that library notices come to you in the form of e-mail messages. 
Ask at the Circulation Desk about how to arrange for this.
<P>
<DT><NAME="howtouse"><STRONG>How do I use Muse?</STRONG></A>
<DD>Muse employs a "menu-driven" search interface, which means that you never have to memorize 
confusing commands. All options available to you at any particular location within Muse are indicated 
on the screen.  Decide which option you want from the menu, and press the corresponding key.
<P>
<DT><NAME="getinfo"><STRONG>Getting Information & Making Suggestions</STRONG></A>
<DD><KBD><STRONG>I > Library INFORMATION</STRONG></KBD> contains answers to the most frequently asked 
questions about the library and its services. You can notify library staff about additional items 
the library should purchase by choosing  <KBD><STRONG>A > ADDITIONAL</STRONG></KBD> items the library 
should acquire.  If you wish to make suggestions about library services in general, select the option  
<KBD><STRONG>S > SUGGESTIONS</STRONG></KBD>.
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Basic Searching</H2>
<DL>
<DT><NAME="word"><STRONG>W > WORDS in the subjects, titles, and contents</STRONG></A> 
<DD>Use the WORD index to perform keyword searches when you don't have a specific Library of Congress 
    Subject Heading, title, or author in mind.  Example:  <KBD><STRONG>w movies</STRONG></KBD>
    <P>
    <STRONG>Truncation</STRONG>  Perform right truncation in the WORD index by using the * symbol:
	Example:  <KBD><STRONG>w cat*</STRONG></KBD> (retrieves the words <KBD><STRONG>cat</STRONG></KBD>, 
	<KBD><STRONG>catalog</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>catalogs</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>catacombs</STRONG></KBD>, 
	<KBD><STRONG>catastrophes</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>cats</STRONG></KBD>, etc.)
    <P>
    <STRONG>Boolean operators</STRONG>  Perform boolean word searches by using the operators 
    <STRONG>AND</STRONG>, <STRONG>OR</STRONG>, or <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> (or <STRONG>NO</STRONG>).
    <P>Examples:
    <P><UL>
       <LI><KBD><STRONG>w cat and dog</STRONG></KBD> (retrieves items that contain both words <KBD><STRONG>cat</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>dog</STRONG></KBD>) 
	   <LI><KBD><STRONG>w cat or dog</STRONG></KBD> (retrieves items that contain the word <KBD><STRONG>cat</STRONG></KBD> and items that contain the word <KBD><STRONG>dog</STRONG></KBD>)
	   <LI><KBD><STRONG>w cat not dog</STRONG></KBD> (retrieves items that contain the word cat, but not items that contain dog)
	Note:  Searching two words without an operator is the same as using <KBD><STRONG>AND (<KBD><STRONG>cat dog = cat and dog)

Nested searches - Use parenthetical expressions in WORD searches. Parenthetical expressions can contain 
the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT (or NO); they can also be nested.

	Examples:  sonata not (baroque or piano)	
		   sonata not baroque not piano
<P>
<DT><NAME="author"><STRONG>A > AUTHOR</STRONG></A> 
<DD>Use the AUTHOR index to find works written by a particular person or organization.  Note:  enter the last name 
first.  Example:  <KBD><STRONG>a silko, leslie marmon</STRONG></KBD>
<P>
<DT><NAME="title"><STRONG>T > TITLE</STRONG></A> 
<DD>Use the TITLE index when you know the exact title of the item you need. Examples:  
<KBD><STRONG>t almanac of the dead</STRONG></KBD> or <KBD><STRONG>t journal of geology</STRONG></KBD>
<P>
<STRONG>Tip on Using Initial Articles</STRONG> - You may choose to enter or not enter initial articles 
(e.g., <CITE>a</CITE>, <CITE>an</CITE>, <CITE>the</CITE>, <CITE>le</CITE>, <CITE>der</CITE>, etc.); either way, 
Muse will retrieve the same record(s). For example, you may input the title <KBD><STRONG>The New Yorker</STRONG></KBD> 
or <KBD><STRONG>New Yorker</STRONG></KBD>, or <KBD><STRONG>A farewell to arms</STRONG></KBD> or 
<KBD><STRONG>Farewell to arms</STRONG></KBD>; in either case, Muse will retrieve the correct record(s).
<P>
If you wish to retrieve titles beginning with a word which is normally considered to be an initial article, 
type the initial article twice when performing the search. Examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To search for:  <CITE>A to Z, the Alphabet</CITE>
<LI>Enter:  </STRONG></KBD>a a to z, the alphabet</STRONG></KBD>
</UL>
<P>
<DT><NAME="author/title"><STRONG>B > AUTHOR/TITLE</STRONG></A> 
<DD>Use the AUTHOR/TITLE index for better precision if you already know the author and title of the work you need.

	Examples:  b silko, leslie <RETURN>
		      almanac
<P>
<DT><NAME="subject"><STRONG>S > SUBJECT (Library of Congress)</A>
<DD>Perform a SUBJECT search only when you know the precise Library of Congress subject heading you need. 
If you don't know the precise subject heading you need, do a WORD search on your topic and examine the 
subject headings of the items you retrieve. Or consult the four volume Library of Congress Subject Headings, 18th ed. near the Reference Desk. 

	Example:  s motion picture			s indians of north america

<DT><NAME="numbers"><STRONG>N > NUMBERS</STRONG></A>
<DD>Select the NUMBER index when you already have the number in one of these categories:
<P>
<STRONG>
<PRE>
		C > CALL numbers (Library of Congress) 
		I > ISBN, ISSN, Recording numbers
		G > GOVERNMENT Documents (U.S. Superintendent of Documents)
</PRE>
</STRONG>
<P> 
<DT><NAME="repeat"><STRONG>P > Repeat PREVIOUS Search</STRONG></A>
<DD>If you need to repeat the previous search, select this option. Up to <CITE>ten</CITE> of your 
most recent searches can be repeated: <KBD><STRONG>p [select from list]</STRONG></KBD>
<P>
<DT><NAME="wilson"><STRONG>J > Wilson JOURNAL Citation Indexes</STRONG></A>
<DD>Use this resource to identify journal articles which have been included in the following indexes since 1990- :
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Art Index
<LI><CITE>Biological & Agricultural Index
<LI><CITE>Social Sciences Index
<LI><CITE>General Science Index
<LI><CITE>Humanities Index
<LI><CITE>Business Periodicals Index
<LI><CITE>Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature
</UL>
<P>
<DT><NAME="wilson"><STRONG>J > Wilson JOURNAL Citation Indexes</STRONG></A>		
	 C > CONNECT to another resource

	Use this option to make automatic connections to  
	a select group of other online library catalogs and 
	databases of value to the Carleton community. 

 
<DT><NAME="wilson"><STRONG>J > Wilson JOURNAL Citation Indexes</STRONG></A>		
	 V > VIEW your circulation record

	This option allows you to retrieve the following 
	information: 

		C > Display CHECKED OUT items
								H > Display HELD items
								F > Display FINES
<DT><NAME="wilson"><STRONG>J > Wilson JOURNAL Citation Indexes</STRONG></A>
   R > RESERVE Lists
  
Select this item to identify materials being held 
on course reserve 

	P > Retrieve by PROFESSOR
	C > Retrieve by COURSE
 
<DT><NAME="quit"><STRONG>Q > QUIT</STRONG></A>
<DD>Use this feature to exit from Muse.
<P> 
<H2>General Muse Tips</H2>
<DT><NAME="caps"><STRONG>Capitalization</STRONG></A>
<DD>You may enter search statements in uppercase or lowercase (or mixed case). Muse is not sensitive to case, 
since it translates all search statements to lowercase.
<P>
<DT><NAME="punc"><STRONG>Punctuation</STRONG></A>
<DD>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Muse treats the ampersand (&) as if it were the word "and" spelled out.
<LI>Apostrophes are removed.
<LI>Most other punctuation marks are replaced by spaces.
<LI>Repeated punctuation marks or repeated spaces are treated as a blank space. Whether or not 
these punctuation marks are included has no effect on your search.
</UL>
<P>
<DT><NAME="return"><STRONG><RETURN> shortcut</STRONG></A>
<DD>Much of the time in Muse, you don't need to use the <RETURN> key. You really need to use 
it only when executing a search from the search screens, or when you make a menu selection 
from a menu which has more than 9 choices.
<P>
<DT><NAME="suptrunc"><STRONG>Suppressing Truncation</STRONG></A>
<DD>Searches performed in the AUTHOR, TITLE, AUTHOR/TITLE, or SUBJECT indexes are considered "phrase searches" 
(as opposed to keyword and number searches). Muse records containing a heading which  begins with a particular 
phrase may be retrieved by entering as much or as little of the phrase as desired.
<P>
For example, keying an AUTHOR search for <KBD><STRONG>smith</STRONG></KBD> will retrieve all the records containing 
<KBD><STRONG>Smithsonian</STRONG></KBD> as an author, as well as all those containing <KBD><STRONG>smith</STRONG></KBD>.
 Entering <KBD><STRONG>sm</STRONG></KBD> will retrieve all records containing authors whose names begin with 
<KBD><STRONG>sm</STRONG></KBD>, such as <KBD><STRONG>Smythe</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>Smart</STRONG></KBD>, etc. 
<P>
To instruct Muse to restrict a search to just the search statement entered (and not to expand it by searching the 
index for all headings beginning with the search statement), key a vertical bar (<KBD><STRONG>|</STRONG></KBD>) 
at the end of the search statement (e.g., the search for <KBD><STRONG>cat|</STRONG></KBD> will only retrieve 
records with the heading <KBD><STRONG>cat</STRONG></KBD>, not records containing headings <CITE>beginning</CITE> with 
<KBD><STRONG>cat</STRONG></KBD>, such as <KBD><STRONG>catalog</STRONG></KBD> or <KBD><STRONG>catch</STRONG></KBD>, 
or <KBD><STRONG>cat domestic</STRONG></KBD>, etc.).
<P>
The vertical bar, sometimes called a pipe, is ususally located on the key with the backslash on most keyboards. 
<P>
<DT><NAME="limit"><STRONG>Limiting a Search</STRONG></A>
<DD>Limit a searchby choosing <KBD><STRONG>L</STRONG></KBD> from the menu after performing  that search. 
You can limit your search by any several fields, including language, material format, location, and the other 
options illustrated here:
<P>
<STRONG>
<PRE>
                         L > LANGUAGE
                         M > MATERIAL type
                         B > BIBLIOGRAPHIC level
                         A > Words in the AUTHOR
                         T > Words in the TITLE
                         S > Words in the SUBJECT
                         P > PUBLISHER

<DT><NAME="browse"><STRONG>Browsing the Shelves & Finding Related Items</STRONG></A>
<DD>

    <LI><STRONG><A HREF="/electronic/cd-rom/cd-rom.html">Stand-Alone CD-ROM Databases</A></STRONG>

    Most of these resources are online sources that you can use from any Internet-accessible location

encouraged them to stake their claim to a small chunk of cyberspace to talk about themselves a bit.  So 
if you're curious about what today's small liberal arts college students are up to, interested 
in making new 'net friends, or just plain bored, take a look at their home pages.

<P>
Terry is Carleton's <strong>Loan Services &amp; Instruction Librarian</strong>.  
He arrived in April of 1992 and has overseen a lot of technological changes in the 
library during the past four and one-half years.
<P>
From 1986-1992, Terry served as Consortium Manager for Cooperating Libraries in Consortium (CLIC),
a non-profit consortium of seven private liberal arts college libraries in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/
St. Paul, Minnesota:

</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
His first library employment was at <A HREF="http://www.hamline.edu/library/index.html">Hamline University's Bush Library</A> in St. Paul, Minnesota, between 1981-1986.
<P>
Terry received B.A. degrees in business administration and geography from <A HREF="http://www.gac.edu/">
Gustavus Adolphus College</A> in 1980, and an M.A. in library science from the <A HREF="http://www.umn.edu/tc/">
University of Minnesota</A> in 1985.
<P>
Terry is a military history enthusiast who can tell you a lot about aerial and naval warfare, particularly in WWI and WWII.  His favorite naval interest is WWII naval combat in the Pacific Theater, although he can tell you a fair amount about the war in the Atlantic, too, such as the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship <I>Bismarck</I>.
<P>
Behind his back, we say that Terry's a bathtub admiral who missed his calling as a naval intelligence officer.
<P>
Terry is also an American Civil War buff.  He's visited and tramped over many Civil War battlefields.

<A NAME="lockers"><H3>Lockers</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>Library lockers are located on the lower three levels of the main library.  Students may sign up for a locker and get a key at the circulation desk.  
<LI>Lockers are to be used for the storage of personal items and library materials that HAVE BEEN CHECKED OUT.
<LI>Lockers are subject to periodic searches.  Students are responsible for whatever is found in their lockers.
<LI>Students should keep their lockers locked.  The College is not responsible for stolen articles.
<LI>Students should empty their lockers before turning in the key.
<li>Keys must be returned before Commencement Day each year.  A $10 lock replacement fine is applicable to those who do not turn in their keys.
</UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="phones"><H3>Public Telephones</H3></A>
Public phones are available throughout the Library.  A payphone is located in the lobby
on the fourth floor, and campus phones are on the landings of the west stairway
on the other floors.  There is also a phone in the computer area on the third floor
Holo Deck.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="food"><H3>Food & Drink Policy</H3></A>
Absolutely no food or drink is allowed in the library.  Food and drink are incompatible
with the libary's mission of preserving needed teaching and research materials.  
Spills and food stains cause rapid deterioration of paper materials, resulting in their
loss and significant additional costs to the library for their replacement.  An even
more serious problem is that food and drink attracts insects and other creatures
that infest the books and periodicals and damage paper and glue.  
<P>
The College has gone to considerable effort and expense to provide a library
environment that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also provides optimum
conditions of temperature and humidity for preservation of resources.  We need
the assistance of all patrons and staff to help keep the the library in top condition.

the Carleton Library has to offer.

<DT><STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>
Library instruction focuses on developing students' critical thinking skills to
find the information they seek.  The plethora of materials and formats can be
overwhelming for inexperienced library users.  An introductory session in
research strategy, online searching techniques, networking sources, and
electronic access to information can help your students become more productive
information seekers and reduce their anxiety about using an academic library.
<P>
Carleton's libraries contain wonderful resources that will greatly assist
students in research and general studying.  Many of these resources go untapped
for lack of knowledge; library instruction is one way to remedy this situation.
Nearly every discipline can benefit from some type of library instruction.
Please read on for descriptions of the different types of instruction
available.  Keep in mind that flexibility is our goal and the options may not
be limited to what is listed.  The library staff would be happy to tailor a
session to your specific needs.

<A NAME="poss">
<DT><STRONG>Possibilities</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>We consult with a faculty member concerning the objectives
of the course, course content, materials covered, and course assignment.  The
program is then created specifically for the course to fit the instructor's
time frame and assignments.  Usually one instruction session is arranged during
the regular class period, although other arrangements can be made.
<p>
Programs and materials currently available for both group and individual
instruction are:
<P>
<UL>
<DL>
<DT><EM>Instruction Class in the Library or Computer Lab</EM>
<DD>The students spend one or more class sessions in the library or computer lab.  A
librarian explains how to use library resources in a particular field and
answers any questions the students might have.  Students are encouraged to make
individual research appointments to follow-up a class session.
<P>
<DT><EM>Focused Library Visits</EM>
<DD>Students come to the library to learn how to use one or just a few sources in
their field.  CD-ROM searching techniques often fall into this category.
<P>
<DT><EM>Bibliographies</EM>
<DD>Librarians will provide a customized bibliography (both paper and on the Web)
that highlights the library's sources relating to a course or subject area.

<DT><STRONG>Procedures</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>Faculty are encouraged to schedule their classes as far in advance as possible.
At least two weeks' lead time between the date the request is made and the date
of the session is preferred.  <A HREF="/staff/carolyn/carolyn.html">Carolyn Sanford</A> 
will coordinate and schedule the sessions, but other librarians
may be involved in the actual teaching of the classes.  Carolyn can
be reached directly at x4266, or you may initiate a request via e-mail;
She can be reached as </kbd>csanford</kbd>.
<P>
If you think Library Instruction can benefit you and your students, please
don't hesitate to contact us.  We are eager to discuss
the possibilities with you.

<h3>Bibliographies</h3>

Bibliographies are lists of materials on a particular topic.  They should save you time because the author has done
the tedious work of searching catalogs and indexes to find information on the topic. Many bibliographies also contain 
evaluations of the works that they mention.  Listed here are several general titles, but note that we have
bibliographies soley on individual topics as well. (Try a keyword search on Muse to find some.  For example,
type: <STRONG><KBD>homer bibliography</KBD></STRONG> to find some bibliographies on homer.)

<h3>Bibliographies</h3>

Bibliographies are lists of materials on a particular topic.  They should save you time because the author has done
the tedious work of searching catalogs and indexes to find information on the topic. Many bibliographies also contain 
evaluations of the works that they mention.  Listed here are several general titles, but note that we have
bibliographies soley on individual authors as well. (Try a keyword search on Muse to find some.  For example,
type: <STRONG><KBD>valery bibliography</KBD></STRONG> to find some bibliographies on Paul Valery.)

<CENTER><H4><A NAME="cdescription">Course Description</A></H4></CENTER>
<P>This course is a survey of the social, cultural, and intellectual history of people of African descent in the United States from 1619 through 1865. The years bracket the arrival of the first Africans in Virginia colony and in mainland British North America and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery and involuntary servitude. The Winter 1997 version of History 220 treats in greater detail the precolonial African background of American blacks and the involvement of black women in the struggle for freedom.</P>
<P>Slavery is the major core historical experience of black Americans. In the apt observation of the late Cornell University Professor and African American scholar J. Saunders Redding, an &quot;iron ring of historical circumstance&quot; unites American black people. The transfer of millions of people from Africa to the Americas and their experiences in the Atlantic World are sources of searching questions and debates among scholars and students of history. Slavery represents a subject of continuing vitality and fresh investigation. Its legacy informs the essential importance of African American history in revising the American master narrative. For reasons, then, that touch upon issues of scholarship and identity, the course is devoted in major part to the study of the origin, development, and destruction of the slave institution.</P>
<P>This course also treats another major group of people of color who were critically linked to the slave population: Free Negroes. This course examines the various strategies free blacks employed toward self-mastery, intra-group uplift, and the destruction of slavery. Finally, the course looks at the roles a distinct minority of  fearless and committed Euroamericans played in black liberation.</P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME="ctheme">Major Theme and Tools of Analyses</A></H4></CENTER>
<P>The major theme is the transition of Africans from enslaved people to freed people. This transition involved both conflict and consensus among and between blacks and Euroamericans.</P>
<P>The quest for freedom from the degradation of racial enslavement and subjugation is studied in the larger background context of United States history, of which African American history is a major specialty.</P>
<P>Race, class, gender, tragedy, acculturation, resistance, and accommodation are concepts employed as major tools for interpreting black history.</P>
<P>In sum, the course strives for a rigorous study of black men and women as complex speaking and acting subjects and as people who were acted upon with tragic consequences. In essence, we study a people who both succeeded and failed in their long encounter with white supremacy before 1865.</P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME="cmaterials">Teaching Materials and Strategies</A></H4></CENTER>
<P>Readings in primary documents and secondary sources in history, discussions, lectures, music, poetry, and an e-mail Notes Conference are the teaching materials and strategies employed to explore some of the important ideas, events, personalities, trends, and institutions that shaped black history before the Civil War.</P>
<P>The major teaching goal is to develop critical literacy in thinking, writing, and discussing African American history.</P>
<P>The main narrative or &quot;spine&quot; of the course is John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss Jr., <U>From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans</U>, 7th ed., (1994). It is the oldest black history survey text still in use; it is the standard in the field. Its authors are African American.</P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME="corganization">Course Organization</A></H4></CENTER>
<P>The course has three units; each is divided into several topical sections with readings and primary source documents that require close reading and evaluation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Unit One</STRONG>, &quot;From African Origins through the American Revolution,&quot; addresses major experiences of Africans beginning on the African continent, continues through the American colonial period, and concludes with the era of the American Revolution. The unit begins with introductory matters, including essays that treat theoretical frameworks of tragedy, race, class, and gender. To facilitate understanding, a full week is spent discussing these concepts. Topics include the role Africans played in developing the Atlantic world, the origin of American slavery, slave systems in the English colonies, formative slave community and culture, the Great Awakening, and the paradox of American revolutionary ideology and black bondage.</P>
<P>In <STRONG>Unit Two</STRONG>, &quot;African Americans in the Ante-bellum South, 1830-1850,&quot; we move to an examination of select topics and issues that affected blacks under slavery as a mature institution. The racial messianism of David Walker and the rebellion led by Nat Turner are two such issues. The unit takes a detailed look at the nexus of race, class, and gender in the case study of Celia, a Missouri slave who murdered her master after years of sexual abuse.</P>
<P><STRONG>Unit Three</STRONG>, &quot;Free Negroes and the Coming of the Civil War,&quot; touches upon several topics. The opposition to colonize free blacks, their status as workers, and their social, religious, and antislavery activities come under review. The significant role of William Lloyd Garrison in the abolitionist movement raises interesting questions about whiteness, leadership, and the boundaries of racial egalitarianism. The Dred Scott case, with a Minnesota connection, was one of the controversial decisions of the decade of stress and strain leading to the Civil War. Harriet Beecher Stowe's <U>Uncle Tom's Cabin</U> is given a close reading to unravel its complexity beyond a simplistic treatment of its obvious melodrama and romanticism. The course ends, appropriately, with the black role in the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment.</P>

<DT>Written Work
<DD>
    <DL>
    <DT>A. <U>Short Papers</U>
    <DD>Two short papers of no more than five pages each and a final exam paper of between eight and 10 pages.<A HREF="#star">*</A> The papers are to be documented interpretive essays based on course readings, lectures, and discussions. The final paper covers the entire course. To prepare for the papers, you should immediately begin to make notes of everything to read, think, and hear that relates to History 220. No outside reading is required; in fact, outside reading works against the objective of the papers, which is for you to employ critical writing and other interpretive skills in responding to a historical problem, issue, or question based on texts studied in this course.<P>
        A draft of each paper must be reviewed by your Writing Assistant before it is turned in to me for assessment.  I do not read papers that have not been reviewed beforehand by a WA, nor do I read beyond the page limit. The WAs for History 220 are Andy Johnson '97 and Matthew Sanders '97. They are senior history majors who have taken my courses and are writing their comps theses under my supervision. Andy and Matthew will not be concerned with the &quot;correctness&quot; of your interpretations or ideas. Their sole goal is to work cooperatively with you in a friendly manner to help you present your interpretations and ideas in the most effective way possible. The essential writing reference for this course is Hacker, <U>A Pocket Style Manual</U>.<P>

<DT>Discussion and Teaching
<DD>The classroom is a communal place where learning and teaching is a collective project involving professor and student. Although I am more responsible than you for classroom dynamics because of my higher institutional position, we are partners. To help create and sustain an effective and successful learning community, History 220 utilizes the Socratic Method as the instructor's preferred teaching approach. Its goal is to foster learning by systematic questioning that encourages students to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate. For the Socratic Method to be effective and successful, vigorous and informed discussion is necessary. For the mechanics and philosophy of the Socratic Method that was employed in a popular film, see <A HREF="#appb">Appendix B</A>.
<DT>Reading History
<DD>The heart and soul of vigorous and informed discussion is careful reading of texts. To prepare for class, read the entire article critically, noting a series of questions along the way. What is the author's thesis? What is the evidence? Is it clear? Convincing? What might be left out? Do you detect negative bias? Try to relate the text to your own past thinking and experience and to other things you have read. Prepare a bibliographic note and precis. See Appendices <A HREF="#appa">A</A> and <A HREF="#appe">E</A>.
<DT>How to Analyze a Primary Source
<DD>There is a primary source to analyze for virtually every class meeting. To make this a successful experience, see <A HREF="#appd">Appendix D</A>, &quot;How to Analyze a Primary Source.&quot;
<DT><A NAME="notesconf">Vax Notes Conference</A>
<DD>The address for the Afam I Notes Conference for this class is <ADDRESS>Hst:[Hwilliam]Afam197.note</ADDRESS>
    It is another site where you may talk with your classmates about topics relevant to History 220. We will exhaust few, if any, topics during the run of the term. Classroom attention to each article and the questions it raises varies. Experience shows that provocative discussions in this course often take place on the Vax, and I strongly encourage you to use this teaching and learning opportunity beyond the four required postings. The four required postings include the &quot;What's My Name?&quot; assignment, discussed above. I will read the Conference each day, but will not participate in individual discussions.
<DT>Videos, Plays, Etc.
<DD>Attendance is required at an evening screening of &quot;Glory&quot; (1989). Time and place to be announced.<P>
    &quot;Off the Ice,&quot; a play by Twin Cities playwright Barbara Field, will be produced on campus this term under the direction of Professor Ruth Weiner.  The play explores what happens when Eliza from <U>Uncle Tom's Cabin</U> meets the <U>Little Women</U>. Wednesday through Saturday, Feb. 19th-22nd, at 8 p.m.  Attendance required.
    Sister Soljah is one of the featured speakers during the 1997 All-Campus Conversation. The rapper and activist has been invited to give a guest lecture in this class. You are encouraged to attend her scheduled events and to participate in other activities associated with the topic &quot;Violence and the Media.&quot; Violence against black people is a topic of particular relevance to African American history.

<CENTER><H4>How to Creatively Read a Historical Work</H4></CENTER>
Pointers for engaging in careful, thoughtful, and analytical reading of a historical work <STRONG>or how to make reading a truly profitable experience rather than a passive attempt to absorb the contents without any analytical thought at all:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>I. Determine the basic structure of the work.<BR>
	<OL>
	<LI>Any book, article, or paper must attempt to establish a point or else it is useless except as a list of facts. The point or argument of the work is the <STRONG>thesis</STRONG>. The content of the work is the <STRONG>subject</STRONG>. <U>They are not the same.</U>
	<LI>Note any characteristic stylistic features of the author's writing. Is the topic sentence, the main emphasis of each paragraph, at the very beginning of the paragraph?
	<LI>If the book or article has an &quot;Introduction,&quot; does it either suggest in summary the contents of the book or article or else provide basic historical background for the main subjects to be discussed later?
	<LI>Read the concluding paragraph in each chapter to determine if the author summarizes the work at the end.
	</OL>
<LI>II. Now consider the main impact of the historical work on your attention. Read the rest of the work quickly. Skim.<BR>
    <OL>
    <LI>What are its arguments?

<CENTER><H4>Words of Wisdom:</H4></CENTER>
&quot;If a student claims that he does not understand a certain book -- and how often have we heard this woebegone complaint from students who have given up in despair -- the probability is overwhelming that the fault lies in the student himself rather than in the book. The student has been waiting for the book to &quot;tell him the answer&quot; instead of using the book as a means of finding an answer. The chief use of a secondary historical source -- a book written to prove a point -- is to provoke, to stimulate, to lead the reader on to new insights of his own; and only thoughtful, analytical reading of secondary sources will make this possible.<BR>
&quot;Neither primary sources nor secondary sources will offer any significantly meaningful insights to a passive reader who seeks merely to recognize their contents. But the student who has acquired the basic principles of analyzing sources... will find himself fully prepared and well informed for the next major step in his development -- the writing of his own original historical papers.<BR>

<CENTER><H4>A Discourse on Teaching and Learning</H4></CENTER>
Given by Professor Kingsfield on the second day of class at Harvard Law:<BR>
&quot;The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you; unlike any schooling you've ever been through before. We use the Socratic method here: I call on you, ask you a question, and you answer it. Why don't I just give you a lecture? Because through my questions you learn to teach yourselves. Through this method of questioning, answering, questioning, answering, we seek to develop in you the ability to analyze that vast complex of facts that constitute the relationships of members within a given society. Questioning and answering. At times you may feel that you have found the correct answer. I assure you that this is a total delusion on your part. You will never find the correct, absolute, and final answer. In my classroom there is always another question, another question to follow your answer. It's as if you're on a treadmill; my little questions spin the tumblers of your mind. You're on an operating table; my little questions are the fingers probing your brain. We do brain surgery here. You teach yourselves the law, but I train your mind. You come in here with a skull full of mush, and you leave thinking like a lawyer.&quot;<P>
From the 1973 film <I>The Paper Chase</I>, which starred Timothy Bottoms, Lindsay Wagner and John Houseman. Directed by James Bridges. Synopsis:<BR>
&quot;The trials and tribulations of being a first-year law student at Harvard University. Bottoms [whose character is a graduate of the University of Minnesota] is a young student [who] becomes obsessed with his tyrannical professor [Kingsfield (Houseman, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor)], but has an even bigger problem, when he discovers that his professor is also the father of his girlfriend.&quot;<P>
Substitute &quot;history&quot; and &quot;historian&quot; for &quot;law&quot; and &quot;lawyer&quot; and after &quot;facts&quot; insert &quot;and interpretations.&quot; Thence, you will have a statement on my teaching style and beliefs.

<CENTER><H4>How to Analyze a Primary Source</H4></CENTER>
<P>Primary sources are those materials that were written or created during the
period under investigation. They are the documents or oral or visual artifacts
produced by the eyewitnesses of, or the participants in, the events the
historian is attempting to reconstruct. They are the records that make the study
of history possible.  In contrast, secondary sources are works of reconstruction
and interpretation based on the primary sources. Secondary sources attempt to
show <EM>how</EM> and <EM>why</EM> events happpened. The distinction between
primary and secondary sources is not always clear as the above definitions
imply. For instance, a newspaper is definitely a primary source for the period
in which it was published, but a newspaper also has many characteristics of a
secondary source. The journalist (a historian of sorts) constructs a narrative
based on primary sources -- documents and eyewitness testimony. (Furay and
Salevouris, <U>The Methods and Skills of History</U>, 1988.)</P>
<P>A convincing analysis of a primary source must be grounded in  (1) an
understanding of the document itself, and (2) knowledge of the era it
represents.</P>
<P>You should begin your analysis of a primary source by coming to grips with
your personal bias -- race, class, gender, sexual practice. Try to suspend your
beliefs; let the material &quot;speak&quot; to you. Keep an open mind. Later,
you will have to develop an argument or interpretation of the source.
<STRONG>Here are some questions that may be helpful to your analysis:</STRONG></P>
<OL>
<LI>What kind of source is it? Does it provide information about experience,
ideology, and/or behavior? Is it prescriptive literature that describes how
people should behave? Or is it evidence about lived experience? Does it tell us
about the experience or beliefs of &quot;typical&quot; people or elites? When
was the document made/published?
<LI>What do you know about the author and his/her purpose in writing? What is
the author's gender, race/ethnicity, class, religion, sexual and political
orientation? Does it matter?
<LI>Who is the intended audience? Was the source intended for public
consumption? How might this affect the presentation?
<LI>What can a close reading of the &quot;text&quot; tell you? Who are the
important people/characters? How does the language construct meaning? What are
the important metaphors or symbols? Pay special attention to the choice of
words. Think about the silences: what's not there may be just as important as
revealing what's there.
<LI>After you have understood the source on its own terms, you should evaluate
it as historical evidence. Is it a good source? Is it a common source for
historians in general? For historians of the African American experience in
particular? What other sources would supplement this one? Have other scholars
used this source? What is their interpretation?
</OL>
<P>Once you have used your analytic skills to understand the source and to
assess its historical significance, then develop your interpretation. Pick one
aspect of the document and discuss that. You can't cover every aspect in class
or in a short paper.</P>

<H4>A Brief History of Black History Month</H4>
Carter G. Woodson<P>
In 1926, Carter G. Woodson (1875-1950) founded Negro History Week, now Black History Month, which is celebrated in February to coincide with the birthdays of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Frederick Douglass.<P>
Woodson stated in 1926 on the reason for starting observance of Negro History Week:<BR> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not so much a Negro History Week, as it is a History Week. We should emphasize not Negro History, but the Negro in history. What we need is not a history of selected races or nations, but the history of the world void of national bias, race hate, and religious prejudice. There should be no indulgence in undue eulogy of the Negro. The use of the Negro is well taken care of when it is shown how he has influenced the development of civilization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
W.E.B. Du Bois observed just after Woodson, founder of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), died in 1950 that Woodson's career &quot;illustrates what race prejudice can do to a human soul and also what it is powerless to prevent.&quot; Woodson, the son of sex-slaves, was born in poverty, worked as a youth in a West Virginia coal mine, and was not able to begin high school until he was twenty. Yet he went on to become the second black American (after Du Bois) to receive the doctorate in history (Harvard), and with his drive and vision was virtually single-handedly responsible for establishing African American history as a historical specialty.<P>
Seeking to preserve and to publicize among both blacks and whites the historical record of the race, he created the ASNLH, established a learned journal (Journal of Negro History, 1918), sponsored pioneering research, and had an influential role in encouraging the development of a whole generation of black scholars. On the other hand, while Woodson thus laid the foundations, he did not live to see African American history either recognized by the mainstream of white historians as anything more than a marginal specialty or to be embraced by Negroes themselves with the enthusiasm that he had envisioned. These things did not come to pass until nearly two decades perspectives after his death.<P>
For more on Woodson's career, see the catalog to &quot;Moving Back Barriers: The Legacy of Carter G. Woodson,&quot; a Library of Congress Traveling Exhibition, 1994; Jacqueline Goggin, <U>Carter G. Woodson: A Life in Black History</U> (1993); Lorenzo J. Greene, <U>Working with Carter G. Woodson, the Father of Black History</U>, ed. Arvarh E.

        <CENTER><H4>A Slave Mothers Doleful Prayer (1858?)</H4>
        <H5>Fannie Woods</H5></CENTER>
        We stopped at this boarding house. This was our first night's stop after leaving Wilmington [, Delaware]. The keeper of the boarding house tried to buy Fannie Woods' baby, but there was a disagreement regarding the price. About five the next morning we started on. When we had gone about half a mile a colored boy came running down the road with a message from his master, and we were halted until his master came bringing a colored woman with him, and he bought the baby out of Fannie Woods' arms. As the colored woman was ordered to take it away I heard Fannie Woods cry, &quot;Oh God, I would rather hear the clods fall on the coffin lid of my child than to hear its cries because it is taken away from me.&quot; She said, &quot;good bye, child.&quot; We were ordered to move on, and could hear the crying of the child in the distance as it was borne away by the other woman, and I could hear the deep sobs of a broken hearted mother. We could hear the groans of many as they prayed to God to have mercy upon us, and give us grace to endure the hard trials through which we must pass.<BR>
        [William H. Robinson recalled this prayer in his autobiography, <U>From Log Cabin to Pulpit, or Fifteen Years in Slavery</U>, 3d ed. (Eau Claire, WI: James Tifft, 1913), 43-44.]<BR>

        &quot;In recent years Marion Williams has received great attention for her performances of a cappella moans. Her slurs and grunts recall old field recordings, but her stylistic authority is such that one doubts whether these traditional hymns have ever been so compellingly sung. In such performances she recalls her musical ancestors, not merely the gospel pioneers but the nameless workers in the fields and factories who expected their songs to 'lift heavy burdens.' Two of these performances are featured in the 1991 movie <U>Fried Green Tomatoes</U> and another in the 1992 movie <U>Mississippi Masala</U>.&quot;<BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="description"></A>Course Description</H4>

<P>This is a seminar in American social and intellectual history with Transcendentalism
as its subject of investigation. Transcendentalism was a movement of thought
that shaped the ideas and activities of a group of high-minded, mid nineteenth-century
intellectuals living in Concord and neighboring Boston. Among the principal
leaders were familiar authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott,
Margaret Fuller, Theodore Parker , and Henry David Thoreau. Although deeply
rooted in New England soil, the Transcendentalists were for America unprecedentedly
modern and cosmopolitan. They were widely associated with a potpourri of
democratic social movements while also producing among the most trenchant
critiques of American democracy ever written, and they vitally influenced
major thinkers and currents from philosophy, theology, social thought,
and politics to literature, painting, and music. Nathaniel Hawthorne and
Walt Whitman are among the American Renaissance writers whose works we
will read. </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="problem"></A>The Historical Problem</H4>

<P>Historians explore the past by asking and answering questions. The problem
of the seminar is Transcendentalism. How would we describe and explain
its distinctive features, its leaders, and their principle-minded actions?
What was the core meaning of the movement? What was the significance of
the Transcendentalists' religious consciousness in Unitarianism? What were
the broad cultural dimensions of the movement? What were their political
concerns: were the Transcendentalists democrats? Where did they stand on
such issues of their day as slavery, race, free white labor, and gender?
Finally, what is the Transcendentalists' legacy? </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="materials"></A>Teaching Materials and Strategies</H4>

<P>The texts will be readings in primary documents and secondary sources
in history, biography, and literature. Seminar discussions, student reports,
occasional lectures, and an e-mail notes conference are the teaching strategies
employed. The major teaching goal is to develop critical literacy in thinking,
writing, and discussing Transcendentalism. </P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="organization"></A>Course Organization</H4>

<P>This seminar follows a chronological, topical, as well as biographical
approach. The second and third meetings of the seminar's Week One contextualizes
Transcendentalism within &quot;the hopefulness and fervency of the reform
fever&quot; that affected the United States in the wake of the Second Great
Awakening. Week Two's topic is &quot;Transcendentalism: Root and Branch,&quot;
and the seminar investigates ideas and movements that figured in the pre-history
of Transcendentalism. In addition, some New England intellectual forerunners
of the movement are considered. Selected key writings of Edward Everett
and William Ellery Channing are specifically included because of the authors'
impact upon the consciousness of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson probably
was the most distinguished, if not the most famous, of the Transcendentalists.
Writing of Emerson in <U>Harvard English Studies</U> (1982), the critic
Joel Porte asserted that &quot;there is scarcely an American writer or
thinker of note who has not been moved to take the measure of this formidable
figure.&quot; His oracular eloquence frames the syllabus as it did Transcendentalism
itself. Robert Richardson's magisterial intellectual biography of Emerson
helps us cast an eye on the Sage's origins and development. Emerson's central
role in the Unitarian Controversy of 1838, during which the orthodox religionists
considered him a dangerous heretic, leads us to consideration of an ensemble
of his essays, addresses, and lectures. Selectivity also shapes the range
of prose essays produced by other major Concord intellectuals, including
Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Theodore Parker, and Bronson Alcott.
During the final weeks the seminar turns its attention to prose fiction
and verse, of which we will read works by two major idiosyncratic geniuses
influenced by Emerson: Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman. </P>

on Grading and Class Attendance</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Written Work
<DD><DL>
    <DT>A. <U>Oral Report Paper</U>
    <DD>Complete one short oral report paper in which a first effort is made
        to sort out an idea or action of the Transcendentalists. The paper is to
        be 3-5 typed double-spaced pages. Footnotes are particularly important
        as you must demonstrate not only what sources were used, but how they were
        used. You should follow the research and writing strategy proposed by Wayne
        Booth's <U>The Craft of Research</U>, which is on Closed Reserve.<BR>
        The paper is to be given in a 20-minute seminar presentation during Week
        Six, Feb. 10-14. Another 10 minutes will be allowed for peer review. On
        the day before presentation, the presenter should make available to each
        classmate and to me either a Xerox or an electronic copy of his or her
        paper. It is the presenter's responsibility to make arrangements for paper
        distribution, and to inform the seminar of those arrangements. Dates for
        presentations will be selected by lottery.<BR>
        Please make an office appointment with me to discuss your paper topic and
        the initial status of your research no later than Monday, Jan. 20. It is
        strongly recommended that you select a topic from the <A HREF="#appe">list
        in the Appendix</A>.
    <DT>B. <A NAME="finalp"></A><U>Final Paper</U>.
    <DD>Complete a substantial paper in which you manifest a more sophisticated,
        knowledgeable perspective on the idea or action of the Transcendentalists
        than was possible in the first paper. You are expected to correct, buttress,
        critique, defend, and expand on arguments presented in the first paper.
        Where possible, in constructing the paper you may build upon the discussion
        and questions presented by other students in the seminar. Full credit must
        not only be given in written sources, but to the questions and ideas presented
        by students in the seminar. The final paper is due the last day of the
        term.
    <DT>C. <U>Introduction: What's My Name?</U>
    <DD>Everyone's presence in this seminar is to be acknowledged and valued.
        To begin this important process, please introduce yourself to me and your
        classmates by completing the &quot;What's My Name?&quot; assignment before
        the beginning of class Monday, Jan. 13. If you do not have a vax account,

<DT>Discussion
<DD>The classroom is a communal place where learning and teaching is a
    collective project involving professor and student. Although I am more
    responsible than you for classroom dynamics because of my higher institutional
    position, we are partners. To help create and sustain an effective and
    successful learning community for History 324, this seminar utilizes two
    discussion formats:
    <DL>
    <DT>A. <U>Instructor-Led Discussion</U>
    <DD>The Socratic Method is the instructor's preferred teaching approach
        in this seminar. Its goal is to foster learning by systematic questioning
        that encourages students to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate. For the
        Socratic Method to be effective and successful, vigorous and informed discussion
        is necessary. For the mechanics and philosophy of the Socratic Method that
        was employed in a popular film, see Appendix, <A HREF="#appb">&quot;A Discourse
        on Teaching and Learning.&quot;</A>
    <DT>B. <U>Student-Led Discussion</U> </DT>
    <DD><P>Except for oral report dates and other &quot;special meetings,&quot;
        one or more students will be responsible for facilitating a segment of
        each seminar meeting. The number of student facilitators will depend on
        the final enrollment. At pre-registration, enrollment stood at five. Under
        a rotating cycle that begins alphabetically, this means that every student
        will lead discussion every sixth seminar meeting.<BR>
        Student-led discussion will be driven by questions posted on the vax. The
        vax notes conference for the seminar is:<BR>
        <TT>HST:[Hwilliam]Concord97.Note</TT><BR>
        At least 24 hours before seminar meeting, the student facilitator will
        post on Concord97.Note at least one question inspired by the assigned reading
        for the next class. Each student will post a response to the question and,
        if necessary, respond to her or his classmates' responses. The question
        and responses will frame the discussion at the next seminar meeting. Obviously,
        the facilitator will need to read ahead and to post the question early
        enough to allow sufficient time for peer response. Each student should
        bring a print out of the question and responses to class. The total number
        of postings per student should equal the number of class meetings this
        term.<BR>
        Here are some brief tips to make this aspect of seminar run smoothly:<BR>
        <OL>
        <LI>Questions should stimulate discussion and demonstrate that you have
            thought about the reading. Sometimes questions such as &quot;What did Emerson
            mean on page 287?&quot; enlighten the entire group, since interpretations
            vary. However, sparingly use this type of question. </LI>
        <LI>Both the student facilitator and the entire seminar must respond in
            Concord97.Note to the question. Jot down ideas, impressions, etc. It is
            not necessary to be profound (although that's welcome, too!) or to write
            a formal, coherent, reply. What we are trying to do is to move toward an
            understanding of Transcendentalism and its intersection with ante-bellum
            American society. Of course, some responses are better than others; vapid
            relativism does not suit the aims of an elite education in this classroom
            that seeks to transgress in the 1990s as much as the Transcendentalist
            project sought more than a century ago. </LI>
        <LI>Strive to keep questions and responses to one paragraph. At the end,
            please sign your full name. </LI>
        <LI>Before coming to class, read the responses of your classmates. </LI>
        </OL>
    </DL>
<DT><A NAME="conversation">Transcendental Conversation</A>
<DD>The group project for the term is the presentation on Friday, Feb.
    21, of a Margaret Fuller-style transcendental conversation. Seminar members
    as a group are to plan and execute the conversation. You are limited only
    by your imagination. You may write a script, converse from note cards,
    or talk <U>ex temporare</U>. Since each person in the seminar is equally
    responsible for the success of the conversation, an identical grade will
    be given all.<BR>
    The project's goals are threefold: (1) to investigate the educational objective,
    methodology, and historic significance of Fuller's transcendental conversations,
    (2) to continue to hone critical thinking and research skills, and (3)
    to stimulate the fine art of good conversation.<BR>
    In addition to major seminar texts that touch upon the topic, the following
    articles on Closed Reserve will help you shape the project.<BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>Margaret Fuller, &quot;Conversation&quot; (1839), in Anne Firor Scott, <U>Women in American Life</U> (1970), 35-38. </LI>
    <LI>Charles Capper, &quot;Margaret Fuller as Cultural Reformer: the Conversations in Boston,&quot; <U>American Quarterly</U> 39 (Winter 1987), 675-528. </LI>
    <LI>Margaret Fuller, &quot;A Transcendental Conversation,&quot; in Perry Miller, ed., <U>The American Transcendentalists: Their Prose and Poetry</U> (1957), 101-103. </LI>
    </UL>
<DT>Reading History
<DD>The heart and soul of vigorous and informed discussion is careful reading
    of texts. To prepare for seminar, read the entire item critically, noting
    a series of questions along the way. What is the author's thesis? What
    is the evidence? Is it clear? Convincing? What might be left out? Do you
    detect negative bias? Try to relate the text to your own past thinking
    and experience and to other things you have read. For the mechanics of
    reading history, see <A HREF="#appa">Appendix, &quot;How to Creatively
    Read a Historical Work.&quot;</A>
<DT>How to Analyze a Primary Source
<DD>There is a primary source to analyze for virtually every class meeting.
    To make this a successful experience, see <A HREF="#appc">Appendix C</A>,
    &quot;How to Analyze a Primary Source.&quot;
<DT><A NAME="attendance">Attendance</A>
<DD>Everyone influences the classroom dynamic because everyone contributes.
    Your contributions are resources. When you are absent, we miss the contribution
    of your resources. As Robin Williams's character states in <U>Dead Poets
    Society</U>, each day we have an opportunity to &quot;make our lives extraordinary.&quot;
    Sorry, no more than one unexcused absence permitted.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Words of Wisdom:</H4>

<P>&quot;If a student claims that he does not understand a certain book
-- and how often have we heard this woebegone complaint from students who
have given up in despair -- the probability is overwhelming that the fault
lies in the student himself rather than in the book. The student has been
waiting for the book to &quot;tell him the answer&quot; instead of using
the book as a means of finding an answer. The chief use of a secondary
historical source -- a book written to prove a point -- is to provoke,
to stimulate, to lead the reader on to new insights of his own; and only
thoughtful, analytical reading of secondary sources will make this possible.<BR>
&quot;Neither primary sources nor secondary sources will offer any significantly
meaningful insights to a passive reader who seeks merely to recognize their
contents. But the student who has acquired the basic principles of analyzing
sources... will find himself fully prepared and well informed for the next
major step in his development -- the writing of his own original historical
papers.<BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A Discourse on Teaching and Learning</H4>

<P>Given by Professor Kingsfield on the second day of class at Harvard
Law:<BR>
&quot;The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you;
unlike any schooling you've ever been through before. We use the Socratic
method here: I call on you, ask you a question, and you answer it. Why
don't I just give you a lecture? Because through my questions you learn
to teach yourselves. Through this method of questioning, answering, questioning,
answering, we seek to develop in you the ability to analyze that vast complex
of facts that constitute the relationships of members within a given society.
Questioning and answering. At times you may feel that you have found the
correct answer. I assure you that this is a total delusion on your part.
You will never find the correct, absolute, and final answer. In my classroom
there is always another question, another question to follow your answer.
It's as if you're on a treadmill; my little questions spin the tumblers
of your mind. You're on an operating table; my little questions are the
fingers probing your brain. We do brain surgery here. You teach yourselves
the law, but I train your mind. You come in here with a skull full of mush,
and you leave thinking like a lawyer.&quot;</P>

<P> From the 1973 film <I>The Paper Chase</I>, which starred Timothy Bottoms,
Lindsay Wagner and John Houseman. Directed by James Bridges. Synopsis:<BR>
&quot;The trials and tribulations of being a first-year law student at
Harvard University. Bottoms [whose character is a graduate of the University
of Minnesota] is a young student [who] becomes obsessed with his tyrannical
professor [Kingsfield (Houseman, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor)],
but has an even bigger problem, when he discovers that his professor is
also the father of his girlfriend.&quot;</P>

<P> Substitute &quot;history&quot; and &quot;historian&quot; for &quot;law&quot;
and &quot;lawyer&quot; and after &quot;facts&quot; insert &quot;and interpretations.&quot;
Thence, you will have a statement on my teaching style and beliefs.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>How to Analyze a Primary Source</H4>
<P>Primary sources are those materials that were written or created during the
period under investigation. They are the documents or oral or visual artifacts
produced by the eyewitnesses of, or the participants in, the events the
historian is attempting to reconstruct. They are the records that make the study
of history possible.  In contrast, secondary sources are works of reconstruction
and interpretation based on the primary sources. Secondary sources attempt to
show <EM>how</EM> and <EM>why</EM> events happpened. The distinction between
primary and secondary sources is not always clear as the above definitions
imply. For instance, a newspaper is definitely a primary source for the period
in which it was published, but a newspaper also has many characteristics of a
secondary source. The journalist (a historian of sorts) constructs a narrative
based on primary sources -- documents and eyewitness testimony. (Furay and
Salevouris, <U>The Methods and Skills of History</U>, 1988.)</P>
<P>A convincing analysis of a primary source must be grounded in  (1) an
understanding of the document itself, and (2) knowledge of the era it
represents.</P>
<P>You should begin your analysis of a primary source by coming to grips with
your personal bias -- race, class, gender, sexual practice. Try to suspend your
beliefs; let the material &quot;speak&quot; to you. Keep an open mind. Later,
you will have to develop an argument or interpretation of the source.
<STRONG>Here are some questions that may be helpful to your analysis:</STRONG></P>
<OL>
<LI>What kind of source is it? Does it provide information about experience,
ideology, and/or behavior? Is it prescriptive literature that describes how
people should behave? Or is it evidence about lived experience? Does it tell us
about the experience or beliefs of &quot;typical&quot; people or elites? When
was the document made/published?
<LI>What do you know about the author and his/her purpose in writing? What is
the author's gender, race/ethnicity, class, religion, sexual and political
orientation? Does it matter?
<LI>Who is the intended audience? Was the source intended for public
consumption? How might this affect the presentation?
<LI>What can a close reading of the &quot;text&quot; tell you? Who are the
important people/characters? How does the language construct meaning? What are
the important metaphors or symbols? Pay special attention to the choice of
words. Think about the silences: what's not there may be just as important as
revealing what's there.
<LI>After you have understood the source on its own terms, you should evaluate
it as historical evidence. Is it a good source? Is it a common source for
historians in general? For historians of the African American experience in
particular? What other sources would supplement this one? Have other scholars
used this source? What is their interpretation?
</OL>
<P>Once you have used your analytic skills to understand the source and to
assess its historical significance, then develop your interpretation. Pick one
aspect of the document and discuss that. You can't cover every aspect in class
or in a short paper.</P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>As I thought further I came to see that what we were really doing was
        withdrawing our cooperation form an evil system, rather than merely withdrawing
        our economic support from the [Montgomery] bus company. The bus company,
        being an external expression of the system, would naturally suffer, but
        the basic aim was to refuse to cooperate with evil. At this point I began
        to think about Thoreau's <U>Essay on Civil Disobedience</U>. I remembered
        how, as a college student, I had been moved when I first read this work.
        I became convinced that what we were preparing to do in Montgomery was
        related to what Thoreau had expressed. We were simply saying to the white
        community, &quot;We can no longer lend our cooperation to an evil system.&quot;

<STRONG>--Highlighted Periodicals</STRONG><br>

<DL>

<DT><strong>American Music</strong>, v. 1- 1983-
<DD>Scholarly, yet readable, exploring all the nooks and crannies of American musical life,
past and present, perhaps emphasizing serious music but not ignoring folk, jazz, and popular
music and dance.
    
<P>

<DT><strong>The Black Music Research Journal</strong>,  1980-  (Carleton has 1983- )
<DD>Scholarly publication covering a broad range of African-American genres, including such
classic styles as blue, as well as more contemporary forms such as rap.  Each issue features
five or six long articles, typically imbued with a sociohistorical prospective.
    
<P>

<DT><strong>The Black Perspective in Music</strong>,  v. 1-   spring 1973- ; Ceased with v. 18 published in 1990. (Carleton has  v. 1-18 1973-1990)
<DD>Publication aimed "to provide an opportunity for the free expression of ideas and opinions by
persons interested in Black-American and African performing arts..."

<P>

<DT><strong>Down Beat:  Jazz, Blues & Beyond</strong>, v. 1-   July 1934-  (Carleton has  v. 2 no.11-v. 24 no.2,v.36 no.8-  1935-1957,1969- INC)
<DD>While a background in music composition and notation is not necessary,
the contents presume a basic knowledge of jazz history and musicians.
Supposedly concerned with all aspects of jazz, the magazine in recent years
has slighted the more traditional forms (Dixieland, ragtime, swing, etc.)
in favor of electric and fusion styles.  Feature articles often 
incorporate enhaustive interviews with leading musicians and
generally are appended with selective discographies.  A lengthly 
record review section (25-30, approximately 500-1,00 words) is
also included.    

<P>

<DL>

<DT><strong>American Music</strong>, v. 1- 1983-
<DD>Scholarly, yet readable, exploring all the nooks and crannies of American musical life,
past and present, perhaps emphasizing serious music but not ignoring folk, jazz, and popular
music and dance.
    
<P>

<DT><strong>The Black Music Research Journal</strong>,  1980-  (Carleton has 1983- )
<DD>Scholarly publication covering a broad range of African-American genres, including such
classic styles as blue, as well as more contemporary forms such as rap.  Each issue features
five or six long articles, typically imbued with a sociohistorical prospective.
    
<P>

<DT><strong>The Black Perspective in Music</strong>,  v. 1-   spring 1973- ; Ceased with v. 18 published in 1990. (Carleton has  v. 1-18 1973-1990)
<DD>Publication aimed "to provide an opportunity for the free expression of ideas and opinions by
persons interested in Black-American and African performing arts..."

<P>

<DT><strong>Down Beat:  Jazz, Blues & Beyond</strong>, v. 1-   July 1934-  (Carleton has  v. 2 no.11-v. 24 no.2,v.36 no.8-  1935-1957,1969- INC)
<DD>While a background in music composition and notation is not necessary,
the contents presume a basic knowledge of jazz history and musicians.
Supposedly concerned with all aspects of jazz, the magazine in recent years
has slighted the more traditional forms (Dixieland, ragtime, swing, etc.)
in favor of electric and fusion styles.  Feature articles often 
incorporate enhaustive interviews with leading musicians and
generally are appended with selective discographies.  A lengthly 
record review section (25-30, approximately 500-1,00 words) is
also included.

<h3>Bibliographies</h3>

Bibliographies are lists of materials on a particular topic.  They should save you time because the author has done
the tedious work of searching catalogs and indexes to find information on the topic. Many bibliographies also contain 
evaluations of the works that they mention.  Listed here are several general titles, but note that we have
bibliographies soley on individual religions as well. (Try a keyword search on Muse to find some.  For example,
type: <STRONG><KBD>hinduism bibliography</KBD></STRONG> to find a bibliography on hinduism.)

<h3>Subject Bibliographies</h3>
<P>
Subject bibliographies are lists of materials on a particular topic.  They should save you time because the 
author has done the tedious work of searching catalogs and indexes to find information on the topic. 
Many bibliographies also contain evaluations of the works that they mention.  Listed here are several general 
titles, but note that we have bibliographies soley on individual topics as well. (Try a keyword search on 
Muse to find some.  For example,
type: <STRONG><KBD>sociology bibliography</KBD></STRONG> to find some bibliographies on sociology.)

    FirstSearch is the library community's fastest growing online
    system.  In addition, FirstSearch is now the second most-used system in the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Carleton College Library</h3>
<h2 align=center>INTERLIBRARY SERVICES</h2>

<h3 align=center>PURPOSE OF ILS</h3>
<p>
InterLibrary Services may be used to obtain library materials for study and research which are not available at Carleton or St. Olaf, but are available from other North American libraries willing to lend.

<h3 align=center>LOCATION OF ILS</h3>
<p>
InterLibrary Services information is available at both the Information Desk and the Reference Desk in the Library.
<p>
The ILS office is located in Room 448, Gould Library, just south of the east stairwell on the fourth floor.  The office is generally staffed from 8 to 5, Monday through Friday.  Telephone: x4257.

<h3 align=center>WHO MAY USE ILS</h3>
<p>
InterLibrary Services is available to current Carleton students, faculty and staff, and to retired Carleton faculty and staff living in Northfield.  A valid Library barcode number is also required.

<h3 align=center>MATERIALS AVAILABLE</h3>
<p>
Books, theses, music and some materials reproduced in microform, such as newspapers, can be borrowed.
<p>
Photocopies from non-circulating materials, such as journals, can be requested in accordance with the copyright law.
<p>
Items missing from the Library (marked "missing" on the Muse), and items sent temporarily to the bindery (also indicated on the Muse) can also be requested.

<h3 align=center>MATERIALS NOT AVAILABLE</h3>
<p>
The following types of materials cannot normally be obtained through ILS:
<ul>
<li>	books owned by the Carleton or St. Olaf libraries and temporarily in use
<li>	periodical volumes
<li>	recent, unmicrofilmed newspapers
<li>	materials for class, reserve, or group use
<li>	bulky or fragile items
<li>	reference books
<li>	rare or valuable material such as manuscripts
</ul>
<h3 align=center>COST</h3>
<p>

All requests are searched through the MINITEX Library Information Network and the Oberlin Group of libraries.  These are groups of libraries that do not charge us for interlibrary access to their materials.  Most filled requests are filled within MINITEX and the Oberlin Group.
<p>
To pursue requests beyond MINITEX and the Oberlin Group, you must agree in advance to pay whatever cost may be incurred.  Exact costs are not determined in advance, but charges of $10 or $15 are typical.


<h3 align=center>HOW ILS WORKS</h3>
<p>
All requests must be submitted either on request forms supplied by the Library, or electronically using certain online tools (i.e., the link from the FirstSearch service).
<p>
Students submitting requests on the paper forms must hand them in person to Information or Reference Desk staff for a quick review.
<p>
Faculty/Staff may drop off completed request forms at the ILS office, or they may send them via campus mail to "InterLibrary Services."
<p>
For speedy service, accurate and complete bibliographic citations should be supplied, along with the source of the citation.  Accurate personal information must be provided as well.  The online catalogs of Carleton (Muse) and St. Olaf (PALS) must be checked first to be sure the material is not already owned locally.
<h3 align=center>TIME</h3>
<p>
Plan ahead when requesting materials.  The time taken for ILS materials to arrive depends upon the seasonal workload in the ILS office, the difficulty of locating a library willing to lend the material, and the time taken for the material to travel from there to here.  7-10 days is a good average time to plan for.

<h3 align=center>NOTIFICATION</h3>
<p>
When loans arrive you are notified via campus mail that you may pick them up at the Library's circulation desk.
<p>
Photocopies are sent to you via campus mail.  They are yours to keep.

<h3 align=center>LOAN PERIOD</h3>
<p>
The loan period is determined by the lending library.
<p>
Loans obtained through MINITEX are not renewable.
<p>
Loans obtained outside MINITEX may occasionally be renewed.  Bring the book to the ILS office before the due date for details.

<h3 align=center>RESTRICTIONS</h3>
<p>
Lending libraries determine any conditions regarding the use of their materials.  Loans designated for "In Library Use Only" must be kept at the circulation desk when you are not in the Library using them.

<h3 align=center>RETURNING MATERIALS</h3>
<p>
All materials borrowed through ILS must be returned to the Library's circulation desk by the due date.  Please leave the book sleeve attached.
<p>
Late return, lost, or the poor care of materials jeopardizes the ability of the Library to borrow from other libraries in the future.

<h2 align=center>Interlibrary Resource Sharing Groups</h2>
<p>
The Carleton College Library is a member of several different interlibrary resource sharing groups:
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.oclc.org/">OCLC Online Computer Library Center</a>
<dd> Furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs are OCLC's major goals. Founded in 1967, OCLC pioneered the computer revolution in libraries when it introduced a computer system that enabled libraries to rapidly and efficiently catalog books and order custom-printed catalog cards. Today, OCLC provides a spectrum of services to over 22,000 libraries and their users in 63 countries.</dd>

<p>
<dt>
<a
href="http://www-MINITEX.lib.umn.edu/">MINITEX Library Information
Network</a>
<dd>
The MINITEX Library Information Network is a program of the 
Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) with the 
mission of facilitating resource sharing among libraries and 
reducing the cost of providing access to information for residents 
throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  
<p>
<dt>
<a href="/obegroup/obe.html">Oberlin Group</a>
<dd>
The Oberlin Group is an affiliation of library directors from over sixty highly-competitive liberal arts colleges in the United States. This affiliation was nurtured by Bill Moffett, former library director at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, hence the name of the group. Mr. Moffett believed it would be benefitial for library directors at these various institutions to share common interests and concerns in order to better fulfill their missions.
</dd>
<p>
<dt>
SELS - SouthEast Library System
<dd>
The multi-county multi-type library system for the following Minnesota counties: Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Mower, Olmsted, Rice, Steele, Wabasha, Winona
</dd>
<p>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright Clearance Center</A>
<DD>
Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) is a not-for-profit organization created at the suggestion of Congress to help organizations like Carleton comply with U.S. copyright law. Through its collective licensing programs, CCC provides authorized users with a lawful means for making photocopies from its repertoire of more than 1.75 million titles.

Laurence McKinley Gould was born in Lacota, Michigan on August 22, 1896,
the son of Herbert and Anna (Updike) Gould. This photograph, labelled "Old
Times" in a family photo album, is the earliest image of Larry Gould we
have been able to locate.

<BR>
Gould finished from high school in South Haven, Michigan in 1914. His immediate <BR>
ambition at that time was to spend a year or two teaching school to earn money to <BR>
attend the University of Michigan, where he expected to study law.

Gould taught two years in Boca Raton. He also drove the school "bus",
organized community gatherings, helped found a Sunday School class, and
with his students published The Boca Raton Semi-Occasional Newspaper,
believed to be the first paper published in that community.

Decades later, Gould recalled in a letter that the two years he spent
teaching in the Boca Raton school "were amongst the most productive of my
whole educational career. I liked the Florida crackers as the natives were
sometimes called. There I made life-lasting friendships with people whom I
loved and respected."

<B>In the fall of 1916,</B> Gould enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of
Michigan. An acquaintance made that year with glacial geologist William
Hobbs, then chairman of Michigan's Geology Department, led to his
developing an interest in that subject. However, Gould's academic career
was temporarily interrupted the following year when he enlisted in the Army
ambulance corps following U.S. entry into World War I.

From July 1917 to March 1918 Gould trained in boot camp near Allentown,
Pennsylvania. From a letter written Oct. 30, 1917: "I should be very glad
to get another pair of socks like you can make....We sleep out in pup
tents and need something to keep our feet warm."

From a letter Jan. 3, 1918: "A man told me that they had the coldest
weather in 37 years. The thermometer has been way below zero at times and
it still continues in the neighborhood of zero." One wonders what Gould
would have thought had he known then that 10 years later he would be
leading an antarctic sledge journey and braving temperatures of 40-60
degrees below zero!

This expedition surveyed Baffin's coast, finding that the island was some
5,000 square miles smaller than had been thought. By the way, Gould did not
continue his pipe smoking for very long. In later life, he liked to relate
a story about going to the doctor for a physical exam. The doctor advised
him to give up smoking and start drinking. "Best damned advice I ever had!"

With two Arctic expeditions now on his resume, Gould was introduced to
Commander Richard E. Byrd at a dinner in Ann Arbor. The impression must
have been favorable, for Byrd subsequently asked Gould to join his
forthcoming expedition to Antarctica as geologist and geographer. This
portrait ran with the Associated Press report of Gould's appointment.

<B>Gould of the Antarctic.</B><BR>
The privately-financed Byrd expedition of 1928-30 was the first American
exploration of the southern continent in ninety years, and Gould was the
expedition's chief scientist -- the first geologist to reach the interior
of the Antarctic continent.

<B>Second-in-Command to Byrd.</B><BR>
As the voyage south neared its end Byrd recorded the following decision in
his journal: "My mind as to the men is now made up. Gould I have made
Second in Command. A splendid fellow, competent, a brilliant geologist and
popular with men. He has proper respect for the seriousness of the job...
He will do well I am sure and I am fortunate to have him."

A few miles inland, on the outer edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, Gould
supervised construction of the barracks and workrooms of the base they
called "Little America." Eventually the camp included such amenities as a
small gymnasium, a fairly well-stocked library, a "maternity ward" for the
sled dogs, and a machine shop and storehouse made out of airplane crates.

Byrd never had cause to regret his choice of Gould as his
second-in- command. "If any man was liked by all, it was he," Byrd wrote in
<EM>Little America</EM> (Putnam, 1930), his personal account of the expedition.
"Larry was a blend of coolness and warmth. His friendly ways and his
fairness endeared him...Larry mingled, and yet was always respected...
When arguments waxed and flamed and drew to no conclusion, Larry was
resorted to as the seat of judgment. His mind seemed to have held every
fact that came into it."

<B>Hazardous science.</B><BR>
While making his first aerial explorations in late January, Byrd discovered
the Rockefeller mountain range some 140 miles east from Little America, and
a few weeks later Gould and two others flew to the area to conduct
geological investigations. He collected his samples, but before the group
could return to base, they were caught by a fierce blizzard which destroyed
their Fokker monoplane. The party had fought to anchor the plane in the
face of tremendous winds -- at one point Dr. Gould was observed by one of
his companions "hanging onto a rope attached to one of the wing tips [and
being] blown straight out, like a flag" -- but to no avail. The party's two
radios also ceased to function, and the men were marooned until a search
plane from Little America rescued them several days later.

As the accompanying newspaper clippings make clear, the world was kept

insisting that they never were lost; they knew exactly where they were the
entire time.

On November 4, 1929 Gould and five companions set out on what was to be an
epic 2 1/2 month, 1500 mile dog-sledge journey south into the Queen Maud
Mountains and back. The party's primary mission was to provide ground
support and possible emergency assistance for Byrd's historic flight over
the Pole, but it also was an opportunity to conduct the first geological
and glaciological survey of an area described by Gould as "a veritable
paradise for a geologist."

a grueling trek featuring snow bridges that collapsed into deep crevasses,
blinding blizzards, and weather so cold that it nearly froze their eyelids

<B>Reaching the rocks.</B><BR>
On December 7 Gould led his team up the mountain's steep southern slope.
"We roped to climb and 'herringboned' and 'sidebilled' our way up on our
skis," he wrote in his journal for that day. "Had to climb even steeper
slopes beyond these first crevasses to reach the coveted rocks -- a bit
hazardous this, for we were climbing along a steep side hill, and some 200
feet below us, paralleling our course, was a great yawning chasm. The snow
was crusted over, and it was hard to make our skis stick, but we finally
reached our rocks, the very rocks I wanted most to find in the Antarctic."
<P>
<A HREF="ImagesII/reachingrocks3.jpg"><IMG ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="113" WIDTH="144" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="5" SRC="ImagesII/reachingrocks3.gif"></A>
Gould hoped to confirm a suspicion that Mt. Nansen and the Queen Maud
Mountains were part of a great uplifted fault system that stretched across
the continent for more than 1,000 miles, and to find evidence that
Antarctica was linked geologically to the Earth's other great land masses.
The rock formations on the peak -- a series of sandstones with impure coaly
material in the top seams -- proved that Gould's supposition was correct.
"No symphony I have ever heard, no work of art before which I have stood in
awe ever gave me quite the thrill that I had when I reached out after that
strenuous climb and picked up a piece of rock to find it sandstone. It was
just the rock I had come all the way to the Antarctic to find," Gould wrote
in a radiogram to Commander Byrd.

From Mt. Nansen the sledgers proceded east along the mountains past the
150th meridian, which put them into land unclaimed by any other nation.
There, in a cairn on a low peak, they left a note claiming this land as "a
dependency or possession of the United States of America."

<B>The Amundsen cairn.</B><BR>
The geological party had traversed much of the same ground followed by
Roald Amundsen in his historic trek to the Pole in 1911-12, and on
Christmas Day they were elated to locate on Mt. Betty, near the Axel
Heiberg glacier, a cairn that had been left by Amundsen.  As Gould
described it, "We couldn't help standing at attention, with hats off, in
admiring respect for the memory of this remarkable man before we touched a
rock of the cairn. It was one of the most exciting moments of the summer
when I pried the lid off the tin can in the cairn and took out a bit of
paper which had formerly been a page in Amundsen's notebook, and on which
he had briefly recorded the discovery of the South Pole."

Commander Byrd termed the Gould sledge journey "the outstanding personal
achievement of the expedition." Its scientific harvest was great, but it
was also an unrivalled adventure; the last episode of the era of dog-sled
exploration.

Gould's sense of the adventure is evident in the following passage from
<EM>Cold:</EM>  "I think man has found no means of pioneering by land or sea or air,
that reaches the high conception of polar sledging with dogs. I think no
other method of travel can be as fascinating in its entirety and I know of
no other activity that makes such complete demands on all that there is in
a man. It demands the most rigid self-discipline or self-control; it calls
for the utmost resourcefulness and it taxes the endurance of the hardiest."

<B>To Carleton, 1932.</B><BR>
Authorities at Carleton College were impressed by Gould when he came to the
campus to deliver his lecture on the Byrd expedition, and in 1932 when
plans were being laid to reorganize and significantly upgrade the college's
then-scant offerings in geology, they succeeded in hiring him as a full
professor and chair of that department.  Moving to Minnesota apparently was
agreeable, for, as he once said, "I feel best in weather that makes me
shiver."

In Northfield, the Goulds lived for several years in the upper-level

there with them while attending Carleton from 1932-35, and in 1938 was
married to Dick Hoppin '36 in a ceremony in the apartment.  <EM>[Note from the

How did the adventurer feel about trading the thrills of the Antarctic for
the tamer qualities of the classroom? "I had to choose between exploring
and teaching as my life work," he told the Carletonian in 1933. "I've

There is abundant testimony that Gould devoted the same passion and

student claimed that Gould was, "By all odds the most inspiring teacher I
ever had." He was a man "of warmth and humor who could combine these things
with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of his subject matter."

"All who studied under Larry Gould, as he is affectionately referred to
both on and off the campus, came to realize that he is no ordinary teacher.
Pre-eminently a scientist fascinated by the pursuit of truth and knowledge,
he has the spirit of the scholar, the soul of a poet and adventurer, and a
special ability to communicate his passion for learning to his students."

"The spell of Gould was upon Carleton before its generator assumed the
presidency. Back of the spell were a ground-gripping body, broad and
hirsute hands, leathern face outcropped with stubborn stubble, low-slung,
tousled forelock, hearty manner, and lusty laugh. The total impression
accorded well with tales of arctic exploration and lecture pictures of fur
capote and huskies."  <EM>[Carleton: The First Century</EM>, 1966]

"Gould dressed casually. A dash of dowdiness became him well. Rolling socks
and sagging tweeds, variegated shirts and flaming ties--all were harmonized
in a far from ordinary mortal." [<EM>Carleton: The First Century</EM>, 1966]  Within
a year of Gould's arrival at Carleton, his taste for fanciful
neckware--particularly in his favorite hue of solid red--had become
associated with a new college tradition:  Wild Tie Day, when male students
attempted to outdo Gould, and one another, in the brilliancy of their
cravats.

Gould's out-of-the-classroom activities continued to be extensive and
varied throughout this period. He produced numerous papers and articles on
glacial geology. He was a popular speaker in a variety of forums on campus
and off. In 1936 he was a delegate to the International Congress of Geodesy
and Geophysics in Edinburgh, and in 1937 he attended an international
geological congress in Moscow and then spent a month on a Russian
icebreaker in the Arctic. In 1938-39 he served a term as president of the
Minnesota Academy of Science. When the U.S. entered World War II he was
granted a leave of absence to become chief of the Arctic section of the
Army-Air Force's Arctic, Desert and Tropic Information Center. He returned
to Carleton in the fall of 1944, and the following spring was instrumental
in organizing a memorable four-day conference on "Problems of the Far
North."

Early in 1944 Carleton's President Cowling officially advised his Trustees
of his intent to retire following the 1944-45 academic year. The Trustees
appointed a committee, chaired by Laird Bell, to consider candidates as
Cowling's successor. Dean of the College Lindsey Blayney, also preparing to
retire, warmly endorsed the suggestion that Gould be elevated from the
faculty to the presidency - as this letter sent to the committee in April
1945 attests.

In his first years as president, Gould guided the college's response to the
the demographic pressures created by a large influx of returning veterans.
Fundraising was needed to meet Carleton's needs for a number of new
buildings in the years ahead, beginning with a new library and a fine arts
building. Gould exerted his leadership in pushing all departments of the
college to ever higher levels of academic expectation and achievement. In
1946 he urged adoption of a uniform retirement age for faculty, and caused
Carleton to become the first college in the Middle West to require that all
applicants take College Entrance Board examinations. The following year he
prompted the Board to clarify the status of longstanding affiliations with
the Congregational, Baptist, and Episcopal denominations, and to declare
that in the matter of student admissions church affiliation was distinctly
secondary to scholastic attainments. 1948 saw the introduction of
comprehensive exams for seniors. Seeking to attract and retain especially
talented young teachers, he urged the Board to commit itself to increases
in faculty salaries. He also sought to pursue longterm plans for
strengthening Carleton's relations with her own alumni, and in pursuit of
this aim committed himself to a heavy program of speaking engagements with
alumni groups around the country. And of course he gave particular
attention to what he always considered his most important duty, the making
of appointments. In a day when most hiring was done directly by the
president, Carleton benefitted tremendously by Gould's usually-shrewd
judgment regarding the potential of young candidates for positions, and by
his ability to persuade many of the best of them to come to Carleton.

On the same day as his appearance before the Norwegian Geographic Society,
Gould had been presented to Norway's King Haakon, and was surprised when at
the conclusion of their interview the king had conferred upon him the
Knight's Cross, 1st Class,  of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olaf, and
suggested that he wear it to that evening's lecture. Gould was the
recipient of dozens of impressive medals and significant awards, but he was
particularly fond of this cross and wore it frequently in his lapel.

After five years, much had been accomplished. The Art Building, Boliou
Hall, had been completed, and hopeful plans were being developed for a new
library and for the remodeling of Willis Hall into a Memorial Union. Gould
issued a five year report that summer in which he addressed "the question
of the permanent size we wish the College to be." Reflecting that the
experience of community participation is impossible in large groups, he
hesitated to state a definite figure for the "ideal" size for Carleton
College, but did assert that "we who have experimented with and thought
about the problem during the post-war years are convinced that for us it is
certainly less than one thousand students."

should go to colleges such as Carleton. We cannot, we must not, try to be

<B>With Trustee Chairman Laird Bell, 1955.</B><BR>
Gould's relations with his Trustees were excellent, and President and Board
valued one another's contributions tremendously. In the mid-1950s Gould was
involved in a number of extracurricular activities which necessarily
consumed a good deal of his time -- appointment by Eisenhower to the
National Science Board, election as a Trustee of the Ford Foundation, and a
key role in connection with planning for the International Geophysical Year
-- all in addition to his usual heavy schedule of speaking engagements. In
1955 the Carleton Board of Trustees took note of these presidential
commitments and wholeheartedly endorsed them, stating that by engaging in
them President Gould was also promoting the best interests of Carleton
College. However, they were also concerned to guard against overwork, and
marked Gould's tenth presidential year by sending Peg and Larry on a
seven-week vacation sojourn to South America, a rest and relaxation break
taken at the Board's insistence.

In July 1955 Gould travelled to Paris to head the United States delegation

be carried out during the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year (IGY).
Subsequently he was appointed director of the United States IGY Antarctic
Program, and in that role returned to Antarctica early in 1957 to inspect
logistical preparations for the IGY being carried out as part of the Navy's
"Operation Deepfreeze." Working out of the main American base on Ross
Island in McMurdo Sound, Dr. Gould supervised scientific operations at five
other United States observation stations, including one at the South Pole
itself.

<B>Gould in Antarctica, 1957.</B><BR>
At the end of 1957 Gould made another, month-long, trip to Antarctica, this
time to accompany six members of the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, who were inspecting the IGY Antarctic program and its
scientific researches in the fields of meteorology, oceanography,
geomagnetism, seismology, ionospheric physics, and glaciology. Although the
scientific knowledge gained from the IGY research programs was enormous,
Gould hoped that the "human and social results" would prove more important
in the long run. "This vast global effort was carried out in a period of
almost unprecedented worldwide turmoil and unrest," he wrote more than a
decade later in the <EM>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EM> (December, 1970). "It
was the IGY cooperative efforts in Antarctica, coldest of all the
continents, that witnessed the first thawing of the Cold War....It
demonstrated, as never before, that the international community of science
is the most hopeful of all examples of world cooperation and organization."

<B>The Antarctic Treaty.</B><BR>
As chairman of the Committee on Polar Research of the National Academy of
Sciences, Gould testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
favor of the Antarctic Treaty, a milestone in international cooperation
which reserved the entire continent as a scientific preserve "to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes." Gould later said of this agreement:
"The Antarctic Treaty is indispensable to the world of science which knows
no national or other political boundaries; but it is much more than that. I
believe it is a document unique in history which may take its place
alongside the Magna Carta and other great symbols of man's quest for
enlightenment and order."

Back at Carleton in the period following his IGY directorship, Gould was
"cooking up" new plans for moving the college forward. In 1957 he outlined
for the Trustees some things he hoped to accomplish before his retirement.
Plans were already underway for building the two new dormitories that would
become Musser and Myers; in addition, Gould told the Board that he hoped to
raise eight million dollars for the following purposes: a biology and
physics building, ten endowed professorships, scholarship endowment, a
men's field house, a women's gymnasium, a new administration building, and
general maintenance.

shovel to symbolize their support for the ambitious
program. That same year the Board gave approval to a plan gradually to
increase the size of the student body to 1300 over a period of years.

People familiar with the Carleton of the late '50s and into the '60s will

attendance at faculty meetings was expected -- Gould's secretary Sally
Crandall would sit in the back of the room taking attendance, and missing
faculty could expect a query the next day as to the reasons behind their
absence. But these men and women were valued. When asked to name the one or
two things he did that made his administration so successful, Gould replied
"Oh, that is easy. Going out and getting the best faculty I could find,
bringing them here, and letting them loose."

The student body then presented the Goulds with two round-trip tickets to
Athens, to be used whenever they wished. In accepting the tickets, the
Goulds promised to make a return visit to Carleton to report on their trip
to the students.  Four days later it was the faculty's turn to say
farewell. At a evening reception at the Northfield Country Club on June 6,
the faculty and administation presented the Goulds first with humorous
remarks by Carleton professors Reed Whittemore and Alfred Hyslop, and then
with the surprise gift of a new red jeep, to be used at the Goulds' Wyoming
ranch.

Gould's Carleton citation, written by Reed Whittemore, read in part:
"Larry Gould has already his full measure of such tributes; his cup of
honorary degrees runneth over. In marking, thus, his departure we are doing
really nothing at all unless we can tell him what cannot be told by the
gift of a degree. We need to tell him that this community prizes less the
academic distinction he has done so much to bring it than the spirit in
which he has done so; to tell him that the money he has found to strengthen
our enterprises has been little beside the strength of his leadership; to
tell him that his magnificent performance in the role of president was only
possible because of the humor, gentleness and humanity he brought to that
role; and, perhaps most of all, to tell him--as I now do tell him--that
what we are doing now we are doing not out of a sense of duty but out of
love."

<B>A tribute from the Carleton Trustees, June 15, 1962.</B><BR>
That day, in recommending the election of Larry Gould as president emeritus
of Carleton College, Laird Bell read the following statement:
<P>
<PRE> </PRE>
"This Board cannot permit the president of the College to retire without
some record, however inadequate, of its gratitude for what his
administration has meant to us all. Building upon a college already
distinguished, he has guided it to still greater stature. The new buildings
are an expression of this growth; the endowment has increased many fold,
thanks to his efforts; but his real contribution has been in his leadership
in the academic field. His first concern has been the selection of a
faculty whose primary devotion has been teaching, supported by genuine
scholarship. He has maintained the College as a place of learning, without
compromise with the shallow or superficial. He has unfailingly supported
the faculty in its freedom to teach. Above all, by his own example he has
showed what it is to be at once a teacher, a scholar, a public servant, and
a man of affairs. He has lived up to the Whitehead principle that he often
quoted - 'Moral education is impossible apart from the habitual vision of
greatness.' It is the fervent hope of the Board that he may find in his new
activities the satisfaction and happiness that his labors have entitled him
to enjoy."
<P>
The Board signified its unanimous approval of this action with a standing
ovation.

In commenting on Gould's retirement in its June 25, 1962 issue,<EM> Newsweek</EM>
noted that it was under his tenure that Carleton transformed "from a
little-known Congregational institution into one of the finest liberal-arts
colleges in the nation." The previous year the <A HREF="ImagesIV/chicagotrib.jpg"><EM>Chicago Daily Tribune</EM></A> had
labelled the school "a little Harvard in academic distinction". Altogether
Gould had given 30 years of his life to Carleton, and the identification
between the College and its famous president was close. The association was
unquestionably an advantageous one for the school, and Gould claimed that
it was equally so for himself. "If I had my life to live over again," he
stated shortly before his retirement, "I could not invest it with greater
satisfaction to myself than I have done at Carleton College."

<B>Retirement.</B><BR>
Jimmy Carter notwithstanding, Larry Gould must have had one of the most
active "retirements" on record. Between 1962 and 1979 Gould returned to
Antarctica four more times. He continued with a busy schedule of public
speaking engagements and maintained significant leadership roles in
numerous scientific organizations. And he began a whole new career as
Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona.
<P>
Gould had met Arizona's president Richard Harvill in the late 1950s, when
delivering an address in Tucson. At that time Harvill had told him that if
he wanted to join the Arizona faculty after retiring from Carleton, "you
can have a job as long as I have and you can do anything you want." In the
fall of 1962, after departing Carleton, Gould went again to Antarctica in
his role as chair of the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Polar
Research. Following that, Peg and Larry settled into their new home in
Tucson, and Larry returned to the classroom. It was a satisfying new life.
Years later, when in his nineties, Gould told a University of Arizona
reporter: "When I retired [from Carleton], I thought, well, I'll come down
here and teach a couple of years and I'll go to seed and I'll die. Well
instead of two years, I taught 18... This place has given me a whole new
wonderful career. That's one reason that I've lived on to 90 years. I would
have died if I hadn't had something to do. I can't express my debt to the
University of Arizona."

Gould continued to contribute actively to many activities dear to his
heart, and to be honored for those contributions. He was instrumental in
raising money for the expansion of the Mayo Clinic, and was a moving force
in the foundation of a Mayo Medical School. He continued until 1972 his
chairmanship of the National Research Council's Polar Research Board. From
1963 to 1970 he was president of the International Council of Scientific
Union's Special Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR). In 1965 he became
president of the largest general body of American scientists, the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. Displayed nearby are a sampling
of awards and tokens of appreciation given to Gould during the years
1963-1966.

<B>A shift in politics.</B><BR>
From a feature on Gould printed in the <EM>Minneapolis Tribune</EM>, Jan. 3, 1965:
"During the recent election he was a member of Scientists and Engineers for
Johnson and Humphrey. This was quite a switch, he admitted, for a lifelong
Republican and one sometimes pressed by Minnesota Republicans to run for
the Senate against Democrat Humphrey. His reason, he said bluntly, was
Arizona's Barry Goldwater and Goldwater's opposition to the
administration's civil rights bill, the nuclear test ban and the Antarctic
treaty. 'When we went to Tucson,' Gould said, 'we found we had to register
by party. I went into one booth and my wife went into another. When we came
out, I said to her, "My father would spin in his grave if he knew it, but
I'm a Democrat." She said, "I am too."'"

During this visit, Gould visited a deposit near the Beardmore Glacier to
investigate a recent fossil find. Gould and fellow National Science Board
member Grover Murray confirmed that the fossil was a 240 million year old
reptile skull associated with tropical climates and closely resembling
others found in relative abundance in South Africa. Here was compelling
evidence supporting the then still controversial theory of continental
drift, and suggesting that Africa and Antarctica had once been attached.
Gould and Murray immediately radioed the National Science Foundation in
Washington, with the news that this was "not only the most important fossil
ever found in Antarctica, but one of the truly great fossil finds of all
time."

his 26 honorary degrees, from the University of Arizona. The citation read:
<P>
Laurence McKinley Gould-- You have combined several careers with brilliance
and grace. You are a geologist, educator, explorer, diplomat and
humanitarian. Your contributions as a teacher, researcher, scientist and
statesman are incalculable. You are perhaps the world's leading specialist
in glacial geology. Your years of Arctic and Antarctic exploration,
research and writing have established a solid foundation for all future
polar exploration, vitally important today as we search for new sources of
energy. In recognition of your contribution to mankind, and to the quality
of your own life, the University of Arizona confers upon you the degree of
Doctor of Science.

Gould was bowled over when he learned of the University of Arizona's
intention to name their new science building -- the tallest building on the
university's main campus -- after himself and paleontologist George Gaylord
Simpson. Here, in tandem with Dr. Simpson's widow, he participates proudly
in the ribbon-cutting ceremonies.

As Gould approached his 90th birthday physical frailities began to manifest
themselves for both Larry and Peg. But life continued to hold out many
satisfactions. The Goulds were blessed with a wide circle of dear and
devoted friends. Some of these, like Carleton alumni Clark and Ardith
Arnold, were Tucson neighbors, while others simply looked forward to any
opportunity to visit.

and across oceans summarized his remarkable career, outlined his
achievements and ennumerated his honors. The <EM>Arizona Daily Star</EM>, observing
that Gould's death recalled to society's memory "entire vistas of history
and life," eulogized him as "truly a wise and generous man who had seen
much ... a life of vision and charm has departed."

<hr size=7>
<CENTER><H1>Introduction:  Basic HTML Concepts</H1></CENTER>

Note: This introduction and the associated exerecises assume knowledge of the fundamental features of Netscape 
or comparable World Wide Web (Web) browsing software.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
HTML stands for <STRONG>hypertext markup language</STRONG>, and is used to create hypermedia documents 
that can be viewed by World Wide Web browsers.
<P>
HTML describes a series of <STRONG>tags</STRONG> that tell browsers how to format, interpret, and 
display information in hypertext documents. By placing HTML tags around appropriate portions of text, 
you can create headlines, paragraphs, bold text, etc., as well as hypertext links to other information. 
Most (but not all) HTML tags are associated with a pair of tags; a <STRONG>starting tag</STRONG> and an 
<STRONG>ending tag</STRONG>. Both pair of tags are surrounded by "less-than" and "greater-than" brackets.  
However, the ending tag adds a forward slash (<KBD><STRONG>/</STRONG></KBD>) in front of the tag, e.g., 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;TAG&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/TAG>&gt;</STRONG></KBD>.
<P>
The basic unit of HTML is called an <STRONG>element</STRONG>; the element <STRONG>name</STRONG> appears 
inside the tag brackets, and specifies the meaning associated with a block of text, e.g, 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;...&lt;/TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags containing the <STRONG>title</STRONG> element.  
There are rules about where elements can and cannot appear within an HTML document.
<P>
A specially defined property of an HTML element is called an <STRONG>attribute</STRONG>, e.g., 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;IMG SRC="image.gif"&gt;</STRONG></KBD> means that the element <STRONG><KBD>IMG</KBD></STRONG> 
has an attribute <STRONG><KBD>SRC</KBD></STRONG>, which is assigned the value 
<STRONG><KBD>"image.gif"</KBD></STRONG>.
<P>
While HTML is not case sensitive, many authors prefer to write HTML tags in capital letters to make 
them easier to see when editing a document. In this the associated exercises, all tags will appear in capital 
letters.
<P>
Just as text filenames often end in <KBD><STRONG>.txt</STRONG></KBD>, HTML filenames often end in 
<KBD><STRONG>.html</STRONG></KBD> or <KBD><STRONG>.htm</STRONG></KBD> (in the PC world). Both are 
accepted as identifiers for HTML documents. Filenames are generally in lower case letters, and contain 
no special characters or spaces. For example, the filename of the page you're currently reading is 
<KBD><STRONG>basic.html</STRONG></KBD>.
<P>

You don't need to have your documents on a World Wide Web (WWW) server to begin experimenting with HTML. 
In Netscape, you can use the <STRONG>Open File</STRONG> command under the <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu to 
locate and open a hypertext file. With this command, you can create files in any text editor (such as
a word processor) that can save its documents as ASCII text, and then open the files with your Web browser. 
Most HTML features will work without a Web server installed on your personal computer.
<P>
<UL>To open a file in Netscape:
<P>
	<LI>Select the <STRONG>Open File</STRONG> command under the <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu.
    <LI>Locate and select the document you wish to open.
    <LI>Click the <STRONG>Open</STRONG> button, and Netscape will open the file.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>After making changes in your HTML code, to view the changes in Netscape:
<P>
	<LI>Save your file in the text editor.
	<LI>Switch to the Netscape application.
	<LI>Click the <STRONG>Reload</STRONG> button or choose the <STRONG>Reload</STRONG> 
	    command from the <STRONG>View</STRONG> menu.

</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<hr size=7>
<CENTER><H1>Exercise 1:  Five Basic Elements</H1></CENTER>

HTML uses formatting codes called "tags" to mark text with formatting instructions.  The tags
are identified by angle brackets around some text.  HTML tags are NOT case sensitive; 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> will work the same way as <KBD><STRONG>&lt;html&gt;</STRONG></KBD>.  
(Some HTML authors prefer to use uppercase within HTML tags because it's easier to locate tags when scanning 
the document.)
<P>
This exercise includes use of <A HREF="#format">basic HTML document format</A>, <A HREF="#head">headers</A>, 
<A HREF="#title">title</A>,and <A HREF="#para">paragraphs</A> elements.
<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
It only takes four elements to create a basic HTML document. It'll be a very boring document--without the images 
and links that people have come to associate with the Web--but these four elements will provide a foundation in 
HTML on which to build.
<P>
Note that most (but not all) HTML tags are paired, e.g. <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> goes in front 
of your title and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> goes behind it.
<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;HTML&gt;...&lt;/HTML&gt;</KBD> - HTML document identifier</STRONG>
<DD>The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags 
identify the beginning and end of an HTML document. While Netscape and many other browsers do not 
require the HTML tag, on some browsers your document may not load correctly if the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag is absent.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;HEAD&gt;...&lt;/HEAD&gt;</KBD> - document header</STRONG>
<DD>Web browsers use the information between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags to gather information about the document, such 
as its author, its title, and to what resources the document should be linked. For the scope of 
these exercises, the only tag used between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
and <KBD><STRONG>>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags is the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag. 
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;TITLE&gt;...&lt;/TITLE&gt;</KBD> - document title</STRONG>
<DD>The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> element should only appear once in the head of an HTML document 
(between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags).  
The text that appears between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tags is used as the title of the document, and is displayed by most Web browsers in the browser window's title bar.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;BODY&gt;...&lt;/BODY&gt;</KBD> - document body</STRONG>
<DD>This is where all the action happens in an HTML document. With the exception of the above HTML elements, 
nearly every other tag must appear between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;BODY&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/BODY&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags.

<A NAME="head"><H3>Creating HTML Headers:</H3></A>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;Hx&gt;</KBD>...<KBD>&lt;/Hx&gt;</KBD> - heading</STRONG>
<DD>Headings are used to identify sections of a document. HTML provides six levels of headings, 
numbered I through 6. For the largest heading, you would use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags. For the smallest, you would use 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;H6&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/H6&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags.
<P>
Note that most browsers will assume that white space should appear before and after a heading element, 
so you don't generally need to put a <A HREF="#para"><KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD></A> or 
<A HREF="exercise8.html#br"><KBD><STRONG>&lt;BR&gt;</STRONG></KBD></A> before or after a heading.
<P>
HTML headers work like this:
</DL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H1&gt;...&lt;/H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H1>A heading like this</H1></CENTER>

<A NAME="para"><H3>Paragraph Tags</H3></A>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</KBD> - paragraph</STRONG>
<DD>In general,a Web browser starts a new paragraph only when it encounters a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tag.  Without <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags, the text in your HTML document will appear as one large, 
continuous paragraph.
<P>
Alas, life is always more complex that it seems, and this is the case with paragraphs in HTML.  Various 
<LINK>versions of HTML have defined paragraphs differently.  The only thing these versions agree on is that you 
indicate a plain text paragraph (not necessarily it's beginning or ending) by using the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.
<P>
Early versions of HTML specified the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> as a <STRONG>one-sided</STRONG> tag.  
There was no corresponding <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>, and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tag was used to indicate the <STRONG>end</STRONG> of a paragraph (a paragraph break), not the beginning.  
So paragraphs in the early versions of HTML looked like this:
<P>
<PRE>
	The Civil War was the first conflict that was dominated by firearms.  
	Muskets employed in earlier wars were one-shot smoothbores, which were 
	inaccurate and extremely limited in range.
	&lt;P&gt;
	Reloading was a difficulty job; and the primitive flintlocks would not 
	work when wet, and only 80 percent of the time under ideal conditions.
	&lt;P&gt;
	Percussion caps for ignition soon replaced the unreliable flintlocks, 
	and experients with rifled muskets were initiated.  A revolution in 
	infantry warfare was sparked by Frenchman, Claude E. Minie, who in 1849 
	designed a bullet (not a "ball" as most Civil War participants referred 
	to it) that was smaller then the diameter of the gun barrel and could be 
	inserted easily.
	&lt;P&gt;
	When fired, the base of the projectile expanded to fit the rifling, 
	giving the bullet a stabilizing spin for greater accuracy and range.
	&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Most browsers that were created early on in the history of the Web--and many browsers--still assume that paragraphs
will be formatted this way.  When come across a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag, they start a new line an 
add some extra vertical space between the line they just ended and the one that they just began.
<P>
In more recent versions of HTML, the paragraph tag has been revised.  In these versions, the paragraph tags are
<STRONG>two-side</STRONG> (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>), but <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
indicates the <STRONG>beginning</STRONG> of the paragraph.  Also, the closing tag (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>) 
is optional.  So the "minie ball" story would look like this in the newer versions of HTML:
<P>
<PRE>
	&lt;P&gt;
	The Civil War was the first conflict that was dominated by firearms.  
	Muskets employed in earlier wars were one-shot smoothbores, which were 
	inaccurate and extremely limited in range.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	Reloading was a difficulty job; and the primitive flintlocks would not 
	work when wet, and only 80 percent of the time under ideal conditions.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	Percussion caps for ignition soon replaced the unreliable flintlocks, 
	and experients with rifled muskets were initiated.  A revolution in 
	infantry warfare was sparked by Frenchman, Claude E. Minie, who in 1849 
	designed a bullet (not a "ball" as most Civil War participants referred 
	to it) that was smaller then the diameter of the gun barrel and could be 
	inserted easily.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	When fired, the base of the projectile expanded to fit the rifling, 
	giving the bullet a stabilizing spin for greater accuracy and range.
	&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
It's probably a good idea to get into the habit of using <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> at the start of 
a paragraph because this will become important in subsequent versions of HTML--where you can define the alignment 
and other featuresof each paragraph.  Currently browsers will ingore this form of paragraphs just fine.
<P>
However, note that because many browsers still expect <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> to indicate the 
<STRONG>end</STRONG> of a paragraph, if you use it at the beginning you may end up with extra space in between 
the first paragraph and the element before it.  If this bothers you, you can do the following:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Go back to the old style of defining paragraphs.
	<LI>Use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> as a paragraph separator, rather than indicating the beginning or
	    end of a paragraph.
	<LI>Leave off the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> in each set of paragraphs. 
</UL>
<P>
Some people like to use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags to spread out the text on a page.  But beware.  
Some browsers may collapse multiple <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags into one, erasing all your careful 
formatting.

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 2 - Unordered Lists</H1></CENTER>
This exercise includes use of <A HREF="exercise1.html#head">headers</A> and an <A HREF="#ul">unordered list</A>.<p>
<HR size=3>
<p>
<H3><A NAME="ul">Creating Unordered Lists:</A></H3>

HTML provides a variety of list formats to use in your HTML documents. Most of the lists use the following format:
<P>
<KBD>
&lt;<STRONG>LIST_TYPE</STRONG>&gt;<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;Item 1<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;Item 2<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;Item 3<BR>
&lt;<STRONG>/LIST_TYPE</STRONG>&gt;
</KBD>
<P>
Unordered are also referred to as "bulleted" lists.  To make an unordered list:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Start with a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;UL&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.
<LI>For each item on your list, enter an <KBD><STRONG>&lt;LI&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag followed by the item. 
    (No closing tag is needed.)
<LI>End with a closing tag: <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/UL&gt;</STRONG></KBD>.
</OL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>List items can contain more than one paragraph.
<LI>In later versions of HTML, you'll be able to specify the bullet type by adding the attribute 
    <KBD><STRONG>TYPE=DISC</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>TYPE=CIRCLE</STRONG></KBD>, or
    <KBD><STRONG>TYPE=SQUARE</STRONG></KBD> within the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;UL&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.
</UL>
<P>
If you put a heading <EM>within</EM> an unordered list, it
will line up with the other list items.  By ending the unnumbered list and starting 
a new one below, a subsequent heading returns to the left margin.

<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<H3><A NAME="ol">Creating Ordered Lists:</A></H3>
Ordered lists are used for information that needs to be presented with a preceding numeral.
To make an ordered list:
<OL>
<LI>Start with an <KBD><STRONG>&lt;OL&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.
<LI>For each item on your list, enter an <KBD><STRONG>&lt;LI&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag followed by the item.

<LI> End with a closing tag: <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/OL&gt;</STRONG></KBD>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>With this type of list, you can <STRONG>reorder</STRONG> the items in your list without having to
    <STRONG>renumber</STRONG> them all.
<LI>In later versions of HTML, you'll be able to specify whether you want your list items marked with:

<LI>In later versions, you'll be able to use a <KBD><STRONG>VALUE=x</STRONG></KBD> attribute in the

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 4 - Definition Lists</H1></CENTER>
<p>
This exercise includes use of a <A HREF="Exercise1.html#head">header</A> and a 
<A HREF="#dl">definition list</A>.
<P>
<HR size=3>
<H4><A NAME="dl">Creating a Definition List:</A></H4>
<P>
A definition list allows you to list items as indented paragraphs.  A typical application of this
feature is a glossary or set of "definitions."  Instead of using the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;LI&gt;</KBD></STRONG> 
tag to denote items in the list, the definition list uses two tags to define each list item.  Each 
term to be defined begins with the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DT&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag.
Each definition for the term begins with the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DD&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag.

<P>
To make a definition list:
<OL>
<LI>Start with a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DL&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag.
<LI>For each term to be defined on your list, enter a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DT&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag followed by the term.
<LI>For each definition on your list, enter a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DD&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag followed by the definition.
<LI>End with a closing tag: <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/DL&gt;</KBD></STRONG>.
</OL>
<BR>
<BR>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT>Legislative Branch
<DD>The House of Representatives and the Senate draft the laws.
<P>
<DT>Executive Branch
<DD>The President and his agencies carry out the laws.

</DL>

<BR>

<UL>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;DT&gt;</KBD></STRONG> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;DD&gt;</KBD></STRONG> entries can 
    contain multiple paragraphs, lists, or other information.
<LI>You can use definition lists to indent sections of text.  For instance:
<P>

<DD>is...
<DD>fear itself.
<P>

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 6 - Extended Quotes and Preformatted Text</H1></CENTER>
<P>
This exercise includes use of <A HREF="#quote">extended quotations</A> and <A HREF="#pre">preformatted text</A>.<p>
<P>
<HR size=3>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="quote">Creating Extended Quotations:</A></H3>
If you're including a lengthy quote and want it to be separated from the surrounding text, use these tags:
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</KBD></STRONG>.

<H3><A NAME="pre">Creating Preformatted Text:</A></H3>
For text that needs to have line breaks, fonts, or tabs exactly as they appear in some other document,
use these tags:  <KBD><STRONG>&lt;PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG>.
<P>
The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag instructs Web browsers to display the text between the 
starting and ending tags with the same spacing and line breaks as the source document. Therefore, you 
could turn nearly any word-processed document into a simple HTML document by placing the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag at the beginning of the document and the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag at the end of the document.
<P>
If you don't put any tags in the body of your document, the Web browser will simply wrap all of the text 
as a single paragraph. The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tag allows you to use existing carriage 
returns and spaces as the formatting for your document. Most browsers use a font with an equal character--
also known as mono-space--width (such as Courier) to display the text between the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;PRE&gt;</KBD></STRONG> tags.

"Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise,
its five year mission, to explore strange new worlds, 
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

<TITLE>Carleton College Library HTML: Exercise 7 - Logical and Physical Styles
</TITLE>

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 7 - Logical and Physical Styles</H1></CENTER>
<p>
This exercise includes examples of <A HREF="#log">logical</A> and <A HREF="#phys">physical</A> styles.  
(Note: there'll be more than one "right answer" to this exercise because different tags result in
identical output.)
<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>HTML provides definitions for bold (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;B&gt;...&lt;/B&gt;</STRONG></KBD>) and 
italic (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;I&gt;...&lt;/I</STRONG></KBD>) text, but there is no guarantee 
that a browser will be able to display bold or italic text.  These formatting tags that are dependent on the 
browser's display capabilities are called <STRONG>physical styles</STRONG>.

For this reason, HTML provides emphasis (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;EM&gt;...&lt;/EM&gt;</STRONG></KBD>) and strong 
(<KBD><STRONG>&lt;STRONG&gt;...&lt;/STRONG&gt;</STRONG></KBD>) tags that are <STRONG>logical styles</STRONG>. These tags 
should be used instead of physical tags. If the browser has access to italics and bold, it will usually 
display the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;EM&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag as italic and the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;STRONG&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tag as bold. But if bold and italics are unavailable, the browser will provide another representation for these tags.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="log">Creating Logical Styles:</A></H3>
Logical styles tag text according to its <STRONG>meaning</STRONG>; these are all <STRONG>paired</STRONG> tags.  
Logical styles include:
<UL>
<DL>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;DFN&gt;...&lt;/DFN&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Definition.  Typically displayed like <DFN>this</DFN>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;EM&gt;...&lt;/EM&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Emphasize.  Typically displayed like <EM>this</EM>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;STRONG&gt;...&lt;/STRONG&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Strong.  Typically displayed like <STRONG>this</STRONG>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;CITE&gt;...&lt;/CITE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Citation.  Typically displayed like <CITE>this</CITE>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;CODE&gt;...&lt;/CODE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Computer code.  Typically displayed like <CODE>this</CODE>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;KBD&gt;...&lt;/KBD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>User keyboard entry.  Typically displayed like <KBD>this</KBD>.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;SAMP&gt;...&lt;/SAMP&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Computer status message.  Typically displayed like <SAMP>this</SAMP>.<P>
</DL>
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="phys">Creating Physical Styles:</A></H3>
Physical styles specify how text is to <STRONG>appear</STRONG>; as with logical styles,
physical styles are also <STRONG>paired</STRONG> tags.
<UL>
<DL>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;B&gt;...&lt;/B&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Bold text.<P>
<DT><KBD><STRONG>&lt;I&gt;...&lt;/I&gt;</STRONG></KBD> <BR><P><DD>Italic text.<P>

The use of styles in HTML documents is important.  How else will
readers of your documents be able to tell when you're <b>SHOUTING</b>?<p>
In more refined circles (where people <i>whisper</i>) styles enable
one to look academically-inclined, like this:<p>
<blockquote>
In her work, <cite>HTML for Snobs</cite>, Professor Karen Mateer points
out the <em>importance</em> of using <strong>logical</strong>, rather than
<strong>physical</strong> styles. <dfn>Logical</dfn> styles are, as their name implies,
<em>stylish</em>, whereas <dfn>physical</dfn> styles are a matter of <kbd>brute force and
ignorance</kbd>.

<TITLE>Carleton College Library HTML: Exercise 8 - Horizontal Rules, Line Breaks, Addresses, and Character Entities
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<hr size=7>
<CENTER><H1>Exercise 8 - Horizontal Rules, Line Breaks, Addresses, and Character Entities</H1></CENTER>
<p>
This exercise uses tags from Exercises 1 through 7 and adds use of 
<A HREF="#hr">horizontal rules</A>, <A HREF="#br">line breaks</A>, <A HREF="#add">addresses</A>, and 
<A HREF="#ch">character entities</A>.
<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="hr">Creating Horizontal Rules:</A></H3>

The horizontal rule tag puts a line across the display, adjusted to the width of the browser window.
This tag is useful for visually dividing sections of text on a page.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the tag is:  <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HR&gt;</STRONG></KBD>.  This is <b>not</b> a paired tag.
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH=x%&gt;</STRONG></KBD> creates a centered line X percent of the 
window width.  You can also specify left or right alignment.
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;HR size=X&gt;</STRONG></KBD>, where <KBD><STRONG>"X"</STRONG></KBD> is a 
number makes a thicker line.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="br">Creating Line Breaks:</A></H3>
The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag adds a blank line to indicate the beginning of a paragraph.  
To force a line break with no extra space, use the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;BR&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.  The 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;BR&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag instructs the browser to begin the text on the next line. 
Consider the following Emilv Dickinson poem:
<P>
<PRE>
A word is dead&lt;BR&gt;
When it is said,&lt;BR&gt;
Some say.&lt;BR&gt;
I say it just&lt;BR&gt;
Begins to live&lt;BR&gt;
That day.
&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
A word is dead<BR>
When it is said,<BR>
Some say.<BR>
I say it just<BR>
Begins to live<BR>
That day.
<P>


Since the poem should be displayed as a single stanza, the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;BR&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag 
lets us avoid separating the lines.


<H3><A NAME="add">Creating Addresses:</A></H3>
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags can be used 
surrounding e-mail addresses.  Browsers generally format the address in italics.

<H3><A NAME="ch">Creating Characters Entities:</A></H3>
Some characters, such as <KBD><STRONG>&lt;</STRONG></KBD>, <KBD><STRONG>&gt;</STRONG></KBD>, 
<KBD><STRONG>&amp;</STRONG></KBD>, and <KBD><STRONG>&quot;</STRONG></KBD> have special meaning in HTML.  
To display them, you need to use a feature known as HTML <STRONG>character entities</STRONG>.
Each character is assigned an abbreviation, such as <KBD><STRONG>amp</STRONG></KBD> for the ampersand 
(<KBD><STRONG>&amp;</STRONG></KBD>).  To place the character in an HTML document, you place an ampersand 
(<KBD><STRONG>&amp;</STRONG></KBD>) before the abbreviation and a semicolon (<KBD><STRONG>;</STRONG></KBD>) 
after the abbreviation. These combinations are referred to as character entities 
collectively.
<P>
Note:  Most browsers interpret the quotation mark (<KBD><STRONG>&quot;</STRONG></KBD>) and thus do not require the 
<KBD><STRONG>&quot;</STRONG></KBD> entity. 
<P>
HTML also provides multinational character entities, such as <KBD><STRONG>&amp;uuml;</STRONG></KBD> for 
<STRONG>&uuml;</STRONG>, <KBD><STRONG>&amp;Egrave;</STRONG></KBD> for <STRONG>&Egrave;</STRONG>, etc. 
Note that unlike the rest of HTML, character entity names <STRONG>are case sensitive</STRONG>. 
A complete listing of HTML character entities is available at:

Wow, in seven short exercises, I've learned how to make an effective
page of text on the World Wide Web.  I know how to:<p>
<ol>
<li>Use basic HTML format.
<ul>
<li>&lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt;
<li>&lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt;
<li>&lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt;
</ul><p>
<li>Make several kinds of lists.
<ul>
<li>unnumbered
<li>numbered (ordered)
<li>definition
<li>nested
</ul><p>
<li>Use different levels of headings, from
<ul>
<li><h1>Large</h1>
<li><h6>to small</h6>
</ul><p>
<li>Include extended quotations (like this one):
<blockquote>The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not.<BR>
We have plenty of messenger boys.<BR>
--<i>Sir William Preece, chief engineer of the British Post Office, in 1876.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>Use logical and physical styles to make text appear:
<ul>
<li><b>bold</b>
<li><i>italic</i>
<li><tt>fixed-width font</tt>
</ul><p>              
<li>Use paragraph tags, special characters, and horizontal rules.
</ol>
<p>In addition to all <b>that</b>, you've learned several definitions.  You know that:<p>
<dl>
<dt>The <i>Internet</i>
<dd>is a collection of connected networks all over the world.
<dt>The <i>World Wide Web</i>
<dd>was started by CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics) and seeks to build 
a distributed hypermedia system.
<dt><i>HTML</i>
<dd>stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is a tool for creating multi-layered and 
linked documents published on the Web.<p>
</dl>
<P>
Now maybe it's time to send e-mail to your boss at <ADDRESS>your_boss@work.com</ADDRESS>
and tell him or her how smart you are!?

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 9 - Image Links</H1></CENTER>
<p>
This exercise gives you practice using <A HREF="#url">URLs</A> in <A HREF="#image">image tags</A><p>
<i>Remember to add text for those without graphic interfaces!</i><p>
<P>
<HR size=3>
<H4><A NAME="url">URLs</A></H4>
URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  URLs specify the location of files on servers.  
An URL includes three things:<OL>
<LI> the type of resource being accessed (e.g., http, gopher, ftp)
<LI> the address of the server
<LI> the location of the file
</OL><br>
You can learn more about URLs from <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html.</A>
<p>
<H4><A NAME="image">In-line Image Tags</A></H4>
To include an image next to the text of your document (called "in-line images"), you provide a link to
any file in X-bitmap (XMB) or GIF (color) format.<p>
To include an in-line image, use &lt;IMG SRC="URL"&gt;, where URL is the URL of the image file.<p>
By default, the bottom of the image is aligned with the baseline of the current line.  You can also specify <br>
&lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC="URL"&gt; or &lt;IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="URL"&gt;<p>
<b>Because some users do not have graphical browsers, you need to specify text to be displayed (if your image relays
information).  Use a tag like this one:  <br>&lt;IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="URL" ALT="text to be displayed"&gt;</b><p>
Changes coming soon (already in Netscape):<UL>
<LI>&lt;ALIGN=left&gt; &lt;ALIGN=right&gt; 
<LI>&lt;IMG WIDTH=x HEIGHT=x&gt; will allow you to specify the size of the image
<LI>&lt;IMG BORDER=x&gt; lets you control the thickness of the border
<LI>&lt;IMG VSPACE=x HSPACE=x&gt; allows you to control vertical and horizontal space around an image.

<CENTER><H2>Exercise 10 - Hypertext Links</H2></CENTER>
<p>
This exercise gives you practice <A HREF="#link">linking</A> documents.
<p>
<HR size=3>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="link">Text Links</A></H4>
The tags used to link text together are called "anchors."  An anchor looks like this:<br>
&lt;A HREF="file.html"&gt;Highlighted text&lt;/A&gt;
<H4>Relative and absolute paths</H4><UL>
<LI>An absolute path is the entire address of a file, from the http:// (or equivalent) down to the file name.
<LI>A relative path means we're specifying the path from the current document to another document.
<LI>Use absolute paths if the linked documents are not directly related (e.g. not on the same web site).
<LI>Use relative paths whenever possible.
</UL>
<H4>Hot Image Links</H4>
A hot image link enables you to click on an image in order to move to a different HTML document.  (Images of 
buttons are often used this way.)  To do this, insert the image link inside the anchor tag, like this:<br>
&lt;A HREF="file.html"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="file.gif" ALT="Alternate text"&gt&lt;/A&gt;<p>

<H4>Hot e-mail links</H4>
Some browsers support a "mail to" command.  To make it easier for most viewers of your page to send you e-mail, 
use a command like this: &lt;A HREF="mailto:name@address.net"&gt;name@address.net&lt;/A&gt;<p>

<H4>Links to specific places</H4>
Sometimes you want to use links to move back and forth inside one document or to move to a specific section of
a different document.  To do this:<ol>
<LI>Specify the place you want to link to by defining an anchor:  &lt;A NAME="place"&gt; &lt;/A&gt;
<LI>Specify a link at your origin point (the place you are linking from) by using a # in front of
the anchor name you specified in step 1: &lt;A HREF="#place"&gt;Highlighted text&lt;/A&gt;
<LI>To link from a different document, the tag looks like this: &lt;A HREF="file2.html#place"&gt;Highlighted text&lt;/A&gt;<p>
</OL>
<H4>Hypermedia links</H4>
To include animations and sounds, you use the anchor tag:<br>
&lt;A HREF="URL"&gt;Highlighted text&lt;/A&gt;, where URL is the URL of the media file.  The only difference
will be the file extension of the linked file.  (need link to page of common file extensions)

<CENTER><H1>Netscape Specific HTML Extensions and HTML 3.0</H2></CENTER>

Netscape Communications Corporation started it all by introducing additions beyond the
HTML 2.0 specifications that could be read by their browser, which is used by about 70% of those 
browsing the Web.  Now Microsoft has <STRONG>its</STRONG> HTML extensions 
and the HTML 3.0 specification is under discussion.<p>

Browsers which do not "understand" Netscape HTML enhancements will skip over them.
Be aware, however, that your pages will not look the same on other browsers.<p>

Another warning:  Netscape's bells and whistles can be a dangerous tool in the hands
of those without a sense of aesthetics.  Check the <A HREF="http://www.meat.com/netscape_hos.html">
"Netscape Enhanced Hall of Shame"</A> for (good and bad) examples.<p>

<h4>This page is a summary of basic Netscape enhancements.  For more information, see 
<A HREF="advancenetscape.html">Netscape HTML Enhancements for Graphics</A> in this tutorial, Netscape's <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html">

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="list">List Elements</A></H3>
<DL>

<DT><B><TT>&lt;UL&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>By adding a TYPE tag to the UL element,
    you can specify whether you want a TYPE=disc, TYPE=circle, or TYPE=square
    as your bullet.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;OL&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>By adding a TYPE tag to the OL element, you can specify
    whether the want your list items marked with: capital letters (TYPE=A),
    small letters (TYPE=a), large roman numerals (TYPE=I), small roman
    numerals (TYPE=i), or the default numbers (TYPE=1).
<P>
   By adding a START tag to the OL element, you can specify that
   the list should start at a value other than 1. 
   Always use an arabic number to specify the value.  The TYPE tag will
   adjust the display.  START=5 will
   display either an 'E', 'e', 'V', 'v', or '5' based on the TYPE tag.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;LI&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>Adding the

    TYPE tag to the LI element takes the same values
    as either UL or OL depending on the type of list you are in, and
    changes the list type for that item, and all subsequent items.
    You can also change the count in an ordered list by using a VALUE element.

<H3><A NAME="image">Basic Image Enhancements</A></H3>
<DL>

<DT><A NAME="imalign"></A><noBR><B><TT>&lt;IMG ALIGN=left&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;IMG ALIGN=right&gt;</tt></B></noBR>
<dd>ALIGN=left moves the image into the next available space at the left margin.
Subsequent text will wrap around the right hand side of that image.
ALIGN=right aligns the image with the right margin and the text
wraps to the left.
<P>

<DT><A NAME="imsize"></A><B><TT>&lt;IMG WIDTH=value HEIGHT=value&gt;</TT></B></noBR>
<DD>The WIDTH and HEIGHT tags (units=pixels) speed up display of the document, but also 
    can be used to distort images.<p>
<P>
<DT><A NAME="imborder"></A><B><TT>&lt;IMG BORDER=value&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>This controls the thickness of the border
    around an image displayed.  Warning: setting BORDER=0 on images that
    are also part of anchors may confuse your users as they are used to a 
    colored border indicating an image is an anchor.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="imspace"></A><B><TT>&lt;IMG VSPACE=value HSPACE=value&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>VSPACE controls the vertical space above and below the image, while
    HSPACE controls the horizontal space to the left and right of the image.
</DL>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="center">Centering</A></H3>
<DL>
<DT><b><TT>&lt;CENTER&gt; and &lt;CENTER&gt;</b></b>

values range from 1-7.  The default FONT size is 3.  The value given to size
can optionally have a '+' or '-' character in front of it to specify that it
is relative the the document baseFONT.  The default baseFONT is 3, and can be
changed with the BASEFONT element.<p>

<DT><B><TT>&lt;BASEFONT SIZE=value&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>This changes the size of the BASEFONT that all relative FONT
changes are based on.  It defaults to 3, and has a valid range of 1-7.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;FONT COLOR=#rrggbb&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;FONT FACE="name [,name2] [,name3] "&gt; </tt></b>
<DD>COLOR sets the hex color of the text.  FACE sets the font.  A list can be specified, which will try
    alternates if the font is not installed on the user's system.  If no specified fonts are available,
    the default font will be used. 
</DL>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="hr">Horizontal Rules</A></H3>
<DL>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;HR SIZE=number&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>The SIZE tag lets  you indicate the thickness of the rule.

<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;HR WIDTH=number|percent&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>The WIDTH tag lets you specify an exact width in pixels, or a relative
    width measured in percent of document width.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;HR ALIGN=left|right|center&gt;</tt></B>
<DD>These tags allow you to specify the alignment of the rule.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>&lt;HR NOSHADE&gt;</tt></B>

<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
Netscape Communications Corporation has introduced many additions to HTML that 
can be read by their browser, which is used by about 70% of those browsing the Web.
Netscape is working to have these additions included in the HTML 3.0 specification.<p>

Browsers which do not "understand" Netscape HTML enhancements will skip over them.
Be aware, however, that your pages will not look the same on other browsers.<p>

Another warning:  Netscape's bells and whistles can be a dangerous tool in the hands
of those without a sense of aesthetics.  Check the <A HREF="http://www.meat.com/netscape_hos.html">
"Netscape Enhanced Hall of Shame"</A> for (good and bad) examples.<p>

<H4>This page is a summary of basic Netscape enhancements.  For more information, see 
<A HREF="netscape.html">Netscape Specific HTML Enhancements and HTML 3.0</A> in this tutorial, Netscape's <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html">

<CENTER><A NAME="back"></A><H3>BACKGROUNDS</H3></CENTER>

<H4>BODY BACKGROUND</H4>

Specifies an URL pointing to an image that is used as the background for a document.
In Netscape 1.1, this image is used to tile the background.

<h4>Format:</h4>
<CENTER>
<NOBR><TT>&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="metal/brushed_aluminum.gif"&gt;</TT><WBR>Document here</WBR><TT>&lt;/BODY&gt;</TT></NOBR><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Background swatches can be found on this <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html">Netscape page</A>.
</P>

<H4>BACKGROUND COLOR</H4>

This attribute (not currently proposed in HTML 3.0) allows you to specify the color
of the background without having to load an image.

<h4>Format:</h4>
<CENTER>
<NOBR><TT>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#rrggbb"&gt;</TT><WBR>Document here</WBR><TT>&lt;/BODY&gt;</TT></NOBR><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Where <TT>"#rrggbb"</TT> is a hexadecimal red-green-blue triplet used to
specify the background color.
<P>
Color swatches can be found in this <A HREF=" http://www.infi.net/wwwimages/colorindex.html">guide</A>. <p>
To get the "hex" for any RGB color generated in Photoshop, check 
<A HREF="http://www.novalink.com/pei/hex/hex.html">this site</A>.<p>
<HR SIZE=4>

<CENTER>
<H3>
<A NAME="fore"></A>FOREGROUNDS

<NOBR><TT>&lt;BODY TEXT="#rrggbb"&gt;</TT><WBR>Document here</WBR><TT>&lt;/BODY&gt;</TT></NOBR><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>

<H4>LINKED TEXT</h4>

These attributes let you control the coloring of link text.  <UL>
	<LI><TT>LINK</TT> = link
	<LI><TT>VLINK</TT> = visited link
	<LI><TT>ALINK</TT> = active link
	<LI>defaults are <TT>LINK</TT>=blue, <TT>VLINK</TT>=purple, and <TT>ALINK</TT>=red</UL>

<H4>Format:</h4>

<CENTER>
<NOBR><TT>&lt;BODY LINK="#rrggbb" VLINK="#rrggbb" ALINK="#rrggbb"&gt;</TT><WBR>Document here</WBR><TT>&lt;/BODY&gt;</TT></NOBR><BR>

</CENTER>

<H4>Additional Notes:</h4><UL>
	<LI>Set colors once in the document (you can't change colors in the middle)
	<LI>Setting a background image slows the perceived speed of document load
	<LI>If <B>Auto Load Images</b> is set to OFF, background images will not load<UL>
		<LI>if background image does not load, and no <TT>BGCOLOR</TT> was specified,
			text color attributes will be ignored.</UL></UL><p>

<CENTER><A NAME="imsize"></A><B><H3>SPECIFYING IMAGE HEIGHT/WIDTH</h3>
</B></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>attributes of the <CODE>IMG</CODE> tag
<LI>specified in pixels
<LI>specifying width and/or height different than the actual size distorts (scales) the image
<LI>format:

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC="foo.gif" WIDTH=413 HEIGHT=356&gt;
</PRE>
</UL>


<HR SIZE=4>

<CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="flips"></A>
LOW/HIGH RESOLUTION FLIP
</H3>
</CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>loads low res image on first pass; loads high res on second pass
<LI>mix & match GIF and JPEG
<LI>can use width & height values
<LI>if images are different sizes and width/height are not specified,k second image is scaled
to fit the dimensions of the first.
<LI>format:

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC="highres.gif" LOWSRC="lowres.jpg"&gt;
</PRE>
</UL>


Here are some examples from the Netscape site: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <CODE>LOWSRC</CODE> is a 7,752-byte JPEG; <CODE>SRC</CODE> is a
     113,164-byte non-interlaced GIF.  They are the same size, 360 by 398,
     and are not auto-scaled.  <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/impact_docs/low1.html">Here.</A>
<LI> <CODE>LOWSRC</CODE> is a 16,721-byte JPEG; <CODE>SRC</CODE> is a
     113,469-byte JPEG.  They are the same size, 642 by 595,
     and are not auto-scaled.  <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/impact_docs/low2.html">Here.</A>
<LI> <CODE>LOWSRC</CODE> is a 6,358-byte JPEG; <CODE>SRC</CODE> is a
     64,714-byte JPEG.  They are not the same size (the <CODE>LOWSRC</CODE>
     image is quite a bit smaller); the <CODE>HEIGHT</CODE> and 
     <CODE>WIDTH</CODE> values of the bigger image are given in the
     <CODE>IMG</CODE> tag, causing the smaller image to be scaled up.

<CENTER><H2>Web Search Engines: Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<P>
During the infancy of the World Wide Web, <A HREF="glossary.html#surf">surfing</A> was 
the primary means of finding information.  Starting with a particular Web page, you 
followed links from page to page, made educated guesses along the way, hoping sooner 
or later to arrive at the desired piece of information.
<P>
Surfing was fun when you had the 
time to explore, but when you needed to find a specific piece of information quickly, or 
needed to find that same information again, surfing and serendipity soon lost their charm.
<P>
You quickly learned to collect <A HREF="glossary.html#url">URLs</A>, or addresses of useful Web sites 
on your list of <A HREF="glossary.html#bookmark">bookmarks</A>, but this soon became a fairly 
unmanageable list.
<P>
Eventually you started to wonder if there wasn't some complete index of
the World Wide Web.  The answer, of course, was no, there is no <EM>complete</EM>&nbsp;
index to the Web.
<P>
But that was then and this is now...
<P>
During the last two years, a category of tools has been developed that enables information 
published on the Web to be searched and discovered more effectively.  
These tools are commonly referred to collectively as 
<A HREF="glossary.html#searchengine"><EM>search engines</EM></A>.  We'll be more 
precise so we'll refer to them broadly as <STRONG>Web search tools</STRONG> and then
make a  distinction between the two most common types of tools based upon their  
primary mechanisms: browsing through hierarchies, and keyword searching. 
<P>
As with the Web itself, these tools are constantly evolving.
<P>
Most of the early Web search tools were started as hobbies or projects by college 
students or computer scientists.  They grew in size or fame, and now have gained 
some of their designers great commercial success.  At times, many search 
tools suffer from overuse, resulting in difficutly in connecting to them.
<P>
Given all the hyperbole and heightened expectations surrounding the "information superhighway,"
users need to keep a balanced perspective of what is actually available via Web
search mechanisms.
<P>
While a flurry of activity is underway to create Web search tools for indexing the Web, it's 
unlikely that anyone can replace the knowledge, skills, and "street smarts" of humans anytime
soon.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="what"><H4>What is a Directory?</H4></A>
<P>
A <STRONG>directory</STRONG> is often a good starting place if you are
interested in finding information on a broad topic or subject area.
Directories (also referred to as <EM>subject directories</EM>,
<EM>subject catalogs</EM>, <EM>subject trees</EM>&nbsp; or <EM>pick
lists</EM>&nbsp;) are collections of <A HREF="glossary.html#document">documents</A>
that maintain lists of <A HREF="glossary.html#link">links</A> organized by
their content.  They're usually very easy to navigate and use, since locating
information you need is simply a matter of trying the links under an
appropriate topic.  Well-maintained directories will often include a brief
summary, or <A HREF="glossary.html#abstract">abstract</A>, and other
information for each link to help users select the most useful materials.
Directories are also useful for people who have a general idea about the
information they are seeking, but just don't know where to start.
<P>
The size and complexity of subject directories are simplified by careful
organization, making them the most useful search tool for general subject
browsing.  Directories are commonly organized hierarchically to make it easy
to navigate from the general to the specific topic of interest. Well organized
directories also contain cross-references between related topics under
different headings such as "Business:Computer Sales" "Computers:Vendors".  Some
directories strive to be comprehensive, others aim to be selective, while
others are subject-specific.
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="work"><H4>How Do Directories Work?</H4></A>
<P>
Most directories are organized hierarchically into layers from general to specific 
topics.  A user selects and navigates the links of a directory by their relation to the desired 
information. Since the documents are grouped by their content, once a suitable file is 
found, there are often many more useful links in the same section.
<P>
For example, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</A> is a directory that is
organized into 14 general subject headings and about 50 sub-headings on the
first page. The user must navigate 3 or more index pages to actually find a
page of links, but such pages typically contain more than 20 references to
documents.  Like other well organized directories, this directory makes
abundant use of cross-references between related headings.

<P>
Because directories must be organized in some sort of meaningful way, they
require an administrative staff or dedicated contributors and guest editors to
locate useful documents and link them under the relevant subject heading.  New
documents are found by automated search tools, new service announcements, and
user suggestions. For each document, an administrator writes a descriptive
abstract and inserts the information into the directory under the appropriate
subject heading or headings.  Similarly, outdated documents or
<A HREF="glossary.html#deadlinks">dead links</A> must be removed by a human
administrator or editor, and is typically handled in response to user 
feedback.
<P>
As the number of indexed documents grows, administrators reorganize subject headings to 
accomodate and differentiate popular topics into smaller groups. Careful maintenance makes 
this process of growth and adjustment transparent to the users. 
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="size"><H4>How Important is Size?</H4></A>
<P>
The usefulness of a directory depends on the value of the links it contains. 
There are two approaches that administrators take to maximize the usefulness of their 
collections.
<P>
Services such as <STRONG>Yahoo!</STRONG> work hard to catalog as many Internet 
resources as possible--typically, hundreds or thousands of document collections a week. 
Resources are gathered by accepting URL suggestions from users, scanning mailing list and
newsgroups for WWW announcments, and scouting other directories for new links.
<P>
By including as many resources as possible, these services aim to provide a complete list of 
relevant documents for each subject area. In this model, the burden of selecting the "best" 
resources from this list is often left to the end user.
<P>
Rather than maximizing the number of links, other services follow a different philosophy. 
The links they recommend are hand-picked as the most valuable or complete within that particular 
subject area. Aging and dead links are quickly updated or removed by the staff. A user may not 
find <EM>all</EM>&nbsp; relevant documents in a field using such a tool, but she or he will almost certainly 
find something useful.

<DD>If you want to understand the territory around your subject of interest or to locate a few

    <P>
    A directory is the right tool for people who aren't familiar enough with a subject

<DD>The subject-oriented organization of directories, while logical,

    and between different hierarchies, along with ad hoc
    additions of new categories, increases the difficulty of browsing directories
    effectively.  Increasingly, directories are sporting search mechanisms to relieve
    this problem so that users can <A HREF="glossary.html#keyword">keyword-search</A> the 
    contents of these sites.  This is equivalent to having an index for the directory.<P>
    
<DT><STRONG>Access to Fewer Documents</STRONG>
<DD>Because directories rely on humans for their overall design and maintenance, they
    typically provide links to a smaller number of documents than most automated search
    services. Thus, while directories are helpful when you're trying to find out what 
    the Web has to offer, they become less so as your questions become more specific...so the 
    results of browsing, or even searching an index to a directory, will
    not be comprehensive.  For these reasons, it's usually advisable to supplement your
    search by using a search <link> engine.

<A NAME="what"><H4>What is a Search Engine?</H4></A>
<P>
A search engine is a Web site which collects and organizes Internet resources using a 
large database of information and presents a way to select 
<A HREF="glossary.html#document">documents</A> based on certain words, phrases, 
or patterns within those documents. 
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="how"><H4>How do Search Engines Work?</H4></A>
<P>
Search engines work on the principle that the information content of a document can be 
summarized by extracting words already in the title or text.
<P>
Documents are found (usually by following <A HREF="glossary.html#link">links</A> from
other documents) and entered into a database (known as a <A HREF="glossary.html#index">
searchable index</A>) based on words extracted from the title or text of that document.
This is mostly an automated process.
<P>
Once a number of documents have been indexed, the user describes the desired information using 
selected words or phrases, called <A HREF="glossary.html#keyword">keywords</A>, that are entered 
into the computer. The search engine then examines the database for documents that match or are
related to the user's criteria, and returns to the user a list of the selected documents.
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="work"><H4>Who Does the Work?</H4></A>
<P>
The vast majority of effort required to create search engines' document collections is
accomplished by automated processes.
<P>
A piece of software reaches out across the network and retrieves as many Web pages as it
can find and follows links embedded in those pages to find other Web pages.  At each page,
the program records the address, known as the <A HREF="glossary.html#url">URL</A>, and 
downloads part (or all) of the content for indexing in a searchable database.  Then the
software searches the document for <A HREF="glossary.html#link">links</A> pointing to
other documents that haven't been indexed yet.  Eventually almost every document on the web
is indexed.  These search-and-retrieve programs are often referred to as 
<A HREF="glossary.html#webickything">Web crawlers, robots, spiders, or worms</A>.
<P>
To make search-and-retrieve programs even more efficient, they can be split into two 
distinct parts:  a <A HREF="glossary.html#gather">gatherer</A> and a 
<A HREF="glossary.html#broker">broker</A>.  The gatherer resides at a remote site, 
retrieving documents to be indexed, while the broker stays on the home machine and builds 
the index.
<P>
Spiders start with a list of a dozen or so known sites.
They index these pages, then follow every link to every new page the sites contain and 
index those.  The process repeats until the spider can't find any links in the Web that
it hasn't visited.  Back when the Web was young, when it contained only a few 
thousand pages, this procedure took less than a day.  Now it takes even the quickest
spiders nearly a week to roam the entire Web. 
<P>
The database grows in size because the indexing software saves new links it discovers, 
as well as user suggested URLs, which can be explored and then indexed in the next cycle. 
<P>
Usually, very little human effort is involved in this process.
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="size"><H4>How Important is Size?</H4></A>
<P>
Probably the most important, and certainly the most popular, comparison of search engines 
is based on the number of documents indexed in their databases. Search engines with larger
databases are typically much more likely to contain relevant results and 
larger result sets for given criteria. For this reason, most search engines strive for as large
a database as possible and advertise the number of documents they have indexed.
However, there are several ways to measure the number of documents in a database: 
<P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Documents for which the entire full text has been indexed. 
		<LI>Documents for which the URL, name, and headings or excerpts have been indexed. 
		<LI>Documents for which the URL and name have been indexed. 
		<LI>Documents for which some descriptive text has been indexed. 
	</UL>
<P>
Although each  method represents a count of "indexed" documents, they do not provide 
the same results!
<P>
For example, the <A HREF="http://inktomi.berkeley.edu">Inktomi</A> search engine site 
provides a link called "Truth in Document Counting," disputing the validity of Lycos' 
claim to have most of the Web "indexed."
<P>
The number of documents indexed by search engines are 
<EM>much</EM>&nbsp; larger than those listed by <A HREF="directories.html">directories</A>.
That's because a search engine's  
database describes every page in a collection to better represent the content of that 
collection, but a directory usually only points to the home page or key pages of a collection. 
Considering that collections of pages at a single site can number in the scores or hundreds or more, 
the actual number of documents indexed by a directory is significantly higher than the total links would 
indicate.

<P>

    indexed shortly after coming online, and that dead links are removed in timely fashion.

<P>
<A NAME="weak"><H4>Weaknesses of Search Engines</H4></A>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>No two search engines work quite the same.
<DD>The way you initiate a search differs dramatically from search engine to search engine.
    While some search engines are case sensitive by default, others allow you to choose 
    whether or not a search will be case sensitive. Many engines ignore words of three or 
    fewer letters. And some search only indexes of keywords, while others search the complete 
    text of pages.  The quantity and quality of results you get from individual search engines
    vary every bit as much as the interfaces and search forms themselves.
<P>
<DT>Search results often lack precision.
<DD>Quantity of results is not generally the problem.  But
    <A HREF="glossary.html#precision">precision</A> is another story entirely,
    and easily the most disappointing factor of all.  Many search engines will provide a large
    list of links, only a few of which contain the information that you were searching for.
    The more sophisticated engines demonstrate better precision.
<P>
<DT>Reviews and abstracts are seldom available.
<DD>The sheer magnitude of the number of documents contained in many search engine 
    databases prevents these services from including editorial judgment about the value 
    of the information in these documents.   
<P>
<DT>Popularity can slow performance.
<DD>A major problem inherent with successful search engines is that as soon as a
    particular search tool becomes useful and well known, it's flooded with users.  This
    in turn makes it less dependable, since the original server is unable to handle the
    increased load.
</DL>
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><EM>Return to Contents</EM></A>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="compare"><H4>Comparison of Features of Search Engines</H4></A>
<P>
Selecting the right search engine does not necessarily have to be a trial and error
process. Connection difficulties, however, often make the choice for you. Lycos, one of
the biggest and most popular search engines, is legendary for its unavailability during
work hours. Webcrawler is more often available, and although considerably smaller,
is easy to use, and as a consequence, is often the first choice. The new kid on the
block, InfoSeek, has been favourably reviewed and rated number one in several
recent studies. Two other new search engines, Excite and Inktomi, are also worth exploring.
<P>

Not all search engines offer the same search options. Some of the engines use 'or'
as the default and rely on relevancy ranking algorithms to find and rank relevant
documents. Other search engines offer a choice between 'and', 'or', 'adjacent',
'near', and 'not' options. 
<P>
Different search engines have better precision for some searches than
others. For example, the lack of phrase or word adjacency capabilities with Webcrawler
makes it an inappropriate tool for an author or name search. Such a search will typically
retrieve a ranked result set, but as the first and last name have been considered to
be separate and unrelated search terms, the chance of a successful outcome is very low.
<P>
Each search engine varies significantly in the way the result sets are ranked and
presented, and this influences the success of a search. Scanning down a result set before
activating any of the links is a recommended strategy. The highest ranked documents in the
list are not necessarily those that will provide the desired information. Often the
best link is further down the ranked list.  The amount of information provided with each
link contributes to the ability to assess the individual links. Webcrawler, at one end of
the spectrum, presents a ranked list of links with no additional information. At the other
extreme, Lycos generates a lengthy computer-composed abstract for each link which is
useful for evaluating links. OpenText is an example of a search engine that goes even
further and suggests links to related sites.
<P>
These search engines, compared to OPACs and online periodical indexing tools, are 
still relatively limited in some respects.  The ability to combine results sets and limit
searches to specific fields has not been fully realized.

<P>
A metasearch engine is a Web search tool which which lets you access many different search engines from one site. 
<P>
These tools not only let you search across a variety of engines simultaneously, but they also let you specify which engines you'd like to use, as well as how long you're willing to wait for
the results.  This can be critical, because a complex multithreaded search can conceivably last for hours.  Some don't even force you to decide which engines to use.  Just select the resources and the number of engines to search, and it does the rest.

each search engine. Here are a few general terms to watch for.

<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="truncate"><H4>Truncation</H4></A>
<P>
Most search services perform some sort of suffix management on 
<A HREF="glossary.html#keyword">keywords</A>. This helps users to get the most for
their queries by generalizing each keyword to its root, and expanding the search to 
include all forms of that root word. A query containing the keyword <CODE>computers</CODE> 
may actually return documents containing the words <CODE>compute</CODE>, <CODE>computed</CODE>, 
<CODE>computer</CODE>, <CODE>computes</CODE>, <CODE>computers</CODE>, and 
<CODE>computing</CODE>. Some services allow the user to choose which words are truncated, 
typically by appending an <CODE>*</CODE> character to the end of the root word, like 
<CODE>comput*</CODE>; most others, however, perform the truncation automatically according 
to their own rules.

<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="boolean"><H4>Boolean Searching</H4></A>
<P>
One of the most popular ways search engines handle multiple keywords is by
linking each with a <STRONG>Boolean</STRONG> command.  Examples of boolean
commands are AND (searching for all terms), OR (searching for at least one of
the terms), and NOT (excluding a term from the search).  To learn more about
Boolean search techniques, try these resources:

This feature allows you to tell the search engine that some terms are more important to
you than other terms. That is, you indicate that all terms are important, but one or more
terms are more important that the others.  Different engines have different techniques
for weighting.

<A NAME="relevancy"><H4>Relevancy Ranking</H4></A>
<P>
Many search engines rank the results of your search based on a scoring algorithm; documents
with a higher score appear near the head of the ranked list.  As with term weighting,
different engines have different techniques for ranking, although some combination of
the following rules are often included:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>your terms appear in the first few words of the document
<LI>your terms are found close to one another in the document
<LI>the document contains more than one instance of your terms
</UL>
<P>

<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="concept"><H4>Concept Searching</H4></A>
<P>
A few sophisticated search engines, such as <STRONG>InfoSeek</STRONG> and <STRONG>OpenText</STRONG>, offer concept searching.
They do this by trying to figure out how a word is being used in a document.  This is done by 
collecting statistics on which words commonly occur together.  This way, if the search engine 
sees the word "film" near the word "director," it can guess that the word is being used to 
refer to a motion picture.  This system still isn't perfect because some words may frequently 
occur together even if they aren't really related.  This is due to an important truth of 
information science:  no matter how good the technology, it can only work when the meaning of 
a document is directly correlated to the words it contains.  Fiction--or anything that relies 
on metaphor or allegory--causes difficulties.

<CENTER><H2>Web Search Tools: Tips for Using Web Search Tools</H2></CENTER>
<hr size=3>
<P>
Web search tools are only as savvy as the person doing the searching.  Here are a few general 
guidelines that will help you increase your success:
<P>
<UL>
	    <LI>KNOW WHAT INFORMATION YOU ARE LOOKING FOR:  Do you want something that's being 
	        published on the Web, or information posted in newsgroups? Some search 
            sites concentrate on the Web, others focus on newsgroups, and still others give 
            you the option of both.
        <P>
		<LI>READ THE INSTRUCTIONS:  Most search engines provide their own set of 
		    operators, delimiters, and rules to help you search them efficiently.  
		    Read the instructions, and take advantage of each engine's advanced 
		    features (e.g. A HREF="glossary.html#booleansearch">boolean operators</A>
		    or <A HREF="glossary.html#proximitysearch">proximity searching</A>).
       
        <P>
		<LI>WATCH FOR VARIATIONS AMONG SERVICES:  No two search engines work quite the same. 
		    While some search engines are case sensitive by default, others allow you to
		    choose whether or not a search will be case sensitive. Many engines ignore words 
		    of three or fewer letters. And some search only indexes of keywords, while others 
		    search the complete text of pages.
        <P>		
		<LI>THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE: Is there a synonym for this word? Is there another, 
            less common word that would also be on the site I'm looking for? Can I insert 
            a modifier to narrow the search? If you can answer "yes" to any of these three 
            questions, you'll improve your search before you start.
        <P>
		<LI>CHOOSE THE UNUSUAL WORD:  Often, a more distinctive word will sharpen 
		    your search.  For instance, you'll get a more targeted search with "laptop" than 
		    with "computer".  You should also try to pick words that refine your idea (e.g., "PowerBook" or
		    "ThinkPad").
        <P>
		<LI>WATCH YOUR SPELLING:  Remember to search for legitimate spelling
		    variations (e.g., "color" and "colour").
        <P>
		<LI>REPEAT YOURSELF:  After the first pass, go to the some of the most 
		    promising-looking hits, and jot down other terms that you can use to 
		    narrow or broaden your search.
        <P>
		<LI>USE MORE THAN ONE SEARCH ENGINE:  There is surprisingly 
		    little overlap in the results from a single query performed on several 
		    different search engines.  So to make sure that you've got the best results, 
		    be sure to try your search with several sites.
        <P>
		<LI>TRY SPECIALIZED SITES:  You'll find many examples here:  <A HREF=
		    "http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Searching_the_Web/Directories/">Yahoo:
		    Computers and Internet: Internet: World Wide Web: Searching the Web: Directories</A> 
        <P>
		<LI>BE FLEXIBLE:  In the ever-changing landscape of the Internet, a critical skill 
		    is adjusting to new surroundings.  You must be prepared for formats to change, 
		    access methods to change, and a fluctuation in performance and the types of services 
		    offered.

<P>
<A NAME="best"><H4>What's the Best Web Search Engine?</H4></A>
<P>
There isn't such a thing! At the current state of the technology, it's often 
necessary to repeat searches with different engines. This is because there are 
significant differences in the results that receive from these tools. 
<P>
The decision regarding the best search engine to start with depends partly upon a
thorough understanding and knowledge of the elements in a document that have been indexed
by each engine. For example, some tools index every word of a Web page, while others
are built with only selected words, such as the title, the headings, and
the most significant 100 words. These differences contribute to the very different
result sets that are returned by different search engines for the same query.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="features"><H4>Features You Should Look for in a Web Search Engine</H4></A>
<P>
Different types of searches and information needs require different types of
Web search tools.  You can't use the same Web search tool for all of your searching just like you can't 
use the same reference book for all of your questions. You need to select the proper tool for your searches.
Therefore, it's smart to be a discriminating user.  Here are some questions to ask yourself to help select the
right Web search tool for the job:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>What type of resource am I looking for?</STRONG>
<DD>Do you want something that's being published on the Web, or information posted 
    in newsgroups? Some search sites concentrate on the Web, others focus on newsgroups, 
    and still others give you the option of both.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Is your search general or specific?</STRONG>
<DD>Searches on general topics imply the need for a directory.  You'll have more success with
    specific topics by employing search engines.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Do you want all pages on a topic, popular pages, or quality pages?</STRONG> 
<DD>Several search engines strive to be comprehensive, while several directories
    aim for popularity and/or quality. And some even offer reviews of the sites they list.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Would you rather pick from a list or type in your search?</STRONG> 
<DD>If you want to select choices offered from a list, you need a directory.  Typing
    in your search almost always requires a search engine.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>How sophisticated and usable is the search interface?</STRONG>
<DD>Some search tools are difficult to configure.  Others have interfaces that
    are too simplistic, and you won't be able to customize your query to 
    pinpoint the desired results.  A good search engine is simple to use and
    allows whatever type of search you want.
<P>    
<DT><STRONG>Is it speedy and reliable?</STRONG>
<DD>If the tool is painfully slow to respond to your queries or it's so busy you can't even
    begin a search when you need to, it's of little value.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Are your results usable?</STRONG>
<DD>You want quantity, precision, and readability of your search results.  It may seem
    exciting to get 500 hits, but not if 400 of them aren't really on target.
    And if all you get back is a hyperlinked-URL with no explanation, you're not likely to
    benefit much.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>How are the sites that are included in the search database chosen?</STRONG>
<DD>Are they submitted and edited by humans (implying some level of quality control) or are 
    they harvested by <A HREF="glossary.html#webickything">spider</A> software (which may retain
    both wheat and chaff)?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>How frequently are sites added to this collection?</STRONG>
<DD>In general, search engines will be more current than directories because search
    engines require little, if any, human intervention to build.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>What kind of intelligence is built into the mechanism?</STRONG>
<DD>Some directories offer cross-references and some directories offer various techniques
    to reduce synonym and homonym problems.

This document describes some of the descriptive vocabulary used in the
evaluation of Web search tools. It's not intended as a basic glossary
for general Internet or World Wide Web concepts; for such information, you
should look at John December's <A HREF="http://www.december.com/net/tools/">
Internet Tools Summary</A> for relevant descriptions and tutorials.  If you
want to see another glossary somewhat like this one, look at Scott Weiss'
<A HREF="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~weiss/glossary.html">Information Retreival
Glossary</A>.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="abstract"></A><STRONG>abstract</STRONG>
<DD>A brief paragraph describing a <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>,
    so that the user can decide to download the file based on more than the
    <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A> text. Abstracts are often written as part
    of the <A HREF="#url"><EM>URL</EM></A> submission process, or by server
	staff when added to a <A HREF="#directory"><EM>directory</EM></A>. Don't
	confuse an abstract, which is a summary separate from the original,
	with another term, document <A HREF="#extract"><EM>extract</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="anchor"></A><STRONG>anchor</STRONG>
<DD>Nothing more than another name for a <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A>, I
    think.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="bookmark"></A><STRONG>bookmark</STRONG>
<DD>A stored note telling how to get to a certain useful
    <A HREF="#www"><EM>Web</EM></A> item.  A bookmark 
    is a shortcut for getting to places you visit often in cyberspace.<P>
    
<STRONG><DT>bookmark list</STRONG>
<DD>Also referred to as a <EM>hotlist</EM>.  A customized listing of useful Web items, 
    stored in memory so you don't have to retrace your steps every time you want 
    access to an item.<P>
    
<DT><A NAME="booleansearch"></A><STRONG>boolean searching</STRONG>
<DD>A technique for finding documents that include or exclude data based
	on multiple criteria. By combining or restricting search keywords using
	Boolean operators <EM>AND</EM>, <EM>OR</EM>, and <EM>NOT</EM>, you can specify
	simple or complex formulas. Boolean searching provides a standard
	command interface for extracting matching data from a database.  Also see the
	<A HREF="features.html#boolean">Boolean Logic section</A> of the features of
	search engines page.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="broker"></A><STRONG>broker</STRONG>
<DD>That portion of the <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>Web spider</EM></A>
    software which builds the <A HREF="#index"><EM>index</EM></A> of a
    <A HREF="#searchengine"><EM>search engine</EM></A>. The broker works in
    conjunction with the <A HREF="#gather"><EM>gatherer</EM></A>, which gathers
    items to be indexed.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>concept search</STRONG>
<DD>A search for documents related conceptually to a word, rather than
    containing the word itself.  See also the
    <A HREF="features.html#concept">Concept Search section</A> of the features
    of search engines page.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>controlled vocabulary</STRONG>
<DD><DD>See <A HREF="#vocabcontrol"><EM>vocabulary control</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="client"></A><STRONG>client</STRONG>
<DD>A peice of software into which the user inputs information, and which then
    interacts with a <A HREF="#server"><EM>server</EM></A> to get the
    information that the user requests.  A web browser is an example of a
    client.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>crawler</STRONG>
<DD>See <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>Web crawler</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="#cusi"></A><STRONG> CUSI (Configurable Unified Search      
        Index)</STRONG>
<DD> A metasearch engine which lets you launch searches to major
        search engines one at a time.  See also
        <A HREF="#susi"><EM>SUSI</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="deadlinks"></A><STRONG>dead link</STRONG>
<DD>Because the Web consists of <A HREF="#document"><EM>documents</EM></A> authored and
    located at numerous network locations, the level of document support and
    maintenance varies.  Some collections are regulary used and incorrect
    information is updated; others may not be updated for weeks or months. As
    machine names change, users' documents move, or network connections fail,
    document <A HREF="#link"><EM>links</EM></A> become out of date. A dead link
    is a URL that leads to no existing document, indicated by the message
    "<CODE>404 Error</CODE>".
<P>
<DT><A NAME="directory"></A><STRONG>directory</STRONG>
<DD>A subject directory is a service that organizes linked
	documents by their content and subject matter. Organized into general
	categories (or alphabetically) at the top level, documents are layered
	hierarchically and collected with related pages. Although any subject
	index will be smaller than a searchable one, it's generally a much more
	reliable tool.  See also the <A HREF="directories.html">directories page</A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="document"></A><STRONG>document</STRONG>
<DD>A catch-all term for anything that appears in the main window of a Web
    <A HREF="#client"><EM>client</EM></A>.  
    More specifically, a text file in HTML format that the client displays.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="engine"></A><STRONG>engine</STRONG>
<DD>See <EM><A HREF="#searchengine">search engine</A></EM>
<P>
<DT><A NAME="extract"></A><STRONG>extract</STRONG>:
<DD>A portion of a <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>, typically returned as part
    of a match when using a <A HREF="#searchengine"><EM>search engine</EM></A>.
    New files are usually gathered in large amounts automatically by searching
    and indexing software, so it is rather inconvenient for an administrator
	to write a document summary or <A HREF="#abstract"><EM>abstract</EM></A>, 
	for each file. Search software generally saves sample text from a
	file with its <A HREF="#url"><EM>URL</EM></A> and indexed keywords, as a simple "preview".
<P>
<DT><A NAME="falsedrops"><STRONG>false drops</STRONG>
<DD>A document set returned from a <A HREF="#index"><EM>searchable index</EM></A>
    is characteristically filled with documents that match the user's criteria but don't 
    really contain the desired information.  These unwanted documents are referred to as
    false drops.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/"><STRONG>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</STRONG></A>
<DD>Common questions and their answers, assembled in one list for easy reading and quick
    information.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>full-text index</STRONG>
<DD>An <A HREF="#index"><EM>index</EM></A> containing every word of every
    document cataloged, including <A HREF="#stopwords"><EM>stop words</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>fuzzy search</STRONG>
<DD>A search that will find matches even when words are only partially spelled
    or misspelled.
<P>    
<DT><A NAME="gather"></A><STRONG>gatherer</STRONG>
<DD>The administrators of directories and search engines must
	not only maintain their collection of <A HREF="#url"><EM>URLs</EM></A>, but should
	continue to find more Internet documents to expand their collections. The
	process of gathering URLs can be done manually (by serendipity and scanning 
	the <A HREF="#whatsnew"><EM>what's new? lists</EM></A>) or by running 
	automated software (such as a <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>Web spider</EM></A>) 
	which returns a list of "discovered" resources.  The gatherer software of the
	spider works in tandem with a piece of software called the
	<A HREF="#broker"><EM>broker</EM></A>.  The gatherer resides at a remote
	site, retrieving documents to be indexed, while the broker stays on the
	home machine and builds the index.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="hit"></A><STRONG>hit</STRONG>
<DD>A document returned from a <A HREF="#index"><EM>searchable index</EM></A>
    which matches the users criteria and contains desired information.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="html"></A><A HREF="http://www.ucc.ie/info/net/htmldoc.html">
    <STRONG>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</STRONG></A>
<DD>A collection of styles (indicated by markup tags) that define the various 
    components of a <A HREF="#www"><EM>World Wide Web</EM></A>
    <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>.  HTML was invented by
    <A HREF=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/People/Berners-Lee/>Tim Berners-Lee</A> 
    while at <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A>.  Web browsers display HTML
    pages according to their coded format.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/"><STRONG>HTTP (HyperText 
     Transfer Protocol)</STRONG></A>
<DD>The Web's primary protocol.  HTTP performs the request and retrieve functions 
    necessary to display documents stored on remote computers.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>hyperlink</STRONG>
<DD>See <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>hypertext</STRONG>
<DD>Text linked across a potentially unlimited number of information sources.
    One <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A> takes the user to another document,
    which contains links to other documents (and so forth), and these documents
    can be located on any hypertext-capable system anywhere in the world.  It's
    much like footnoting, but you get the referenced
    <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A> instantly!  Hypertext is the
    basis for the <A HREF="#www"><EM>World Wide Web</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="index"></A><STRONG>index</STRONG>
<DD>The searchable catalog of <A HREF="#document"><EM>documents</EM></A> created
    by search engine software; it works with the search engine to allow a user
    to find documents by entering a <A HREF="#keyword"><EM>keyword</EM></A> or
    other criteria.  Also called "catalog."  Index is often used as a synonym
    for <EM><A HREF="#searchengine">search engine</A></EM>.
<P>
<DT><NAME="invertedindex"><STRONG>inverted index</STRONG>
<DD>An inverted index is simply a huge table, where rows 
    represent documents and columns represent words.  If document <CITE>x</CITE> 
    contains word <CITE>y</CITE>, there will be a binary <CITE>1</CITE> in row 
    <CITE>x</CITE>, column <CITE>y</CITE> of the table.  To find all 
    <A HREF="#document"><EM>documents</EM></A>&nbsp;  
    that contain a specific word, the computer simply scans for <CITE>1</CITE>s in 
    the appropriate column.  With a little added work, its possible to do more 
    complex searches:  Find all the documents that contain the word "apples" and not 
    the word "oranges."  The table helps speed up search engine performance because 
    only the appropriate columns, instead of the documents themselves, need to be examined.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="keyword"></A><STRONG>keyword</STRONG>
<DD>A word or phrase relevant to the information the user is seeking, entered
    by the user to tell the software how to identify the desired data. The
    database software then examines each record in the database for a match.
    Such matches, called <EM><A HREF="#hit">hits</A></EM>, are selected
    because they contain the entered word or phrase.
	Keyword searching can be improved by combining with other techniques:
	<EM><A HREF="#booleansearch">boolean searching</A></EM>, 
	<EM><A HREF="#proximitysearch">proximity searching</A></EM>, or 
	<EM><A HREF="#vocabcontrol">vocabulary control</A></EM>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>keyword search</STRONG>
<DD>A search for documents containing one or more words specified by a user.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="link"></A><STRONG>link</STRONG>
<DD>A reference to another Web <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>, or another
    section of the same Web document.  Links typically appear as highlighted
    or colored text when displayed in Web <A HREF="#client"><EM>clients</EM></A>.
<P>    
<DT><A NAME="loadbalancing"></A><STRONG>load balancing</STRONG>
<DD>Popular Web services can become too busy to run from a single computer,
	and administrators may choose to distribute the document collection 
	and processing across several networked computers. To reduce the 
	<EM><A HREF="#serverload">server load</A> </EM> that numerous users place
	place on critical resources, the server may be configured to perform
	automatic balancing between available computers. By passing off requests
	to alternating machines, the server can improve response time
	significantly.<P>

<DT><STRONG>metasearch engine</STRONG>
<DD> A metasearch engine is a Web search tool which which lets you access many
    different <A HREF="#searchengine"><EM>search engines</EM></A> from one
    site.  Metasearch engines are classified as either
    <EM><A HREF="#cusi">CUSI</A></EM> or <EM><A HREF="#susi">SUSI</A></EM>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="mirrors"></A><STRONG>mirrors</STRONG>
<DD>When a popular server becomes to busy to support the 
	<EM><A HREF="#serverload">server load</A> </EM>, other sites may volunteer
	to run a copy of the same software and database on their own computers.
	By duplicating, or mirroring, the original server's data, the new
	site can serve local users much faster and reduce the load on the
	first computer.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>multithreaded search</STRONG>
<DD><DD>See <A HREF="#cusi"><EM>CUSI</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="page"></A><STRONG>page</STRONG>
<DD>An <A HREF="#html"><EM>HTML</EM></A> document available for browsing in a
    Web <A HREF="#client"><EM>client's</EM></A> main window.  Some documents
    provide key access or information about a service or 
    organization on special pages, called "public pages" or "homepages".
<P>
<DT><STRONG>phrase search</STRONG>
<DD>A search for <A HREF="#document"><EM>documents</EM></A> containing an
    exact sentence or phrase specified by the user.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="precision"></A><STRONG>precision</STRONG>
<DD>The accuracy with which an information system retrieves relevant items.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="proximitysearch"></A><STRONG>proximity search</STRONG>
<DD>Another technique for improving the quality of 
	<A HREF="#keyword"><EM>keyword searching</EM></A>, a proximity search lets you
	identify documents with certain phrases or word combinations. Such tools
	let you specify multiple words that occur near to one another in the text
	of the original document, and thus a better chance of correspondence, 
	rather than two words that may be located anywhere in a single document.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>query-by-example</STRONG>
<DD>A search in which a user instructs an
    <A HREF="#searchengine"><EM>engine</EM></A> to find more documents that are
    similar to a particular <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>.  Also
    called "find similar."
<P>
<DT><STRONG>recall</STRONG>
<DD>The ability of an information system to retrieve stored items.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>relevancy</STRONG>
<DD>How well a <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A> provides the
    information a user is looking for, as measured by the user.  See also the
    <A HREF="features.html#relevancy">relevancy ranking section</A> of the Web
    Search Tools Features page.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>robot</STRONG>
<DD>See <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>Web robot</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="searchengine"></A><STRONG>search engine</STRONG>
<DD>The software on a Web server that applies user criteria to a database
	of documents to build a match set. The speed of the engine is based
	on the size of the collection and the complexity of the search, as well
	as how the software is written.  Search engine is often used synonymously
	with <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>spider</EM></A> and
	<A HREF="#index"><EM>index</EM></A>, although these are separate components
	that work with the engine.  Popular search engines include
	<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A>,
	<A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A>,
	<A HREF="http://www.webcrawler.com/">Web Crawler</A>, and
	<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</A>.  For more information see the
	<A HREF="engines.html">Search Engine Page</A>
<P>
<DT><A NAME="server"></A><STRONG>server</STRONG>
<DD>A computer connected to the internet which allows other computers to access
    certain <A HREF="#document"><EM>documents</EM></A> such as World Wide Web
    <A HREF="#page"><EM>pages</EM></A> from it.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="serverload"></A><STRONG>server load</STRONG>
<DD>The amount of work, such as networking or database searching, that a Web
    <A HREF="#server"><EM>server</EM></A> is performing at any given time. A
    server with a high load will not respond to user requests quickly, or may
    not work reliably.
	A site may choose to replace the server with a faster computer, or
	purchase a second computer to share the processing load and improve
	performance.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>spider</STRONG>
<DD>See <A HREF="#webickything"><EM>Web spider</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>stemming</STRONG>
<DD>See <A HREF="#truncate"><EM>truncation</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="stopwords"></A><STRONG>stop words</STRONG>
<DD>Conjunctions, prepositions, articles, and other words such as
    <EM>and</EM>, <EM>to</EM>, and <EM>a</EM> that appear often in documents,
    yet alone contain little meaning.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="surf"></A><STRONG>surf</STRONG>
<DD>Term for unstructured and serendipitous browsing.  
    It typically refers to the technique of rapidly moving from one Web resource to 
    another--disregarding most content--in order to locate resources of value or interest 
    to the user.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="susi"></A><STRONG> SUSI (Simultaneous Unified Search Index)</STRONG>
<DD> A metasearch engine which simultaneously launches searches
        to several different search engines.  See also
        <A HREF="#cusi"><EM>CUSI</EM></A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>thesaurus</STRONG>
<DD>A list of synonyms a search engine can use to find matches for particular
    words if the words themselves don't appear in documents.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="truncate"></A><STRONG>truncation</STRONG>
<DD>Also referred to as "root/suffix management" or "stemming," truncation
    allows some <A HREF="#searchengine"><EM>search engines</EM></A> to recognize and
    shorten long words such as "plants" or "boating" to their root words
    "<A HREF="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/eukaryotes/green_plants/green_plants.html">plant</A>" and
    "<A HREF="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/premier/">boat</A>." This makes
    searching for such words much easier because it isn't necessary to consider
    every permutation of that word when trying to find it.  See also the
    <A HREF="features.html#truncate">truncation section</A> of the page on
    refining search engine retrieval.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="url"></A><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">
    <STRONG>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</STRONG></A>
<DD>The address of a document on the <A HREF="#www"><EM>World Wide Web</EM></A>.
    The address is contained in a <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A>, which a
    <A HREF="#client"><EM>client</EM></A> interprets in order to connect with the proper
    server.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>visit</STRONG>
<DD>The process of accessing a <A HREF="#www"><EM>World Wide Web</EM></A>
    <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A> via a <A HREF="#hypertext"><EM>hypertext</EM></A>
    <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A>.  
    The anchor of a document that you have visited recently has a different appearance 
    than the anchor of a link you haven't accessed.
<P>    
<DT><A NAME="vocabcontrol"></A><STRONG>vocabulary control</STRONG>
<DD>Vocabulary control means establishing a standard set of
    <A HREF="#keyword"><EM>keywords</EM></A> and identifying documents by these
    keywords, to improve the user's chances of finding every relevant document.
    As a user, selecting a suitable keyword for a search may be problematic
    when there are several related terms that have similar meanings. Unless
	the user's criteria reflect every relevant word in the language, matching 
	documents may be missed in a search.
<P>
<DT><A NAME="webickything"></A><STRONG>Web crawlers, robots, spiders, worms</STRONG>
<DD>Each of these terms are used to describe software that automatically
	downloads and catalogs Internet documents. By reading each document it
	discovers, the software builds a list of additional pages to visit.
	This is a popular method for creating a database suitable for a
	<EM><A HREF="#index">searchable index</A></EM>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="whatsnew"></A><STRONG>what's new? lists</STRONG>
<DD>As more document collections and cool homepages come online, Web 
	servers and other organizations regularly compile them into lists.
	By scanning a few What's New? lists, you can keep track of the 
	latest and greatest pages on the Web.<P>

<DT><A NAME="www"></A><A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/"><STRONG>World Wide Web</A> (also the Web, 
     WWW, or merely W3)</STRONG>
<DD>A method of retrieving information available from certain computers on the
    Internet, making use of a <A HREF="#hypertext"><EM>hypertext</EM></A> interface.
    One <A HREF="#link"><EM>link</EM></A> takes the user to another
    <A HREF="#document"><EM>document</EM></A>, which contains
    <A HREF="#link"><EM>links</EM></A> to other documents (and so forth), and
    these documents can be located on any hypertext-capable system anywhere in
    the world.  The World Wide Web was started by
    <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A> (the European Laboratory for
    Particle Physics) and seeks to build an international distributed
    hypermedia system.

<A NAME="download"><STRONG>Downloading your Searches</STRONG></A><BR>
<P>
You can save your database searches on disk to browse through 
later.  Advantages to downloading are numerous:

<UL>
<LI>     Saving to disk is faster than printing.
<LI>     Saving to disk saves paper.
<LI>     You don't have to retype your citations; you merely cut and paste
them into your word processing document.
</UL>

To download, you will need to bring a 3 1/2" MS-DOS formatted disk 
to the
library.  Follow the directions at the individual 
CD-ROM search stations, because the downloading procedure 
varies from station to station.

To read what you've saved, you will need to use an MS-DOS or 
Windows word processor like WordPerfect, Write or Works.  Your 
searches are saved on disk as DOS TEXT. Ask for help in the 
computer center if you get stuck.

is a not-for-profit membership organization comprising the 
libraries of North American research institutions and operates as a forum for the exchange of ideas and as 
an agent for collective action. The mission of ARL is to shape and influence forces affecting the future of
research libraries in the process of scholarly communication.  ARL programs and services promote equitable access
to, and effective use of recorded knowledge in support of teaching, research, scholarship, and community service.

Institutional Cooperation</a> (CIC) Electronic Journals Collection (EJC), a prototype electronic journal management
system coordinated by the librarians of the CIC member universities, and the staffs of CICNet, Inc. and the CIC.  
Ultimately, this collection aims to be an authoritative source of electronic research
and academic serial publications -- incorporating all freely distributed scholarly electronic journals 
available online. The CIC-EJC serves as the electronic journal collection for the libraries of the
<a href=http://www.cic.net/cic/links.html>CIC member universities</a>. 
<p>
The CIC is the academic consortium of the members of the Big
Ten athletic conference and the University of Chicago. The

Note: When Newsstand "hosts" a publication, it may not provide <EM>precisely</EM> the same content as you'll
find in the paper versions of these publications.  That determination is made by the magazine publisher.
However, at the very least, you'll find sample articles, a table of contents, and some cover art.  Newstand

Celena is a Medieval history major from Hubbard, Iowa. She actually works for

<H1>ED ZAMORA'S HOMEPAGE</H1>

<IMG SRC=rsat_work.GIF ALT="[IMAGE: at work icon]">
This page is currently under construction.
<hr noshade>
<p>	
Basically, I'm still learning how to write a web page in the first place, so
any psycho bored enought to look here should chill...

Let's see, what is interesting about me... actually, not much, but here it goes:
<p>
I am currently a Junior biology major attending Carleton College, MN.  I am also working on getting my butt to Med school.  Like most college bound students, I spent my 1st year figuring out what I wanted and the rest of my time partying: (place pic here) Currently I am working on figuring out how I ended up in state where there are only two seasons--the freezing blight called winter and the humid mosquito breeding seasons.
<p>
For fun I have numerous little diversions including:

<h2>HOCKEY!</h2><ul>

<A NAME="download"><STRONG>Downloading your Searches</STRONG></A><BR>
<P>
You can save your database searches on disk to browse through 
later.  Advantages to downloading are numerous:

<UL>
<LI>     Saving to disk is faster than printing.
<LI>     Saving to disk saves paper.
<LI>     You don't have to retype your citations; you merely cut and paste
them into your word processing document.
</UL>

To download, you will need to bring a 3 1/2" MS-DOS formatted disk 
to the
library.  Follow the directions at the individual 
CD-ROM search stations, because the downloading procedure 
varies from station to station.

To read what you've saved, you will need to use an MS-DOS or 
Windows word processor like WordPerfect, Write or Works.  Your 
searches are saved on disk as DOS TEXT. Ask for help in the 
computer center if you get stuck.

<title>Library Instruction - Internet Citing</title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<center><H2>Tips for Citing Internet Sources</H2></center>
Standards are not yet agreed upon for citing sources gleaned from the Internet.  A recent article in 
<A HREF = "#chron">The Chronicle of Higher Education**</A> discusses the debate over citing Internet 
resources.  Scholars and students of all kinds are finding and using Internet resources, but 
<strong>citing</strong> these sources is a challenge because the citation format differs significantly 
from formats developed for print resources. 
<P>
As a result, librarians and researchers have been adapting or creating guidelines for use 
in citing electronic sources, but they face some unique concerns, including:
<UL>
<LI>Creating a permanent citation for an online resource that has relocated or whose content has changed
<LI>Directing readers to a specific point in a cited document in the absence of page numbers
<LI>Citing mailing list documents that are not permanently archived for verification
</UL>
<P>
Standards for citing Internet sources will undoubtedly evolve.  In the meantime, 
however, you may refer to the guides below for help in citing your online resources:

<h4 align=right>Copyright</h4>
<h2>"Secrets" of Copyright Revealed</h2>
<p>
	It seems that many people in the academic community are concerned about copyright these days. This may be due in part to the recent explosion of information produced and made available in electronic format. Not only can networked electronic information be much easier to access, it can also be much easier to duplicate than information published in traditional paper media.
<p>	One might say that in an Information Age, it can only be more important than ever to be familiar with those pesky copyright laws. Luckily, for the most part the idea of copyright translates nicely into the electronic world.
<p>	So what should we know about copyright? First of all, let's back up a bit. Ideas, symbols, names, forms of expression...we can refer to all of these as intellectual property. Just as with other forms of property, there are certain sets of laws designed to protect intellectual property from being abused, stolen, etc.
<p>	There are three main kinds of intellectual property protection available under US law:
<ul>
<li><em>Copyright</em> protects original creative expressions, including writing, architectural design, software, graphic arts, motion pictures, and sound recordings.
<li><em>Patents</em> are available to protect novel and useful inventions. This includes machines, man-made products, compositions of matter, and processing methods.
<li><em>Trademarks</em> protect distinctive pictures, symbols or words from being used by competitors for identifying similar products.
</ul>


<p>

	Now back to copyrights. What rights do you get when you own a copyright for an original, creative work? You have the right to control:
<ul>
<li>the reproduction of your work,
<li>the production of works based on your work,
<li>the distribution of your work,
<li>the performance of your work,
<li>the display of your work.
</ul>
<p>
	Copyright protection begins from the moment of creation. That is, you don't have to register your work with the government, and you don't have to display a special copyright notice on your work to enjoy basic copyright protection. There are definite benefits to taking these two steps if you ever need to take someone to task for infringing on your copyright, but no registration or warning notice is required for protection.
<p>	When do copyrights expire? Works by a single author are protected for 50 years beyond the life of the author. Works by multiple authors: 50 years beyond the life of the last surviving author. Many works, though, are "works made for hire," or works created at the direction of someone else (like a company). Works made for hire are protected for 75 years from first publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
<p>
	Copyright protection can also end if the copyright owner specifically gives up the rights to a work; the work then enters the "public domain." This term refers to any intellectual property that is not covered by any form of protection. Anyone may do anything with material in the public domain.
<p>	Thanks to several international treaties that the US has signed, works copyrighted in this country are also protected in most other countries around the world. Chief among these treaties is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html">Berne Convention</a>, which the US finally agreed to join in 1989. As a member of Berne, the US is also obligated to honor copyrights held in other Berne member countries. The Berne Convention also mandates many of the features of copyright protection for member countries, so copyright laws (though not necessarily their enforcement) are relatively uniform.
<p>	While basic facts about copyright are often quite straight forward, some of the details quickly become fuzzy when examined closely. Fortunately there is plenty of reliable copyright information available. Your friendly librarians are here to help you find it, and maybe even help make some sense of it!

<h2 align=center>Intellectual Property Protection for Computer Software</h2>

<h3 align=right>by <a href="/staff/michael/">Michael Current</a>, <a href="ac.html">AC</a> Contributing Author</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
The legalities of computer software are often poorly understood.  In this
article I'll attempt to acquaint you with the laws of intellectual property
protection for computer software, especially those pertaining to copyrights.
While copyright protection is the central topic here, I'll also touch on the
areas of patent protection, trade secret protection, and trademark protection
as applied to computers.  Once some backtround in copyright law has been
provided, popular terms such as "commercial software," "shareware," "freeware,"
and "public domain" software will be defined and explored in their legal
meanings, and a few ethical questions are posed as well.
</p>
<h4>Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
<p>
Ideas, symbols, names and forms of expression are typical examples of
intellectual property.  If an author or inventor chooses to allow use of
his/her property by others, the intellectual property laws come into play.
These laws attempt to strike a reasonable balance between the ability of
authors and inventors to control the use of their property versus the right of
the public at large to have free access to new ideas and forms of
expression.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. Congress offers creators of computer software three direct types of
intellectual property protection: patent protection, copyright protection and
trade secret protection.  Many products make use of two or even all three of
these techniques. [<a href="#9">9</a>, p.2]
</p>
<p>
Additionally, trademark protection may be employed to protect a product
name, symbol, device, or a combination of these, from use or misuse by others. 
Trademark registrations cover an initial five year period, with renewable
twenty year periods so long as the trademark remains in use.
</p>
<h4>Patent Protection</h4>
<p>
A patent protects ideas and algorithms in a computer product rather than the
particular set of code used to implement them. By providing 17 years of
exclusivity in the marketplace, patents usually are the broadest and most
powerful form of protection available to a developer, as long as the invention
in question is "nonobvious" in nature.  Two basic types of patents are utility
patents and design patents.
</p>
<p>
Examples of utility patents include inventive functions, methods, systems,
and algorithms, including applied mathematical formulas.  Design patents, while
not protecting the functional aspects of a screen display or a portion of
computer code, protect the graphical or ornamental aspects of a screen display.
Over 10,000 U.S. patents had been granted for software inventions by 1989.
</p>
<p> 
However, patents for computer software aren't widely utilized. [<a href="#9">9</a>, p.3] 
This can be attributed to the unofficial opposition to the practice by the
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">Patent and Trademark Office</a>, the very high relative cost of obtaining a patent,
and the several-year application process necessary to obtain a patent.  Also,
the large amount of disclosure of product information required can jeopardize
the possibility of trade secret protection. [<a href="#6">6</a>, p.83]
</p>
<h4>Copyright Protection</h4> 
<p>
The United States recognizes the following seven rights exclusively to a
copyright holder: 1) Reproductive right: to reproduce the work in copies; 2)
Adaptive right: to produce derivative works based on the copyrighted work; 3)
Distribution right: to distribute copies of the work; 4) Performance right: to
perform the copyrighted work publicly; 5) Display right: to display the copyrighted work publicly; 6) Attribution Right (or, the paternity
right): to claim authorship of the work and to prevent the use of his/her name
as the author of a work he/she did not create; 7) Integrity right: to prevent
the use of his/her name as the author of a distorted version of the work, to
prevent intentional distortion of the work, and to prevent destruction of the
work. [<a href="#4">4</a>, part 2]
</p>
<p>
Copyright applies to virtually all computer software.  It protects the form
of expression, both source and object code, from duplication or close
imitation.  Beyond the program code itself, copyright may be applied to the
program's structure, sequence and organization, and some elements of the
user-interface (the "look and feel").  The copyright holder may prevent others
from modifying or adapting the product for distribution in its modified form. 
Protection under copyright is easily obtained and enforced, but cannot protect
underlying functions, methods, ideas, systems, or algorithms, and it cannot
protect against independent creation of the same or a similar work.
</p>
<h4>Trade Secret Protection</h4> 
<p>
Information and ideas must be of value, not readily known to
others, provide a demonstrable competitive advantage, and be subject to
reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy to qualify for trade secret
protection.  Code, ideas, and concepts may be treated as trade secrets so long
as they aren't obtainable through other products by lawful means, including
reverse engineering.  The technology isn't protected if it's produced
independently by others.  The idea can even be patented by others if they
develop it independently.  A trade secret is forever lost when the secret
becomes general knowledge. Usually trade secret protection is used in
combination with patent and/or copyright protection for software products to
provide more complete protection. 
</p>
<p> 
<h4>Copyrights in Detail</h4> 
<p>
The
copyright laws are found in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/17/">Title 17</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/uscode/">United States Code</a>, which is based
on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">Constitutional</a> power of Congress "To promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors...the exclusive Right to
their... Writings...."[<a href="#4">4</a>, part 2]  In this context, copyright law doesn't
protect ideas, only the ways in which they are expressed. The 1909 Copyright
Act was inadequate for addressing computer software, yet the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">Copyright Office</a>
chose to accept computer programs as literary works beginning in 1964 [<a href="#6">6</a>, p.
35]  The present <a href="http://www.cni.org/docs/infopols/www/US.Copyright.1976-1.html">Copyright Act</a> was passed in 1976 and became effective January
1, 1978.  The question of copyrightability of software programs was temporarily
put off, to be settled by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of
Copyrighted Works.  This finally led to the Computer Software Copyright Act of
1980, amending the 1976 law so it explicitly applies to computer programs. [<a href="#6">6</a>,
p.35] 
</p>
<p> 
If a software program was originally created by the author and not
copied from someone else, and it is stable enough to be stored in any way, then
it was automatically protected by copyright law since the moment of its
creation.  Protection under copyright extends for the life of the author and,
except for rights six and seven above, 50 years beyond the author's death.  In
the case of "works made for hire," (discussed below) protection lasts for 75
years from the year of first publication or for 100 years from the year of
creation, whichever ends first.  Although copyright protection is automatic, to
protect against "innocent infringement" a proper copyright notice (described
below) should be used.  In addition, registration of the program with the
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">Copyright Office</a> is required if you want to challenge a copyright infringer in
court. 
</p> 
<h4>If it Ain't Copyrighted, it's PD!</h4> 
<p> 
As of March 1, 1988,
the effective date of the <a href=" http://www.cni.org/docs/infopols/www/US.Berne.Convention.html">Berne Convention Implementation Act</a>, a work does not
require a notice of copyright to be protected ounder copyright law.  As with
all legalities, however, there are some exceptions to this that directly affect
you and me--dependent as we Classic Atarians are on the Public Domain for so
much of our software these days.  If the copyright has expired, or the software
was published without copyright notice before 1988, or the copyright is
expressly abandoned by the holder, then a computer program becomes part of the
public domain.  Once in the public domain, there are no legal rights associated
with that software.  It may be freely copied, enhanced and sold, without any
kind of compensation to the original author. 
</p>
<h4>Copyright Notice</h4> 
<p>
A legally recognized copyright notice consists of the following: 
<ol> 
	<li>A copyright symbol 
	<li>The year of first publication 
	<li>The name of the copyright owner (or company in the case of works made for hire) 
</ol> 
<p> 
Under
the <a href="http://www.cni.org/docs/infopols/www/US.Copyright.1976-1.html">copyright act of 1976</a> the copyright symbol was either "&#169;" "Copyright,"
or "Copyr.," but "(c)" was not legally sufficient.  However, no such copyright
notice has been required since the United States joined the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html">Berne Convention</a> in
1988.  On the other hand, to be protected under the <a href=" http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/UNTS13444.txt">Universal Copyright
Convention (U.C.C.)</a> treaty, which includes some countries that haven't signed
the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html">Berne Convention</a>, a copyright notice as described above is still required. 
Note that the <a href=" http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/UNTS13444.txt">U.C.C.</a> only recognizes "&#169;" as the proper copyright symbol. 
Also seen in the field is the phrase "All rights reserved." This phrase was
required under the Buenos Aires convention, but all members of that treaty are
now signatories of either the <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/multi/texts/UNTS13444.txt">U.C.C.</a> or the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html">Berne Convention</a>, so "All rights
reserved" is no longer meaningful. 
</p>
<p> 
A copyright owner may register a
copyrighted work at any time during the duration of that work's copyright
protection. It's an absolute requirement if you wish to bring suit against an
infringer of your copyright.  However, monetary compensation is largely only
available if the work was registered before the infringement took place. [<a href="#6">6</a>,
pp.51-2]  Registration of copyright involves sending the required deposit
material, consisting of source and/or object code, plus a $10 filing fee to the
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">Copyright Office</a> of the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>.  Because materials that are
deposited are available for public inspection, a variety of special rules may
be invoked to protect possible trade secrets contained in the machine code.
[<a href="#6">6</a>,p.53] 
</p>
<p>
<h4>Co-ownership and Works Made for Hire</h4> 
<p> 
By default,
copyright ownership rests with the original author of the software.  If there
are co-authors, then each author is a co-owner of copyright for the work. 
Co-ownership of copyright, as in other material items, can be very inconvenient
and produce legal headaches if disagreements arise. 
</p>
<p> 
A work made for hire, on the other hand, is either: 
<ul> 
	<li> a work created by an employee being paid for the creation of that work, or 
	<li> a work commissioned outside the company as part of a set of related products being collectively developed.
</ul> 
<p>
The first case always results in the copyright ownership resting with
the employer, while in the second case ownership remains with the author unless
it is expressly agreed in writing that ownership is transferred to the
employer.  Such agreements are the rule rather than the exception.[<a href="#4">4</a>, part 3]
</p>
<h4>Piracy is Infringement!</h4> 
<p> 
Copyright infringement occurs
whenever one of the seven rights exclusive to the copyright holder is violated,
and is popularly termed "piracy."  If the violation occurs within the scope of
employment, then the employer is also liable for the act, even if unaware of
the employee's activities.  Any person who induces or causes another to commit
copyright infringement is liable as well. 
</p>
<p> 
When considering whether piracy
has taken place, the concept of "fair use" must be understood.  That is, the
law expressly allows for any copying steps necessary for legitimate use of the
software, such as copying the program from disk to RAM. The second part of
"fair use" is the right to make a personal copy of the software for archival
purposes, so long as all copies are either transferred with the original upon
change of ownership, or are destroyed at such a time. 
</p>
<p> 
However, it's
important to note that "Fair use" only applies to copies of software that have
been purchased.  Much of today's software is not purchased by users but rather
licensed to users. [<a href="#9">9</a>, p.46]  In this case the license agreement will expressly
state what rights are granted to the licensee (user) while all other rights
remain with the copyright owner. <i>[Editor's Note: these license agreements
are frequently printed on the outside of the envelope containing the magnetic
disks.  Breaking the seal on the envelope means you automatically agree to all
legal mumbo-jumbo printed there, even if you don't bother to read it (and most
people don't, including me!).-BP]</i> 
</p> 
<h4>Popular Terminology</h4> 
<p>
Lowest in the hierarchy is public domain software: software that can be freely
copied, modified, and/or sold for profit, without notification of the author. 
It has been shown above that software placed into the public domain is the
exception rather than the rule.  The only real way for a program to enter the
punlic domain is for the copyright holder to unambiguously declare it so,
thereby forefeiting all intellectual rights associated with it. 
</p>
<p>
Often
confused with public domain software is Freeware.  Freeware is software that
can be freely distributed but not modified in any way. The programmer wishes
his/her creation to see maximum distribution at no cost to its users, but
he/she also wishes to retain full intellectual property rights for the program.
 What is happening here is a mandatory license agreement between the copyright
owner and the user.  The programmer retains full copyrights, except for those
rights expressly granted to licensees, those persons who obtain the software.
</p>
<p>
Next up the line is Shareware. In fact, the only difference between
Shareware and Freeware is that among the conditions stated in the
programmer-written user license agreement is the demand that a certain amount
of money be sent to the author.  In markets too small to support more than a
few commercial software developers, this can be an effective way to market
software for a small profit. 
</p>
<p>
At the top of the hierarchy is commercial
software.  This bracket includes all software that must be purchased by the
user at the time of acquisition.  As briefly discussed above, commercial
software can be further divided into software sold to users and software
licensed to users.  A user who has purchased a copy of commercial software has
not purchased the copyrights in any way, and may not violate any of the seven
rights which remain exclusively held by the copyright owner.  Licensed
software, on the other hand, is software where only a few rights are explicitly
granted by the copyright owner to the user.  The user has purchased nothing but
the license agreement, and is usually required to return the copy of the
software to the owner when the terms of the agreement are violated.  Such
agreements are usually imposed by the developer to further limit the rights of
the user beyond those granted by copyright law. 
</p>
<p> 
In addition to categorizing
computer software by the amount of payment required, it's also useful to group
all copyrighted software into these two categories: 1) Purchasable commercial
software, where ownership of the copy, but not the copyright, is transferred,
and 2) Licensed software, which includes freeware, shareware, and the rest of
commercial software, where ownership remains with the copyright holder.  Users
of purchased commercial software must abide by copyright law and the license
agreements beyond copyright law. 
</p>
<h4>Questions for Future Research</h4>
<p> 
The field of computer copyrights is enormous, much more than I can present
in a single short introductory magazine article. My limited research has left
may questions unanswered, especially issues that directly affect the Atari
8-bit user community. Clearly, no copyrights have expired for computer software
created since 1978, but what if a commercial program is no longer commercially
available?  What if the commercial developer has long since disappeared into
bankruptcy?  Agreements can be made between the programmer and employer in this
case so that copyrights revert to the author, but from my limited observation,
this doesn't seem to be the default course of events. Is it legal to obtain
pirated copies of commercial software if the developer no longer exists?  What
if the vendor exists but has long since lost interest in the product? 
Legalities aside, does one have a right to pirated software that is unavailable
legitimately? These are standing legal controversies in the 8-bit community,
but unfortunately I'm not planning a career in law!  Hopefully, the extensive
bibliography following this article will inspire someone else to take up the
challenge and enlighten us further.

INTRODUCTION
 
      This is a very basic version.  I am adding as 
people give feedback to what they want to see, and how 
they want to see it. Any info or comments you have are 
more than welcome!
 
PURPOSE
 
      This FAQ exists to describe the various hardware 
modifications available to the Atari 8-bit user.  It does 
not teach you how to do them.  It definitely doesn't take 
any responsibility for the results if you do try them.  
But it will try to give you some information about where 
to find more information, which upgrades (or "hacks") are 
best, and who to consult if things go wrong.  For 
addresses and phone numbers of any of the companies 
listed, consult the Vendors and Developers List, posted 
to comp.sys.atari.8-bit at or about the 15th of each 
month.
 
      It also exists to describe the many wild, Woolley 
and wonderful products that have been produced for the 
Atari 8-bit.  Many are unique, some may be apocryphal.  
Mainstream items like printers, modems, disk drives and 
cassette decks are all excluded, unless I feel otherwise. 
Temperature gauges, combination printer buffer/RAMdisks 
that run through the joystick port, and other such are 
fair game.
 
      If you're looking for a list of Atari hardware 
(real or vapour-ware) or for a list of Atari compatible 
disk drives, check out the comp.sys.atari.8bit FAQ, 
posted every two months, and stored at the University of 
Michigan archive (gopher://gopher.archive.umich.edu).

POSTING FREQUENCY
 
      This FAQ is posted whenever I remember to post it.  
It is posted to comp.sys.atari.8bit.
 
OTHER STUFF I THOUGHT I SHOULD INCLUDE SOMEWHERE

      This FAQ owes a debt of gratitude to Michael 
Current, Bill Kendrick, Glenn Saunders and Ben Corr for 
their contributions.  Bob Woolley and Bob Puff (CSS) also 
deserve mention, since they are responsible for so many 
of the items listed here.  All errors, omissions, blatant 
mistakes and attitude problems are mine.  If you notice 
any, tell me!

PART I - RAM Upgrades
 
General
 
      The 6502 microprocessor at the heart of every Atari 
8-bit has a sixteen bit wide address bus.  What this 
means is that it can access up to 2^16 memory locations.  
That's 65536 bytes.  Some people, wanting more memory, 
came up with a variety of techniques to use more memory.  
Most were built around the idea of bank switching.  Bank 
switching means that you swap chunks of memory around so 
that the CPU can see them when necessary.  Most schemes 
use 16k banks, though 4k and 32k have also been tried.

Atari 400
 
      The original Atari 400 had either 8k or 16k.  Atari 
produced a board with 48k.  Mosaic produced a 32k board, 
as well as a 64k board with 48k RAM plus 4 4k RAM banks. 
(ANL 13, IFC)
 
Atari 800
 
      The Atari 800 came with three memory slots.  Each 
slot could contain Atari 8k or 16k RAM boards.  Mosaic 
produced 32k and 64k boards.  Three 64k boards could be 
combined for 192k.
 
      Axlon produced the 128k RAMdisk board.  It banks 
16k, using $CFFF as a control register.  Banked memory 
appears from $4000 to $7FFF.
 
      David Byrd created the "800 PLUS 288K UPGRADE" 
which rewired  existing 16k RAM boards, but required 
additional work to become  fully Axlon compatible.  A 
nasty sort of flame war erupted between  David Byrd and 
Jay Torres of the Windhover Project over who invented the 
upgrade.
 
      Magna systems produced 256k, 512k and 1M boards 
which followed the Axlon standard. (ANL 65, 68)
 
Atari 1200xl
 
      See 800xl.
 
Atari 600xl
 
      As shipped, the Atari 600xl came with 16k RAM.  
Atari released the 1064 memory module which expanded the 
600xl to 64k. MPP, now Supra, produced the Microram 64k 
Memory Board (ANL 19,  28)
 
      RC Systems produced three expansion modules for the 
600xl, raising memory to 32k, 48k or 64k (ANL 26, 12)
 
      Richard Gore produced the Yorky, a 256k board which 
plugs in to the PBI.  It provides full compatibility with 
130xe type banking.  It is for use on 600xls upgraded 
internally to 64k, or on 800xls.  (AC 3/2, 10)
 
Atari 800xl
 
      The Atari 800xl came with 64k RAM internal.  To 
access RAM hidden under the OS ROMs, the PIA chip was 
used (PORTB, used for  STICK(2) and (3) on the original 
800).  Claus Bucholtz published  plans for a 256k upgrade 
which banked 32k at a time using PORTB for control in 
Byte magazine. (Byte Sept 85)
 
      ICD released the RAMBO upgrade, providing 256k in 
16k banks, using PORTB.  Newell came out with the 256k 
XL, which would work on a 1200xl or 800xl, providing 256k 
total memory, .  The two upgrades used different 
sequences to access their banks. (ANL 44, 115)
 
      Charles Bucholtz updated his upgrade to use 16k 
banks after the release of the 130xe.  Most of the 800xl 
upgrades can be made compatible with Antic banking.  The 
only possible problem would be when Antic and the CPU are 
supposed to be using different memory banks.
 
      The Yorky will also provide 256k on an 800xl (see 
the entry under 600xl).
 
      Newell released 1Meg and 4Meg upgrades for the 
800xl.  These banked 16k as well, and required disabling 
internal BASIC to properly access the memory.
 
      Fine Tooned Engineering, having bought the rights 
to ICD and Newell's products, is bringing out a third 
method in the Mars 8. Though not yet released, it will 
use SIMMs for 256k, 1Meg or 4Meg RAM.
 
     The 800xl is arguably the most popular Atari 8-bit 
for upgrades, since most 800xls have socketed chips.

Atari 130xe
 
      The 130xe was the first "official" method of 
banking memory. It too used PORTB, but with an added 
twist: ANTIC and the CPU could access different banks.  
This provided headaches for some owners of "older" 
upgrades, but few programs took advantage of this feature 
(SpartaDos Wedge and VideoBlitz demo only).  Upgrades for 
the 130xe include replacing one set of 64k chips with 
256k chips, raising the RAM to 320k.  Adding another 256k 
for 576k total has also been done.  These were designed 
by Scott Peterson, as was a 1088k upgrade.
 
PART II - Video
 
Upgrades
 
      The most common video upgrades are the SuperVideo 
series, described in AC 2/6.  Plans were provided for the 
600xl, 800xl, 1200xl and 130xe.  The SuperVideo upgrade 
provides the forgotten chroma signal on the monitor port.  
It corrects a number of errors in the parts in the Atari 
video circuit, resulting in a clearer image, particularly 
on monitors.
 
      Providing TTL output was also covered in AC 2/6.  
Bob Woolley provided plans for the circuit, as well as 
instructions for getting TTL output from an XEP80.  Be 
warned that the output is not in the standard Atari 
colours; on a CGA type screen, the sixteen possible 
shades are translated into eight colours.
 
80 column devices
 
      Since the 400/800 were released in 1979, people 
have been clamouring for better text displays than the 
default 40x24.  Two products were released for the 800: 
The Austin-Franklin 80 column board and the Bit 3 80 
column board were both for use in the Atari 800.  They 
replaced the third memory module.  The Austin-Franklin 
board came with a "Right Cartridge" which provided the 
drivers. Removing the cartridge disabled the board.  Some 
software would not run with an 80-column board installed.
 
      Ace 80/80xl was a cartridge released which provided 
80 columns by using  bitmapped graphics on an 80 column 
screen.  A similar technique was used in the Newell 
Omniview, an add-on for their Omnimon.
 
      Atari's entry into the 80 column field was the much 
maligned XEP80.  For maximum compatibility, the XEP80 
attaches to the computer via a joystick port.  It 
includes three character sets, 8k internally, and a 
parallel printer port.  The software provided by Atari 
supports a 320x200 graphics mode.  This mode only 
supports direct bit images.  Hacks have been released 
which hook the XEP80 on via the parallel bus.
 
     Recent terminal programs have added two other 
display techniques.  ICE-T uses a graphics 8 screen and 
fine scrolling for its display.  FlickerTerm uses two 
graphics 0 screens a half-character apart, each displayed 
during alternate vertical blanks.

      In a series of articles in the SLCC newsletter, Bob 
Woolley gave hardware plans for installing an 80-column 
TTL output inside an XL.

Nir-PAL

      With the decline of Atari in North America, more 
and more quality software was migrating across the 
Atlantic which was all but unusable.  Why?  European 
Ataris are built for the PAL broadcast standard; North 
American Ataris use NTSC.  Not knowing it was impossible, 
Nir Dary upgraded an NTSC Atari to run PAL software 
properly.  Swap out the NTSC Antic chip for a PAL Antic, 
do a minor modification to the OS, and voila!  Your Atari 
is ready to join the EU.  (Better stop before the 
abbreviation police arrive!)

Genlock
 
      In October and November of 1991, Michael St Pierre 
published articles in the SLCC Journal describing plans 
for a monochrome Genlock.  A genlock is a system to 
synchronize live video with a computer image.  Graphics 
can be overlaid, faded in or out, or used for titling.
 
      In 1994, Michael announced Prism Studio, a full 
colour genlock.  It is sold by Mytek.
 
Computer Eyes
 
      Computer Eyes was a video capture system which 
plugged into two joystick ports.  It could render images 
in a variety of modes. It required a composite video 
source.  (ANL 35, 53)
 
Easy Scan
 
      Take a cartridge, add a fibre-optic cable, and hook 
it onto a printer, and you've got Easy-Scan, an image 
scanner for the Atari 8-bit.  Innovative Concepts 
produced this item.  (ANT 7/6, 43)
 

PART III - Operating Systems
 
      The original 400/800 had a 10k ROM OS.  There was 
nothing in memory from $C000-CFFF.  The later xl/xe 
models all had 16k OSes.  As an added bonus, the xl/xe OS 
was in a 28 pin ROM that was pin compatible with a 27128 
EPROM.  What does this mean to the layman?  With a little 
knowledge of 6502 assembly and an EPROM burner, you can 
write your own operating system (or at least change 
Atari's).

Computer                OS

and Omnimon.  Includes option for second OS.
 
XL Boss: from Allen Macroware.  OS replacement for XL 
model computers.  Includes m/l monitor.  400/800 OS 
compatible.
 
TurBoss: available from KP and Best.  Fast math and fast 
screen routines.  For XL/XE computers.
 
Turbo 816: Chuck Steinman at Dataque released a modified 
OS that used the 16 bit capability of the 65816 CPU 
upgrade he sold.  For XL/XE computers.

DP OS Version 4: my own effort (don't ask about versions 
1 through 3!).  Fast floating point math, fast screen 
display, graphics 0 screen dump, fast keyboard repeat.  
For XL/XE computers.

SmartOS: This is a hardware upgrade that installs a 
battery-backed RAM chip into your XL/XE.  This lets you 
fool around with changing the OS and not have to burn new 
EPROMs constantly.  Presented in AC 4/3.

PART IV - Sound

Voice Master
 
      Covox sold the Voice Master and Voice Master 
junior.  These would capture and record speech.  Bundled 
software attempted recognition of commands, with limited 
success. (ANL 47, 44)
 
Parrot
 
      The Parrot was a sound digitizer sold by Alpha 
Systems. Resembling a paddle, the device had phono jack 
for input.  Antic provided plans for a similar project, 
called the Antic Sampling Processor.  (ANT 8/8, 11)
 
SoundMouse
 
      Among the more esoteric products ever released was 
the SoundMouse, which interpreted sound to provide a 
reading on a paddle register.  It did not act as a 
digitizer, like the Voice Master and Parrot did.  Bundled 
software made the lava lamp look mainstream in its 
appeal.  No commercial applications taking advantage of 
this unique device were released.
 
Gumby
 
      Chuck Steinman of DataQue created this set of plans 
for building stereo sound by installing a second Pokey 
chip (Pokey and Gumby, get it?).  Once installed, the 
second channel has all its addresses 16 bytes higher in 
memory ($D210 - $D21F).  A small number of demos have 
been released in stereo.

      available at the umich atari archive 

POPS

     Lee Brilliant, ANALOG's resident hardware guru, came 
up with this system for stereo sound, running it off the 
clock line on the SIO bus.  As with Gumby, it requires 
customized software to use.  (ANL ???)

MIDIMATE

     MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface.  It is a system for computers to record, 
replay and control musical instruments.  MIDIMATE, when 
combined with MidiTrack software, permits an Atari 8-bit 
to take control.  Why buy an ST?  (ANL 33:26)

SIO-2-MIDI Interface

     This is a set of plans to make your own MIDI 
interface.  Limited software is included.

      available at the umich atari archive


PART V - Disk Drives

Happy Computing

      Atari users were notorious for their software 
piracy.  The Happy Drive (originally for the 810, later 
for the 1050) contributed to that reputation.  It was a 
modified 810, which could duplicate copy protected 
software.  Thus began a war between crackers and software 
houses.  It also included a full track buffer, which sped 
up operations and reduced the painful grinding sound of 
the 810 at work.  The 1050 version also made the 1050 
into a true double-density drive; the last version would 
let the modified 1050 read and write 180k MS-DOS disks.

US Doubler

      The Atari 1050 drive was brain-damaged from the 
very beginning.  Rather than add a few dollars worth of 
parts to make a true double-density drive, Atari invented 
their own format, called "dual-density", which stored 
130k on a disk.  ICD produced the US Doubler, a hardware 
add-on that gave the 1050 true double-density.  As an 
added bonus, it also included UltraSpeed, which made 
"the normal beep-beep of Pokey sound like staccato 
machine gun fire" according to one review.  A variant 
was produced which added 4 to the drive number, 
permitting drives to be addressed as D5:-D8:.

The Super Archiver

      This was CSS's entry into the 1050 DD sweepstakes.  
It included a high-end crackers' toolbox, letting you 
edit sectors, create phantom sectors and other fun stuff.

The Bit Writer

      Eventually, software companies came up with a new 
copy-protection technique: use 34 sector tracks and 
repeating sector numbers, so you get a "different" 
sector #7 depending on where the disk is when you ask for 
it.  CSS to the cracker's rescue again!  The Bit-Writer 
reads in tracks from the disk and stores the bit pattern.   
This can then be re-written.  Ironically, the software 
disk that came with this upgrade to the Super Archiver 
was created on a non-Atari machine, so users couldn't 
copy it.

The XF551 Update

      Atari's last disk drive for the 8-bit wasn't quite 
perfect.  This replacement OS ROM from CSS fixed a number 
of bugs (can't switch back and forth between SD and DD 
properly), and sped up the drive.  A warning on upgrading 
the XF551: The main PC board is lousy.  It's REALLY easy 
to break traces - even unplugging SIO cables can do it.  
BE CAREFUL!

The XF Single and Dual Drive Upgrades.

      CSS introduced these for the XF551.  You could 
either replace the 360k mechanism with a 720k one, or add 
a 720k to the 360k.  Software included let you read and 
write IBM disks.

Bob Woolley's 3 1/2" XF551 Upgrade

      Once again, someone couldn't leave well enough 
alone, ripped apart Atari hardware, got bored with merely 
improving the OS ROM, and swapped out the 360k 5 1/4" 
mechanism for a 720k 3 1/2" one.  This was sold by an 
outfit called Innovative Concepts.

512k ROMDisk

     From Klaus Peters in Germany, this system provides a 
solid-state alternative to floppy and hard disks.  Using 
up to 8 27512 EPROMs, this setup provides high-speed PBI 
access to commonly used software

Amdek 3" drive

     Amdek released a new standard for disks: a rigid 3" 
plastic disk that could store a whopping 360k (but you'd 
have to flip the disk for that).  It never caught on.

MIO
 
      ICD manufactured this wonderboard in 1987.  
Connected to the PBI or ECI, it provided either 256k or 
1Meg of RAM, two RS232 ports, a parallel printer port and 
a SCSI hard drive port.
 
MIO II
 
      Currently under development by Fine Tooned 
Engineering, this PBI/ECI board will provide an interface 
and power supply for an IDE hard disk.  It may also 
include extended memory support for CPU upgraded 
computers, as well as a parallel port.
 
Black Box
 
      CSS manufactures the Black Box, a PBI/ECI device 
that offers an optional 64k printer buffer.  Its main 
attractions are its m/l monitor, 19200 baud RS232 port, 
parallel port, and hard disk interface.  The parallel and 
serial ports do not use standard DB9 or DB25 connectors; 
custom cables are required.
 
Floppy Board
 
      This is an add-on to the Black Box, also from CSS.  
It permits standard floppy drives, 360k, 720k, 1.2M and 
1.44M, to be attached to the Black Box.  Since they are 
connected to the PBI, these drives operate extremely 
quickly.  Software included lets you read and write to 
MS-DOS format disks.
 
Supra/KP Hard Disk Interface
 
      Supra released one of the first hard drives for the 
800xl. It hooked up via the PBI.  KP bought the rights to 
the interface from Supra.
 
Corvus Hard Disk System

     The earliest hard disk interface, the Corvus system 
hooked up to a 400/800 via joystick ports 3 and 4.  A 
custom DOS would be booted from a floppy disk to permit 
the computer to access the hard disk, which was divided 
into 720 sector partitions.

IDE Hard Drive Interface v1.0

     New from Poland, this promises to let your XL/XE 
take control of new IDE hard disks.  Its design will 
permit future systems to break the 16 megabyte boundary.

Bob Woolley's IDE Interface

      Some guys are constantly hacking hardware.  And 
then there's Bob.  Memory upgrades?  PBIs for 1200xls?  
80 column devices?  Battery-backed RAM operating system?  
Somewhere, after all those, he found the time to 
interface the xl/xe parallel bus with an IDE hard drive.  
Plans to be published in the next Atari Classics 
magazine.

ATR-8000

     SWP Computer Products made this original wonder-
widget: Serial and parallel ports, standard floppy 
interface, optional hard disk interface and even CPM and 
MS-DOS add-ons.

Critical Connection
 
      A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, was a 
mystic operating system known as CPM.  A company named 
USS Enterprises produced the Critical Connection, a 
device to permit a CPM computer to emulate disk drives 
for the Atari.  It was a cable, plus software for the CPM 
end of the system.  The CPM system could also act as a 
printer buffer, and the CPM keyboard could be used in the 
place of the Atari keyboard.  (ANL 39,103)
 
SIO2PC
 
      With the demise of CPM and the rise of the IMI 
cartel (IBM-Microsoft-Intel) a new system similar to the 
Critical Connection arose.  Nick Kennedy developed the 
SIO2PC hardware and software, which permits any PC with a 
serial port to act as up to four disk drives for an 
Atari.  It can also act as a printer buffer.
 
APE

      Stephen J. Tucker took SIO2PC one better and wrote 
new software.  The Atari Peripheral Emulator (APE for 
short) lets your PC act as high-speed drives.  It lets 
you print to your PC printer.  And it lets you use your 
PC modem on the 8-bit.  It also permits, with a special 
cable, the creation of backups of copy-protected disks.

PART VI - Other Neat Stuff
 
Zucchini
 
      In ANL 59,60 and 62, Dr. Lee S. Brilliant provided 
plans and software to turn a surplus Atari into a printer 
buffer for another Atari.  He called it "The Atari 
Zucchini".
 
      The Printer Buffer Routine (PBR) and Disk Emulator 
Routine (DER) came from B.L. Enterprises.  They were 
cartridges and cables which worked in a similar fashion 
to the Zucchini.  The PBR provided a buffer, while the 
DER emulated a disk drive on the remote computer.  Stock 
XLs gave 403 free sectors; a 130xe would give 914. (ANL 
65, 67)
 
 
PIA2
 
      With the use of PORTB for RAM banking, hackers were 
looking for more parallel outputs.  This plan, for adding 
one more PIA chip, includes notes for adding two more.  
It was intended as a means to control large RAM upgrades.  
(AIM 3/2, 16)

WIMA Radio, Lima, Ohio
 
      This radio station, when automating 6 broadcast 
hours daily, created a hardware and software package 
built around a 130xe for control.  Control was via 
joystick ports and tone decoders. (ANT 8/7, 30)
 
Comp-U-Temp
 
      This provided 8 or 16 channels and 2 or 4 sensors.  
It would monitor the temperature, with options to log 
results to disk or printer, or to sound an alarm if the 
temperature strayed out of set boundaries.  The software 
was described as "cumbersome". (ANL 48, 35)

Atari Lab

     During one of their periodic restructurings, Atari 
decided to sell their computers as educational.  Thus, 
the Atari Lab series was produced.  The two kits released 
provided experimenters with tools to measure light and 
temperature.  Of course, the next restructuring left this 
an orphan product.
 
Turbo 816
 
      Released by DataQue, this provided a replacement OS 
as well as a replacement for the 6502 CPU.  A 65816 was 
substituted, providing new opcodes and a 24 bit address 
space (16Megs vs 64k with the 6502).
 
Sweet 16
 
      Released by Fine Tooned Engineering, this provides 
a 65816 CPU to replace the 6502.

Bob Woolley's 65816 Upgrade

     Notice one name popping up again and again?  In AC 
3/3, Bob began explaining how to add a 14 mHz 65816 to 
your xl.  That's right, parallel processing.  Complete 
plans were never published.
 
MicroNet
 
      Supra provided the Atari community with its first 
networking product.  MicroNet provides nine SIO 
connectors.  Eight are for computers.  The ninth goes to 
whatever peripherals are to be connected.  The system 
served to isolate the computers electrically.  It did no 
software checking, meaning that two or more users 
attempting to print or save at the same time could trash 
each others output.  (ANL 51, 76)
 
MultiPlexer
 
      CSS provided a better way to network.  The 
Multiplexer system requires one host system which has all 
the disk drives and printers for the network.  The slaves 
are connected via the cartridge port to the host, and all 
their disk and printer i/o is rerouted to the host.  All 
the systems involved require their OS replaced with a 
special multiplexer OS.
 
GameLink II

     The most recent innovation in networking the 8-bit 
Atari, GameLink II permits up to 8 machines to share 
information for interactive games.  Currently, only the 
Maze of Agdagon supports this system.  DataQue sells 
cables and the game.

J-Net

     Released to on-line services and possibly to the 
Umich archive as well, this set of programs was designed 
to interface computers by the joystick port, using 3 bi-
directional data lines and two control lines.

R-Time 8
 
      This is a clock cartridge for any Atari from Fine 
Tooned Engineering.  It includes a pass-through connector 
so that any other cartridge can be plugged in as well.  
Though primarily intended for SpartaDos, software for 
other DOSes is included.
 
???? Clock Cartridge

     Announced `way back in Atari Classics 1/1, this 
product was intended as a replacement for the R-Time 8.  
Software difficulties have kept it from being released.

Mars-8
 
      This is still under development from Fine Tooned 
Engineering. For 800xls only.  Memory expansion of 256k, 
1M or 4M.  Install internally Action, Basic XL/XE, 
MAC/65, SpartaDos X, R-Time 8.
 
Atari 850
 
      This device hooks into the SIO line, and provides 4 
9-pin RS232 ports and a 15-pin parallel port.  The RS232 
ports are NOT IBM PC standard.  The MIO and PR Connection 
use the same pinout.
 
P:R: Connection
 
      This device plugs into the SIO line, and provides 2 
9-pin RS232 ports and a 15-pin parallel port.  It is 
powered by the SIO line.  The Atari 1200xl requires an 
internal modification to work with this device, or with 
the Atari XM301 300 baud modem.
 
Siders' Serial Interface

     With 850s and P:R: Connections becoming increasingly 
rare, Kenneth Siders released plans to build a high-speed 
serial interface using only 2 ICs.

Atari 1090XL Interface Box

      Ever look in the back of an Apple II or an IBM PC, 
and envy the expansion cards?  Atari was planning to 
release a similar expansion box.  The full specs were 
written up, and prototypes were sent out to hardware 
developers.  As usual, Atari took this great idea, buried 
it, and forgot about it.  These are EXTREMELY rare; I've 
only ever seen two for sale.  Definite collectors pieces.

MPP 1000 Modem

     The joystick port is a parallel port.  The SIO port 
is a serial port.  So where would you hook up a serial 
modem?  MPP (now Supra) plugged a 300 baud modem into the 
joystick port.  Running at 300 baud, with software that 
couldn't d/l files longer than 32k (an Xmodem bug), this 
is what got me started in the on-line world, and what got 
Supra started in the modem business.  Wonder if I could 
trade in my old 300AT for a new 33.6k?

Voice Box II
 
      Manufactured by the ALIEN Group, this speech 
synthesizer even made it into TIME Magazine in their 
"Machine of the Year" issue in 1982.  Plugging into the 
SIO line, this device would produce speech of the 
traditional computer variety.
 
R/128 RAMdisk Printer Buffer Spooler
 
      Protronics of California announced this 128k 
RAMdisk/printer buffer which interfaced via the joystick 
ports, offering it as a replacement for the 850.  A 512k 
upgrade was promised. (ANT 2/8, 106)
 
N1858-32
 
      Newell Industries announced this 850 replacement in 
1983.  It offered two serial and one parallel port, along 
with an expandable 8k printer buffer.  (ANT 2/8, 106)
 
Oscar Model 1
 
      This bar-code scanner was from the Databar Corp.  
The intent was to permit the speedy entry of computer 
programs which would be encoded in magazines.  (ANT 2/8, 
107)
 
1200XL PBI
 
      Hackers love the 1200xl for two reasons: because of 
all the space available within the case, and because of 
the great keyboard.  Bob Woolley came up with this set of 
plans for adding a parallel bus interface to the 1200xl.

      available at the umich atari archive
 
Arm Your Atari

     ANALOG magazine provided this unique information on 
interfacing an 8-bit to a Radio Shack Armatron remote 
controlled arm.  Positioning was determined using the 
paddle/potentiometers, and control was via the PIA 
(joystick pins).

Subject: Atari BBS List: 96-12-05 Update
To: info-a8marist.bitnet@cunyum.cuny.edu

Still looking for someone to keep this list.  It's not too much
work - honest!   -OMF

  -------------

Please keep me informed with updates to the list and I'll post revisions
as necessary.  In particular, if one of the BBS's is within your local
calling area, please give them a call and let me know whether they're
currently operational.

All boards are assumed to be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week unless otherwise noted.

The format of the individual entries is below.
Note that each entry uses at least five lines (all of which are
less than 40-columns in order to make this easily 8bit readable):
  "Type" indicates the type of hardware used to run the board.
  "Status" is whether the board was up or not the last time it was 
checked.
  "Status Date" tells you when the entry was last updated.
  --
  There can be one or more lines of "Notes".


An asterisk (*) next to the board's phone number indicates that entry has
been updated since the last version of this list.

</TITLE>

<CENTER><H1>Exercise 1:  Five Basic Elements</H1></CENTER>

HTML uses formatting codes called "tags" to mark text with formatting instructions.  The tags
are identified by angle brackets around some text.  HTML tags are NOT case sensitive; 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> will work the same way as <KBD><STRONG>&lt;html&gt;</STRONG></KBD>.  
(Some HTML authors prefer to use uppercase within HTML tags because it's easier to locate tags when scanning 
the document.)
<P>
This exercise includes use of <A HREF="#format">basic HTML document format</A>, <A HREF="#head">headers</A>, 
<A HREF="#title">title</A>,and <A HREF="#para">paragraphs</A> elements.
<P>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
It only takes four elements to create a basic HTML document. It'll be a very boring document--without the images 
and links that people have come to associate with the Web--but these four elements will provide a foundation in 
HTML on which to build.
<P>
Note that most (but not all) HTML tags are paired, e.g. <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> goes in front 
of your title and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> goes behind it.
<P>
<A NAME="format"><H3>Creating a Basic HTML Document Format:</H3></A>
<KBD><STRONG>

<DD>&lt;TITLE&gt;<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;HTML&gt;...&lt;/HTML&gt;</KBD> - HTML document identifier</STRONG>
<DD>The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags 
identify the beginning and end of an HTML document. While Netscape and many other browsers do not 
require the HTML tag, on some browsers your document may not load correctly if the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;HTML&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag is absent.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;HEAD&gt;...&lt;/HEAD&gt;</KBD> - document header</STRONG>
<DD>Web browsers use the information between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags to gather information about the document, such 
as its author, its title, and to what resources the document should be linked. For the scope of 
these exercises, the only tag used between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
and <KBD><STRONG>>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags is the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag. 
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;TITLE&gt;...&lt;/TITLE&gt;</KBD> - document title</STRONG>
<DD>The <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> element should only appear once in the head of an HTML document 
(between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags).  
The text that appears between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tags is used as the title of the document, and is displayed by most Web browsers in the browser window's title bar.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;BODY&gt;...&lt;/BODY&gt;</KBD> - document body</STRONG>
<DD>This is where all the action happens in an HTML document. With the exception of the above HTML elements, 
nearly every other tag must appear between the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;BODY&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/BODY&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags.
</DL>

<A NAME="head"><H3>Creating HTML Headers:</H3></A>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;Hx&gt;</KBD>...<KBD>&lt;/Hx&gt;</KBD> - heading</STRONG>
<DD>Headings are used to identify sections of a document. HTML provides six levels of headings, 
numbered I through 6. For the largest heading, you would use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags. For the smallest, you would use 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;H6&gt;</STRONG></KBD> and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/H6&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags.
<P>
Note that most browsers will assume that white space should appear before and after a heading element, 
so you don't generally need to put a <A HREF="#para"><KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD></A> or 
<A HREF="exercise8.html#br"><KBD><STRONG>&lt;BR&gt;</STRONG></KBD></A> before or after a heading.
<P>
HTML headers work like this:
</DL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H1&gt;...&lt;/H1&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H1>A heading like this</H1></CENTER>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H2&gt;...&lt;/H2&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H2>A heading like this</H2></CENTER>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H3&gt;...&lt;/H3&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H3>A heading like this</H3></CENTER>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H4&gt;...&lt;/H4&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H4>A heading like this</H4></CENTER>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H5&gt;...&lt;/H5&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H5>A heading like this</H5></CENTER>
<LI><KBD><STRONG>&lt;H6&gt;...&lt;/H6&gt;</STRONG></KBD> produces <CENTER><H6>A heading like this</H6></CENTER>

<A NAME="para"><H3>Paragraph Tags</H3></A>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><KBD>&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</KBD> - paragraph</STRONG>
<DD>In general,a Web browser starts a new paragraph only when it encounters a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tag.  Without <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags, the text in your HTML document will appear as one large, 
continuous paragraph.
<P>
Alas, life is always more complex that it seems, and this is the case with paragraphs in HTML.  Various 
<LINK>versions of HTML have defined paragraphs differently.  The only thing these versions agree on is that you 
indicate a plain text paragraph (not necessarily it's beginning or ending) by using the 
<KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag.
<P>
Early versions of HTML specified the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> as a <STRONG>one-sided</STRONG> tag.  
There was no corresponding <KBD><STRONG>&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>, and <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
tag was used to indicate the <STRONG>end</STRONG> of a paragraph (a paragraph break), not the beginning.  
So paragraphs in the early versions of HTML looked like this:
<P>
<PRE>
	The Civil War was the first conflict that was dominated by firearms.  
	Muskets employed in earlier wars were one-shot smoothbores, which were 
	inaccurate and extremely limited in range.
	&lt;P&gt;
	Reloading was a difficulty job; and the primitive flintlocks would not 
	work when wet, and only 80 percent of the time under ideal conditions.
	&lt;P&gt;
	Percussion caps for ignition soon replaced the unreliable flintlocks, 
	and experients with rifled muskets were initiated.  A revolution in 
	infantry warfare was sparked by Frenchman, Claude E. Minie, who in 1849 
	designed a bullet (not a "ball" as most Civil War participants referred 
	to it) that was smaller then the diameter of the gun barrel and could be 
	inserted easily.
	&lt;P&gt;
	When fired, the base of the projectile expanded to fit the rifling, 
	giving the bullet a stabilizing spin for greater accuracy and range.
	&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Most browsers that were created early on in the history of the Web--and many browsers--still assume that paragraphs
will be formatted this way.  When come across a <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tag, they start a new line an 
add some extra vertical space between the line they just ended and the one that they just began.
<P>
In more recent versions of HTML, the paragraph tag has been revised.  In these versions, the paragraph tags are
<STRONG>two-side</STRONG> (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>), but <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> 
indicates the <STRONG>beginning</STRONG> of the paragraph.  Also, the closing tag (<KBD><STRONG>&lt;/P&gt;</STRONG></KBD>) 
is optional.  So the "minie ball" story would look like this in the newer versions of HTML:
<P>
<PRE>
	&lt;P&gt;
	The Civil War was the first conflict that was dominated by firearms.  
	Muskets employed in earlier wars were one-shot smoothbores, which were 
	inaccurate and extremely limited in range.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	Reloading was a difficulty job; and the primitive flintlocks would not 
	work when wet, and only 80 percent of the time under ideal conditions.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	Percussion caps for ignition soon replaced the unreliable flintlocks, 
	and experients with rifled muskets were initiated.  A revolution in 
	infantry warfare was sparked by Frenchman, Claude E. Minie, who in 1849 
	designed a bullet (not a "ball" as most Civil War participants referred 
	to it) that was smaller then the diameter of the gun barrel and could be 
	inserted easily.
	&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;
	When fired, the base of the projectile expanded to fit the rifling, 
	giving the bullet a stabilizing spin for greater accuracy and range.
	&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
It's probably a good idea to get into the habit of using <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> at the start of 
a paragraph because this will become important in subsequent versions of HTML--where you can define the alignment 
and other featuresof each paragraph.  Currently browsers will ingore this form of paragraphs just fine.
<P>
However, note that because many browsers still expect <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> to indicate the 
<STRONG>end</STRONG> of a paragraph, if you use it at the beginning you may end up with extra space in between 
the first paragraph and the element before it.  If this bothers you, you can do the following:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Go back to the old style of defining paragraphs.
	<LI>Use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> as a paragraph separator, rather than indicating the beginning or
	    end of a paragraph.
	<LI>Leave off the <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> in each set of paragraphs. 
</UL>
<P>
Some people like to use <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags to spread out the text on a page.  But beware.  
Some browsers may collapse multiple <KBD><STRONG>&lt;P&gt;</STRONG></KBD> tags into one, erasing all your careful 
formatting.

According to Captain James T. Kirk:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
"Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise,
its five year mission, to explore strange new worlds,
to seek out new life and new civilizations,
to boldly go where no man has gone before."
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Here's an example of some preformatted ascii text:

The use of styles in HTML documents is important.  How else will
readers of your documents be able to tell when you are &lt;B&gt;SHOUTING&lt;/B&gt;?
&lt;P&gt;
In more refined circles (where people&lt;I&gt;whisper&lt;/I&gt;) styles enable one to look academically-inclined, like this:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
In her work, &lt;CITE&gt;HTML for Snobs&lt;/CITE&gt;, Professor Karen Mateer points
out the &lt;EM&gt;importance&lt;/EM&gt; of using &lt;STRONG&gt;logical&lt;/STRONG&gt;, rather than
&lt;STRONG&gt;physical&lt;/STRONG&gt; styles. &lt;DFN&gt;Logical&lt;/DFN&gt;
styles are, as their name implies, &lt;EM&gt;stylish&lt;/EM&gt;, whereas &lt;DFN&gt;physical&lt;/DFN&gt;
styles are a matter of &lt;KBD&gt;brute force and ignorance&lt;/KBD&gt;.

&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Overview of HTML-Exercise 8
&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
Wow, in seven short exercises, you've learned how to make an effective
page of text on the Net.  You know how to:
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Use basic HTML format.
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make several kinds of lists.
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;unnumbered
&lt;LI&gt;numbered (ordered)
&lt;LI&gt;definition
&lt;LI&gt;nested
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Use different levels of headings, from
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Large&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H6&gt;to small&lt;/H6&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Include extended quotations (like this one):
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not.&lt;BR&gt;
We have plenty of messenger boys.&lt;BR&gt;
--&lt;L&gt;Sir William Preece, chief engineer of the British Post Office, in 1876.&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Use logical and physical styles to make text appear:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;italic&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;TT&gt;fixed-width font&lt;/TT&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;              
&lt;LI&gt;Use paragraph tags, special characters, and horizontal rules.
&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
In addition to all &lt;B&gt;that&lt;/B&gt;, you've learned several definitions.  You know that:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;The &lt;I&gt;Internet&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;is a collection of connected networks all over the world.
&lt;DT&gt;The &lt;I&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;was started by CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics) and seeks to build 
a distributed hypermedia system.
&lt;DT&gt;&lt;I&gt;HTML&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is a tool for creating multi-layered and 
linked documents published on the Web.
&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Now maybe it's time to send e-mail to your boss at &lt;ADDRESS&gt;your_boss@work.com&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
and tell him or her how smart you are!?
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;HR ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; WIDTH=&quot;12%&quot;&gt;
&lt;HR ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
&lt;HR ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; WIDTH=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

<H4>Some text explaining what this home page is, why it exists, who you are, or what

Not too much, just some general quick-to-read description that either (a) hooks people
into reading more or (b) tells them to move on 'cause this isn't what they wanted.

Now you may want to add a list (often of hyperlinks) to:

It's just this simple.</H4>

<A NAME="1"><H3>1.  Design for the average user.</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>The average user is:
    <UL>
	<LI>looking at a 14" monitor
	<LI>using the Netscape browser
    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
Unless you have a special audience in mind, don't design for the highest, or lowest, common denominator.
Go average and you should be save for most users.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The average user is:
    <UL>
	<LI>using either a PC or a Mac
    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
While Macs are less than 10% of the installed personal computer user base, Mac users are proportionally more likely
to use the Net.  If you use only one system, and most of us do, always remember the other exists and the other is 
different.	
<P>
<EM>
<A HREF="#contents">Return to Contents</A></EM>
<HR SIZE=2>
<A NAME="2"><H3>2.  Smaller is Better.  Period.</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>Smaller is better because:
    <UL>
    <LI>smaller loads faster
	<LI>the average user is sitting in front of a 14" monitor
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>
Waiting for a large graphic to load isn't fun.  If some of your intended audience are sitting at home in front
of not-very fast machines connected by a 14.4 or 28.8 modem, they're going to be more than board.  They're not
going to wait to see what you have to show them.
<P>
Yes, some of us doing the designing are using 17" or 20" screens, but we're the minority.  You don't want to
design a graphic that takes up so much screen real estate that essential information is off the screen, or 
design one that can't be fully seen without scrolling.
<P>
Also remember, smaller for a digital image doesn't mean just two-dimensional size.  File format, bit-depth, 
and type of image are also important factors.  We'll talk about these issues in the following rules. 
<P>
<EM>
<A HREF="#contents">Return to Contents</A></EM>
<HR SIZE=2>
<A NAME="3"><H3>3.  Design for a computer screen, not the printed page.</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>Printed 8.5" x 11" pages are usually designed for a "portrait"; i.e., the height is greater than the width
<LI>Computer screens on the other hand are "landscape"; i.e., the width is greater than the height.
</UL>
<P>
Stop thinking horizontally.  The first screen someone comes to on a Web page is the most essential.  If it
doesn't grab them, they won't scroll down to see what else you're offering.
<P>
<EM>
<A HREF="#contents">Return to Contents</A></EM>
<HR SIZE=2>
<A NAME="4"><H3>4.  Stop thinking in terms of inches.</H3></A>
From now on, you have to start thinking in pixels, the dots of light that make up an image on a screen.
<UL>
	<LI>The average screen has a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.
	<LI>However, you need to create images that are no larger than 600 x 400 pixels.  Why?
	<LI>Because you don't have the whole screen as your canvas.
</UL>
<P>Both the browser software and the computer's operating system take up screen real estate, too.  With Netscape,
assuming you have both the square buttons for home, etc., and the locating bar showing, the loss is 124 pixels
in height and 21 pixels in width.  That means the maximum any image should be is 619 x 356.  But since the
Netscape browser defaults to an opening size of approximately 600 pixels, it's probably safer to create images
no larger than 600 x 400.  For banners across the top of the page, your goal should be 500 x 100 or less. 
<P>
<EM>
<A HREF="#contents">Return to Contents</A></EM>
<HR SIZE=2>
<A NAME="5"><H3>5.  You have two different format choices--GIF and JPEG.</H3></A>
Choosing which graphics file format to use isn't that difficult if you consider the following:


										[PUT TABLE HERE]


<DL>
	<DT><STRONG>In-line Images</STRONG>
	<DD>In-line images are those that appear on the screen with the HTML-generated text.  All browsers
		can display GIF in-line images, and most, but not all, can display JPEG in-line images.  JPEG
		in-line images will crash some browsers.
    <P>
	<DT><STRONG>Bit-depth</STRONG>
	<DD>Bit-depth refers to how many bits each pixel has to describe a color:
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI>2-bit images are black and white
		<LI>8-bit images can describe up to 256 colors (or shades of gray)
		<LI>24-bit images can display millions of colors
	</UL>
	<P>
	In the real world, the eye (and color film) can see millions of colors.  If you have a color photograph or
	a color painting, you would want millions of colors as well.
	<P>
	But our friend the average user has a monitor that can show only 8-bit color.  When an 8-bit monitor 
	displays a 24-bit image (or when you change a 24-bit image to 8-bit), the software "dithers" the 246
	allowable colors to approximate the colors it can't show you.  The dithering is a pattern tha combines
	two or more colors to simulate a third--and can be quite distracting.
	<P>
	All Net browser software will dither a 24-bit image for an 8-bit system, but they won't do as good  a
	job as graphics software like Adobe Photoshop.
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>The overall characteristics of your image should also affect your choice of file types.</STRONG>
	<DD>The GIF compression algorithm works best with flat areas of color
	<P>
	JPEG, on the other hand, is not the best for images with flat areas of color or high contrast.  The JPEG
	compression algorithm tends to leave "artifacts" (small areas of off-color pixels) that become obvious
	in high-contrast pictures.
	<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG>
	<DD>The final, and often deciding reason to use GIF in-lin images is if you need the effect of 
	transparency where the background or background colors show through (used most often on decorative
	text.  <A HREF="http://www.gpo.ucop.edu/">See the GPO Gate example</A> from the University of 
	California Library System.)  The JPEG format doesn't support transparency.
</DL> 
<P>
<EM>

<A NAME="6"><H3>6.  Color is not color is not color.</H3></A>
<UL>
	<LI>Different computers display colors differently.
	<LI>You can't guarantee that the colors you see are the colors someone else sees.
</UL>
<P>
You've created this gorgeous color scheme, for your Web pages on your PC.  You tell everyone you know the URL.
One of your friends is on a Mac and tells you it's the gaudiest thing she's ever seen.  Another friend, who uses
a PC, says the colors all clash.  Are they wrong?
<P>
No.
<P>
Every computer system displays colors differently.  Not only are Mac system colors (the default 256 color
palette) different from the PC system colors, but most of the browsers have default palettes that are 
different from both (and from each other!).  Even when using defined "safe" colors--colors that are
<EM>suppose</EM> to be the same on both platforms--you can get into trouble.
<P>
The best thing to do is to put some Web pages up and then look at them on both a Mac and a PC.  If you have
access to different browsers, you might want to check them, too.

<A NAME="7"><H3>7.  An image is an image, but it may not save any words at all.</H3></A>
There are times to use images and icons and there are times not to use them.  Although there are literally 
thousands of free icons available for the taking on the Web, that doesn't mean you should.  Almost every
iconic button in use on the Web has words next to it explaining what it is.  Which is not to say that you
should <EM>never</EM> use decorative buttons, arrows, bullets, etc., but use them with care and ask yourself
first if the image is worth waiting for.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't--it's a judgment call, and
one that often separates the good pages from the bad.
<P>
If you'e going to use images as buttons, remember to consider the user who's on a Lynx browser with a VT100
connection and can't see the pictures at all.  Can that user still navigate your page without them? 
<P>

                    take less time to load than it really does.</H3></A>
If you know the size <EM>in pixels</EM> of your image and you add that information as an attribute in your
in-line image tag, the text will be  able to load more quickly because the browser will know how much space
it has to leave for each picture.  For example:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>You want software that will:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>let you modify and correct digital images.
	<LI>let you create images from scratch.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>You should be able to:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>type text in it.
	<LI>be able to save files in either GIF or JPEG formats.
	<LI>(Some software now have built-in programs for creating transparent images<BR>
	    and creating interlaced GIFs (the images that come up in several passes,<BR>
	    gradually getting sharper), though there is shareware available which will<BR>
	    do those conversions as well.
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
Any image you create online, copy from a Photo-CD, or scan in on a consumer-level scanner will benefit from
simple modification with good software.  An good does <EM>not</EM> mean the pait software that comes with
Windows.  Adobe Photoshop is excellent, but there are other software packages with similar functionality that
you can choose from.
<P>
Whatever package you choose, take the time to learn and use it.  There's nothing that will replace the 
experience, and there's no shortcut you can take to get there.  A person without art background but with
a good understanding of the software can make better graphics than someone who knows art but doesn't
know the digital brush from the digital pencil.
<P>
Good luck.

There are an almost bewildering array of tags available to create a table 
which can be read by Netscape's Browser.  Most of the tags serve to make minute
adjustments in table appearance.  Tables can be this simple:<P><OL>
<LI>Use the <TT>&lt;TABLE BORDER&gt;</TT> tag.
<LI>Use <TT>&lt;CAPTION&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/CAPTION&gt;</TT> to title the table. (optional)
<LI>Use <TT>&lt;TH&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/TH&gt;</TT> to create column headings
<LI>Work across in rows:<UL>
	<LI>Each row begins with <TT>&lt;TR&gt;</TT>
	<LI>Each item in the row is framed with <TT>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;</TT>
	<LI>To create row headings, frame the text with <TT>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;</TT>
	<LI>The row ends with <TT>&lt;/TR&gt;</TT></UL>

<STRONG><EM>...to help you think about creating a Web site...</EM></STRONG>
...whether you're hiring an <A HREF="http://www.delivery.com/webb/">outside consultant</A>
or are doing the work yourself.</CENTER>
<P><hr size=3>
<P><STRONG>The quiz...
<A NAME="top"></A>
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#logo">Do you have a logo appropriate for use online?</A>
<LI><A HREF="#does">Explain, in three sentences, what your organization does.</A>
<LI><A HREF="#whol">How will your web site fit with your business as a whole?</A>

<LI><A HREF="#graphics">How will the graphics on your page relate to each other?</A>
</OL>

The commentary...
<P>
<A NAME="logo">1.  Do you have a logo appropriate for use online?</A></STRONG>

Web graphics need to be in .gif format.  If your logo is in electronic form, you
should be able to convert it.  If it's not, you'll probably want to scan and convert 
it.<p>
Most logos will work online.  If your logo includes very fine lines, be aware that it
may not have a strong online presence.  You may want to consider using a bold 
graphic that incorporates your logo on your web pages.<p>
Right now, online graphics do not adjust their size to fit the viewer's window.  
Most browsers use windows 70 to 80 characters wide.  Size your logo to fit in
that space, or viewers will only see part of it.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="does">2.  Explain, in three sentences, what your organization does.</A></STRONG>

You may already have a brochure describing your organization.  Web text is easiest 
to read when it consists of headings and short paragraphs.  Long text descriptions 
are hard to read on a screen.  If you have a mission statement or short description
of your organization, put it near the top of your page.  Net surfers will be able to
tell at a glance whether they're interested in your site.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="whol">3.  How will your web site fit with your business as a whole?</A></STRONG>

You already have marketing materials, business strategies, and strategic plans (even
if you don't call them by those names).  How will the look and content of your
Web site fit (or be different from) already existing materials and strategies?<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="cats">4.  What categories of service/product does your organization provide?</A></STRONG>

Thinking in categories will make it easier for you to decide what groups of pages
to include in your Web site.  The first/home page should tell people enough about
you to make the viewer want to know more (or help them decide they're not interested).<p>
From there, buttons or linked lists will take them to other pages.  
<UL>
<LI>What questions will people be asking about you?
<LI>What different kinds of things do you do?
<LI>Will different types of viewers be interested in different parts of your organization?
</UL><p>
Answering these questions will help you decide how to cluster your information.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="cust">5.  Who are your customers?</A></STRONG>

Whose attention are you hoping to attract?  What kinds of tools will they have available
to them?  What resources are they hoping to find?<p>
If your viewers are unlikely to have audio or video software, it won't make sense
for you to include those media in your Web pages.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="acts">6.  What actions do you want the viewer to take?<A></STRONG>
</A>
Will they send you e-mail?  Order a catalog?  Order from an online catalog?  
Register for a class?  Get on your mailing list?<p>
Keep in mind that most interactive activities involve extra work for the people
putting your Web site on the server and the people doing the maintenance of your
pages.  Activities like placing online orders involve <i>lots</i> of extra work
(and using a commercial server and a computer security expert).  Be sure
you have the resources to follow through.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="info">7.  What information will you provide?</A></STRONG>

The internet is a wonderful world-wide reference source.  My personal bias is that
being a good Web citizen includes providing information useful for folks who may not get
personally involved with your organization.  (Hence this page!)<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="links">8.  How will the various pages at your site relate to each other?</A></STRONG>
Practically speaking, which pages need to be linked to which pages?  If you chose three or
four "top level" pages, which would they be?  (Drawing what I call an "architecture"--a
kind of tree of branching pages can be helpful.)
<P>
Aesthetically speaking, will one design carry throughout the pages or will each one have
a different layout?  When you've got them linked the way you want them, cruise from one
to another to see if you can tell at a glance what each one is about.<p>
<A HREF="#top"><i>To top</i></A>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="graphics">9.  How will the graphics on your page relate to each other?</A></STRONG>

If you plan to use buttons or in-line graphics, think about
how they relate to each other and to the other graphics (photos, logos) on your pages.
(Some logos contain a graphic that can be used as a background shape for button graphics.  
If you're designing an online logo, you may want to consider including such a graphic.)<p>

<CENTER><H2>How to download files from the Web</H2></CENTER>

FTP means "File Transfer Protocol" and is used as both a noun ("that file 
is available by FTP...") and verb ("FTP that file to me").  It's the way
to download all sorts of goodies from the Web.<p>
Anonymous FTP means you log into an FTP server (using an <A HREF="#FTPP">FTP program</A>),
enter the username <i>anonymous</i>
and your e-mail address (the whole thing) as your password.<p>

<H3>Resources Available</H3>
There are three types of resouces available on the Web:<p>
<DL)<DT><STRONG>Public Domain</STRONG>
<DD>The author has created the resource and released it for
any and every use.  There's no limit on distribution or sale and it can
be modified by anyone.<p>
<DT><STRONG>Freeware</STRONG>
<DD>The author retains the copyright but allows you to use the resource
for free.  Usually, you can give it away, but can't sell it.<p>
<DT><STRONG>Shareware</STRONG>
<DD>The author retains copyright and allows you to use the resource on
a trial basis for a short evaluation period.  At the end of that period,
you either pay for the resource or destroy all copies.<p>
</DL>
<H4>In order to keep the Web as information-rich as it is, please pay
fees for the shareware software you use.</H4>
<HR>
<p>
<H3>How to identify downloadable files:</H3>
If, when you put your browser on a linked sentence or word, you see a file
that ends with .hqx, .sit, .cpt, .sea, .seg, .pit, .dd, .zip, .lzh, .arc, .z,
.tar, you're looking at a downloadable file.  Those filename extensions
stand for the compression program used.  FTP programs will automatically determine
which transfer mode to use, based on the extension.<p>

<H3>How to download files:</H3>
In some cases, the URL of the downloadable file will be created so that your 
browser (if you're using Netscape or Mosaic) <B>automatically downloads it</B>.
The browser will put the file into whatever directory you specified when you
set preferences.<p>
<A NAME="#FTPP"></A>
Sometimes you need an FTP program in order to transfer files.  You can't FTP to get
an FTP program unless you have the software!<p>
To get FTP software:
<UL>
<LI>buy one of the several books on the market that come with an FTP program on disk
<LI>talk to your friends and find someone who has a (non-commercial) program
to give to you on disk, or
<LI>contact a distributor directly.
</UL>
If you're going to download files, you will also want to install a virus checker
on your computer.  (If you don't have one already.)
<p>
<A NAME="FTPP"><h4>For Macintosh users:</H4>

<H2>Human Relations Area Files (HRAF)</H2>
</CENTER>

The <STRONG>Human Relations Area Files</STRONG>, commonly known as <STRONG>HRAF</STRONG>, is special collection of 
articles and essays on the cultures of the world.  This unique organization by culture and by subject
allows cross-cultural research, especially useful for students in the social sciences and humanities.
About 360 cultural groups exist in the Files now, with a few added every year.  Much of the field 
research was conducted during the first half of the 20th century. Carleton, one of two libraries in 
Minnesota that subscribes to HRAF, makes this microfiche collection available in the Microforms Room
in the Gould Library.  There are three volumes which serve as guides and are shelved near the microfiche:
<STRONG>Outline of World Cultures</STRONG>, <STRONG>Outline of Cultural Materials</STRONG>, and 
<STRONG>HRAF Source Bibliography</STRONG>.
<P>
Recently, HRAF began producing data on a CD-ROM, known as <A HREF="cd-rom.html #ehraf">E-HRAF</A>.  
The Gould Library has this resource mounted on a CD-ROM workstations. The first CD includes fifteen cultures
with a commitment to yearly expansions of fifteen additional cultures.  The first 60-culture sample to be converted
is known as the <STRONG>Probability Sample File</STRONG>, which is composed of groups that have been the subject of
long and in-depth study.  Included with this group will be two or three North American ethnic cultures not already
covered in the microfiche collection.  The database also contains photographs, drawings, illustrations, charts,
graphs, and other data.

<center><H1>Introducing Project Muse:<br>
Full-Text Journals via the World Wide Web</H1></center>

In one of the first ventures of its kind, the Carleton College Library is 
participating in an initiative that enables worldwide networked access to the full 
text of selected scholarly journals.  Along with other members of the <A HREF=
"/obegroup/obe.html">Oberlin Group</A>, a loose affiliation of over sixty highly 
selective liberal arts college libraries, the Carleton Library is a <EM>charter 
member</EM> of this venture.
<P>
This experiment in scholarly communication, known as <strong>Project Muse</strong> 
(not to be confused with <A HREF="/muse/muse.html">Muse</A>, the Carleton Library's 
online catalog), is a product of the Johns Hopkins University Press.  Within the next 
three years, Project Muse will publish online more than forty of the Press's journals 
in the humanities, the social sciences, and mathematics.

<b><i>Deep in highlands of Scotland lies Loch Ness.  And deep in the murky waters of Loch Ness
waits a remnant of prehistoric times, an ancient creature of the depths.  Rarely seen, and even more
rarely photographed, this beast inspires awe, wonder, and a sense of mystery in visitors to its watery home.<p>
<p>
Imagine the scene: the creature sits at the bottom of the loch, waiting for its prey.  It senses movement 
in the water above, leaps from its hiding place, and pounces on the hapless fish, which promptly eats it.<p><p>

<center>I am speaking, of course, of the Loch Ness Muenster.</center>
<p><p>
Often eclipsed by its larger and slightly better-known neighbor, the Loch Ness Muenster is, in this author's humble
opinion, much more of a mystery than Nessie.  Shown below are some of the striking photographs purporting to show "Cheesie," as 
the Muenster is familiarly known.</i></b>

<table>
<tr><td align=right>This photo, snapped by a tourist, clearly shows Cheesie in the foreground, basking on the
surface, which is thought to have been a common behaviour in prehistoric aquatic cheeses.</td><td><img src="mun2.jpeg"></td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><img src="mun3.jpeg"></td><td>Another photo, similar to the one above, showing the Muenster floating
near the surface of the lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Perhaps the most startling photo of Cheesie, this underwater shot shows it locked in what appears to be mortal combat with a large
plesiosaur-like creature.</td><td><img src="mun1.jpeg"></td></tr></table>
<p><hr><p>
<b><i>Will the Muenster ever be captured?  Ever be photographed up close? Ever be... eaten?  Only time will tell.</b></i>

The sipp survey is designed to provide detailed information on the economic
situation of households and persons in the United States. These data examine
the distribution of income, wealth, and poverty in American society and gauge
the effects of federal and state programs on the well-being of families and
individuals. There are three basic elements contained in the survey. The first
is a control card that records basic social and demographic characteristics for
each person in a household, as well as changes in such characteristics over the
course of the interviewing period. The second element is the core portion of
the questionnaire, with questions repeated at each interview on labor force
activity, types and amounts of income, participation in various cash and
noncash benefit programs, attendance in postsecondary schools, private health
insurance coverage, public or subsidized rental housing, low-income energy
assistance, and school breakfast and lunch participation. The third element
consists of topical modules, which are series of supplemental questions asked
during selected household visits.

economy: Retail trade; Wholesale trade; Service industries; Transportation,
communication, and utilities; Financial, insurance, and real estate industries;
Manufacturers; Mineral Industries; and Construction industries. The census also
incudes Enterprise statistics and minority- and female-owned business which
cover all of the sectors.

<P>
The County to County Migration CD set houses data on migration between 1985 
and 1990.  The data are compiled using information from the 1990 Census of 
Population and Housing.  As part of the 1990 Census, respondents were asked 
where they lived in 1985.  Using the 1985 and 1990 residences reported by the 
respondents we can tabulate the number of persons who moved from any one 
place to another between these years.  The County to County Migration data
is based on such tabulations.
<P>
The CD set consists of two CD-Roms.  One CD-Rom is labelled "In-Migration" while
the other is labelled "Out-Migration".  Both include the software for viewing
data.  However the data stored on each CD is different.  The difference is in the
direction of movement represented by the data. For the "In-Migration" disk
destination is first chosen and the data on people moving into that area can be
viewed, including there origin can be viewed. For the "Out-Migration" disk a
origin is chosen and then data on the people moving out, including there
destination can be viewed. See the <A HREF="Abstracts/SP312/ABSTRACT.ASC.html">abstact</A> for a list of the data available.

percent of the population, and the 'B' Sample contains records for 1 percent of
the population. Each record is 231 characters in length and contains information
coded from the 'long form' questionnaire. This is weighted raw data, not summary
data. As such it is useful only for doing analysis. The 1995 reissue corrects the
GROUP QUARTERS RECORDS which had incorrect migration and place of work data.  The
only feilds effected were POWSTATE, POWPUMA, MIGSTATE AND MIGPUMA. The old disks have been kept as lending copies. The fields
which each record type contains are listed in two separate files:

The CD provides a versatileinterface enabling the user to select and contour 
a nearlyunlimited variety of climatological charts covering the global
upper air environment.  Although export of the gridded data is
possible from within the CD, users requiring massive data export
preferred access to the GGUAS data base directly.  This CD-ROM
product is intended to provide this access.

The GGUAS data set describes the atmosphere for each month of the
year represented on a 2.5 degree global grid at 15 standard
pressure levels.  Mean and standard deviation values were compiled
for sea level pressure, wind speed, air temperature, dew point,
height and density.  Eight-point wind roses were also compiled.

The Public Libraries Survey is conducted annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through 
the Federal-State Cooperative System for Public Library Data (FSCS). The survey file includes 8,946 public libraries 
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia identified by the state library agencies. A total of 44 data items 
were collected for each library--33 basic data items and 11 library identification items. (The basic data items for 
multiple-outlet libraries are provided to NCES as aggregated data.) Included are the library's name, address, number 
of service outlets, number of full-time equivalent staff, operating income, operating expenditures, capital outlay, 
size of library collection, annual public service hours, attendance, number of reference transactions, total annual 
circulation transactions, number of interlibrary loans, circulation of children's materials, and children's program 
attendance. The survey also collected 12 data items on each public library outlet and state library agency outlet; 
11 identifying items on state library agencies, federations, systems, and cooperatives; and 4 data items on 
characteristics of the state data submission.

The Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System is a system designed to collect data from primary providers 
(institutions) of post secondary education. It is a single, comprehensive data collection system developed to 
encompass all institutions and organizations that provide secondary education as their primary goal. The IPEDS 
system is built to collect institution-level data in such areas as enrollment, program completion, faculty and 
staff, and financing.
<P>
This disc contains an analysis file that includes variables extracted from the five IPEDS surveys. The data has been 
combined into a single file with each record on the file representing a single institution. The file does not 
contain all of the variables in each file; rather it contains those variables (nearly 5000) considered to be the 
most useful to the user community. This CD contains an ASCII file version of the analysis data file along with the 
individual data files and documentation for the following surveys: Institutional Characteristics (90/91), Fall 
Enrollment(90/91), Compilations(89/90), Finance(89/90), and Salaries and Tenure (90/91).

Each entry describes a separate statistical program, giving program purpose, data coverage, and collection methods, geographic coverage, agency contacts, pertinent publications, and database access options.
<P>
Statistical coverage in the Guide includes data related to the state-of-the-environment (e.g. air and water quality, status of biotic resources), pressures on the environment (e.g. energy use, mining, transportation, etc.), human health and welfare issues (e.g. exposure to toxic chemicals), and societal responses to environmental problems (e.g. expenditures on pollution abatement). This information was provided by 53 program offices of 23 agencies in six federal departments as well as the Environmental Protection Agency.

This CD contains four related databases.
Air CHIEF version 4.0 provides EPA emission estimation guidance
documents and databases in the form of infobases that can be quickly
searched using the Folio BoundVIEWS software interface. The PC-based FIRE system contains
EPA's unique recommended criteria and toxic air emission
estimation factors. The TANKS program is designed to estimate emissions of
organic chemicals from storage tanks.  The calculations are
performed according to EPA's AP-42, Chapter 12.  After the user
provides specific information concerning a storage tank and its
liquid contents, the system produces a report which estimates the
chemical emissions for the tank on an annual or partial year (no less
than one month) basis.  The user can also determine individual
component losses by using one of the speciation options available in
the program.  The CD-ROM also contains EPA guidance documents for estimating air
pollutant emissions. More information can be found in the <A HREF="abstracts/airchief.abstract.html">content file.</A>

Data reported about 18,000 facilities and hazardous substance fact sheets distributed by EPA that provide health, safety, and ecological toxicity data for specific chemicals. It is a compilation of information which individual businesses and facilities are required to submit about routine and accidental releases of toxic chemicals into the environment (reporting requirements apply to firms with ten or more employees that use or manufacture such substances). Searches can be done by chemical name, chemical category, state, and individual words such as company or city names.

records of live births and infant deaths for the year's birth cohort --
also referred to as the numerator file. This file is comprised of deaths
to infants born in that year who died in that year or before their first
birthday. Infant death records were extracted from the the file year and
the following year's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality
statistical files. This file includes linked records for births and deaths
that occurred in the United States to U.S. residents and to U.S. nonresidents.
Excluded are deaths that occurred outside the United States to infants born
in the U.S.; deaths that occurred in the United States to foreign-born infants;
and births and deaths that occurred outside the United States to U.S. residents.
<LI>The second file contains the live birth file for the file year, with
a few minor modifications (described in the introduction to the documentation)
-- referred to as the denominator-plus file. The files are offered as a
numerator/denominator data set to give users the means to compute infant
mortality rates. Linked birth records were extracted from a denominator
file that contained the file year's NCHS natality statistical file and a
small number of late-filed birth certificates. Refer to the Methodology
section for a more detailed explanation of records added to the statistical
file. The denominator file is not identical with the NCHS natality statistical
file. <LI>The third file contains information from the death certificate

<B>Health, United States, 1992 </B>presents national trends in public health
statistics. The 145 detailed tables in this year's report are organized
around four major subject areas-health status and determinants, utilization
of health resources, health care resources, and health care expenditures.
The detailed tables are designed to show trends in health statistics. A
major criterion used in selecting the detailed tables is the availability
of comparable national data over a period of several years. Similar tables
appear in each volume of Health, United States to enhance the use of this
publication as a standard reference source. Data are reported for selected
years to highlight major trends. Several tables in Health, United States,
1992 present data according to race and/or Hispanic origin consistent with
department-wide emphasis on expanding racial and ethnic detail in the presentation
of health data. The large differences in health status according to race
and Hispanic origin documented in this report may be explained by several
factors including socioeconomic status, health practices, psychosocial stress
and resources, environmental exposures, and access to health care. <BR>

<B>Healthy People 2000: </B>National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
Objectives (1) is a statement of national opportunities. This prevention
initiative presents a national strategy for significantly improving the
health of the American people in the decade preceding the year 2000. Healthy
People 2000 recognizes that lifestyle and environmental factors are major
determinants in disease prevention and health promotion. It provides strategies
to significantly reduce preventable death and disability, to enhance quality
of life, and to reduce disparities in health status between various population
groups within our society.

ICD-9-CM is a clinical modification of the World Health Organization's International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9). ICD-9 is designed for
the classification of morbidity and mortality information for statistical
purposes, and for the indexing of hospital records by disease and operations,
for data storage and retrieval. The term &quot;clinical&quot; is used to
emphasize the modification's intent: to serve as a useful tool in the area
of classification of morbidity data for indexing of medical records, medical
care review, and ambulatory and other medical care programs, as well as
for basic health statistics.

This  CD-ROM contains the HCDN data set which consists of streamflow data measured 
at 1,659 sites throughout the United States and its territories.  Daily mean, monthly
mean, and annual mean, minimum, and maximum values of discharge are provided for each water year. 
Records cumulatively span the period  1874 through 1988, inclusive, and represent a total of 73,231
water years of information.
<P>
Information necessary for the identification of each station in the HCDN, any qualifyg comments 
about the available record for the site, and descriptive basin characteristics are also provided 
on this CD-ROM.
<P>
The streamflow records included in the HDDN meet, except as noted in the comments for a station, 
strictly defined criteria of measurement accuracy and natural conditions.  The records have been 
selected to be as unaffected by artificial diversions, storage, or other human influences as 
possible.  There are no reconstructed records of "natural flow" not any extended or "filled in" 
records.  If the streamflow at a station was judged to be suitable for only a part of the entire 
period of record for the station, then only that part was included in the HCDN.  Generally, a 
station was required to have 20 water years of record to be included.  Only complete water years 
of data are included.

Each year, the US. Geological Survey (USGS) publishes hydrologic records for each State in a 
publication series entitled "US. Geological Survey Water-Data Reports". The State Water-Data 
Reports (SWDR) are prepared by District and Subdistrict Offices throughout the Nation and are 
published in quantities of 200 to 600 per volume and distributed to State agencies, cooperators, 
and others as appropriate. The number of volumes range from 1 to 7 per State, resulting in a 
total of 73 for the 1990 water-year.
<P>
This CD is the first attempt to distribute the hydrologic records in electronic form for the 
entire Nation, Puerto Rico, and Trust Territories. With the exception of Alaska (vol. AK-90-1),
Arizona (vol. AZ-90-1), Georgia (vol. GA-90-1), and Hawaii (vol. HI-90-2), which were not 
available at press time, all other volumes are included herein. In addition, volumes from 
selected States for water-years 1987 through 1989 are included.
<P>
The second CD represents the second consecutive year's attempt to replicate the hydrologic 
records in electronic form for the entire Nation, Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territories. In 
1991, the first replication consisted of hydrologic records for water year 1990, with records 
for selected States for water years 1987-1989. The current CD-ROM contains both water years 
1990 and 1991 for most State report volumes. Volumes unavailable for inclusion on this CD-ROM

This is the first in what is hoped to become a series of educational and research discs. This 
disc is the result of a collaboration between USGS and Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, 
VA. The area of coverage is centered on the state of Virginia; the data ranges in resolution from 
digital orthophoto quads re-sampled to 2 meter resolution to isopleths of simple Bouguer anomaly 
taken from a 1:500,000 map with contour intervals of 5 milligals. Data types include seismic 
sections, geologic maps, vector and icon overlays, 3-dimensional displays and film loops, color 
imagery of geologic features, GLORIA sonar imagery of the EEZ, Landsat TM imagery, aerial 
photograph, bathymetry and topography. Some of the photographs are arranged into a "Photographic 
Field Trip of Virginia". Overlays on the geologic, gravity, and deposit maps include railroads, 
roads, dikes, faults, quads, streams, water bodies, and political boundaries. A history of the 
Appalachian mountains and the orogenies that formed them is included on the disc as well as 
descriptions of lowland sedimentary formations.
<P>
All of the programs used to create the disc are on the disc and instructions on the use of the 
mapping and image processing systems are included in the directory DOC\TUTORIAL. Moreover, the 
various file types found on this disc are described in the directory DOC in files of extension 
type FXT. For example, the file BIN.FXT describes the '.BIN' files and so on. To view these files

(USGS) operates a network of 13 geomagnetic observatories located throughout the
conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico that
continuously monitor the Earth's magnetic field.  The NGIC maintains these
observatories, and serves as a primary source of information on the Earth's
magnetic field.


The first CD-ROM produced by the NGIC contains values of the geomagnetic field
for the years 1985 - 1989.  Subsequent CD-ROMs are 1-year CD's for 1990 through
1993, including this CD-ROM for 1993.  The 1994 data will be placed on a second

The objective of this study was to map the texture and morphology of the sea floor in western 
Massachusetts Bay. Knowledge of the sediment distribution in coastal areas adjacent to major 
population centers is useful in many ways. Contaminants have a strong affinity for fine-grained 
sediments in coastal waters, and maps that define areas of fine sediment help predict where 
contaminants may have accumulated in the past and where they are likely to accumulate in the 
future. The maps also yield information about the habitats of important marine organisms that 
utilize specific sediment types for food and protection. In addition, knowledge of the 
distribution and thickness of coarse sediments such as sand and gravel is essential to evaluate 
their potential as a mineral resource. Maps and data included on this disc include: a general 
map showing sonar lines and geographic boundaries, a bathymetric contour map with contours in 
feet, a geologic map with general sediment types, a digital mosaic of sonar images showing 
individual features, a reference map, and sediment texture data.

The purpose of this data set is to provide paleoclimate researchers with a tool for estimating the 
average seasonal variation in sea-surface temperature (SST) throughout the modern world ocean and 
for estimating the modern monthly and weekly sea-surface temperature at any given oceanic
<P>
location. It is expected that these data will be compared with temperature estimates derived from 
geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable isotopic analyses. The results 
can then be used to constrain general circulation models of climate change.
<P>
The data contained in this data set are derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution 
Radiometer Multichannel Sea Surface Temperature data (AVHRR MCSST), which are obtainable from the 
Distributed Active Archive Center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. The 
JPL tapes contain weekly images of SST from October 1981 through December 1990 in nine regions of 
the world ocean: North Atlantic, Eastern North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Agulhas, Indian, Southeast 
Pacific, Southwest Pacific, Northeast Pacific, and Northwest Pacific. This data set represents the 
results of calculations carried out on the NOAA data and also contains the source code of the 
programs that made the calculations. The objective was to derive the average sea-surface temperature 
of each month and week throughout the whole 10-year series,
meaning, for example, that data from January of each year would be averaged together. The result is 
12 monthly and 52 weekly images for each of the oceanic regions. Averaging the images in this way 
tends to reduce the number of grid cells that lack valid data and to suppress interannual variability.
<P>
As ancillary data, the ETOPO5 global gridded elevation and bathymetry data (Edwards, 1989) were interpolated to the resolution of the SST data; the interpolated topographic data are included.
<P>
The images are provided in three formats: a modified form of run-length encoding (MRLE), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and Macintosh PICT format.
<P>
Also included in the data set are programs that can retrieve seasonal temperature profiles at user-specified locations and that can decompress the data files. These non graphical SST retrieval programs are provided in versions for UNIX, MS-DOS, and Macintosh computers.

DDS-12 provides literal snapshot views of Colorado and Utah mining operations, generally before 1980. It supports environmental and historical research by providing access to the mostly unpublished photographs in the U.S. Geological Survey Photographic Library (USGS) collection in Denver. This material is provided to answer requests from government and historical researchers for visual documentation applicable to their current research.
<P>
The photographs were originally taken to support USGS reports on mineral resources in various mining districts or locales. The images provide a thorough search of the Photographic Library card catalog for Colorado and Utah mining operations. The database includes only views cataloged prior to 1990.

<P>
<B> Natural Radioelement Data Base
</B> contains data on the uranium, thorium, and potassium concentration 
from over 8500 saples taken from locations all around the country. 
 The data base is organized by states and countries.
        Within each state, the county, quadrangle, location, sample
        number, laboratory number, RaeU(ppm), Th(ppm), K(pct), rock
        description, latitude and longitude, and submitter are given
        if known.  Although a specific reference is not given for
        each sample, a list of references is included and the submitter's
        name may be searched to find more complete information about
        the sample.
<P>
<B>National Geochronological Data Base
</B>
is a group of computerized files established 
        by the U.S. Geological Survey as a means of collecting and 
        organizing published isotopic ages from the United States. 
        For each dated sample reported in a published work, a record 
        containing information on sample location, rock description, 
        analytical data, age, interpretation, and literature citation 
        is constructed.  Such information pertinent to the major dating 
        methods (K-Ar, Ar-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-0s, U-Th-Pb, Pb-alpha, 
        and fission track) can be accommodated, singly or in combinations, 
        for each record.  As of May 1994, NGDB consists of more than 18,000 
        records containing over 30,000 individual ages, which is 
        believed to represent approximately one-half the number of 
        ages published for the United States through the year 1991.

This CD contains composite digital sidescan-sonar mosaics and geologic maps of the deepwater parts of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Caribbean Sea. The mosaics provide the first broad-scale view of the sea floor and help us to understand sedimentary processes that have been unknown or poorly known until recently. These images have been published in paper atlases at a scale of 1:500,000 as U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Investigations Series I-1864-A, B (1987) and I-2054 (1991). The geologic interpretations of the images are expanded from those in I-1864 and I-2054.
<P>
The data on this disc consist of the fully processed GLORIA sidescan-sonar images, geologic interpretations of the images, bathymetry overlays for the images, 21 seismic profiles collected in 1978 along the Atlantic continental margin, and a three-dimensional perspective of the entire eastern Atlantic. The GLORIA data on this disc were collected during 10 cruises between 1982 and 1987 for regions where water was more than 400 m deep.

The radar image files are corrected 500-MHz GPR data collected during a controlled spill of tetrachloroethylene (PCE, a common dry-cleaning solvent). The experiment was conducted in a saturated natural sand aquifer on Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden, during July 1991, in an isolated cell that was 9 by 9 m by approximately 3 m deep. Details of the spill and subsequent data reduction are found in Sander (1994). The images are intended to document the movement of the PCE during the data collection period of 0 340 hours after the spill began.

The purpose of this data set is to provide paleoclimate researchers
with a tool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea-ice
concentration in the modern polar oceans and for estimating the modern
monthly sea-ice concentration at any given polar oceanic location.  It is
expected that these data will be compared with paleoclimate data derived
from geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable-
isotope analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general
circulation models of climate change.

The results of the 1995 National Assessment of Oil and Gas Resources of the
United States are presented in an interactive CD-ROM.  The interactive nature of
the National Assessment CD-ROM allows the user to browse through the documents
and presentations, choosing items of interest in user-selectable order.

The USGS National Assessment is an unbiased and scientifically based estimate of
the quantity of oil and gas yet to be discovered and of the past and future
growth in hydrocarbon reserves onshore and in state waters.  The National
Assessment describes the sources of oil and gas, where they are, what technology
may be needed to recover them and at what price, and at what rate they can be
withdrawn. Knowledge of oil and gas resources is necessary for strategic
planning, evaluating Federal lands, and developing sound economic, energy and
environmental policies.

The contents of this CD-ROM are described in a global and a detailed table of contents. A search on "global" or "detailed" in SearchExpress should make these available to you. Entries in the detailed table of contents correlate closely to the actual tabular documents on the CD-ROM.
<P>
Because some of the tables are too large to be viewable under SearchExpress, they have been broken into smaller documents. The largest resultant document may be on the order of 5 megabytes long, while most documents are well under one megabyte long. Because SearchExpress scans the document on CD-ROM before making it viewable, there can be a significant delay between selecting a document and being able to view it. Assuming a typical data transfer rate of 375 kb/minute, the largest delay might be about 13 minutes. Please be patient.
<P>
The OEUS recognizes the access inefficiency described above, and investigated the possibility of presenting the information as one or more databases, and found no reasonable, practical solution with the time and resources available.

Electronic copies of most of the IRS tax forms for the 1994 tax year. With the reader supplied most of the forms 
can be printed, but several(including the 1040 EZ) are supplied in a multi layer format. This means that the gray 
boxes and background found on the forms is supplied separately, and unfortunately in a deep black color, making them 
impossible to print out completely. This is a three CD series, with each disc presumably containing more forms than 
the last.

<A NAME="intro"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>
Carleton College Library is a selective U.S. government publications library.  We
receive approximately 25% of the titles that come through the depository program.
In addition to offering many primary historical and Congressional resources,
current
titles provide statistical data, census data, environmental reports, and much
more.

<A NAME="searching"><H3>Searching for Government Documents</H3></A>
Government publications are not listed in <A HREF="../muse/muse.html">Muse</A> at present. 
A project is under way to add titles published since 1976 to the online catalog. 
General access is through the CD-ROM index<A HREF="http:/electronic/cd-rom/cd-rom.html#gpo"> Marcive's
GPO CAT/PAC</A>.  It is available on one of
the work stations in the Reference Room electronic area.  Titles held at Carleton
are listed by the Superintendent of Documents number in the Documents Shelf List
in the Documents microform area.  Periodical titles are also listed in the
Carleton List of Periodicals.
<A NAME="check_out"><H3>Check-Out Policy</H3>
</A>Government publications may be checked out unless they are published before
1910
or have a notation that they can not leave the library.
<A NAME="electronic_media"><H3>Electronic Media</H3></A>
Many publications arrive on <A HREF="list/THELIST.html">CD-ROM or
discs</A>.  The government documents work station is dedicated to these titles. 
Magazine 6 offers access to NTDB/The National Trade Data Bank, NESE/National
Economic, Social & Environmental Data Base, the 1993 Statistical Abstract, and
U.S. Foreign Relations.  There are 5 additional magazines with titles loaded and
ready to use.  If you need to use one of these, ask at the <A HREF="../reference/infodesk.html">General Information &amp; Referral
Desk</A> for assistance.  Other titles are kept in the CD-ROM cabinet.  See the
Documents Librarian, Carolyn Sanford, to use these cd's.
<P>
<A NAME="internet"><H3>Government Documents Resources on the Internet:</H3></A>
A wide variety of information about the <A HREF="bookmarks.html">Federal
Government</A> is available on the Internet.  The Government itself maintains
several sites, including a virtual tour of the White House.  Many servers also
have searchable archives of Government related information.

<H2>Human Relations Area Files (HRAF)</H2>
</CENTER>

The <STRONG>Human Relations Area Files</STRONG>, commonly known as <STRONG>HRAF</STRONG>, is special collection of 
articles and essays on the cultures of the world.  This unique organization by culture and by subject
allows cross-cultural research, especially useful for students in the social sciences and humanities.
About 360 cultural groups exist in the Files now, with a few added every year.  Much of the field 
research was conducted during the first half of the 20th century. Carleton, one of two libraries in 
Minnesota that subscribes to HRAF, makes this microfiche collection available in the Microforms Room
in the Gould Library.  There are three volumes which serve as guides and are shelved near the microfiche:
<STRONG>Outline of World Cultures</STRONG>, <STRONG>Outline of Cultural Materials</STRONG>, and 
<STRONG>HRAF Source Bibliography</STRONG>.
<P>
Recently, HRAF began producing data on a CD-ROM, known as <A HREF="cd-rom.html #ehraf">E-HRAF</A>.  
The Gould Library has this resource mounted on a CD-ROM workstations. The first CD includes fifteen cultures
with a commitment to yearly expansions of fifteen additional cultures.  The first 60-culture sample to be converted
is known as the <STRONG>Probability Sample File</STRONG>, which is composed of groups that have been the subject of
long and in-depth study.  Included with this group will be two or three North American ethnic cultures not already
covered in the microfiche collection.  The database also contains photographs, drawings, illustrations, charts,
graphs, and other data.

<TITLE>What is the Oberlin Group?</TITLE>

<CENTER><H2>What's the Oberlin Group?</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Oberlin Group is an affiliation of library directors from over sixty highly-competitive 
liberal arts colleges in the United States.  This affiliation was nurtured by 
<A HREF="moffett.html">Bill Moffett</A>, former library director at Oberlin College in 
Oberlin, Ohio, hence the name of the group.  Mr. Moffett believed it would be benefitial 
for library directors at these various institutions to share common interests and concerns 
in order to better fulfill their missions.
<P>
The first meeting of Oberlin Directors took place at Oberlin College in 1986.
<P>
<CENTER><H2>Why Maintain an Oberlin Group Web Site?</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Since the Web is rapidly becoming the basis for the prototype "virtual library," 
it seemed natural that the Oberlin Group begin staking its own claim in cyberspace.   
For the time being, consider this resource as a mechanism whereby member libraries may 
share their accomplishments and ideas about using the Web for liberal arts library uses.
<P>
The Oberlin Group Home Page was initially developed in celebration of the 1994 Oberlin Group 
Conference held in Minnesota.  That conference was sponsored by the five Minnesota Oberlin 
Group members:

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER January, 1997</h2>

<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Jan., 1997

<p>	The Christmas Party went well and it was great to see some of the former members of SPACE in attendance. Many thanks to all who made the party a success, especially Mike Wiest who handled the sign up sheet plus many other unsung deeds.

<p>	January starts a new year. So please bring suggestions to the club meeting on what you'd like the club to do in 1997.

<p>	Have you tried the Video 61 BBS? The BBS phone # is 462-3680. Give them a call and say hi.
<p>
While on the subject of BBS's I've downloaded a listing of Atari BBS's for possible and/or future enclosure in the Newsletter.

<p>See you the 10th of January.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<h4> by Greg Leitner</h4>

<p>	Well, this report ends another year for us diehard Atarians and what a way to end it. The Christmas party was a smashing success and everyone had a great time. The selection of food was unbelievable and anyone who went hungry after that feast probably did more talking than eating.

<p>	The Club ended up the year on a high note to the tune of $625.12 balance in our Club's account. The only expense that remains unpaid at year end is the fourth quarter room rental of $105.00 due right after the first of the new year.

<p>	We took in $48.00 in software and blank disk sales and our only expense in December was $12.02 for the newsletter. Unfortunately, we didn't have any new or renewed memberships in the month but we still increased our bank balance from November.

<p>	I have to keep this short because I am still trying to get everything ready for our family Christmas. I hope each and every one of you and your families had very happy holidays and I wish that we will have another successful year in 1997. See you all in January.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>
<h4>Dec. 13th, 1996</h4>

<p>Space meeting opened at 7:35 PM. Mike Fitzpatrick, club president welcomed members and guests to the December meeting and Christmas Party. Mike said meeting would be short.

<p>Mike asked if there were any comments on November Space minutes and treasurer report. Greg Leinter, club treasurer, said 4th quarter room rent, in amount of $105 is due at end of December. Motion made to approve minutes and treasurer report, approved.

<p>OLD BUSINESS- Space club will pay to rent BBS. space from Lance Ringquist's BBS. Lance will post his BBS. phone no.

<p>NEW BUSINESS- None.

<p>Meeting adjourned at 7:36 PM. Space party followed meeting.

<h3 align=center>Space Christmas Party<br>
December 13, 1996</h3>

<p>	It was the night before the annual Space Christmas party and all through my house, nothing was stirring except the Big Tom Turkey roasting in my oven.
<p>	As we can all remember, our annual Christmas party was canceled by Mother Nature last year and was held at our January meeting. But we did have a fun Christmas party last year.
<p>	This year we had no trouble with Mother Nature. Around 30 people showed up this year. Members were treated to a 30 foot table full of delicious food. Everything from turkey and ham to salads (including Ray Wafer's famous potato salad), chips, two large cakes (supplied by the Fitzpatricks) and to wash it down ice cold pop (supplied by Greg Leinter).
<p>	Like in other years it was a time to have a fun time, talk Atari talk, and eat GOOD! We had a few special people join us at the Christmas Party. They were Steve Nelson and his wife, Amos Jackson and his wife, Gary Barnes and his wife, Willie Rora, and Tim Guerin. Glad to see you all, stop in and join us at a future meeting.
<p> A special thanks goes out to the Christmas Party committee, especially Mike and Earline Fitzpatrick. Earline's hard work in the kitchen before the party was appreciated. Those cakes were delicious!!!!! And a special thanks goes out to all the members who showed up, to make this a fun Christmas Party.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER February, 1997</h2>

<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Feb., 1997

<p>
Sorry to have missed the January meeting but your president took a hard fall off his icy front stoop and really bruised his leg pretty badly.

<p>
Have you tried the Video 61 BBS? They are doing a good job and are trying to make a very neat place to come and visit. I highly recommend the visit. They are at 462-3680.
<p>
Anyone in the club familiar with the various spreadsheets available to the classic 8-bit Atari? Have had a request from "Red" one of our members who winters (grr!) in Arizona concerning the formulas used in a spreadsheet. I'll have better data to work with come meeting time.
<p>
At the February meeting let's revisit some of the fun activities we've done in prior years and do some of the fun ones again. The Christmas Party with Mike Wiest's idea of inviting former members was fun and maybe we can expand that to a non-meeting picnic-in-the-park, etc. Something to think about.
<p>
See you at the February meeting.

<h3>BBS News for Jan. 1997</h3>
<p>
Will have to get with Video-61 to see if the Sysop wants to submit a monthly article.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<h4> by Greg Leitner</h4>

<p>	Let me start off by clearing up a very important matter. Before the November 1996 SPACE meeting a key to our P.O. Box was lost and we were unable to pick up the mail prior to the meeting. Now that wasn't so bad since we had another key and we figured we would just get the November and December mail for the December meeting at the same time. Well, when Glen went to the post Office to pick up the mall he found out that they put our P.O. Box renewal notice in the Box in November instead of mailing it out to us like they had always done in the past. Since forty-five days had elapsed from the time the renewal notice was given, the post Office closed our Box. Luckily, we got tile same P.O. Box number renewed, but all the mail that was in the Box when it was closed was sent back to the senders. So if you are one of the senders who got SPACE mail returned to you, fear not, because SPACE is still alive and doing well despite the Box snafu, whew!! Please keep the newsletters and mall coming to SPACE as we need all the correspondence we can get. Sorry for the unfortunate situation and thank you for your patience.

<p>	Now for the Club treasury. We took in only $33.00 for the January meeting. The membership turnout was low because of the severe cold weather, and we met without our President because grandpa Mike had an unfortunate accident due to Mother Nature. Hope you are doing better Mike and we hope to see you and Earline back for the February meeting.

<p>	Of the $33.00, we had one membership renewal and sold six Dom's. Our expenses were much higher than normal in January because we had to pay the fourth quarter room rental for 1996, and of course the P.O. Box fee that was due from November. The expenses for January totaled $157.00 and that leaves our balance at $591.12. The good news Is that our major expenses for the next two months are now paid and we can build on our treasury. Maybe if we throw in another auction along the way we can really increase our balance and have some fun along the way.

<p>	On closing I just want to say, get well Mike, and don't forget Mid-winter madness in February. See you all on the 14th.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>
<h4>Dec. 13th, 1996</h4>

<p>	Space meeting opened at 7:40 PM. Terry Streeter, club vice-president, presided over meeting. Mike Fitzpatrick, club President, suffered a injury and couldn't make the meeting. Terry welcomed members to the meeting

<p>	Terry asked for a treasury report by Greg Leinter. Greg said treasury balance as of end of December '96 is $625.12. The 4th quarter room rent was paid out, which was $105 and post office box rental $52. Post office box rental is now paid till June '97. Mike Weist, club secretary, gave a quick recap of December Minutes. No newsletter for January '96 available at meeting.

<p>Terry Streeter, club Vice President, asked for approval of treasury and secretary report.. Approved.

<p>
<strong>OLD BUSINESS-</strong> Discussion of Lance Ringquist's BBS was brought up. Terry Streeter mentioned the club may be able to get around using Lance's BBS., by maybe using another method to transfer files. Several members have on-line services such as AOL. Files can be transferred that way. This will be discussed at next month's club meeting.

<p><strong>NEW BUSINESS-</strong> There was a discussion about the CD-ROM for 8-Bit users. Mike Weist talked about the upcoming Mid Winter Madness Show, February 8, 1997 at Blaine Sport Center.

<p>
Lance Ringquist has located a 8-bit Atari club in Minneapolis called Classic Games. He has been invited to meeting in future. He plans to attend a meeting soon.

<p>	Meeting adjourned 8:00 PM.	Mike Weist - Secretary

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER January, 1996 </h2>



<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p> By Mike Fitzpatrick

<p>	As you are all aware the weather forced a cancellation of the Christmas Party. Many thanks to:
<ul>
<li>Rich Mier. 
<li>Ray Wafer. 
<li>Greg Leitner.
</ul>
and others who passed the word along.

<p>	Also, we had help from KOOL-108 and WCCO radio in getting the message out over the radio waves.
<p>	The plan is to have a party at the January meeting. Please try to bring what you signed up for plus a little bit for yourself. The sheet cake that eve picked up was well received by all our neighbors at our impromptu snow removal party the night of the canceled SPACE meeting.
<p>	The method <maximum frustration> of contacting folks was exacerbated by the loss of the BBS, with all the member records, two days prior to the meeting. Hopefully that will never happen again. I do think that a calling plan for a member daisy chain of contacting might be a point to consider.
<p>	Here's hoping that you had a great Holiday Season and 1996 will be filled with Health, Happiness, and Prosperity to you all.
<p>	There is one item that I'll save for Lance to discuss in January about new developments for the classic Atari 8-bit computer

<h3>BBS Report</h3>
<p>
	As you know the BBS went down on the 6th of December. A REALLY horrible event. The problem with the BBS was the hard drive. The older MFM & RLL drives were warranted for 500 hours of service life. Well in six months time 4500 hr's is the norm. This will be an increasingly growing problem as those types of drives are only available as used; true condition unknown. For the technical folks: a post mortem on the drive indicated that the bearing(s) lost the permanent lub. Friction and heat did the rest.
<p>	Imbedded SCSI's are available but they tend to be expensive. I would also save that type of drive for the ST where the full potential of the drive can be utilized.
<p>	It appears that I was able to save the user dat file so that few if any had to re-log on. There is still a minor problem with the 3rd party f-mail and I plan on working that out with K-Products and Steve Cardin (BBS Express-Pro progammer).
<p>	As of this writing the files have not been reloaded but the plan is to do it on Superbowl Sunday when few if any will be bbsing.

<h3>Minutes of Space meeting</h3>
<h4>December 08,1995</h4>

<p>	It was the night before the Space annual Christmas party and all through the house, nothing was stirring except me. I was busy preparing the big 13-pound turkey for our Christmas party, Friday, December 8, 1995. I put it in the oven to cook over night. In the morning I pulled a delicious looking turkey out of the oven. I then put it in the ice box. In the evening I was going to add it to all the delicious food at the party. You all know the rest, the club party was canceled by MOTHER NATURE. Luckily we have a chance to celebrate a Christmas party at our January 12, 1996 meeting. We can also include celebrating a new year. For all members that signed up to bring something on the Christmas potluck list, please bring food in for the Christmas party in January. Be prepared to have a fun time too!
<p>	The midwinter Madness show is rapidly approaching. It will be held on February 10, 1995 at Blaine Sports Center in Blaine. Be sure to bring plenty of money because there will probably be plenty of bargains.
<p>	Last of all, because we didn't have a club meeting in December because of MOTHER NATURE, there aren't any minutes to report. See you at the January Space meeting, and be prepared to PARTY HARDY and FEAST LIKE KINGS !

<p>Michael Weist<br>
Club Secretary

|          ACTION! TUTORIAL          |
+------------------------------------+
#17            VICTORY
--------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
From the last issue:<br>
The 12 different boxes of product need 11 gates to provide 12 conveyors to the 12 automatic shelves. My set of eleven tests began with a scale weighing out any package less than 15 Lbs. If your solution has something different, that is perfectly acceptable, provided it meets the needs of the job. Basically the first test should divide the group of products roughly in half, but it is not mandatory. The important part is that it performs as required, and you can check that by using your flowchart to see where each box would get diverted to. The criteria was that the boxes should end up on separate shelves. You might imagine the supervisor may want to invest more cash into the system and ask you to add in the needed equipment to reject certain boxes which fail in a unique way, and return all rejects on a new conveyor to the plant.
<p>
Such is the way it goes in programming, just when you think your done, somebody shows up and wants to change the program. A good flowchart helps in modifying an already complete program. With a flow chart, the programmer can make necessary changes to the algorithm, and can quickly add in the needed code in the proper spot. This is just a reminder to always document your programs, either by the use of a flow chart, or in the source code itself. You never know when you may decide to add more stuff to a finished program.
<p>
Moving from words in a flowchart, to code on the computer can be made easy to do. The more details included in a flowchart, the easier it is to translate into code. Flowcharts also help in optimization of algorithms. Careful inspection of a flow chart can reveal redundant loading of a variable, or testing of a value, that may be consolidated or reduced. Looking at the whole process, might give insight to a different algorithm, or method, that will do the same thing even quicker. Some times a better algorithm will be enough, and should be attempted first, but there are occasions when assembly is the best choice. Remember you need only to rework the code that causes a delay, or that will make a perceptable difference. There is no big advantage in optimizing the part of a program that is already performing well.
<p>
As if to fly in the face of good advice, look back at issue #12's procedures. Here we had a few good routines that were made even better by translating part of them to machine code (AscToInt). EchoS has a loop in it, one of the most basic programming structures, and the most time consuming. Translating this routine to machine code will provide an example of the loop structure as it appears in machine language.
<p>
First the flowchart:
<ol>
<li> Save STRING address
<li> Calculate DESTINATION address
<li> Initialize counter
<li> Load byte from STRING
<li> Save byte to DESTINATION
<li> Decrement counter
<li> Test for end condition
<li> Loop to "4" until done
<li> RETURN
</ol>




<p>Now the code:
<pre>

PROC EchoS=*(BYTE ARRAY S)
   ;1. Save STRING address
[$85 $A2       ;STA $A2  Save S LO
 $86 $A3       ;STX $A3  Save S HI
   ;2. DEST=(Y*40)+SAVMSC+X

<p>

As you can see, most of this procedure is spent setting up the parameters for the loop. The loop itself is quite small, only 10 bytes (Two bytes are used to indicate where AscToInt is located). This loop can still be optimized further, if desired, by moving all the code from the AscToInt routine to its proper place in the loop. This results in eliminating the need for jumping (using time to store values on the processor stack and in the program counter) which is time consuming when done repeatedly. The code from the AscToInt routine is needed for this loop to function, so moving it 'in line' will make the loop larger, but will actually reduce the execution time.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Were you wondering how to call a procedure using machine language? You can also call ACTION! routines that you have written. ACTION! passes variables using the A and X registers, and returns function values in $A0 and $A1.

#18      BREAKING THE RECORD!
--------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
BYTES, CARDS, POINTERS, and ARRAYS can be used for most of your programming. There comes a time when you must work with a large amount of data, and a mixed set of BYTES, CARDS, and ARRAYS. At times it makes sense to organize your data so that it may be easily processed, other times it makes just as much sense to organize your data for optimum use with files on a disk. Records are used to help in both of these areas.
<p>
Records allow a programmer to group the fundamental data types together (BYTES, CARDS, and INTEGERS). The grouping must be declared before it is used. The records become real useful when you set up a block of memory to hold an array of records. This is no more than a BYTE array, which is divided into individual records, one record right after the other. Each record can be accessed using a record POINTER, which steps through the array, in steps the size of one record.
<pre>

TYPE DAY=[BYTE hi,lo   ;Record FORMAT
          INT change]

BYTE ARRAY memory(400) ;Records storage

DAY POINTER temp       ;Record ID

DEFINE RECORD_SIZE="4" ;2 BYTES + 1 INT 
DEFINE MAX_DAYS="9"    ;99 max!

PROC Make_Record() 
BYTE i,r=53770,oldtemp 
INT chg

  temp=memory             ;# 1a

  oldtemp=75 
  FOR i=0 TO MAX_DAYS 
  DO
    chg=r&7
    chg==-4
    temp.change=chg
    temp.hi=oldtemp+chg
    temp.lo=temp.hi-5-(r&3)
    oldtemp=temp.hi
    temp==+RECORD_SIZE    ;# 1b
  OD
RETURN

PROC SHOW() 
BYTE i

Make_Record()

Graphics(0) 
PrintE(" ")

printE("DAY   High   Low   Chg")

  FOR i=0 TO MAX_DAYS
  DO
    temp=memory+(RECORD_SIZE*i) ;# 2
    PrintF(" %U     %U     %U    %I",
       i,temp.hi,temp.lo,temp.change)
    PrintE(" ")
  OD
RETURN
</pre>
<p>
You can read your manual to get further information on declaring records. This program is nothing special, it creates a list of each days high and low temperature and indicates the change of the high temp from one day to the next. Take note, there are two methods used to access the records. Method #1 sets 'temp' to the start of the storage area (1a) and steps through each record by adding RECORD_SIZE to 'temp' (1b) each pass through the loop. Method #2 calculates the proper location of each record (#2). This random access method of locating each record is simple to use and works well for records that reside completely in memory.
<p>
Because each record can be accessed in a uniform manner, the need for special data handling code is reduced. To give you a little practice in using records, try to write a routine that would allow you to enter the data for this program. You can have the user input the high and low temperatures, and the computer calculating the amount of change in high temperature from the previous day. When you have that routine working, write a program to keep track of the time of the sun rising and setting each day. Also keep track of how many hours of daylight there are in each day and the change in daylight hours from one day to the next. The more practice you get, the better you become.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Records are a very useful tool. As will be shown next month, they can be used to provide an easy means of working with data objects (the manual calls them 'virtual records'), we're going to call them worms!

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER February, 1996 </h2>


<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick


<p> The delayed Christmas Party was a great success. The feedback I've been seeing on the BBS and some of the comments at the party meant to me all had a good time.
<p> There have been some comments on the BBS to have an impromptu pizza party. We used to do that in the past, after the meeting, but if the membership wishes we can have it catered by Dominoes or Pizza Hut. Something to discuss at our next meeting in February. If we do pursue that course of action a couple of issues need to be addressed; such as:
<ul>
<li>    Who will accept the responsibility to plan and organize the food acquisition?
<li>    Do we wish to have a surcharge of $1.00 extra for each member to be put in the treasury?
<li>    Who will accept the responsibility to insure the meeting place will be cleaned up?
<li>    Will we have an alternate food item for those who cannot or wish not to have pizza?
</ul>
<p> Speaking of the Treasury, how does an auction of personal items sound with a percentage of the sale earmarked for the treasury. We could have the auction with the owner/seller determining minimum sale price; to include also the percentage to the treasury. That way nobody is out, treasures are moved around, and the club benefits a little. Again something to discuss at a later time.
<p> To the members in general; aside from the D.O.M. what type/kind of demo do you wish to see? This could be from setting up a hard drive to the use of a particular program, etc.?
<p> I've been in contact with Bob Klass of K-Products and he's working on a CD ROM for the 8-bit with shareware/public domain software included.
<p> I haven't been able to make a good connection with SCAT but am still pursuing a trip to see them if a direct connection is made. I estimate a trip down on Friday and return on Sunday will be $200 each; considering hotel, meals, and shared gas costs.
<p>See you all in February and stay warm.

<h3>BBS Report</h3>

<p> The BBS is slowly coming back on line and by the time you read this it should be fully operational.
<p> The cost of accessing an Internet server for e-mail hasn't been finalized. I will try and get together with Craig Peterson and discuss who he uses and find out from the server what an account will cost. Then we need to contact K-Products and Steve Carden to see if we can modify/alter the BBS software. We need their permission for this evolution as we are only licensed to use their software/program. I would expect that it would be cheaper to access the Internet e-mail through Flight Line or acquire the 80 column term program(s) and gain access to the server on an individual basis. More as contacts are made.

<h3>Minutes of Space meeting</h3>
<h4>January 12th, 1996</h4>

<p> Meeting was opened by club president, Mike Fitzpatrick. Mike welcomed members to the Space meeting at 7:35 PM.

<p><strong>OLD BUSINESS</strong> Mike Fitzpatrick talked about the cancellation of last month's Space meeting because of the bad weather.

<p><strong>NEW BUSINESS</strong> Club member asked the BBS SYSOP when the BBS would be up again. SYSOP reported that the BBS was up again, but files for the system would have to be reloaded. This would take time. Bearings in old SEAGATE HARD DRIVE failed. Mike also reported BUG in F-mail found.

<p> Mike remarked the December minutes were in order and Larry Serflaten's article was appreciated.

<p> Mike said he has been in communications with a Chicago Atari group. Letter from a person with a Atari CADD program question. Also said Bob Kloss is alive and well, sends greetings. Version 5 Pro is out.

<p> Rich Mier and Lance Ringquist will give a talk on CD ROM for the 8-bit user in the future.

<p> E-Mail on the INTERNET for Atari 8-bit users was also talked about.

<p><strong>TREASURER REPORT</strong> Greg Leinter said the treasury has taken a beaten. Besides no meeting in December 1995 and no sales, there is 4th quarter room rent, post office box, newsletter, and BBS cost.

<p> Greg Leinter also reported that MID WINTER MADNESS Officials would like Space club to participate at show in February 1996. Cost of a booth is $16. Mike Fitzpatrick asked if anybody would like to represent Space club at show. Mike Schmidt, club newsletter editor said he would like to, but he will be celebrating his 25th Wedding Anniversary in Hawaii. He was congratulated for making 25 years.

<p> Greg Leinter also said room rent for the Space club would be increasing from $90 to $105. But instead of 2 hour, we could use room for 3 hours a meeting.

<p> Club president ended meeting by telling membership <strong>LET'S PARTY, LET'S GO!</strong>

<p>Meeting adjourned at 7:55pm.

<p> Mike Weist  Club Secretary
<h3> Treasurer's Report by Greg Leitner</h3>
<p> What happened?? Just when the Club was beginning to get momentum, we fell flat. The cancellation of the December Xmas party meeting was very unfortunate but it couldn't be helped. I would have thought that members would have been very anxious for the January meeting. Only about a dozen members showed up for our belated Xmas party, and even with so few members we still had a great spread of food and a lot of leftovers.
<p> It doesn't take a genius to figure out that missing a meeting really messes up our financial picture. We had to pay for the room rental that we didn't use and also for our regular monthly newsletter & BBS expense. Also we got socked with having to pay for a half-year fee for our P.O. Box rental. All these expenses and no receipts to offset any of them!
<p> At least in January we took in $100.00 thanks to three membership renewals and many DOM sales. Of course we had our usual monthly expenses and so at the end of January 1996 our bank balance stands at $410.00 down about $150.00 from my last report in November.
<p> Please reassure me that the January meeting was just an exception by marking down on your calendars the 9th of February as the day you will be at the next meeting. Remember, that you are the most important member that this Club has.

 ||| "From a saved backup...." <br>
 ||| By: Ron Whittam <br>
/ | \ GEnie: EXPLORER.4 Internet: whittam@primenet.com<br>
//// <strong>Day In, Day Out........</strong> ln this column I hope to
foster
communication and support for 8-bit and ST computer owners...
presenting a positive and directive approach. This will help to
strengthen the users group base and encourage the executive
element.
<p> If you have a question you would like to see answered, or a topic you would like to see covered; send me an EMail!
<p> If the topic of computer conversation isn't the Internet, it's about some new and innovative operating system. Recently Microsoft unleashed its newest creation on the world, Windows 95. I read a post on the Internet that touted the new functions of Win95, such as the multitasking changes, the file manager, plug and play, and other nifty features, the author summed it up with, "Bill, Welcome to 1985." Yes, 1985 technology has finally made it to the masses. Back in 1985, ten years ago, similar technology was utilized by Digital Research, Atari, Commodore, and Apple (and lately, even IBM). But it took a media-using company like Microsoft to sell it
 on a world-wide scale.
 <p>
//// <strong>It's All in the Wrist........</strong> The developers on the Atari platform
have not stopped developing newer and more innovative software
packages and system enhancements. These programs will even run
on computers purchased in 1985. You can't say that about
Microsoft's accomplishment. A few of these new operating
systems and operating system enhancements have been quietly
reported in the few Atari magazines available on the market:
MagiC and EASE - multi-tasking OS; Geneva - Multi-tasking, and
NeoDesk; AtariNOS - Atari TCP/IP; MiNTOS - UNIX-like
environment; MultiTOS - Atari's GEM multitasking OS based on
MiNT; OMEn - cross-platform multitasking system, and others.
These are designed to meet the needs of the 1990's and beyond.
<p> Hardware devices like 4x CD-ROMs, scanners, multi-sync monitors, high-speed modems, MIDI components, and other devices can be easily connected to the Atari computer (even the

older Atari ST, circa 1985). Recently, I was called upon to install software on an IBM PS/2 computer. The person called me because I had spent a few hours, years before, showing them how to use their Atari. While fixing the configuration and getting the word processing program tweeked to run efficently, I was asked, "Why do you like Atari computers so much when you know so much about IBM compatables?" (I wondered if this was a trick question). I responded by pointing out that I liked the ease of use and the functional aspects of the Atari. I mentioned, "for instance, this new HP printer you have just bought can be hooked up to your Atari, and your current Atari programs can print to it." She was surprised. One reason they bought the IBM computer was because they bought the new printer. They didn't think an old computer would work with it.
<p> Running quality software is easy. Most freeware and shareware products on the Atari platform rival the commercial offerings on any other computer platform. Some argue that the Public Domain (PD) databases (free and shareware programs) of other platforms have so many more programs then PD databases on the Atari platform. This may be true. I have waded through (and download) many useless or inadequate programs from those "other" databases. When trying to find a what your looking for in an Atari PD database, you don't need to look far. Most every program will not only do what you need done, it will usually do even more.
<p>//// <strong>Reality Check........</strong> Ok, ok. You are thinking, "he's preaching
to the choir." Not so. I have run across Atari users who are
keeping their Atari and using it with a great deal of "other
platform" envy. but who can't afford to make the cross-over. I am
here to say, you don't need to. For a lot less money, you can
purchase commercial or shareware Atari programs and commercial
hardware enhancements to make your Atari the envy of your IBM
touting friends. You can feel confident that you have a quality
machine that can "get the job done."
<p> I was also asked, by the forementioned person, why I spent so much time consulting personal and business home computer owners who had IBM compatable machines, and so little time with Atari owners. Aside from the ratio factor, IBM types need the help - Atari owners don't. Atari owners, however, need information. We always seem to know what is happening in the other realm because of News, media-hype, advertising, and the like. But Atari owners, like this solitary school teacher, are often "in the dark" about the advancements of the Atari platform. They believe the Atari they own is obsolete and not usable. They become very surprised at the notion that it is not. And are often awestruck at the proof. In my last article, I mentioned a PC user group officer to whom I showed an Atari TT during a swapmeet. He said he thought Atari had disolved and that they had only made game machines (he still had one). He was unaware of the Atari ST, STE, TT, and Falcon series of computers. The Eagle advertisements we were handing out shocked his socks off.
<p> As a user group member (if you are not one, be one - if you don't have a user group - start one), the dissemination of information and instruction of the masses falls to you. Recently, two of our user group member's letters to the editor (about Atari computers) have been printed in the local paper. Our user group editor makes frequent contributions to a local computer rag called, Computer Solutions. We are doing what we can in our corner of the world. Do what YOU can in yours.
<p>////<strong> Doing it Right........</strong> There are ways to go about doing this. Be
innovative. Have direction. First, find other Atari computer
owners. A year ago, we went on a campaign to locate the 1,000
people who had bought Atari computers from one computer store
    in the Boise area during the 1980's. We dropped off our newsletter at computer stores. bookstores that carried computer books, computer repair shops and electrical outlet stores, and anywhere else we could find. Some of our members scanned the classified ads for Atari computers being sold. They would drop by the seller. They asked the seller to give the new buyer a newsletter and user group information. We sold used Atari equipment we salvaged from a school warehouse. Our members fixed and repaired what we could and sold them for a fair price. The buyers were invited to the user group (free one year membership with purchase).
<p> An easy, simple, and cost effective method is a business card. Use a few dollars from the user group treasury to make a business card that can be used to advertize your user group. Pin them up on bulletin boards in your city (shopping centers, grocery stores, and the like have public bulletin boards for this purpose). The business card ad should be simple yet complete. Announcing your group's name, the meeting place and time, a means of getting hold of the officers, an Internet address and web page URL, and any other significant information.
<p> If you have some innovative ideas your group has done (or ideas you would like to see done), please send them to &ltexplorer.4@genie.com&gt. I will include them in the up and coming issues of AEO. 
<p>//// <strong>A Few Interesting Places on the 'Net</strong><br> http://www.futurenet.co.uk is the Web site of Future Publishing and the ST FORMAT magazine. 
&lt75300.3443@compuserve.com&gt is Sam Tramiel's EMail address. http://www.mcc.ac.uk/~dlms/atari.htrnl is the famous Atari Web Page by Mark Smith. http://www.atari.com/ is the Web site address for some company...
<p> If your user group has a web page, BBS, or an E-mail address, send me the information at &ltexplorer.4@genie.com&gt and I will help get the word out. 
<p>//// <strong>Send it in........</strong>Don't forget to send in the registration for that shareware program you have been using. The developer deserves the cash. Hours of time lost from family and friends were required to produce that program. And don't forget programmers need to eat, too. If you use Atari computer shareware programs, make a sigrnficant contribution to the Atari platform by contributing to the programmers who are still developing products for you.
<p> Here's an idea: Get the members of your user group together. Find out which shareware programs you are using (and have not paid for). Pool your resources and do a mass registration. You pay for one postage stamp and one cheque or money order. This will benifit both your group and the programmer. Better yet, pick one shareware programmer a month, and do this each month until the products your members are using have been paid for. This will ease the impact on the pocketbook and support the Atari programmers at the same time. 
<p><strong>Speak up!........</strong>If you are supporting the Atari platform, send me a brief bio and how you can be contacted.
<p>Until next time. . .

 ||| Old Atari News<br>
 ||| By: John Hardie<br>
/ | \ GEnie: EXPLORER.3<br>
    No, this isn't a column of old news about Atari. Basically, this column will cover new items of interest to the owners of older Atari 8-bit, 2600/5200/7800, or Lynx machines. News of new products, upgrades, etc., will be noted as I find out about them. If you have something of interest to your fellow Atarians with these machines, please contact me on GEnie at EXPLORER.3 or Internet &ltexplorer.3@genie.com&gt.
<p> At times this column might resemble an advertisement for Best Electronics or B&C Computervisions. Let me assure you that this is strictly due to the fact that these two reputable dealers are the only people that have any parts or equipment for most of the listed machines. With that out of the way, let's see what's new. 
<p>////<strong> Atari 8-bit news</strong><br>
    If you're currently running 80 columns with the XEP-80, you should know about an upgrade to the XEP-80 to allow you to use an IBM TTL monitor, which are both plentiful and cheap. Designed by the masterful Bob Wooley, this simple upgrade taps off the signals needed for a TTL monitor. But before you rush out and buy a TTL monitor, you might be interested in knowing that Atari made their own IBM TTL monitor, the PCM124. If you're a fanatic like myself, you might want to check out the amber PCM. Contact Best Electronics or B&C Computervisions for pricing on XEP-80's and PCM124's. Contact me in EMail if you just want the upgrade document.
<p> Did you ever order a piece of European software or maybe get one of those great demos from overseas, only to have it lock up or not run properly? Well, a fine gentleman named Nir Dary in California, has come up with the solution. To upgrade your XE/XL to run European software, simply replace you current Antic chip with a PAL antic chip, and in the O.S. change location $C386 to $01 and location $C000 to $12. If you'd prefer to have this done for you, you can contact:
<blockquote>
Nir Dary<br>
19185 Castlebay Lane<br>
    Northridge, CA. 91326
</blockquote>
<p> //// <strong>Atari 7800</strong><br>
    On one of my trips to Ireland, I discovered a 7800 system with Asteroids built in to the console. Well, with a minor adjustment, you can put this special O.S. in your own 7800. Depending on what model 7800 you have (there were 3 types), it may be as easy as plugging in a chip. At worst, so me simple, minor soldering needs to be done. The upgrade kit with all necessary parts is available from Best Electronics.
<p> Also on the 7800 front, if you're a collector like myself, you'll want one of Atari's Nintendo-style joypad controllers that they only released overseas. Again, these are available from Best.
<p>//// <strong>Atari Lynx</strong><br>
    I hope this is true. When I called Atari Customer Service the other day, I was told that Super Asteroids/Missile Command and Battlezone 2000 were in production. When I questioned the lady about in-store availability, she said they would be direct from Atari for $39.99 each.
<p> That's all for now. As new items of interest appear, I'll post them here. Here's the vendor info:
<blockquote>
Best Electronics 1-408-243-6950<br>
B&C Computervisions 1-408-986-9960

<h3>Space Christmas Party<br>
January, 1996</h3>

<p>The Space Christmas party was to be held on December 8, 1995. As we all know MOTHER NATURE took care of that. The Space Christmas party was cancelled, along with the monthly meeting. The Christmas party was rescheduled for the January Space meeting on January 12, 1996. I hoped MOTHER NATURE didn't strike again.

<p>January 12, 1996, the day of the rescheduled Christmas Party came. To my surprise, no surprises from MOTHER NATURE. After a short Space club meeting, the Christmas party started. There was a table full of delicious food, from a big 13 lb turkey, KFC chicken sticks, BBQ meatball, BBQ Smookies, cookies, chicken salads, veggie trays, a huge delicious sheet cake provided by our club president and his wife, and cold pop to wash all that food down.
<p>
Members had a chance to sit, relax, and enjoy the party. There was so much food,, members could go up for seconds. A thanks goes out to the Christmas party committee for all their hard work. Even though we didn't have the biggest crowd of Space members at the party ( about 20 ) we had a fun evening. A thanks also goes out to the member, who showed up to PARTY! The club's Christmas and Birthday parties are always fun. Can't wait till Space club's 14th birthday party in July '96.
<p>
Don forget!

<h3>A Parallel Bus Interface for your 1200XL</h3>
<p>
By Bob Woolley SLCC
<p>
    If you did the CLEARPIC modification in the August Journal, then you qualify as a 1200XL nut, just like me. No use fighting it, though, you really do yearn for the MIO type stuff that all the 800XL/130XE users have been bragging on. The easy way to get one is to buy an 800XL, but since when do we have to take the easy way out? Face it, you want an MIO, you gotta do this mod. You might even get a disk interface thrown in. There are only two hardware functions that are missing on the 1200XL that are required to run the Parallel Buss - a 16K ROM select and the -EXTernal SELect input. All the other circuitry already exists in the 1200XL. So, let's get a 16K ROM in there, first.
<p>
    The 1200XL OS does not have the PBI code in either of its two 8K ROMs, which means we'll have to either recode an EPROM or use the 800XL or 130XE (same chip) OS ROM. Since many people don't have an EPROM burner and don't want to spend $150 for one, maybe $5 or $10 for an Atari ROM out of an 800XL (CO61598B) is a good idea. Also, it really isn't legal to copy the Atari ROM into an EPROM, even for your own use. Even if you destroy your source ROM, even. Atari was nice enough to provide an easy upgrade path, use their ROM. OK? First thing you may find is that the 1200XL ROMs are 24 pin devices and the new ROM is a 28 pin package. No problem. All of the 1200XL main boards have 28 pin sites for the ROMs. All you need to do is pull the 24 pin socket at U13 and solder in a 28 pin unit. One more address line (A13) is needed, so remove the W6 jumper and solder a wire from pin 23 of the CPU chip (U21) to the top pad of W6. Now, plug the 800XL OS ROM into U13. The 16K ROM select is just as simple. Take a look inside your 1200XL. See the chip that has 20 pins (U14)? That is your MMU. It is the main difference between a 1200XL and an 800XL. Same number of little pins, same
 number of inputs and outputs .....  But
the 800XL IC has the 16K select for the OS
ROM. So, lets jump right in and swap the
MMU with the 800XL part (CO61618). Fits
just fine, doesn't it? Pull out all the
jumpers except W11, W12 and W9 and you
have a ROM select line that will select
the address range from $C000 to $FFFF
in a single ROM, like the 800XL.
<p>     Since the 1200XL has two ROM sockets, and there may be some hard core nuts out there that just must have the internal Basic ROM, get a version C ROM and bend up pins 24 and 21. Plug this ROM into U12 and solder a wire from pin 24 of the Basic ROM to +5v at the top of C11 (just to the left of U13) . Solder another wire from pin 21 of the ROM to the left hand pad of W7 (which should not have a jumper in it) . One more wire from pin 18 of U14 to pin 11 of U23 and your machine has Basic under the covers, just like the big guys ! Now you get the thrill of holding down OPTION when you want to boot without Basic, where those of us who don't do this section only need to pull the cartridge. To be fair, though, SpartaDos will now turn Basic on and off in your 1200XL with the Basic On and Basic Off commands - which is kinda nlce.
<p>
    All right ! Half way there. Now, for the -EXTSEL line. You need a 74HC08 for this part of the upgrade. You could use a 74LS08, but the 74HC devices draw much less power than the older LS chips and they are better behaved on the buss compared to the standard parts. Bend up all the pins on the new IC except 7 and 14. Cut off pins 4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12, and 13. Pull U17, an LS08, and place the HC08 on top of it so that all the pins line up. Solder the two devices together at pin 7 and pin 14 and plug the pair back into U17. You should have pins 1,2 and 3 of the HC08 bent away from the LS08 such that wires can be soldered to them. Looking at the BOTTOM of the board, cut the trace that runs from pin 16 of U14 to a pad about 1 inch above pin 14 of U11. Cut the horizontal trace on the bottom of t to the old collector pad of Q16 (bottom pad of the transistor) . If you have not done the CLEARPIC upgrade, solder a 2.7K resistor from pin 2 of the HC08 to + 5 volts. Either way, pin 2 of the 74HC08 that you added is now the -EXTSEL line (pin 2 on the PBI connector) that you were missing. Your1200XL now contains all the lines necessary for PBI operation.
<p>
    You know what comes next, don't you? Solder one end of a 50 conductor flat cable to each point listed below. Be absolutely certain that you are counting the flat cable wires correctly. They read kinda goofy - the red stripe is pin 49. Pin 50 is the next wire into the flat cable. Next is pin 47 and then 48. It continues in that odd fashion to pin 2 on the right edge of the cable. Be careful - I warned you !

    As far as the length of the flat cable is concerned, I have used the PIO Controller from the July and August Journals with a 4 foot cable. None of the logic in that design would have a problem with this 1200XL setup. However, other commercial hardware may not be so forgiving. I have not finished my 1200XL wiring , but I have tested the ROM and Basic changes - check with me on CIS (75126,3446) if you are planning to run an MIO or the Supra Hard Disk controllers. Otherwise, get yourself a Supra MicroPort kit and check the Journal next month.

As stated at the start of this monthly column, I intended to give you routines you can use, and a little insight into programming with ACTION!. This issue gives you new PLOT and LOCATE routines that are faster than those supplied with ACTION!. In addition to the clip and save section, part of the START UP routine must be included to initialize the screen array. You may remember it is faster for the computer to look up data in a table than it is to calculate the needed values every time. This is what the array does in the PLOP and FIND procedures.

Last months program should have revealed the cookie-cutter approach by using an array of records. Each worm had 4 pixel segments and its own direction of travel stored in a record. The MOVE procedure handled all the worms in the same manner, which eased the programming task. This same method can be used for other programs where you have many identical, or nearly identical, objects. Some examples might include soldiers engaged in a war, rooms of a haunted castle, employee files, days in a calendar, and many, many more.
<p>
Although you cant directly declare a BYTE array in a record, you can coax ACTION! to store arrays in records. This month you will see how you use and access a record that has a BYTE array in it. The program asks you to enter three student names, with three test scores each. It then displays the student name and average of the test scores, along with their grade. At the bottom of the display, the records themselves are shown, with spaces inserted between the name, test scores, average, and grade. This section shows you how the record would look (minus the spaces) if it were stored in a disk file.

<p>This program runs funny, in that whenever the name is less than 10 characters long, the records still hold old data behind the student name. See if you can fix this problem. To see this effect, run the program and enter AAAAAAAAAA for the first name, then run it again and enter Z for the first name. You will see that part of the name AAAAAAAAAA is still in memory.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER March, 1996 </h2>


<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick

<p>	This month I've contacted an avid Atarian who is making a WEB Page for the Atari Computer and any Clubs that are based on the Atari. He's been given the data on our Club and how to contact us. When his task is complete he promised to give us a call and inform us of where we can see what is still left for the Atari computer.
<p>	Have had some folks interested in the Atari, both 8-bit and ST, contact me, one through an intennediary. The interest is varied. One wants to have both games and educational benefits for their children; the other is interested in setting up a business using an Atari. SPACE member Lance Ringquist should be smirking by now.
<p>	There was a vender listing u/loaded to the BBS and made available to the Newsletter Editor showing current Atari Venders.
<p>	I've seen some neat software about, one program &lttype in&gt was uploaded to the BBS.
<p>	We should have a fun meeting in March; hope to see you there.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick reported that the minutes of the February meeting were misplaced and unavailable in time for the Newsletter.

<h3>BBS News</h3>
<p>	Finally isolated the problem to why user slots are overwritten and lost. It is the 3rd party F-mail and how it is used. Put in a revised version that is not so sensitive and am in the process of ordering a newer version that should be bug free, at least for f-mail.

<p>	Have been having some problems with users who terminate calls by disconnecting at their end instead of letting the BBS perform the disconnect. Sometimes what will occur is the board not recycling to the wait call mode. It is a pain for other users &ltunable to access&gt until I get up in the morning or come home from work to restart the BBS.

<p>	Also, it has come to my attention that there is an unhappy user. This user wants a different BBS Sysop. That is fine if we have a volunteer who is willing to provide a phone line and take the time to set up, on the club's equipment, the BBS strictly for SPACE.
<p>	While we are on the BBS issue; let it be known that there are very few SPACE members who call on a regular basis. This might be a way to save the club some funds. Shut down the BBS and send data to the Newsletter Editor and DOM Chairman via U.S. Mail. This in itself would save the club about $300 per year. Just a thought.
<p>Let's discuss this issue at the next SPACE Meeting.

<h3>Treasurer's Report by Greg Leitner</h3>

<p>	The February meeting was very interesting as the CD-ROM drive for the 8-bit Atari surfaced again. I would really like to know more about the hardware connections and what software will be available. This could be the very thing that will bring new life into the 8-bit world of computing. Also, come to the meetings and see what Lance has to offer. I understand that Atari is still cleaning out their warehouses and Lance is right there getting his share of the hardware and software at unbelievable prices.

<p>	The February meeting went quite well even though we only had about fifteen members present. We could really use the support and input from all our members. I just wish you would let us know what we can do to get you all to the meetings on a regular basis. It was mentioned at the Feb. meeting that demonstrations could be done if the members were interested. If you have some suggestions about what you would like to see demonstrated please let us know. This is what the User Groups were meant to do and be, how we increase our knowledge about the system we choose to use, our 8-bit Atari's.

<p>	As far as our financial situation for February goes, our balance in our bank account stands at $434.64 up from last month by about $25.00. We took in $52.50 and only paid out $28.74, that for the monthly BBS billing. We still owe Mike Schmidt for the great Newsletter he put out in Feb., just before he ditched the cold weather and headed for Hawaii, but that expense will only be about $15.00.

<p>	March could be a good month for us in that we don't have any major expenses due, but we need your support and presence to accomplish this. So please try to save one day of the month on March 8 and make it to the meeting.

<h3>Atari to merge with JTS Corp. in deal valued at $78 million.</h3>
<h4>Game firm joins disk-drive maker</h4>

<p>	Sunnyvale, Calif. -- Atari Corp., the multimedia games Company, said Tuesday that it his agreed to merge with JTS Corp., a privately held maker of disk drives in a deal valued at around $78 million.
<p>	Atari, maker of the popular video game Jaguar and other titles playable on Atari's dedicated platform, has met with stiff competition from other games makers such as Sega Corp., as well as from personal computers.
<p>	An Atari spokesman said the company was looking for a strategic investment.
<p>	"We had $50 million in the bank", Said Spokesman August Liguori, from Atari headquarters Sunnyvale, Calif.
<p>	He said that in the past. Atari has sold computers, printers andother computer components. "To some extent we are going backinto the computer business" by merging with JTS.

<p>	The new entity will be known as JTS Corp., but Atari will remain as a brand name.

<p>	Under terms of the deal, Atari, which has about 63 million Shares outstanding, will issue an additional 40 million shares to JTS shareholders.
<p>	As a result of the proposed transaction, Atari stockholders would hold about 60 percent of the new company's outstanding shares after the merger, it said. The transaction is structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and would be accounted for as a purchase.
<p>	JTS Chairman Jugi Tandon will be chairman of the merged company. He founded JTS in 1994.
<p>	Atari Chairman Jack Tramiel will become a JTS board member.
<p>	Under terms of the deal, Atari has extended a $25 million bridge loan to JTS. In the event that the merger is not completed, the loan would be convertible into JTS Series A preferred shares.
<p>	Both Atari and JTS anticipate the transacton will close toward the end of the second quarter. The Atari entertainment business and the JTS disk drive business will operate as separate divisions of the new merged company.
<p>	Atari stock was up 18 3/4 cents at $2.06 on the American stock Exchange.

<h3>MidWinter Madness Show '96</h3>

<p>The Mid Winter Madness Show was once again held at the Blaine Sports Center in Blaine Minn. It was held on February 10, 1996 from 7:30 am. to 2:30 PM. I ventured out to the show at around 11 am. Finding the sports center isn't that hard. A person has their choice of going highway 65 or using 35W to get there. There is parking available for a few dollars or a parking area for free parking, with a shuttle bus that will bring you to the front of the building, where the electronic show is held.
<p>
Every year it is fun to go to this show to see friends, look for bargains, or just to have a fun time. I hit the flea market area and found a lot of computer books related to IBM computers, but the show was really bare of Atari software and hardware. I don't know what has happened to the Atari stuff. Anyway there is always the Amateur show in July '96 at Aldrich Arena in Maplewood, MN. See you all at the next Space Meeting on March 8, 1996.

#21        FINAL EPISODE...
---------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
Up to now I have discussed the different
		aspects of a program for the computer.
		Now its time to discuss how to turn those
		programs in the computer, to files on the
		disk for everyone to enjoy.
<p>		After you have typed in a program, you
		are required to enter the Monitor to compile and run the program. The Monitor will
		also save the compiled code to disk. The
		file produced from the Monitors write
		command (W "D1:MYPROG.EXE") is executable
		from the disk. After you have written a
		program file to the disk from the Monitor,
		you can then call up DOS and run the file
		from the command line prompt. If you have
		supplied all of the necessary code for
		execution, you will be able to run the
		file even without the ACTION! cartridge
		installed. Those files are the type of
		files you can send to your friends, who
		may not have the ACTION! cartridge. For
		a discussion on how to get programs to run
		without the cartridge, refer back to my
		column #11.
<p>		The DOS file system has a method of
		determining what type of file is stored
		on the disk. By using the first two bytes
		in a file, it can determine if the file
		was meant for direct execution, or for
		use with the BASIC cartridge, and so on.
		If the file begins with two 0's, it is
	probably an executable file, BASIC uses
		255, 255 for its tolkenized form. The
		next four bytes in the file tell DOS where
		to put the stored data in memory, and how
		much to put there. By using the two CARD
		values as the start and stop memory
		addresses of the code segment, it can load
		the executable code anywhere in memory.
		The Monitor supplies all these bytes for
		you when you use the write command. DOS
		also allows for the appending of files, so
		that some code may be loaded in at one
		address, and other code may be loaded in
		elsewhere. When the computer has loaded
		data into the last (stop) address, DOS
		checks to see if there is more data in the
		file. If it finds more, it checks to see
			if the next two bytes are 0,0 (which does
			happen when files are appended). If not
			and there is still more data in the file,
			DOS will assume the next four bytes are
			the start and stop addresses of
another
			segment of code (or data, depending
upon
		who put what, where!) This process will
		repeat until there is no more data in
the
		file.
	<p>	The ATARI operating system also has two
		special addresses for use in handling
the
		executable files. These addresses are
		RUNAD (Run Address = 736, 737) and INITAD
		(Init Address = 738, 739). When data is
		loadied into INITAD, the ATARI
Operating

System (OS) interrupts the load process and begins executing code at the address pointed to by INITAD. When that code has finished (via a RETURN statement), the loading process resumes. When data is loaded into RUNAD, the loading process is allowed to complete, then execution of code begins at the address pointed to by RUNAD. You might now see how professional programmers put a little title screen up while their program is loading. A short program to put text on the screen could be loaded in, the INITAD could be used to run that code, then loading of the main program could proceed. Using ACTION! it is real easy to do things like this. When the Monitor writes a program to the disk, it also includes a short segment to load INITAD with the starting address of the main procedure. Appending files written by the Monitor will always act in the manner stated above, some part loads and runs, then another loads and runs, and another, and another, as many times as there were files appended together. Try it yourself, and put it to good use!
<p>	With all the routines and tips I have let you in on, you are now ready to undertake your own projects with confidence. With just a little advanced planning, almost anything a computer can do, can be done using the ATARI. It is up to you, the user of the computer, to put the computer to use. It doesnt do any work sitting on a shelf. You dont have to rely on some distant programmer to write the program you want to use, you can write it your self. It seems the younger generations pick up the new technology quicker than old folks, which is all the more reason to introduce young kids to the ATARI computer. It is easy to use, and simple to program, providing a stepping stone the larger machines for those kids who want to pursue a career involving some aspect of programming a computer. The bulk of computer programming is done by those who have a need. The limits of what a computer can do is bound up only by the imagination of those people willing to attempt the programming of their computer. My advice; reach for the stars!<br>

It has come time to close this column and move on. I want to thank Mike Schmidt our newsletter editor for the great job he has done organizing, printing, and mailing our club newsletter to all our members. All the people in the club who volunteer their time to help SPACE provide support for the ATARI community, deserve a hearty thanks. Its the members, who support SPACE through membership and the purchase of DOMs, that are to be congratulated on keeping this group together for so long. Nice going. This is my last submission, I had a fun time, I hope you gained a little more confidence in your own efforts.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER April 1996 </h2>


<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick

<p>There wasn't a file from the President waiting for me in the Newsletter section of the BBS. Left message, now the BBS appears to be down as this newsletter is put together.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>

<p>	Space meeting for March, was held on March 8, 1996. Meeting opened at 7:35 PM. Mike Fitzpatrick, club president and BBS sysop, welcomed members to the Space meeting. Mike apologized for the Minutes of February meeting not being in the March Newsletter because they were misplaced.
<p>	Mike asked the club treasurer for a report. Greg Leitner, club treasurer, said the club picked up money for treasury. That the balance was $434.64. The motion was made to accept the report. It was accepted.

<p><strong>OLD BUSINESS-</strong>
<p>	Mike talked about a auction of Atari club property in future. Member said good time for auction would be before summer set in. It was suggested May 1996 would be good time for auction. It was suggested the auction be Atari stuff only. Don Langford was asked to handle this auction.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick said he hasn't been in contact with Atari group with Atari group in Chicago, but he has been in contact with Atari groups in Florida and Toronto, Canada.
<p>	Greg Leitner talked about Mast Disk Library available on a Single sided, Single density disk. This is a library listing of ST programs available through the Space Club. It is a 100 pages long. Greg Leitner said he had a few copies on disk available at meeting, for people who wanted a copy.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick thanked a Michael Current for making a Atari Vendors list available for Atari Computer owners.
<p>	A Web page for all Atari groups on the Internet was discussed. It is being worked on.

<p><strong>NEW BUSINESS--</strong>
<p>	The Space 14th Birthday Party was discussed. Mike Fitzpatrick asked Mike Weist to work on a potluck list for upcoming celebration. And also help on working on plans for this party.
<p>	The Amateur show was also talked about Mike Fitzpatrick asked Mike Weist to look into getting a table for our club. Club will pick up table cost.
<p>	Talk about operations of the Club BBS was brought up. Mike Fitzpatrick said Space Club can't afford the cost of phone line for BBS. Mike is providing this through his business. Mike also stated that if members don't like the way he runs the BBS they can take over his duties. He can't make the BBS a 24 hour a day job. If there is a volunteer to take over, he will transfer the duties and equipment to such a person.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick discussed F-Mail problems with BBS. Glen Kirschenmann asked Mike Fitzpatrick how much F-Mail was used on the BBS. Mike said there was 20% usage. Mike said if he re did access level for F-Mail for Space club, he could get rid of F-Mail problems. The change proposed would be eliminate F-Mail for Space Club members until updated software would be available for the BBS. to eliminate these problems. The proposed change was voted on and accepted by members at meeting.
<p>	Greg Leitner touched on CD ROM that is available from TOAD Computer. Asked if one is available for the 8-bit Atari. computer. A member said one is in the works. Mike Fitzpatrick talked about copyrights of software. Told about discussion on Flightline BBS about this subject. He made members aware that a copyright on software should be good for life or until the software owner releases the software copyright.
<p>	Greg Leitner asked if there was a web browser to get on the Internet for the Atari Computer user. Rich Mier said one was in the works.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick told members about upcoming AtariFest III in Indianapolis on July 13, 1996. Asked secretary to announce this, State Computer Show, and the Honeywell Tailgate Swapfest in April Space Newsletter.
<p>Meeting adjourned at 8:15 PM.
<p>Michael Weist Club Secretary

<h3>BBS News</h3>
<p>	This month the F-mail was turned off to the SPACE club user(s). So far there have been no complaints of having a slot lost by the individual user.
<p>For everyone's information:
<ol>
<li>If you try a command and are informed that your security level is too low, you are not being penalized just not given access to that portion of the BBS and the software. ALL SPACE users have the same security level. If you think that you are having a problem leave me E-mail and I'll check it out.
<li>PLEASE! Log off the BBS the legal way by using the "G" key at the main command prompt. Sometimes when one takes a shortcut it can impact the BBS for other users until I can reset the system. Thanks!
</ol>
<p>	I'm strongly considering turning the BBS over to the ST RATSoft program. There are a lot of different items available for the user. For openers a stable F-mail and a voting/polling area for expressing opinions to issues. Right now I just don't have the time.

<h3>Upcoming Space Events</h3>
State Fair Computer Show April 26-28 1996<br> 
Honeywell Tailgate Swapfest June 8, 1996 <br>
Space 14th Birthday Party July 12, 1996 <br>

<h3>Treasurer's Report by Greg Leitner</h3>

<p>	The March Club meeting turned out to be a complete success. Not only did we get a new member, we also had a good turnout of our membership for the meeting. Thanks to Terry and Glen for the great DOM. The sale of the March DOM was brisk to say the least.
<p>	The Club sold 22 disks for March and that hasn't happened in a long while. With the possibility of a Club membership software/hardware auction or sale in May or June, our financial outlook is looking better all the time. I hope we generate enough interest for the sale to take place, but we need your support, and that won't happen unless you show up at the April meeting and express your feelings.
<p>	Our receipts for March included two memberships, (one renewal and a new ST member). The sale of 22 disks along with some blank disks took in $72.00. It's very encouraging to deposit $102.00 when only $30.00 came from memberships. That means the members are buying more software which tells me that our members are still eager to get their hands on good Atari 8-bit programs.
<p>	With this renewed interest in the Club's DOM's, it means a stronger financial position for the Club. Realize that in this position it opens the Club up for a lot of possibilities to do the things we couldn't do before.
<p>	Our only expenses for the month were the two months newsletter and the monthly BBS bill. Our account grew by $50.00 to $482.00 for the month ended March 31, 1996.
<p>See you all on April 12 for another great Atari Club meeting.

<h3>State Fair Computer Show</h3>
<p>April 26, 27, 28, will be the dates for the State Fair Computer Show. The State Fair grounds are near our monthly computer meeting spot. At the show, Atari computer users should run into a few bargains. Maybe run into some Atari software and hardware that you are looking for. Discount tickets were handed out at the March 8 Space meeting. If you weren't at last month's meeting, $1 discount tickets are still available at computer stores. The show should be interesting. Maybe a few of us will run into fellow Atarians. See you all there! ! !

<h3>Hacker's Journal</h3> 
<p>By Brian Little

<p>	Welcome to my new article for the SPACE Newsletter. First of all, I'm not going to bore you to death with self-advertisements for my upcoming game, Haunted Nightmare. Instead, I'm planning on writing about the Atari 8-bit world, our club (and views on recent decisions), and bashing our nice big brother, the IBM and it's sad, sorry and sickening leader, Bill Gates (you know, the rich fag with how much money again).
<p>	This month, I'm going to discuss why I became an Atarian, plus my view of the BBS (Paul - I'll be on any day now). The reason why I became an Atarian is simple: Atari's cost less, have more programs, a great distributor (I bet Lance Ringquist is ginning by now), and a great Club. Even more so is because I can get more money off my titles in the Atari market, but the IBM market is so full of titles, l probably wouldn't even get a cent. Worse yet, the IBM is more complex (in other words, complicated and stupid).
Don't just take my word for it, ask any IBM programmer, like Larry Serflatten.
<p>	Another reason I became an Atarian is because of how unfair the IBM world has become. A walk through my local computer store left me very angry. You see, l happened to of found a copy of a hot new game, Wing Commander 4 (which is made by Origin Systems and the game producer is Chris Roberts, who made a couple of Atari Xl games, including Times of Lore). The system requirements are outrageous. My computer didn't even come close to them. I looked around even more, only to find somewhere around half of the great games won't run on my machine. But, the Atari will run almost all the games produced for the 8-bit, and any beginner can start producing their own games immediately. On the PC, you need to learn C or C++ to make games that look at least good.
<p>	To change the subject, I would like to input my opinion of the BBS. I personally love the BBS, and would be on it more often, but my parents moved the PC to an area where I couldn't reach a phone outlet. Now that I own an Atari, with a modem, I can jump on whenever. So my word to the Club members is to get on the BBS more often (I plan on it myself).
<p>	Finally, l would like to stop and give thanks to all the people who have made an impact on my life (or I have put one on theirs). My parents, Lance Ringquist, Larry Serflatten, Paul, Mr. Data, Charlie Johnson, Kathy Himes, Christina Nelson, Joelle Platt, Jason Ringquist, Wesley Ringquist, and all of you SPACE members who show up at every meeting (and figured out how to program the VCR for the X-Files).
<p>See you next month (April).

<p>Message #545 [Atari 8Bit - InterNet] <br>
From: Oscar Fowler Posted: 10 Mar 96, 23:32 <br>
Subj: Atari BBS List: 96-03-10 UPDATE <br>
From: oscar@primenet.com (Oscar Fowler) <br>
Subject: Atari BBS List: 96-03-10 UPDATE <br>
Organization: Sirius Cybernetics Corporation<br>

<p>	I've compiled the replies I received for my query on existing BBS's which support the Atari 8bit. The list is in 40-column format in order to accommodate those of us who will be using an 8bit to view it. I've removed "BBS" from the BBS names in order to conserve space.
<p>	Thanks to everyone who replied. Sorry that I haven't had a chance to reply personally to those of you who sent email. Please keep me informed with updates to the list and I'll post revisions as necessary. In particular, if one of the BBS's is within your local calling area, please give them a call and let me know whether they're currently operational. Also, I just found out (by reading the FAQ...) that Rick Detlefsen is putting together a BBS list as well. Does anyone know if he completed it? If so, we can just merge the two lists together.
<p>	The format of the individual entries is below. Note that each entry uses four lines. "Type" indicates the type of hardware used to run the board. "Status" is whether the board was up or not the last time it was checked, which was on the "status date". I assume the remaining fields are self-explanitory.<br>
