<center><b>Citizenship AmeriCorps Style</b></center>
<p>To the Editor:<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Contrary to John Walters ("<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/walt.html">Clinton's AmeriCorps Values</a>," Jan.-Feb. 1996), AmeriCorps is a successful program that reinvigorates the principle of citizenship. Consider AmeriCorps's work with Birmingham AIDS Outreach (BAO) in Birmingham, Alabama.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Birmingham has been hit disproportionately hard by the AIDS epidemic, particularly the black heterosexual community. Sufferers have gone without care and have been forced to go to emergency rooms -- at  the expense of the state -- for care that can easily be provided at home.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A proposal written by community organizations called for a team of individuals to provide in-home respite care for end-stage AIDS patients. Volunteers were needed to fill eight- to 10-hour shifts around the clock. The need overwhelmed an already substantial volunteer base, but volunteers from AmeriCorps answered the call.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The BAO/AmeriCorps program paid a living allowance to its volunteers for the same reason that elected officials are paid: They were providing a public service to our country. In doing so, volunteers incurred an opportunity cost that would have otherwise precluded them from volunteering. For example, several BAO participants were mothers who had worked their way off welfare and were trying to finance a college education.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The proposal was not written by bureaucrats but by a coalition of clergymen, citizens, nonprofit organizations, medical professionals, and businessmen. The local coalition designed its own policies and mechanisms concerning implementation and care delivery.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The BAO program will save state and the federal government close to $2 million over its initial investment by allowing patients to die at home rather than in a hospital at the expense of Medicaid. It is a clear example of the AmeriCorps mission: to build partnerships between public and private agencies in order to rebuild America.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a shame that Walters misunderstands the intentions behind the AmeriCorps program and the citizenship it embraces. While it would be nice if people could always solve their own problems, let's step off the ideological pedestal for a moment to realize that not everyone can. Citizens should be able to take care of one another in times of need. Feeding, bathing, and befriending a person dying of AIDS is neither a meaningless task nor a job deserving of only a meager living allowance, yet it has to be done. AmeriCorps makes it possible for people, welfare recipient and business executive alike, to do it -- to embrace true citizenship.<P>
<b>Kyle E. Kimball<br>Cambridge, Mass.</b><P><b>John Walters</b> responds:<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kimball assumes that just because AmeriCorps volunteers are doing good things that the program merits federal funding. A program that spends $500 million a year should produce results. But it is the unintended consequences of such programs that are often more significant -- witness the waste in the Medicaid program Kimball is proud to have corrected through his AmeriCorps program.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Good deeds would not disappear if federal funding for AmeriCorps were eliminated. What civic leaders may have accomplished with federal dollars in Birmingham, countless private, religious, and charitable groups throughout America are achieving without federal assistance. One lesson from Birmingham is clear: AmeriCorps has taught people at the grass roots to look to Washington -- not their local communities -- for assistance.<p><center><b>Common-Sense Criminology</b></center>
<p>To the Editor:<br>As a former public defender, I agree whole-heartedly with John J. DiIulio's argument in "<a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thiuli.html">Arresting Ideas</a>" (Fall 1995). If a criminal thinks he will be caught committing a crime, he will be less likely to commit that crime.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This law-breaking mentality lies within every reader. Do you accelerate when you are driving over the speed limit and spot a patrol car? If you don't, is it because you've just realized speeding is illegal or because you fear being caught?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the exception of psychopaths and the slow-witted, most people, including criminals, will not break the law if they think they will be caught. Criminals rely in part on sights and sounds when calculating the likelihood of their capture. A thug doesn't mug a person inside a police station, next to a patrol car, or when he hears a siren, even if it may be an ambulance.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, criminals weigh the benefits of committing a crime against the costs they will incur if caught. A criminal is more likely to pass a forged check for $50 than commit armed robbery in a homeless shelter. As the length of a criminal's potential incarceration increases, a criminal is less likely to commit a crime.<p>
<b>Dan Coburn<br>Hamilton College<br>Clinton, N.Y.</b><P><center><b>Incorporation Intended</b></center>
<P>To the Editor:<br>I read with great dismay Rep. Bob Dornan's view of the Constitution ("<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html#dornan">Preserve, Protect, Defend</a>," Jan.-Feb. 1996). Dornan articulates three constitutional fallacies which must be addressed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, Dornan's essay is entitled "Government by Judiciary." This title aptly describes Dornan's incorrect view that judicial action that protects the precious liberties and fundamental rights of American citizens is merely an intrusion upon the "rights" of politicians. But in reality it is the job of the judiciary to stand astride the political branches, and majorities in general, to ensure that their actions are consistent with the basic constitutional guarantees granted to each individual citizen. In the end, Dornan's diatribe merely inflames the base bigotry directed towards those citizens who have been forced to seek judicial protection for their most basic rights: women, racial minorities, religious dissenters, and homosexuals.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, Dornan asserts that the loss of federalism is the price America has paid for the end of slavery. This view presumes that federalism is incompatible with a structure of substantive constitutional restraint upon each level of government. Dornan apparently believes that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments repealed federalism. On the contrary, they perfected the American experiment by establishing the protection of individual rights as the primary responsibility of each level of government found in the federalist system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, Dornan concludes that the principle of incorporation should be repealed. What would this mean in practice? Well, consider that the Supreme Court has concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the protections of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments "against" the states. In practice, therefore, each state must respect such basic principles as free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Dornan's constitutional universe, however, states and localities would be free to infringe upon religious liberty, free speech, or any other rights protected by the principle of incorporation. That most states and localities would not choose to infringe upon these rights is immaterial; the mere fact that these political entities would be capable of doing so is tantamount to concluding that Americans would be slaves to their government.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Contrary to sentiments expressed by the mythmakers who oppose judicial protection for individual rights, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended the principle of incorporation to be expounded, and enforced, by the Supreme Court. Senator Howard, a Framer, declares that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections encompass "the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution" and that "the great objective" of the Fourteenth Amendment was to "compel [the states] at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In direct contrast to the false contentions of absolute-majoritarian state interventionists, Howard forcefully asserts that these protections "are secured to the citizen solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts." It is clear that the misguided advocates of absolute "judicial restraint" in areas of fundamental rights and liberties have blamed the messenger (judges) for the message (constitutional protection of individual rights).<P>
<b>Joe Mitchell<br>Virginia Polytechnic Institute<br>Blacksburg, Va.</b><p><center><b>Stigma, Not Spirit</b></center>
<p>To the Editor:<br>
In his <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Welcome"</a> to the new <I>Policy Review</I> (Jan.-Feb. 1996), Adam Meyerson says, "The root cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others." Maybe.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When children have little or no parental guidance it does not take a genius to expect trouble. When a delinquent is not reprehended, publicly rebuked, humiliated, recidivism can be expected.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The root cause of crime is the lack of stigma attached to it. Spirituality is not needed to lead a moral life.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;You want your new format to build a bridge to liberals whose policies have failed. This is like trying to run a business by committee. If conservatives have the guts and wisdom to find new approaches to adult and juvenile crime, let them stand up and be counted. Nothing works better than success.
<p><b>James L. Robson<br>LaBelle, Fla.</b><p><center><b>Kind Words</b></center><p>
To the Editor:<br>
Bravo for adopting a "historic new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship" in the newly designed <I>Policy Review</I> (<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Welcome,"</a> Jan.-Feb.). We are at a crossroads, or maybe close to a point of no return, having lost our sense of citizenship and our understanding of rights and responsibilities. Historians will look at the past 30 years and wonder how a nation founded on the principles of Washington and Jefferson -- how "one nation, under God" --  could have become so depraved.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current films based on the writings of Jane Austen remind us how far we have come from common sense and decency. It is wonderful to see these films well-attended and observe young people who seem to wonder how we have strayed so far.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The time is ripe. Thank you for supporting the American family with educational material and examples of people taking positive steps to make a difference for all of us. Our children are searching for role models, and you can provide them.<p>
<b>Joseph B. Famme<br>Arlington, Va.</b><p>To the Editor:<br>
I am writing to compliment you on the Jan.-Feb. issue of <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>. I particularly enjoyed your <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">presidential symposium</a> ("Preserve, Protect & Defend"). For the last 50 years, too many people have come to believe that the president's responsibility to the Constitution consists of appointing conscientious judges to the bench. That is only one part of the executive's responsibility. The president should also use the bully pulpit to fight for his constitutional vision, veto unconstitutional bills, and refuse to enforce unconstitutional legislation that is already on the books. That is what the oath of office is all about!<p>
<b>Timothy Lynch<br><a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a><br>Washington, D.C.</b><P>To the Editor:<br>I have been a reader of <I>Policy Review</I> for more than a year. I recently received the Jan.-Feb. 1996 issue and enjoy the new format and content.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Its <a href="/heritage/p_review/prstate.html">"Statement of Purpose"</a> and <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Letter to Our Readers"</a> excite me and give me hope. We all know that our government, in its desire to help, has grown to hurt -- that "we the people" need to do it better through the wonderful liberties of our Constitution.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This publication is needed. I look forward to the wealth of information future issues will surely contain.<p>

<b>Private-Sector Conservation</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For decades, liberals have assumed that only action by the 
federal government can protect the environment and have argued that conservatives care little about 
environmental issues. Last December, the <a href="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise 
Institute</a> launched its new <b>Center for Private Conservation</b> to set the record straight. The 
center aims to publicize private-sector efforts to conserve the environment. To this end, it will publish case 
studies of private conservation and analyze how legal and social institutions either assist or hinder private 
individuals and communities pursuing environmental agendas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CEI Senior Environmental Scholar <b>Robert J. Smith</b> 
will supervise the project. In January, CPC reissued Smith's <i>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by 
Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife</i> and published CEI research associate <b>Michael De 
Alessi</b>'s <i>Emerging Technologies and the Private Stewardship of Marine Resources</i>. Smith 
and De Alessi, who oversees the day-to-day operations at CPC, argue that depletion of fisheries and other 
natural resources can be combatted by entrusting these resources to private ownership. CPC events and 
publications can be tracked in the CEI newsletter, <i>UpDate</i>.

<b>A Report Card on Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For years, education reformers have called for independent 
assessments of public schools to enable parents to hold educators accountable for poor performance. 
Colorado has become perhaps the first state to deliver. <b>The Parent Information Center of the 
Independence Institute</b> in Golden, Colorado, monitors 176 school districts and 2,000 schools 
throughout the state. On the basis of standardized test scores, graduation rates, attendance levels, and other 
indicators, the center formulates report cards that evaluate schools and school districts. Parents can also 
receive general info on education issues like the pros and cons of phonics-based language education.

<b>Innovations in Government</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Boston's <b>Pioneer Institute for Public Policy 
Research</b> recently announced the nine winners of its fifth annual Better Government Competition, 
"Local Solutions to Public Problems." Among them: <b>William H. Mellor</b> and <b>John E. 
Kramer</b> of D.C-based Institute for Justice offered model legislation to deregulate the Boston taxicab 
market; Houston constable <b>Victor Trevino</b> reduced the crime rate in his Houston precinct by 36 
percent in three years by deploying 300 officer-volunteers (see <i>Policy Review</i>, Spring 1994); 
Indianapolis mayor <b>Stephen Goldsmith</b> has saved $18 million since 1992 by allowing city 
employees to bid for public contracts on an equal basis with private contractors.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The competition aims to elicit innovative solutions to public-
policy problems. Since it began, think tanks in Arizona, California, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Canada, and Great Britain have imitated the program. The competition's theme for 1996: "Criminal 
Justice."

announced the launch of the <B>Parents' Television Council</B> and the release of the <i>1995-96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>. Jones is the honorary cochairperson of PTC, a division of 
<b>Media Research Center</b>, in Alexandria, Virginia. The <i>1995-96 Family Guide to Prime Time 
Television</i> assesses the suitability of prime-time television shows on all the broadcast networks for 
viewers of all ages. It does not evaluate programs for artistic merit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each review offers a summary of the show's themes and a 
traffic-light icon. A green light (e.g., The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) stands for "family-friendly," a yellow 
light (ER) warns of adult themes, and shows given a prohibitive red light (Beverly Hills, 90210) are judged 
unsuitable for children. Programs that showcase loving families, affirm traditional values like hard work 
and honesty, treat religion seriously, promote sex in the context of a loving marriage only, and frown on 
obscenity and promiscuity are likely to be designated family-friendly.

<b>Entertainment Monitor</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What kind of songs do Smashing Pumpkins sing? What does 
it mean when today's music artists want to "blaze up a stack"? For anyone lost in the maze of popular 
music's artists and language, <i>Entertainment Monitor</i> offers some guidance.

<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>Entertainment Monitor</i>, a monthly publication of 
California-based <b>Entertainment Information Services</b>, is nonpartisan, nonreligious, and does not 
make judgements about the music it describes. The mag recounts the story lines and themes of top-40 
albums and translates the slang they contain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <i>Monitor</i> tells us, for example, that Tha Dogg 
Pound's album, Dogg Food, is a collection of 17 rap and "gangsta rap" songs; that in one track, "I Don't 
Like to Dream About Getting Paid," the artist talks about leaving a regular job to make more money and 
attract more women by selling drugs; and that to "blaze up a stack" means to smoke marijuana.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each album review is coded for content: "S" for sex; "V" for 
violence; "D" for drugs; "L" for potentially offensive language; and "SL" for potentially offensive slang. 
Songs that contain many profanities and a great deal of slang are quoted at length. The magazine also 
covers movies and television programs.

income Americans who have risen above adversity to improve their lives and their communities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before the dinner, NCNE will host a conference entitled "From

<b>How Far Have We Come?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In <i>To Empower People: From State to Civil Society</i>, 
published in 1977, <b>Peter L. Berger and Richard John Neuhaus</b> argued that "mediating 
institutions" --  defined as "those institutions standing between the individual in his private life and the 
large institutions of public life" --  could provide welfare services more effectively than big government. 
The <b>American Enterprise Institute</b> recently reissued this text, along with commentaries by 11 
distinguished scholars and a response by Berger and Neuhaus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gulf between presidential rhetoric and administration 
policy is a primary theme here. "Every president from 1968 to the present," write <b>Michael S. 
Joyce</b> and <b>William A. Schambra</b>, has promised "to reinvigorate states, small communities, 
and civil society's intermediate associations." But even the Reagan administration, contends  <b>James P. 
Pinkerton</b>, abandoned "the self-help ethos that Berger and Neuhaus had identified as the key to 
successful mediating institutions." One reason for this abandonment is that "the old paradigm of the 
welfare state continues to haunt the political discourse. . . . Intellectual habits die as slowly as other 
habits." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even when big government tries to encourage mediating 
institutions, it often undermines them. <b>Marvin Olasky</b> recounts the sad transformation of 
<b>HOBO (Helping Our Brothers Out)</b>, a religious charity that was successful in helping the 
homeless until it accepted government funds. By forcing HOBO to abandon its ministry as a condition of 
the aid, the government robbed it of its effectiveness. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Does this mean that government should leave mediating 
institutions alone? <b>Michael J. Horowitz</b> believes so, but <a 
href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> and <b>Douglas Besharov</b> think that 
government has a more positive role to play, provided that "mediating structures are an outgrowth of the 
individuals who comprise discrete communities and should always be dependent on these individuals for 
their continued existence." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All the contributors endorse a devolution of power to society's 
"little platoons." Michael Novak: "If the 20th century unfolded under the sign of the state, pictured as a 
beneficent mother sheltering her children at her bosom, the 21st century is likelier to see a rebirth of the 
idea of freedom, in communities of men and women eager to practice self-government both in their private 
and their public lives." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i> To Empower People: From State to Civil Society, Michael 
Novak, ed. (AEI Press).</i>
<p>

<b>Why Government Shouldn't Fund Charities (excerpt)</b>
<p>
<b>1. Direct government funding of social welfare agencies (including mediating structures) 
is likely to create the wrong winners and losers.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The process is analogous to establishing an industrial 
policy: that is, government tries to pick the best service provider (instead of the best manufacturer, 
for example). Unfortunately, governmental decisions are less likely to be correct than are the 
cumulative decisions of thousands, or millions, of consumers. Worse, once government funding 
begins, political pressures make it almost impossible to end support. Thus, in his research on the 
differences between private and government support for start-up companies, Allan Meltzer found 
that private decision makers were more successful because they were more likely to abandon an 
obviously unsuccessful project than was the government. In other words, government is not 
capable of performing the key aspect of good decision making: creating losers. Many Head Start 
providers, for example, were chosen for reasons having little to do with their ability to care for 
children -- and many others continue to be funded even though they are pale reflections of their 
former selves.
<p>
<b>2. Direct government funding of social welfare agencies can alter the nature of their 
services and raise their costs.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When government chooses the service (or agency) 
for clients, it often imposes costly quality standards on the it. Since government tends to impose 
regulatory standards with less regard for whether they result in a better service than do individuals 
(who must pay for the service out of their own pockets), government-supported services tend to be 
more expensive than those that individuals purchase themselves. And government often decides 
that it knows how to provide the service better than the actual provider, so that it often requires 
even successful providers to alter their programs. No better example of this two-sided dynamic 
exists than the quality-cost differentials between publicly and privately-funded child care.
<p>
<b>3. Direct government funding often requires mediating structures to abandon the very 
features, like religious activities, that make them effective.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, the government, through its police power, 
always has the authority to regulate the activities of mediating structures even when not giving 
them money (subject to various but limited constitutional constraints such as the right to the free 
exercise of religion). But the temptation to attach requirements to the behavior of mediating 
structures -- and the political support for doing so -- is greatly increased when there is direct 
funding. After all, goes the argument, the money is public money and must be spent in accordance 
with the "public trust."

<b>Test of Faith</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There is no group more unfairly caricatured than today's 
religious conservatives," writes <b>Karl Zinsmeister</b>, the editor of the <i>American Enterprise</i>. 
Far from being an intolerant minority trying to force its values on the larger society, Zinsmeister argues 
that religious Americans have launched a "defensive offensive" against an aggressive secularism that has 
attempted -- often successfully -- to exclude traditional believers from the public arena.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To help set the record straight, Zinsmeister devotes an entire 
issue of his magazine to a group portrait of the religious right. <b>Doug Bandow</b> describes the 
"parallel universe" of educational institutions, publishing houses, news channels, philanthropic groups, 
and political organizations developed by religious Christians. <b>Fred Barnes</b> looks at the 
"Orthodox Alliance" of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious conservatives whose goals, he writes, 
"are cultural and political, not religious." <b>Dale Buss</b> examines the poor coverage religion gets 
from mainstream media, and <b>Michael McConnell</b> analyzes the movement for religious rights.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Religious conservatism is put into historical perspective by 
two distinguished scholars. Intellectual historian <b>Gertrude Himmelfarb</b> compares today's 
Christian men's movement, <b>Promise Keepers</b>, to the 18th-century "open-air meetings where the 
Wesley brothers preached and gained converts." <b>Robert W. Fogel</b> calls the current religious 
ferment the "fourth Great Awakening," and offers thumbnail sketches of the three earlier "cycles of 
religiosity" in American history.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In all, the issue profiles 40 Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and 
Muslim religious conservatives. What emerges from this "focus group in print" is that for most members 
of the religious right, devotion to God and "helping others" are two sides of the same coin.

<b>Religion and the Democrats</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Politics absent religion and morals, argues <b>Joel 
Kotkin</b>, senior fellow with the <b>Pepperdine University Institute for Public Policy</b>, is 
nothing more than power mongering. Before secular liberalism, religion played an essential role in 
American politics. In Tocqueville's America, it trained citizens to use and not abuse freedom. In the mid-
1800s and the mid-1900s, religion furnished civil-rights causes with their guiding principles and moral 
authority. Indeed, religion has been the fuel of progressivism in America. It would be today, Kotkin argues, 
if only we would let it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The solutions to the problems of the inner city lie in its black 
churches. They do more to alleviate urban plight than the government ever has. Kotkin argues that liberals 
should build on their success, reconnecting reform efforts to religious principles and institutions. "Sensible 
policies to foster this change," he says, "would include regulatory reform in urban areas, tax incentives, 
larger write-offs for charitable giving, and the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of many social 
services from government to nonprofit, community, and church-based organizations."

<b>Where Virtue Grows</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Democracy, argues <b>Mary Ann Glendon</b> in 
<i>Seedbeds of Virtue: Sources of Competence, Character and Citizenship in American Society</i>, 
requires "a higher degree of virtue in its citizens than any other form of government." But the critical 
problem of maintaining our democratic regime by fostering virtue has all too often been neglected by 
political theorists. The current volume, a collection of 13 scholarly essays, "aims to place that forgotten 
problem at the front and center of American public deliberation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 According to <b>James Q. Wilson</b>, "the West has 
irrevocably cast its lot with a culture that makes it easy, and seemingly natural, for the individual to 
triumph over the group." By contrast, "Islam and Confucianism are alike in elevating the collectivity over 
the individual," and believe that, in a century or two, "their way will be proved superior."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wilson emphatically disagrees: "As costly as its embrace may 
be, freedom is man's universal hope; its defense, his steady preoccupation." But for freedom not to 
devolve into lawlessness, "all of us, but especially the intellectuals, [must] recognize that the exercise of 
freedom presupposes the maintenance of a natural moral order that deserves respect and reaffirmation, an 
order that arises from the familial seedbeds of virtue." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For <b>William A. Galston</b>, the defense of freedom 
requires political theorists to start taking words like "virtue" and "character" seriously again. 
Unfortunately, "For two generations scholarly inquiry has been dominated by the belief that the liberal 
polity does not require individual virtue."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By contrast, Galston believes that "to an extent difficult to 
measure but impossible to ignore, the viability of liberal society depends on its ability to engender a 
virtuous citizenry." And the institution charged by the liberal democratic order with "the formation of 
character, including public character," is the family. "It follows," says Galston, "that if families become 
less capable of performing that role, the well-being of the entire community is jeopardized.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But <b>David Popenoe</b> argues that the decline of 
families is related to the decline of neighborhoods and communities. "To help restore social virtue," 
Popenoe concludes, "we as a nation should seek to protect and cultivate natural communities, preferably 
along residential lines. As individuals, we should seek to stay married, stay accessible to our children, stay 
active in our local communities, and stay put." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To strengthen natural communities, <b>David 
Blankenhorn</b> urges the government to adopt "a strategy explicitly based on restoring the institutions 
of the civil society." The "centerpiece" of such a strategy should be strengthening the institution of 
marriage. And when public policy proposals are debated, the first question to be asked should be, "Will 
this policy strengthen or weaken the institutions of civil society?"

<h2>WHAT WORKS</h2></a>

<b>Growth of the Grass Roots</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In <i>Revolution at the Roots: Making Our Government 
Smaller, Better, and Closer to Home</i>, <b>William D. Eggers</b> and <b>John O'Leary</b> assert 
that today's political climate is truly revolutionary. "The overarching aim of the current bottom-up 
revolution is to reduce, rather than expand, the size and scope of government." This reduction will be 
achieved by devolving authority from the federal government to local government and by devolving 
responsibility from local government to individuals, families, churches, and voluntary associations -- what 
Eggers and O'Leary describe as the "third pillar" or the "little platoons" of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors examine the devolution revolution as it applies to 
policing, welfare, economic development, and education. They discuss, for example, how one division of 
the San Diego police department has reduced crime by deploying 175 community volunteers -- 115 of 
whom are senior citizens -- to collect evidence, take crime reports, and check on the homes of vacationing 
residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wisconsin's <b>"Work Not Welfare"</b> program slashed 
welfare rolls 17 percent in the two counties it was implemented in 1994 by requiring welfare recipients to 
work while on welfare and terminating cash benefits after two years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <b>Salvation Army</b> shelter in Bell, California, 
moved 113 of its 165 boarders into jobs in 1993 by prohibiting sex, alcohol, and even provocative clothing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since <b>Mayor Stephen Goldsmith</b> eliminated nearly 
all of Indianapolis's taxicab regulations in May 1994, the number of taxicab companies has nearly doubled 
from 28 to 52 (all of which are minority or women-owned), fares have tumbled seven percent, and not one 
customer complaint has been registered with the city.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, 25 percent of the students at the <b>Marcus Garvey 
School</b> in South Central Los Angeles are on public assistance, yet at a cost of $3,600, this private 
school has pre-schoolers memorizing the 50 states, second-graders reading from college textbooks, and 
sixth-graders beginning on calculus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors conclude that devolution's success ultimately 
depends on America's citizens -- the depositories of devolved authority and responsibility.

<p>
<b>What Comes After</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A book by the <b>Hudson Institute</b> profiles 16 
programs "that shun the governmentalist mindset and instead take a civic-sector approach to homelessness, 
drug addiction, poverty, illiteracy, illegitimacy, crime and health care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One Texas woman marshals dozens of volunteers, six 
refrigerators, four freezers, two stoves, and a $375,000 budget to deliver 20,000 sandwiches a month to 
needy Houston youth.  <b>Friends for Life</b>, a Waco-based organization that employs just 4 people 
(but enlists 4,000 volunteers) provides 8,000 abandoned and ailing senior citizens with legal, personal, and 
emergency assistance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <b>Austin Street Shelter</b> provides the homeless of 
Dallas, Texas, 100,000 beds a year at a cost of $3.19 per person per night. The shelter treats the soul as 
well, encouraging visitors to participate in Bible study classes it offers and offering residents incentives to 
secure jobs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Clean and Sober Streets</b>, located in the heart of 
Washington, D.C., frees 80 percent of its residents of drug and alcohol addictions through a strict and 
regimented treatment program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New York City-based <b>Student/Sponsor Partnership, 
Inc</b>., enables 929 disadvantaged students to enroll in neighborhood Catholic schools by enlisting 
sponsor-mentors to foot the bill. In a city where the high school graduation rate does not break 40 percent, 
76 percent of SSP participants graduate in four years and 90 percent go on to college.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Denver-based <b>Friends First</b> led a revolt in Colorado 
education by instituting an abstinence-centered sex-education program at 35 schools last year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly all of these programs funnel 80 percent or more of 
privately funded budgets directly to their beneficiaries. "Instead of viewing government as the primary 
provider of services," write the authors, "we should first look to private sources: families, churches, 
charities, community development corporations, foundations, and businesses."

<b>Crime and Religion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 1985 and 1992, the murder rate increased 50 percent 
for white males and 300 percent for black males. By 2005, the number of males in this age group will have 
risen 25 percent overall and 50 percent for blacks. Since six percent of males in this age group commit 50 
percent of the crime the group commits, we can expect that an additional 500,000 male 14 to 17-year-olds 
in the year 2000 will produce 30,000 more murderers, rapists, and muggers. And each generation of 
criminal youth seems more dangerous than the previous one. Today we fear Crips and Bloods and embrace 
memories of Sharks and Jets. What should we do about the coming wave of juvenile "super-predators"?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"My one big idea is . . . religion," writes <b>John J. DiIulio 
Jr.</b> Citing studies that demonstrate how religion immunizes youth against crime, DiIulio argues that 
public funds should be used to empower local religious institutions to act as safe-havens, provide adoption 
services, offer substance-abuse treatment, run day-care centers, and handle the youngest nonviolent 
offenders. And what about the reaction this policy prescription promises to elicit from ACLU-types? "Let 
them argue church-state issues all the way to the next funeral of an innocent kid caught in the crossfire," 
DiIulio writes.

with 130 chapters around the country, helps 70 to 86 percent of its participants free themselves of drugs 
and alcohol forever. But the state had tried to shut the group down because it would not hire state-licensed 
counselors or offer state-approved classroom courses. (State-approved treatment is 24 times costlier and 
has a success rate in the single digits).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a later issue of <i>World</i>, the authors report that 
<b>Governor George W. Bush</b> intervened on Teen Challenge's behalf, postponing a shutdown until 
he introduced legislation to allow faith-based charities to seek certification from a nongovernmental 
agency. In November, Teen Challenge reached an agreement with the state: While the state revoked Teen 
Challenge's license, it also agreed to allow Teen Challenge to remain open as long as it adheres to its now 
state-approved program.

<b>Academic Value of Family Values</b>
<p>

his family than by any other variable, even school, writes <b>William R. Mattox</b> of the <a 
href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council.</a> Poor or rich, single-parent or two-parent, families 
of all stripes enhance academic performance by establishing daily family routines, monitoring out-of-
school activities like TV viewing, setting high expectations, rewarding success, helping with homework, 
maintaining teacher contact, facilitating access to community resources like the public library, and 
stimulating reading and writing at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mattox offers four prescriptions. First, "parental 
involvement" must mean more than participating in the local PTA; it means hands-on educating by 
parents. Second, parent engagement, not economic efficiency, is the greatest benefit to school choice. 
Third, Americans must look beyond our classroom-based and district-dictated education system; 21st-
century schooling will take place in a more interactive setting where parents have a greater role in making 
education decisions. Finally, tuition tax credits are superior to vouchers because they are more fungible.

<h2>CAUTIONARY TALES</h2></a>

<b>In Defense of the Flophouse</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	New York Times</i> columnist <b>John Tierney</b> spent 
an evening among New York City's poor, huddled masses at the White House Hotel, a flophouse on New 
York City's famed Bowery. He was surprised by what he found: For $10, this "lodging house" provides a 
clean, safe, and warm place to stay. Tierney was also astonished that this very effective shelter for the 
homeless is being threatened by do-gooder liberalism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Revolted by the idea that someone could make money from 
housing the homeless, New York politicians have passed legislation that prevents the formation of new 
flophouses and squeezes existing flophouses and single-room-occupancy hotels out of business through 
overregulation. Most recently, a court decision in a lawsuit initiated by legal services extended the city's 
rent regulations to lodging houses, making it more difficult for renters to expel dangerous and menacing 
residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The result: Flophouses, which provide residents better 
accommodations than city shelters at one-fifth the price, have become endangered. Meanwhile, the waiting 
list for public housing has 127,000 names.

<b>Second Thoughts on Devolution</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you favor returning power and authority to state and local 
governments, <b>Clint Bolick</b> suggests you consider Alexandria, Virginia. The city of 116,000 is 
administered by 74 boards, commissions, committees, task forces, and authorities. Businesses that want to 
locate there must file upwards of 16 permits and pay as many as six different taxes. Excluding schools, 
Alexandria employs more people per capita than Los Angeles, Chicago, or San Diego.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And what about schools? Alexandria spends $10,000 per 
student on a system that employs as many people outside the classroom as it does inside and whose high-
school students achieve mediocre test scores. Bolick concludes that "states and cities are just another form 
of big government." What's more, "they touch ordinary Americans in ways far more personal and 
meaningful than the national government." Bolick's answer: If you really want to be devolutionary, give 
power to individuals and the communities they construct.

<b>Should Charities Live Forever?</b>

<i>Philanthropy</i>, <b>James L. Payne</b> counsels against it. Endowments are inefficient and 
debilitating. They enable some nonprofits to outlive the demand for their services, and more importantly, 
they remove the incentive nonprofits have to remain frugal and innovative. Payne's premise is that the 
small, independent, and usually struggling charities conservatives herald are successful precisely because 
they are "underfunded."

<h2>Rediscovering Religion</h2>
<p>
	Religion, it seems, has suddenly seized a prominent position in debates over values, culture, and 
public 
policy. In response, FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> 
examined recent social-science literature on the benefits of religious belief and observance. He recently 
published his findings in a Heritage paper, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">"Why Religion Matters: The Impact of Religious Practice on Social Stability."</a>
<p> 
	Among the apparent benefits of religious observance on society: Both strong marriages and strong 
families are closely linked to regular church attendance; regular churchgoers in the inner city tend to move 
out of poverty; moral judgment is massively strengthened; and regular practice of religion tends to 
immunize people against suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, divorce, and other problems. 
Religious belief reduces the incidence of depression, raises self-esteem, and helps repair the social and 
psychological damage caused by drug addiction and marital breakdown. It appears even to be associated 
with longevity, reduced cardiovascular diseases, and faster recovery from injuries. Fagan quotes 
psychologist Allen Bergin: "Some religious influences have a modest impact, whereas another portion 
seems like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy." (<a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html"><I>Backgrounder No. 1064</I></a>)
<p>
<h2>Baltimore II</h2>
<p>
	In a follow-up to their December 1994 orientation session in Baltimore for 65 congressional 
freshmen, 
The Heritage Foundation and Empower America sponsored the "1996 Congressional Advance," a one-day 
conference for freshman and sophomore members of the 104th Congress.
<P>
	The second Baltimore conference took place January 25-26, 1996, and explored issues vital to the 
second legislative session of the 104th Congress. Featured speakers included Heritage Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; Robert Woodson, the president of the National 
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise; and Al Dunlap, the former CEO of Scott Paper Co.
<p>
<h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<P>
	John Hood, a 1994-95 Bradley Fellow at Heritage and a regular contributor to the <a href="bless.html">"Blessings of Liberty"</a> column in <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American 
Citizenship</I>, has written the conservative answer to the corporate social responsibility movement. In 
his book <I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good</I>, to be published in June by the 
Free Press, Hood tracks the successes of business in such areas of social concern as environmental 
protection, workplace and product safety, family values, education reform, and the revitalization of inner 
cities. Hood shows that companies make a greater contribution to society through innovation in goods and 
services than through their philanthropy. Hood is now the president of the John Locke Foundation in 
Raleigh, North Carolina.
<p>
<h2>Welfare and Medicare</h2>
<p>
	In a recent <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1063.html">Backgrounder</a>, 
"Why 
Congress Must Reform Welfare," <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a>, a senior policy 
analyst at Heritage, shows:
<P><ul>
<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC have already spent, on average, six and a half years 
on welfare; 
<p>
<li>When past and estimated future AFDC benefits are combined, the average length of stay on AFDC 
among those families currently receiving benefits is 13 years; 
<p>
<li>Among the families currently receiving AFDC, more than 90 percent will spend more than two years 
on the AFDC rolls.
</ul><p>
	Rector also discusses recent research by June O'Neill, the director of the Congressional Budget 
Office, 
showing that spending long periods of time on welfare may reduce a child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. 
Rector writes that the more welfare income a family receives during a boy's childhood, the lower the boy's 
earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical nonwelfare income. (<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1063.html"><I>Backgrounder No. 1063</I></a>)
<p>
	In <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html">"Reforming Medicare: What Congress Can Learn from the Health Plans of America's Corporations</a>," Brenda Fitzgerald profiles the 
innovative ways that private corporations have cut costs in employee medical coverage while improving 
the quality of care. Fitzgerald, a clinical professor at Emory University, describes several successful 
private-sector health-care innovations and concludes that markets provide the best service at the best price, 
if they are characterized by choice, information, and competition. (<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html"><I>Backgrounder No. 1059</I></a>)

<h2>Church Without State</h2>
<b>By John G. West Jr.</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in the United States in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were "forever forming associations." Instead of looking to the government for help, public-spirited citizens sought to solve societal problems on their own. Tocqueville may not have realized that this national enthusiasm for "associations" was largely of recent vintage. Although Americans had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations did not occur until the second decade of the 19th century.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps no one deserves more credit for creating this culture of volunteerism than Lyman Beecher (1775-1863). Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, the elder Beecher was a powerful minister and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues commented, "In massive talent, Lyman Beecher stood among his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate -- alone."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As a young clergyman in the early 1800s, Beecher confronted a society in crisis. Church attendance was dropping, and alcoholism and other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. Elected officials were increasingly reluctant to enforce morality or piety by law, and there was growing support in the political sphere for abolishing tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism in New England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry depended on religion. In the absence of established churches and direct state support for religion, he feared the worst. But instead of despairing, he responded brilliantly: If the government would no longer support religion directly, the religious adherents themselves had to do whatever the government could not. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling people to "support the gospel and attend the public worship of God," Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. "But these means of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians, and by all classes of the community who love their country."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher advocated replacing government support for religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute. In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations would seek to create a political consensus through educational efforts. In a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During his career, Beecher held four pastorates -- in Long Island, New York; Litchfield, Connecticut; Boston; and Cincinnati -- and traveled the Northeast and West speaking not only in churches but also at revival and reform meetings. His widely circulated sermons and tracts helped inspire evangelicals to organize scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and social and political reform. They formed groups to help alleviate poverty, teach reading and writing to the poor, and prevent alcohol abuse. Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of the Sabbath. The many private associations of the era transformed American society in a way that few government programs could.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"They say ministers have lost their influence," Beecher wrote years later. "The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence than ever they could" have with state support. He had learned through experience that the free-enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish. Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state as beneficial to true religion. But at the time, they tended to view religion as a private matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher's unique contribution was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once direct state support of churches had ended.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even as Beecher championed Christianity's civic role, however, he keenly appreciated the limits of religious activism and recognized the dangers that politicking posed for Christianity. The political ambitions of some activists could easily overwhelm the message of the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher advised Christians to confine their political efforts to the "great questions of national morality" and avoid formulating an explicitly Christian position on every political issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During our own era, when questions are again being raised about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might learn from Beecher's free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion in public life.

<CENTER><B>Daniel Casse on Lamar Alexander</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT></B>amar Alexander is an unorthodox, populist, and persuasive Republican
leader. That is why I gladly moved from Washington to Nashville
to work on his presidential campaign, and why I believe he will
be the party's nominee in 1996. 

<P>
Our legislative branch's leadership
of national government is a temporary (albeit fascinating) phenomenon.
But we need our next president to set the agenda, not take his
cues from Congress. Conservatives should be looking for a candidate
who can present a bold design for government along with the ability
to execute it. 

<P>
Lamar Alexander has the imagination, energy, and
executive background to do both. The major themes of his campaign-growth,
freedom, and personal responsibility-are indisputably conservative.
But what distinguishes him is his unorthodox approach to politics,
his populist style of governance, and his skills of persuasion.


<P>
<B>Unorthodox.</B> In 1978, Alexander was elected governor of Tennessee,
only the third Republican to win that office this century. Nothing
that followed was typical, either. He began his crusade to improve
Tennessee's pitiful public-school system by introducing merit
pay and master teachers, relatively radical notions that weakened
the teacher unions. The National Education Association fought
him vigorously. He ignored warnings that it was hopeless, fought
back, and won. 

<P>
Alexander broke new ground on other issues. At
a time when most governors were using state airplanes to fly to
Washington, Alexander closed Tennessee's D.C. office altogether.
He chided other governors for behaving like senators. As early
as 1981, he advised President Reagan to end the federal role in
education. Four years later, he called two relatively unknown
congressmen named Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and invited them
to join a small group of GOP governors to plot a united strategy
for second stage of the Reagan Revolution. 

<P>
He showed the same
verve when he arrived at the Department of Education in 1991.
By then, the intellectual excitement of the Bill Bennett years
had passed, and the Bush administration's school-choice agenda
amounted to little more than photo-ops with local education activists.
Alexander understood that school choice-despised by country-club
Republicans and misunderstood by most suburbanites-was at risk
of becoming a political loser. His &quot;America 2000&quot; program
was a true grass-roots initiative that breathed life into education
reform. Conventional wisdom dubbed it a quirky agenda that offered
little federal legislation. But it tapped into a decentralization
movement that remains the only path to school choice. His 1992
school-choice bill was a true voucher program for public, private,
and parochial schools, but the Democrats in Congress made sure
it never came to a vote. 

<P>
<B>Populist.</B> Alexander's well-publicized
assault on Congress-&quot;cut their pay and send them home&quot;-is
no mere slogan. It reveals his deep sympathy with the populism
that has justifiably become the bedrock of conservative politics.
An unapologetic champion of term limits, he sincerely believes
that a citizen legislature would transform the character of the
federal government. With none of Ross Perot's demagoguery, Alexander
offers a mature, but no less revolutionary, brand of popular discontent
with government in Washington. 

<P>
While some Republicans still waver
on the wisdom of block grants, Alexander is advancing the idea
both philosophically and practically. He suggests ending the federal
role in education, welfare, and job training altogether. He applauded
the Supreme Court decision striking down the 1990 Gun-Free Schools
Zone Act, an attempt to federalize local responsibility that every
GOP senator supported. &quot;We know what to do&quot; is the central
tenet of his populist conservative political theory, which holds
that Americans should be given the freedom to make decisions about
their own lives. Although every Republican will offer bromides
about &quot;states' rights&quot; or &quot;new federalism&quot;
during the coming months, Alexander's own policy prescriptions
suggest a fully conceived populist vision.

<P>
<B>Persuasive.</B> If conservatives
are to remake government, we must do more than merely express
support for conservative ideas. We must also win over others not
fully in our camp. It didn't take much leadership to point out
that the Clinton health-care plan was a socialistic fantasy. The
political challenge was to convince half the nation-including
many Democrats-that the Clinton plan was bad medicine. 

<P>
The job
of president is almost entirely about setting a principled agenda
and then persuading the country of its wisdom. Alexander's public
career has prepared him to do just that. As governor, he led a
Democratic legislature toward his goals. When 38 governors competed
to get GM's Saturn division to build its plant in their states,
Tennessee won, in part because Alexander convinced the company's
executives that a right-to-work state with school choice, merit
pay, and no income tax was the best environment for business.
No tax breaks were involved. 

<P>
As the chairman of the National Governors
Association, he transformed its agenda by convincing fellow members-including
Bill Clinton, John Sununu, Dick Thornburgh, and Michael Dukakis-that
they should end their obsession with Washington issues and focus
on state matters instead. 

<P>
A president who is at once unorthodox,
populist, and persuasive will quickly establish a very different
type of presidency. But that is exactly what conservatives and
libertarians should be looking for next year.The danger we face
is that, with an irreparably damaged president in the White House,
Republicans will try to coast to victory in 1996 on a poll-driven
platform of GOP boilerplate.  Alexander will offer none of that
blandness. He governed Tennessee in the 1980s in much the same
way that Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson and Michigan's John Engler
govern in the 1990s. True, his view of the role of the federal
government may be at odds with much of established Washington.
But it is a view understood and applauded around the country.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paul Gottfried on Patrick Buchanan</B></CENTER>
<P>
The announcement by Pat Buchanan of his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination has done more to change the Republican
race than has the entry of any other candidate. More than any
other contender, Buchanan represents the populist right and has
fought all of its enemies. He has tangled with the liberal media;
the gay, feminist, and civil-rights lobbies; and the corporate
economic interests allied with big government. He has also dished
out, in his provocative speeches and blistering columns, fully
as much as he has taken. There is a certain bulldog tenacity about
him that even his bitterest opponents acknowledge. When Buchanan
believes he has been unfairly attacked, he stands his ground,
and he shows as much civility or incivility to his critics as
they display toward him. In 1992, I thought that he should have
done more to defuse accusations of being anti-Jewish, a charge
that plagued him particularly after he had linked support for
the Gulf War to the activities of Israel's &quot;amen corner.&quot;
But Buchanan would not apologize for what he--and others, including
commentators Michael Kinsley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner-took to be
a false charge. As he told his Jewish advisers, he would not dignify
a &quot;libel&quot; charge by responding to it. 

<P>No, I do not always
agree with Buchanan's positions, but they are honestly stated
and consistently held. Unlike senators Gramm and Dole, he has
not waffled on affirmative action or aid to illegal aliens, which
Buchanan has always opposed. And like Alan Keyes, but unlike most
of the other Republican candidates, he is genuinely opposed to
abortion. 

<P>
Equally important to me are the populist themes that
resonate in his campaigns. In the Wall Street Journal in 1993,
Irving Kristol predicted the inevitable success of a national
leader carrying out Buchanan's ideas. Buchanan's passionate concerns-violent
crime, immigration controls, the disintegration of morals, and
the disappearing jobs of American workers-are now, according to
Kristol, widely shared. New York cabdrivers, even those from the
Third World, express most of these concerns with equal vehemence.
Kristol is no friend of Buchanan or his candidacy, but he does
recognize the timeliness of his populist themes-and the foolishness
of those who would resist them. 

<P>
Buchanan belongs to a movement
that is also sweeping Europe. In Italy, Austria, and Germany,
there is a surging populist protest against capricious public
administration. There is also a growing demand that government
bring itself into line with the beliefs and traditions of those
it is intended to serve. Democracy, populists maintain, is not
an exercise in sensitivity training or the formulation of administrative
policy. It is the practice of self-government by self-identified
communities, whether regional or national. 

<P>
When the popular will
seeks to affirm traditional morality or limit the political community,
but is disregarded or overruled judicially, then both democracy
and citizenship are devalued. This is now a regular occurrence
in the U.S. The populist call for both political accountability
and true self-government has joined a conservative goal: the defense
of family and traditional communities endangered by a therapeutic
managerial state. 

<P>
Buchanan personifies the populist revolt against
this. Unlike neoconservatives and gentrified Republicans, he concedes
nothing, rhetorically or programmatically. He calls for seismic
change: devolution of power to states and open confrontation with
moral and cultural revolutionaries posing as value-free judges
or public servants. As president, he would not merely dicker with
liberal administrators. He would find ways to dispatch them and,
wherever possible, dismantle their agencies. 

<P>
Buchanan's spiritedness
and unwavering conviction persuade me that he would make a difference
as president. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he would not leave the Washington
power structure as he found it. He would make strenuous efforts
to restore the dual federalism established by our founders. 

<P>Buchanan
knows that genuine democracy must come from below. It cannot be
mandated from Washington or, in imperialist fashion, imposed abroad.
In our own country, democracy is an ideal to be recaptured, not
a blueprint to be forced on other nations. 

<P>
I doubt that Buchanan
would be a rigidly isolationist president. His stern warnings
against foreign entanglements have a constructive aim. He rightly
fears that our own society is deteriorating in many ways. Especially
now that our communist enemy is gone, it may be best to work on
domestic problems instead of shouldering the burdens of other
peoples.  

<P>
Nor should we encourage unskilled workers from less
developed lands to immigrate, take advantage of our social services,
and displace those most at risk in our own work force. America,
as Buchanan sees it, should hope neither to remake nor to absorb
the rest of humanity. In contrast to the nationalism expressed
by Ben Wattenberg, one of his frequent debating partners, Buchanan's
nationalism has no global imperative and is respectful of cultural
differences. Because of his feisty and principled character and
his democratic counterrevolutionary vision, I shall cast my own
vote in the Republican presidential primary for this modest nationalist.

<CENTER><B>DavidKuo on Bob Dole</B></CENTER>
<P>
The elections of November 1994 did more than usher in the first
conservative Congress in two generations. They also signaled the
public affirmation of a conservative agenda. In so doing, they
forced conservatives to change both their congressional and their
presidential perspectives. Suddenly, long-held conservative hopes
became new-found conservative realities. The balanced budget is
fashionable-the only real question now is whether it will be accomplished
through the budget process or through an amendment to the Constitution.
Federalism is renewed and devolution is the new buzzword. Illegitimacy
is bad and the family needs to be strengthened. As conservatives
consider whom among the presidential candidates to support in
1996, the question is, &quot;Who is best suited to take us to
the next stage of our conservative realignment?&quot; The clear
answer: Bob Dole. 

<P>The next stage of the realignment is not for
communication and symbolism, but for the detailed work of devolving
federal power, strengthening families, and reasserting American
interests abroad. It is a stage for implementing an agenda already
defined. 

<P>
Although some things may have caused conservatives some
angst, the simple fact remains: On every serious issue on our
agenda, Bob Dole is not only on board, he is the leader. 

<P>
This
is not a recent phenomenon. The man now calling for the abolition
of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Energy is the same man who voted against creating
both Education and HUD. The man now speaking out against our nation's
social pathologies has a pro-life voting record of nearly 100
percent. The man now advocating a U.S. foreign policy based on
American interests has been one of the leading voices in foreign
policy for years. And the man who has pledged to balance the budget
has made tough choices, year after year, on spending cuts. 

<P>
Today,
Bob Dole is arguably the most respected statesman in the country.
He has proven himself an excellent strategist who remains cool
under fire, a coalition-builder, and a political achiever. He
has demonstrated both the courage and the decisiveness that will
be required to implement our agenda. 

<P>
Too often, conservatives
have belittled and diminished legislative experience as a liability-suggesting
that a man who legislates cannot be trusted with the ideological
mantle. But as Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and even Bill Clinton
have learned, accomplishing-legislating-is difficult business.
Any agenda, however aggressive, however bold, however visionary
is merely an agenda unless it is implemented. But Majority Leader
Dole is not only a legislator, he is a master at getting things
done. And President Dole would be able to translate his experience
and ability into the tough work of reversing 30 years of growth
in the welfare state. 

<P>
Many contend that the president's most important
role is commander-in-chief of our armed forces, and they may be
right. Though Cold War pressures have receded, our recent dalliances
in Somalia, Bosnia, and North Korea testify to the continuing
need for serious and responsive leadership. Bob Dole, who has
emerged as the leading Republican voice in foreign policy, would
bring to the presidency a developed view of world affairs. His
view combines two things: an expansive interpretation of America's
role in the world and a personal and pragmatic understanding of
the dangers of global involvement. 

<P>
For someone who has worked
for both the National Right-to-Life Committee and Empower America,
all of these things are important. But the real source of my attraction
to Dole lies elsewhere. The true reason I believe Bob Dole should
be president of the United States stems from his character. 

<P>
The
presidency helps define the character of the country. People look
to the president for leadership, inspiration, and guidance. The
president should be someone to whom parents can point and tell
their children, &quot;Be like him.&quot; In Bob Dole, parents
could point to someone who served his country in war, overcame
physical infirmities thought to be insurmountable, and dedicated
his life to serving the American people-all good and noble things.
He has also proven himself to be a man who keeps his word.

<P>
In the 1980s, following a decade of turmoil and the &quot;malaise&quot;
presidency, America needed a particular kind of conservatism-an
inspiring conservatism of sweeping visions, a conservatism that
could hasten the downfall of communism abroad and the restoration
of confidence at home. In President Reagan, it had an unparalleled
leader. But America now needs something very different. It needs
a conservatism that is still visionary, but one whose greatest
virtue is belief in community and responsibility. In Bob Dole
it has its rightful leader. His presidency would not only bury
the aberration that is the Clinton presidency, but would also
consolidate the conservative revolution.

<CENTER><B>William E. Dannemeyer on Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>
True leadership emanates from men who say the right thing at
the right time to the people who need to hear it most. This is
how I think of Bob Dornan. In my mind's eye I return to 1990,
on a typically hot and humid July morning in Washington, D.C.,
where a not-so-typical debate began to boil on the floor of the
House. 

<P>
At issue was the expulsion of Representative Barney Frank,
who had brought shame upon our institution for misjudgments involving
a male friend and prostitute over an 18-month period. As the sponsor
of the resolution to expel Frank, I can tell you that the experience
was one of the most intensely sobering dramas with which I was
ever involved in my 14 years of service in the House. It was not
a time for the timid. Only four members spoke in favor of the
expulsion. Bob Dornan was one of them. 

<P>
Bob began his comments,
&quot;I have not been this nervous in this well in over a 14-year
span in this House.&quot; And then he did something that has become
trademark Dornan, something only courageous men can do under fire.


<P>
Knowing that he stood virtually alone, knowing that ridicule and
contempt would be heaped upon him by Frank's defenders and a vicious
liberal media, Bob turned and looked Barney Frank square in the
eyes, not once turning his attention elsewhere, and said what
had to be said to the man who needed to hear it most: &quot;I
don't care about the details. The devil is in the details. That
is for you lawyers.&#133; I will vote for expelling you because
you did not have the honor or decency to resign.&quot; 

<P>
Bob Dole,
as inspirational as his life has been, would never have shown
such leadership. Phil Gramm would have become invisible. Dick
Lugar would have prayed that the moment would quickly pass. And
Arlen Specter would have defended Frank. Under those circumstances,
not one of these Republican candidates, who all serve in elective
office, would have done what needed to be done or have said what
needed to be said. This is a major reason why I support Bob Dornan
for president. 

<P>
Bob's conservatism is real. It is passionate. And
it is based on a deep and abiding faith in God. I was glad, although
not surprised, to hear Bob inject themes of liberty and virtue
into the presidential debate. Unlike the congressional colleagues
who have become his presidential competitors, Bob actually understands
the historical, moral, and philosophical basis of these themes.
He knows, and has stated, that we cannot be a free people unless
we are a virtuous people. He did not need million-dollar handlers
to tell him that. Nor did he need the incessant prodding of pro-family
special interests to motivate his comments. He knows the relationship
of liberty to virtue because he is a self-motivated student of
truth. 

<P>
History is one of Bob's closest friends. His life-long
relationship with history has honed his bubbling idealism into
a practical and balanced conservative philosophy. As a staunch
proponent of lower taxes and lower federal spending, Bob knows
the bounds of governmental authority, not only because he has
worn this mantle of authority over the last 18 years in Congress
but also because he has studiously examined history. From ancient
Rome to modern America, Bob Dornan knows what makes nations rise
and fall. The presidential rivals who serve with him in Congress
haven't got a clue. 

<P>
Bob Dornan is not the only good conservative
in this race for the presidency. Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes are
also running-and I count each as my friend. Even so, when I have
to choose, it is Bob Dornan I will support. Few other qualities
in a presidential candidate could offset a lack of elected public
service. Bob has been elected to Congress nine times, in Democratic
districts. These experiences have built character that cannot
be found anywhere else in politics.Moreover, Bob's record of service
both in and on behalf of the military is a nearly essential requirement
of the role of commander-in-chief. I know Bob feels it is an absolute
requirement. Through a variety of circumstances, he has witnessed
firsthand how America has influenced the world for good and has
developed the deepest appreciation for U.S. sovereignty. Bob Dornan
would not rush us off to war, nor would he abandon genuine freedom
fighters anywhere in the world. In determining this delicate balance,
I know he would excel-always erring on the cautious side in preserving
American lives and sovereignty. 

<P>
Bob Dornan belies the public persona
crafted and manipulated by an adversarial media elite. His passion
for life, his love of country, his deep commitment to his wife
Sallie and their children and grandchildren, and his uncanny identification
with all types of people sometimes make him an easy target for
mean-spirited and shallow adversaries. Yet he has remained eternally
optimistic about life and about the future of America specifically.
Great men deserve even greater opportunities to show their mettle.
This is why I unhesitatingly support Bob Dornan for president
of the United States of America.

<CENTER><B>Lewis E. Lehrman on Phil Gramm</B></CENTER>
<P>
Who is the authentic heir of the Reagan Revolution, the iron
man who can fulfill its promise? Who among us is the leader with
the compelling vision, the experience, and the perseverance to
lead us out of our time of troubles? I say I know such a man.


<P>
Born a son of the South, a grandson of Yankee immigrants, raised
in Georgia, and grown to manhood in Texas, he has risen to leadership
by virtue of his own remarkable energy and intelligence-just as
he rose to the rank of legislative statesman as the senior senator
from Texas. Phil Gramm is the man. 

<P>
Born poor, self-made, and unencumbered
by the cultural baggage of country-club Republicans, Phil Gramm's
life has demonstrated the promise of the American dream: that
every American, no matter how humble his beginnings, has the right
and the opportunity to rise by indefatigable effort and indisputable
merit as high as he might go. Phil Gramm will rise to the highest
office in the land because he will, conventional wisdom notwithstanding,
roll up the primaries in 1996. And he will win the general election
going away. 

<P>
This is how Phil Gramm will win! He will win with
the most compelling campaign of conservative ideas. He knows what
he believes and loves what he knows. He will win by recruiting
legions of true conservative activists to embrace his definition
of the American dream. He will win by the sheer force of his superior
talent and leadership, which explains why he has built more organization,
raised more money, and won over the vast majority of conservative
activists who know where he stands. 

<P>
Every true conservative who
aspires to the highest office should uphold a clear program of
reform designed to restore our limited constitutional government.
Yet we know, from the failures and disappointments of the past,
that a program by itself is not sufficient. Neither will it be
sufficient in 1996 to choose careerism or time-serving political
credentials. 

<P>
The conservatives now assembled for victory have
learned from hard experience that the man who leads us will only
be sufficient unto the task if he has, in addition to the gift
of intellect and a well-laid plan, something more. That something
is true grit, unimpeachable character, and the irrefragable tenacity
to carry his plan for a rebirth of the American dream to total
triumph. We the people want a president of the United States whose
impeccable conservative ideas and matchless record are joined
with a driving will to win. We want a winner, a big winner, a
man with a strategy for victory.

<P>
In the domain of political economy,
Phil Gramm is the best-trained, best-equipped presidential candidate
in American history. A free-market professor of economics long
before it was trendy, a co-author of the Reagan economic program,
he is the very apostle of low tax rates, a balanced budget, stable
money, and a deregulated economy. Phil Gramm is without peer in
his grasp of how to create full employment, long-term interest
rates of 4 percent, and a tax code based on a flat rate. 

<P>
In the
domain of defense policy, Phil Gramm has prepared himself for
the post-communist world. He has declared that he is &quot;ready
for a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and if
such a world comes about, I want the United States of America
to be that lion.&quot; No other policy is acceptable to Phil Gramm,
whose presidential inaugural oath, registered in heaven, will
require him to &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States of America.&quot; 

<P>
Believing as I do that
economics and foreign policy are contingent, but cultural and
social principles are central, what assurance does one have that
President Gramm will encourage and foster the indispensable moral
reformation of the public square? Speaking in May before Liberty
University and The Heritage Foundation, Phil Gramm said: &quot;Faith
and family produced the values and virtues that helped make America
the world's greatest and most powerful nation long before we had
any of the trappings of greatness and power.&quot; Quoting Alexis
de Tocqueville, Gramm said, &quot;'Not until I went into the churches
of America, and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did
I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great
because she is good, and if America ever ceased to be good, America
will cease to be great.' I believe that Alexis de Tocqueville
was right 160 years ago, and I believe he is right today.&quot;


<P>
In more specific terms, Gramm has argued that &quot;the social-security
net that we erected has become a hammock. Government programs&#133;have
changed the way we behave, corrupted our values, and diminished
our virtue. As we look more and more towards Caesar to take care
of us, we have turned more and more away from family and faith.
In rendering unto Caesar, we have stopped rendering unto God.&quot;


<P>
And thus we are brought to consider the soul of the Republican
Party as we debate its presidential nomination. During the greatest
crisis of American history, the Republican Party of the United
States was founded on the everlasting covenant of &quot;free soil,
free men, and free labor.&quot; And with the victory of our party
and of President Lincoln came vindication of the inalienable right
to liberty and the end of slavery in America. More than a century
later, the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan came to stand for
many things, but there was one unique covenant in the platforms
of 1980 and 1984. Let us call it the one needful thing. And what
is that thing? Senator Gramm described &quot;the day when all
unborn children are welcomed into life and loved when they get
here.&quot; A Republican Party-indeed, a Republican president-without
a commitment to the inalienable right to life, without unequivocal
opposition to abortion, is as unthinkable as a Republican Party
without Lincoln, the inalienable right to liberty, and unequivocal
opposition to slavery. 

<P>
We conservatives know that, after this
imminent contest for the presidency, our philosophical agenda
entails no less than the comprehensive reformation of our political
institutions. But to pursue a goal without the right man and the
right means to attain it is to court political disaster. Republicans
are blessed with several authentic candidates. But I believe that
Phil Gramm is the only leader with the intellect, the force of
will, and the preparation for greatness who can marshall our forces
for an overwhelming and irreversible victory over our foes.

<CENTER><B>Mary Parker Lewis onAlan Keyes</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the millions of Americans who are brokenhearted over the
decay of moral standards, the disintegration of families and neighborhoods,
and the slaughter of innocents in the womb, Alan Keyes is the
most powerful spokesman on the scene today. More than any other
candidate, Alan Keyes offers a healing message of hope and renewal,
based on the immortal principles of our great Declaration of Independence,
and delivered without apology to the better angels of our nature.


<P>
The former president of Citizens Against Government Waste, Alan
Keyes offers credentials second to none as a champion of Americans
fed up with overtaxation, overspending, and overregulation. For
example, when many Republican leaders were assuring us that Dick
Darman's 1990 budget deal was a winner for George Bush and the
GOP, Alan warned that the agreement would prove disastrous for
taxpayers, the economy, and the party. Events proved him right.


<P>
Today the GOP endorses the policies of tax reduction, spending
restraint, and local empowerment that Alan has championed for
years. That is well and good. But as Alan eloquently reminds Republican
audiences, economics is not at the heart of what ails America.
Serious though they are, our economic problems are largely derivative,
the consequences of having abandoned the moral and constitutional
principles of the American founding. The transfer state is bankrupting
America, but the transfer state comes into its own only when hordes
of people see nothing wrong with living off the toil of others.
In any event, moral vices produce the social problems for which
government programs are inevitably proffered as solutions. 

<P>
That's
why Alan's front-and-center emphasis on moral issues is the only
genuinely practical approach. Consider these words from his February
19 address to the New Hampshire Republican State Committee: &quot;Why
is it that we spend so much money on welfare and illegitimacy?
Why is it that we spend so much money on crime and violence in
our streets? Why is it even that we spend so much money dealing
with the problems of irresponsible behavior that contribute to
the decline of the health of this nation? I think you all know
in your hearts what the real answer is. We don't have money problems,
we have moral problems. And it's time we stood up and faced that
truth.&quot; We will never succeed in relimiting the federal government
until we restore the family to its rightful place as the first
and best &quot;welfare provider&quot; and strengthen the marriage-based,
two-parent family as the fundamental moral unit of society. 

<P>
Of
all the policies eroding the moral foundations of family life
and American freedom, the policy of abortion on demand poses the
greatest danger. There are, of course, many decent people on both
sides of the abortion controversy. Nonetheless, the pro-abortion
position is anti-family. As an institution, the family both depends
upon and nurtures an ethic of duty and self-sacrifice. But the
pro-abortion position fosters an ethic of self-indulgence. It
says, in effect, that the convenience or pleasure of the adult
is the supreme law. 

<P>
Worse, the pro-abortion position implicitly
justifies political despotism. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims the right to life to be a gift from God and, therefore,
inalienable. The pro-abortion argument assumes either that government
(not God) is the source of rights, or that we have the right to
decide whose humanity shall be recognized and whose shall not.
Obviously, the doctrine that there are no natural rights (hence
no natural wrongs) advances the ambitions of those whose chief
interest lies in the expansion of government power. But liberty
is also subverted when we claim the authority to decide who among
us is human, and who is not. Alan put it this way in an April
8 speech to Delaware Republicans: 

<P>
&quot;Don't you realize that
opens the door to every form of tyranny? Because all I have to
do if I want to snuff out your life or trample on your rights
is decide that you're not human. And of course you'll look at
me and say, 'But you can't do that.' And I'll say, 'Well, the
last time the American people decided they were going to draw
the line, my folks ended up on the wrong side of it.' And I don't
think it was because we had the poor judgment to draw the line
in the wrong place. I think it was because we claimed a right
we do not have. We do not have the right to draw that line. God
drew it, and all we have the right to do is respect His will.&quot;


<P>
Slavery and abortion on demand are both what Alan calls &quot;Declaration
issues&quot;-moral wrongs that must be addressed because they
contradict the basic premise of a self-governing polity. I believe
Alan sees so deeply into the nature of the abortion controversy
because he has thought long and hard about slavery and the black
experience in America. 

<P>
Keyes's book, <I>Masters of the Dream:
The Strength and Betrayal of Black America</I>, is not just an
antidote to decades of left-wing revisionism. It is a meditation
on the universal significance of the black experience-the moral
and civic lessons to be learned therefrom. Slavery did not make
blacks slavish, nor did material deprivation turn them into passive
victims. Rather, slavery whetted their natural thirst for freedom,
much as it did to the Hebrews of old. Deprivation taught them
to recognize the true, non-material basis of human dignity. To
survive in the face of adversity, blacks had to become diligent,
dependable, hopeful. They learned to honor hard work, self-discipline,
family, and the riches of the spirit. Such qualities of moral
and spiritual strength are the key to restoring the true American
dream-the dream of freedom. 

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, black America
was betrayed by the same forces that are destroying the dream
for all Americans: the perverse incentives of the transfer state,
and the debilitating doctrines of sexual permissiveness and moral
relativism. Alan Keyes's candidacy is a candidacy like no other.
Drawing on the moral lessons of black history, the imperishable
truths of the Declaration, and the arts of statesmanship, Alan
Keyes will elevate the 1996 presidential contest to a plane not
seen in America since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

<CENTER><B>MitchellE. Daniels Jr. on Richard Lugar</B></CENTER>
<P>
 As they search for the best national leader in 1996, conservatives
should look beyond words, votes, and even public actions. The
true measure of authenticity must encompass not only what a man
has shown to the camera, but also what he has shown to his family,
his neighbors, and his Maker. For Dick Lugar, conservatism is
not merely a school of thought, it is a way of life, and it is
in that context that he emerges as the right man to lead America
back to strength and virtue. 

<P>
By every conventional yardstick,
Dick Lugar has been a rock of conservative principle and consistency.
As the mayor of Indianapolis, he cut taxes five times in eight
years, and battled tirelessly against federal intrusion into state
and local autonomy. As a senator, he has amassed a voting record
in the most conservative fifth of each Congress in which he has
served; statistically, he was Ronald Reagan's number-one supporter
for the eight years of the 40th presidency. 

<P>
Lugar's campaign for
the presidency is animated by these same bedrock beliefs. His
determination to shrink government and reduce spending is confirmed
by his ongoing, often lonely battle to cut agricultural subsidies
and free American farmers to plant for the market, not the government.
Like Churchill, he believes that &quot;The responsibility of Ministers
for the public safety is absolute and requires no mandate. It
is in fact the prime object for which governments come into existence.&quot;
He knows, and is unafraid to state, that the safety of our country
cannot be left to chance, but will demand American activism on
nuclear proliferation, ballistic-missile defense, and terrorism.


<P>
Dick Lugar rejects the current establishment's constrained vision
of a U.S. economy growing at only 2 or 3 percent per year. His
clarion call to abolish all taxation of enterprise is the single
most radical and promising idea on the 1996 agenda. Alone among
the candidates' reform proposals, it would uproot today's entire
anti-growth, anti-savings regime of income, capital-gains, and
estate taxation, and turn loose a 1980s-like explosion of investment,
exports, jobs, and higher incomes. 

<P>
But for all its macroeconomic
appeal, the true significance of the Lugar tax plan lies in its
underlying values. Leapfrogging the flat tax and its imitators,
Lugar would abolish at a stroke the most dehumanizing aspects
of modern statism: the invasions of privacy, the abuses of power,
the insidious invisibility of withholding, and the unspoken assumption
that income belongs to the state rather than the individual. Through
their consumption decisions, individuals would have full control
of the rate of their taxation. In a real sense, Dick Lugar's tax
plan is the ultimate expression of conservative philosophy. 

<P>Anyone
can write a platform. Many have compiled positive records of words,
votes, and public deeds. It is the rarest of public men who can
also lead a life in complete congruence with the principles he
espouses. 

<P>
Dick Lugar has lived the virtues of self-discipline,
duty, devotion to country, and religious faith that we all admire
but practice imperfectly. He was first in his class in high school,
first in his class at college; he has been a Methodist lay minister,
and an Eagle Scout. Like Bill Clinton, Dick Lugar visited the
American Embassy in London while he was a Rhodes Scholar; unlike
Clinton, Lugar went there to enlist in the U.S. Navy. 

<P>
Lugar served
his country with distinction, including a stint as intelligence
briefer to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the chief of naval operations.
Returning to his home town, he saved a struggling family manufacturing
business, carried on the family farming operations, and with Charlene,
his wife (and co-president of their college's student body), built
his own little platoon of four sons. As a school-board member,
he fought for racial integration and against forced busing. That
brought him to the public's attention, and eventually to an elective
career. But throughout his public life, he has remained closely
involved in both his businesses. Dick Lugar has always been a
citizen legislator. 

<P>
When President Lugar calls Americans to reassert
the moral superiority of hard work, personal responsibility, intact
families, and respect for life, his conviction will not be drawn
merely from congressional testimony of the latest policy analysis.
His leadership of a cultural recovery in our country will be grounded
in a life of commitment to virtues early learned and deep embedded.


<P>
The conservative revolution is yet to be won. Building upon the
congressional breakthrough of 1994 will require the election of
a Republican president, and not just any Republican will do. Total
triumph will only be won by a president who can attract and hold
the respect and affection of millions of citizens. 

<P>
Dick Lugar's
brand of inclusive, reasoned, friendly conservatism has allowed
him to build larger coalitions and shatter electoral records throughout
his career. Just as he is the candidate most certain to disarm
President Clinton in a general election, he is the man best equipped
to win the enduring trust of the larger majorities whose support
will consummate the conservative crusade.

<CENTER><B>Roger J. Stone
Jr. on Arlen Specter</B></CENTER>
<P>
Arlen Specter is a Jew, he comes from a big city, he has a record
of commitment to racial equality (without quotas), he's pro-choice,
and he believes strongly in tolerance and the First Amendment
doctrine of church-state separation. For social-issue conservatives
who take their marching orders from Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,
who believe in Pat Buchanan's &quot;holy war&quot; for the soul
of America, some or all of these factors probably make Specter's
candidacy anathema. Frankly, this article is not addressed to
them. 

<P>
The conservatives to whom this article is addressed are
conservatives like myself-the kind of conservatives I met in 1964
as a member of Young Americans for Freedom, fighting the good
fight for Barry Goldwater; the conservatives I led as National
Chairman of Young Republicans, and worked with beginning in 1976,
and then in 1980 and 1984, to give America eight magnificent years
of a Ronald Reagan presidency; and the supply-side conservatives
I worked with in Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential campaign in an
effort to continue that tradition. 

<P>
This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Barry Goldwater, believe that government
ought to get off our backs, keep out of our pocketbooks, and stay
out of our bedrooms. This article is addressed to conservatives
who, like Ronald Reagan, believe in a strong America: strong enough
militarily to secure our interests and keep the peace around the
world, strong enough domestically to win the war against drugs
and violent crime on our streets. This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Jack Kemp, believe in an American future
of unlimited economic opportunity and unprecedented growth fueled
by low taxes, free trade, and free markets. 

<P>
To those libertarian
conservatives, who I believe are the true core of American conservatism,
I say Arlen Specter is your candidate. In Arlen Specter, you will
find a senator with a strong record of conservatism that goes
back to his first days in the senate. In the Specter '96 campaign,
you will find a program thoroughly grounded in conservative ideals
and ideas, and a candidate committed to fiscal and economic conservatism
who has the best chance of beating Bill Clinton in a general election.


<P>
First, the Specter record. Arlen Specter came to the Senate in
1981 with an outstanding background in law enforcement as Philadelphia's
district attorney, where he fought successfully to end plea bargaining
and win stiff sentences for violent criminals. In the Senate,
he immediately made tough anticrime policies a legislative priority,
and authored the 1984 Armed Career Criminal bill, the first federal
law to use &quot;three strikes&quot; to get long-term jail terms
for repeat offenders. A strong believer in the deterrent force
of the death penalty, Arlen Specter has for 15 years been the
driving force in Congress to put teeth back into state death-penalty
laws by eliminating ridiculous judicial delays in carrying out
death sentences. 

<P>
Throughout the Reagan presidency, Arlen Specter
was a solid supporter of the revitalization of the American military,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative. He firmly opposed
any effort to relax the Cuban embargo. He has been at the forefront
of the fight to combat terrorism at home and abroad, and was a
leading Senate voice in support of the Gulf War resolution. Recently,
he has been a vocal Senate force in opposition to the Clinton
administration's appeasement of North Korea and its pointless
risk of U.S. lives in Haiti. 

<P>
Specter's fiscal record in the Senate
is solidly conservative: long-time support for both a balanced
budget amendment and the line-item veto (including sponsoring
his own legislation during his second term); support for the Reagan
era tax cuts; and, early this year,his own flat-tax bill-the Senate's
only such legislation.

<P>
For the same reasons that Specter has opposed
government interference into Americans' private lives, he has
always opposed gun-control and supported the rights of law-abiding
citizens to own firearms. He believes that swift, certain, and
severe punishment of criminals, not confiscation of guns from
the public, is the effective way to fight violent crime.

<P>
The defining
themes of the Specter '96 campaign are squarely conservative.
As Arlen Specter said in announcing his candidacy last March:
    
<P>
&quot;With the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and
a Republican president in 1996, we have a unique opportunity to
move America toward unprecedented prosperity and unlimited opportunity....


<P>
&quot;We do so by implementing our core Republican values: smaller
government; less spending; lower taxes; civil rights and liberties;
strong national defense; and effective crime control.&#133; I
stand before you today as a man willing to work with every ounce
of my energy and every fiber of my determination to renew once
again the dreams of freedom and opportunity that for 200 years
have made this nation the envy of and the example for the world.&quot;


<P>
In his announcement speech, Specter made just two specific pledges
on domestic policy, and both reflect the fundamentally conservative
orientation of his governing philosophy: to balance the budget
by 2002 (and to write the first check to reduce the national debt
in January, 2003); and to deliver a flat-tax bill to the Congress
at his own inauguration. 

<P>
The flat-tax concept-a single 20 percent
tax rate on all business and personal income, elimination of all
loopholes and deductions except for a portion of home-mortgage
interest and small charitable contributions, and no taxation on
interest, dividends, and capital gains-has become the economic
centerpiece of the Specter campaign. As welcome as specific tax
cuts might be, they are mere Band-Aids for a tax system that is
long on bureaucrats, rules, and regulations and short on incentives
for economic growth. The future of conservative fiscal policy
lies with the flat tax-House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the
next president would be elected on a flat-tax platform-and Arlen
Specter is the only Republican candidate to commit foursquare
to such a system. 

<P>
Conservatives need to be realists. We need to
recognize that Bill Clinton is not as vulnerable as he once seemed
or as we might like. The 1996 Republican nominee will face in
Bill Clinton an energetic campaigner, a president determined to
use the considerable powers of incumbency in support of his re&euml;lection,
and a man zealously supported by interest groups determined to
retain their last link to political power. As conservatives, we
need a Republican nominee who can defeat Bill Clinton in a general
election-and that means Arlen Specter. 

<P>
Since 1980, Arlen Specter
has won three tough Senate races (and two tough primaries) in
a bellwether state where Democrats have always far outnumbered
Republicans. In 1992, despite the fury of radical feminists over
his defense of Clarence Thomas, Specter carried Pennsylvania by
three points while George Bush was losing the state to Clinton
by a million votes. Arlen Specter has a reputation as an indefatigable
campaigner-a reputation I can tell you is well deserved. He has
the intellect, tenacity, and toughness to take on Bill Clinton
in a presidential debate-and to win going away. 

<P>
In Arlen Specter,
conservatives have the chance to support a candidate committed
to a balanced budget and a flat tax at home, and to the restoration
of American strength, resolve, and credibility abroad; a candidate
who has the knowledge and experience to lead a national war on
crime and drugs; and a candidate who can win the White House on
these issues. Conservatives who see themselves as heir to the
libertarian legacy of Barry Goldwater, the Reagan tradition of
American strength abroad and limited government at home, and the
Kemp commitment to broad-based growth and prosperity belong in
his camp.

<P>
Today the commonsense conservative philosophy that so many have
fought for, for so long, holds sway in the Supreme Court, in the
U.S. Senate, and in the House of Representatives. There is only
one piece missing in the conservative political jigsaw puzzle-the
White House. When that piece is in place, a picture of real political
revolution will emerge, a revolution that could roll on well into
the next century.

<P>
That is why the stakes next year are so high.

<P>
There
have been three successful conservative Republican presidents
elected in our lifetimes-Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon,
and Ronald Reagan. I've worked to help elect and then serve with
two of them, and I believe there are certain requirements that
a person must have to win the Republican nomination and then the
presidency.   

<P>Here's the short list:
<UL>
<LI>They must have rock-solid
conservative views on national security and economic policy, and
they must be in accord on a wide range of social issues important
to the conservative base of the Republican party.
<LI>They must
be political warhorses, with a powerful political base-preferably
California (54 electoral votes), New York (33 votes), or Texas
(32 votes)-and skilled campaigners. Executive experience in government
is a big plus.
<LI>They must have high intelligence, great stamina,
and a record free of scandal. Running for president against any
incumbent Democrat, in the teeth of a hostile, liberal press,
is a mind-numbing, exhausting gauntlet. 
</UL>

<P>
The Republican candidates
running for president in 1996 are a distinguished group; any one
of them would be a dramatic improvement over President Clinton.
By the fall of 1995, it is likely that the race will narrow to
three men: Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, and Governor Wilson. They
are all good men, but I believe that one of them-Pete Wilson-best
meets the criteria for getting nominated, getting elected, and
governing successfully. 

<P>
<B>Peace and National Security.</B> Pete Wilson
has a strong, consistent record of conservative positions on national
defense and foreign policy. Known as a national defense hawk in
the U.S. Senate, he was a leading supporter of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and one of the few who called
for early deployment. An expert on strategic nuclear policy and
arms control he was a critic of the SALT II treaty and backed
President Reagan's INF treaty.  

<P>
As governor, he has been an outspoken
critic of President Clinton for squandering U.S. prestige and
influence around the world and cutting national defense spending
to dangerously low levels. 

<P>
In the 1950s, he was a platoon leader
in the U.S. Marines. On national-defense matters, they don't come
any tougher than former U.S. Marine officers. On national security,
Pete Wilson is as tough a defender of U.S. interests as any Republican
running. 

<P>
<B>Prosperity and Economic Policy.</B> As a U.S. Senator, he
consistently supported both a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget, and line-item veto authority for the president.
As a candidate for the Senate, he strongly opposed the 1982 tax
increase; and as senator, he voted against President Bush's 1990
tax increase. 

<P>
When he became the governor of California in 1991,
he inherited the worst economic mess in the state's history. The
deficit facing him was one third of the state's general fund request,
comparable to a $500 billion deficit in today's federal budget,
but with one big difference-the California constitution mandates
a balanced budget. Unlike Washington, where you can take seven
years to achieve fiscal responsibility, he only had one year and
a legislature controlled by Democrats. Although some taxes were
raised, the lion's share of that deficit was eliminated by tough
spending control. 

<P>
In fact, during the four years of his first
term he held spending flat in current dollars. If you account
for inflation, real spending went down-not from some bogus baseline
projection, but from actual 1991 spending levels. If the federal
government had exercised comparable toughness, the federal budget
would be in balance today. 

<P>
California also went through a few
other trials-drastic defense-industry cutbacks, the collapse of
real-estate values, fires, floods, mudslides, riots, and earthquakes.
But Pete Wilson's tough spending control, unmatched in any other
state, laid the foundation for a strong economic recovery that
confounded the experts-a recovery strong enough to generate sufficient
new tax revenues to pay off temporary debts, to fund spending
increases for education and law enforcement, and to propose a
15 percent across-the-board tax cut for all individuals and businesses.
If the Democratic-controlled legislature refuses to pass the tax
cut, Pete Wilson has vowed to hold a statewide ballot referendum
and let the voters decide. When passed, the new tax rates will
be below what they were when he took office. 

<P>
Pete Wilson is the
only Republican candidate proposing a true supply-side tax cut-not
increased deductions or exemptions, but an across-the-board reduction
in tax rates. 

<P>Speaking to the Republican Midwest Leadership Conference
on May 19, 1995, he spelled out the Reagan supply-side formula
for economic prosperity: &quot;If we both cut taxes and cut spending...there
is every reason for not just optimism but for justified confidence
in America's dynamic growth.&quot; 

<P>
<B>Justice and Social Issues.</B>
Here his record is overwhelmingly on the side of conservative
values, a clear sense of what is right and wrong, and of achieving
justice. Pete Wilson, the governor of our largest state, took
the lead not only in reforming welfare, but also in actually cutting
the amount of benefits paid. He was the first political leader
to sound the alarm on the injustice of paying billions of taxpayers'
dollars for the welfare, medical care, and education expenses
of illegal aliens. He led the battle for &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; for career criminals, locking them up for life
after their third felony conviction. 

<P>
A supporter of term limits
for politicians and the kind of federalism the Founding Fathers
intended for the United States, he has led the fight against the
heavy hand of federal mandates, declaring that California is &quot;not
a colony of the federal government.&quot; 

<P>
He has fought for regulatory
and legal reform, proposed a state constitutional amendment to
limit regulatory excesses, and issued an executive order suspending
the environmental regulations that contributed to the recent flood
damage. He has consistently vetoed legislation that would extend
special rights to gays, while opposing measures that would discriminate
against them. Pete Wilson, an expert pistol shot when he served
in the Marine Corps, has always supported the fundamental Second
Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, subject only
to some commonsense restrictions that support law enforcement.
On affirmative action, he has called for commonsense justice-a
color-blind society in which people would be treated equally regardless
of race or gender. 

<P>
On the social issue that most troubles the
Republican party today-abortion-Pete Wilson holds strong, consistent
views. While fully aware of the deeply held beliefs of those who
oppose all abortion and the reasoning behind those beliefs, he
has also carefully considered the rights and responsibilities
of the individuals involved, and the dangers of allowing an already
too powerful federal government to intrude itself into the most
intimate, difficult decision a woman can make. He strongly believes
we should encourage the kind of responsibility that would make
abortion unnecessary, that the question of abortion is best left
to the family and church, and that we should try to remove this
issue from the political arena to the extent possible. 

<P>
Is this
conservative? Well, it is the position shared by a substantial
majority of the Republican Party. Considering the terrible moral
dilemmas involved, it is a commonsense conservative view. 

<P>
<B>Electability.</B>
Most of my conservative friends are primarily interested in ideas
and principles, but for those who are also concerned with mundane
things like winning elections and taking power, I have a final
thought. 

<P>
If Pete Wilson wins the Republican nomination in 1996,
he will win the 54 electoral votes of California in the general
election. No Democratic nominee can be elected president without
winning California. 

<P>
Therefore, the nomination of Pete Wilson is
as close to a guarantee as you can get that Republicans   will-for
the first time in 44 years-control both houses of the Congress
and the White House. 

<P>If that happens, well then, as Ronald Reagan
once said: &quot;You ain't seen nothin' yet.&quot;

<p>
A generation has passed since the Nixon administration established racial quotas in hiring, promotion, college admissions, and government contracting. Affirmative-action policies, both public and private, have opened many economic and educational opportunities for Afri-can Americans, and have played an important role in one of the most encouraging developments of recent decades: the emergence of a large and growing black middle class. But supporters of government-mandated racial preferences have always been uncomfortable about policies that judge Americans by the color of their skin, not the content of their characterthe opposite of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Even if racial preferences have been justified on a temporary basis, they surely cannot be justified for more than a generation.<p>
Citizens and politicians are beginning to roll quotas back. Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm both have promised that, if elected president, they would repeal President Nixon's executive order requiring all government contractors to submit detailed "goals and timetables" for the hiring and promotion of minorities and women. Governor Pete Wilson has abolished some racial hiring quotas established by California law. Even President Clinton is reviewing the issue. <p>
Perhaps the most dramatic movement is the California Civil Rights Initiative, which will be on the ballot next year and enjoys overwhelming support in public-opinion polls. The brainchild of two scholars, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, the initiative is based on the color-blind language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: "Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system of public employment, public education or public contracting."<p><center><b>Gaining Ground</center></b>
<p>
There are six reasons why the repeal of government-mandated racial quotas is gaining the support of the American people:<ul>
<li>
Racial preferences are discriminatory. It is just as wrong for the government to discriminate in favor of blacks and other minorities as it is to discriminate against them. Preferring one race to another is a violation of the Declaration of Independence, which holds that all men are created equal; of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees all citizens the equal protection of the laws; and of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which explicitly forbids government-mandated reverse discrimination. This discrimination has real victims, such as the Asians denied admission to the University of California in spite of spectacular records, and would-be policemen and firemen who lose jobs to applicants who are substantially less qualified.<li>
Racial preferences violate the principles of American citizenship. Americans come from all races, all religions, all nationalities. What unites us as a nation is not a common origin, but a common commitment to our political institutions: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the Constitution; a self-governing republic. Martin Luther King Jr. brought Americans togetherby speaking of what Americans have in common, by showing how the civil-rights movement fit into the American political tradition. Racial preferences do the opposite; they balkanize our country by emphasizing our differences.<li>
Racial preferences foster dependency on government. Ronald Reagan used to say that "the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." So, too, the success of affirmative action should be judged by how many businesses become independent of set-asides, by how many individuals become independent of quotas in promotion and hiring. Unfortunately, all too many businesses have become part of a permanent affirmative-action industry.<li>
Racial preferences restrict freedom. Much of the creativity of a market economy comes from the freedom that individuals and businesses have to discover and use information. Bureaucratic, highly regulated affirmative-action policies endanger this creativity by denying businesses the freedom to hire and fire whomever they wish, and, in the case of employment tests that are forbidden because they have a disparate impact on races, by interfering with the free flow of information.<li>
Racial preferences fail to address the central challenge facing black America today: integrating poor black males into the American mainstream. The number of black men in college has fallen behind even as affirmative-action preferences in college admissions have intensified: There are now only 540,000 African-American men in college, compared with 830,000 black women. The explosion of violent crime by young black men wasn't supposed to happen with affirmative action. Something drastically different must be done instead of racial preferences, or a generation of black men will be destroyed.<li>
Most perniciously, racial preferences lower standards and expectations. When African Americans and Hispanics are held to a lower standard than members of other groups, the implicit message is patronizing, even racist. The signal sent by different treatment is that African Americans and Hispanics cannot compete on their own, unless they are given a special handicap. To make matters worse, the very idea of standards is devalued in the culture of affirmative action, where a test is considered discriminatory if blacks and Hispanics don't score well. </ul>
<p>
It is no accident that the two institutions in which blacks have advanced the most rapidly in America, the military and athletics, are meritocracies with clear performance standards. Colin Powell did not become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the outstanding generals in American history by receiving special treatment in his performance reviews. The military, it is frequently said, is the only institution in America in whichblacks regularly give orders to whites. This is because blackss in the armed forces have been given standards to aspire to, and the opportunity to achieve them.<p>
By contrast, public schools in America set tragically low academic expectations for poor children, especially for blacks and Hispanics. The culture of affirmative action reinforces these low expectations, with a defeatist message that minorities can't make the grade, and that standards don't even really matter. The sad fact is that on average blacks and Hispanics do score poorly on standardized academic tests. But that isn't an indictment of the tests; it's an indictment of the school system and surrounding culture that discourage kids from achieving.<p>
The literature of education is filled with stories of rapid academic advances by blacks and Hispanics in the face of higher expectations. Over the objections of fellow teachers and guidance counselors who said "these kids can't learn," Jaime Escalante turned Garfield High School, located in a working-class Mexican-American neighborhood of East Los Angeles, into one of the country's top advanced-placement calculus schools. Black and Hispanic freshmen in Georgia Tech's engineering program outperform whites, thanks to a rigorous orientation program based on immersion in math and chemistry.<p>
In New York City, the number of black ninth-graders passing the New York State Regents' science exam doubled from 6,000 in 1994 to nearly 13,000 in 1995, while the number of Hispanics passing the test tripled from 3,000 to over 10,000. The difference? In 1995, at the insistence of New York City School Chancellor Ramon Cortines, black and Hispanic students were expected to take Regents-level science courses and succeed in them. Prior to that, they were expected to fail.<p>
Expectations make all the difference for modest levels of achievement as well. During the early 1980s, Florida established a functional literacy test as a criterion of high-school graduation. Florida schools now give diplomas only to students who pass a test measuring whether they can fill out basic job application forms, do basic kinds of comparison shopping, balance check books, and otherwise participate in a modern society. At first, 80 to 90 percent of black 12th-graders failed. The test was challenged in court by the Legal Services Corp. on the grounds that it was discriminatory. But Florida gives students five chances to sit for the exam, and 90 percent of black 12th-graders now get passing scores. Those graduates are much better off for being forced to achieve a minimum level of competency.<p><b><center>The Best Affirmative Action</b></center>
<p>
The best affirmative action offers opportunities to outsiders without lowering standards and expectations. This means holding the members of all races to the same high standard and, if necessary, giving people the extra training they need to make the grade. It means not reserving particular jobs for blacks. It means making a genuine effort to find African Americansand other Americans of all raceswho might be overlooked but who have the capacity to excel. This is frequently a judgment call, for the capacity to excel is determined by leadership ability, strength of character, intellectual creativity, and other attributes that can't be easily measured by standardized tests. Precisely because it is a judgment call, it does not lend itself to bureaucratic oversight in the form of quotas, goals, or timetables.<p>
The nomination of Clarence Thomas as associate justice of the Supreme Court is a wonderful example of this judgment. President Bush and his advisers sensed that Thomas, though he did not yet have much judicial experience, had the constitutional understanding, the moral courage, and the intellect to become a distinguished judgeand also to become a national hero among conservative blacks in the way that Justice Thurgood Marshall was a national hero among liberals. As a result of Thomas's race, President Bush may have looked at his qualities more closely than he otherwise would have at that stage in the judge's career. But it was Thomas's qualities, not his race, that led to the nomination. There was no lowering of standards. On the contrary, the  Thomas nomination is now seen, at least by conservatives, as Bush's most significant enduring domestic-policy achievement.<p>
Americans of all races can take pride in the growing leadership of African Americans in political, economic, and cultural life. It is one of the great success stories of American history, rivaling the stories of the pioneers, of immigrants, of inventors and entrepreneurs. It is a quintessential American story of determined people overcoming hardship to make the most of our blessings of liberty.<p>
Government-imposed racial preferences played an important part in this story, by smashing through the institutional barriers to black advancement that were the legacy of centuries of discrimination. But reverse discrimination was always a questionable remedy to earlier prejudice. By failing now to offer opportunity to poor black males, racial preferences have outlived whatever usefulness they may have had. It is time for them to go.

Big Government was consolidated in America in the First Hundred Days of the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. By promising that the House would enact the Contract With America in the First Hundred Days of the 104th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich deliberately invited the history books to compare the work of the House Republican leadership with the New Deal of FDR.<p>
Policy Review asked nine students of American politics to assess the historic significance of Gingrich's First Hundred Days, and the principal achievements and errors of the House Republican leadership during this "rendezvous with destiny."<p>
<center><b>John J. Pitney, Jr.</center></b><p>
At first glance, it seems that the House GOP's First Hundred Days compare badly with FDR's. Although all the items in the Contract With America reached the House floor, only two of them (congressional compliance and unfunded mandates) became law before the hundredth day. By contrast, FDR signed bushels of bills during the Hundred Days of 1933. His emergency banking measure went through introduction, passage, and signature on the very first day of the congressional sessionand in less than eight hours.<p>
It is unfair, however, to judge today's House Republicans by the Roosevelt standard. Crisis is the great lubricant of the legislative process, and the economic calamities of FDR's early days briefly suspended Capitol Hill's normal friction. And odd as it may sound, many aspects of public life actually moved faster in 1933 than in 1995. Take justice, for instance. Shortly before FDR took office, a man named Giuseppe Zangara fired five shots at the president-elect, missing him but killing one person and wounding four others. Zangara was tried, convicted, and executed within 33 days. In the 1990s, jury selection alone can take longer than that, and capital offenders can stay out of the electric chair for years by filing endless habeas corpus petitions.<p>
Government has become tangled in its own red tapewhich is precisely why the Republicans put so much emphasis on procedural reform. They started with the House itself, recognizing that the institution would work more efficiently with fewer committees and smaller staffs. The best symbol of their commitment to renewing Congress came with the congressional-compliance bill, which cleared both chambers faster than any peacetime domestic legislation since Roosevelt's banking bill in 1933. In other ways, the Republicans strove to make government leaner and less cumbersome. Proposals such as block grants would eliminate layers of bureaucracy and miles of red tape. And the GOP crime bill would restore rationality to the appeals process in capital cases, thereby ensuring swift justice for the Zangaras of the future.<p>House Republicans are pushing the federal government to match the pace of 62 years ago. Ironically, that is high praise.<p>

<p>
The First Hundred Days of the new House Republican leaders will deserve that well-worn adjective "historic" even if relatively few of the measures listed in their Contract With America ever become law in a form they would recognize. For the central achievement of the First Hundred Days was to change the whole terrain and direction of American politics.<p>
Last year, the most that could be conceived, let alone hoped for, in the field of tax reform was a modest reduction in the rate of income taxation. Todaywhether or not major changes occur in the first session of the 104th Congressthe serious talk among congressional leaders is about imposing a flat tax, or even tearing up the tax code by the roots and replacing the income tax with a broad-based tax on consumption.<p>
Similarly, "welfare reform" in 1994 meant, at best, doing a little nipping and tucking on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Today, the entire burden of administering most of the nation's huge welfare programs is on its way back to the 50 individual states, along with block grants to finance it.<p>
And so it went, in one field after another, from unfunded mandates to the line-item veto; this new House of Representatives has dared to think and act in ways that have simply transformed the paradigms of American politics. It remains true that "politics is the art of the possible," but a huge number of new possibilities has opened up.<p>
Whether the First Hundred Days of this House will ultimately deserve comparison to the First Hundred Days of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency depends upon how successful the Republicans are in setting their initiatives in concrete, as the New Dealers managed to set theirs. At this writing, and probably for several years to come, it is simply too early to tell. Much depends on how the voters react in November 1996, when they will, with their votes, make their first and perhaps most important comment on the Republican performance. Almost as crucial, however, will be the way in which future Republican presidents and Congresses follow up on the achievements of the 104th.<p>
Any major mistakes? Yes, one: The failure to anticipate and prepare for the Democrats' counterattack, based on the tired old charge that Republicans want to starve America's children and stuff the money into the pockets of the rich. Don't be fooled by the sheer implausibility of such an accusationa big enough lie will be believed, by a small but often crucial percentage of the voters, if it isn't nailed promptly and repeatedly by spokesmen whom the media cannot ignore. (Note how disastrously the Bush administration let the liberals rewrite the whole history of the 1980s.) We may yet pay dearly for the Republican party's sloth in this regard.<p>

<p>
The House Republican Leadership did most of what it said it would do in the Contract With America. The result was a remarkable legislative flurry that largely fulfilled the campaign promises that so many Republicans made during the 1994 elections.<p>
How do we compare this Republican onslaught in 1995 with FDR's First Hundred Days in 1933? Both were years of high legislative intensity; both years are likely to be described later as landmarks in 20th-century political history. And, in both years, the discussion of ideas dominated the media.<p>
The differences between the two events are more interesting, and in some cases more subtle. Obviously, the Republicans were critical of Big Government and skeptical of the idea that man can improve his condition through central planning. The Republicans had zeal, but no faith in the perfectibility of man. By contrast, FDR's New Deal promoted the idea that government could solve economic problemsthat individual liberty had to be sacrificed and power centralized in Washington to attack the Great Depression. FDR's spirits were high because he believed man to be capable of pulling the levers and turning the wheels to effectively control America's destiny.<p>
Another difference is often overlooked. The Republican Contract was a conscious, thoughtful, and usually coherent plan that went from campaign document to legislative writ. The New Deal was improvisational and contradictory right from the start. During the 1932 campaign, for example, FDR denounced Hoover for his "reckless spending" and budget deficits. The New Deal to come was never outlined. But in Roosevelt's First Hundred Days, he reversed himself. In just three months, he pushed and signed bills that authorized government to spend almost as much as Hoover did in his entire presidency. FDR wanted a government program for each constituency: AAA for farmers, FERA for the unemployed, TVA for the South, CCC for the young, and so on.<p>
His First Hundred Days were crucial because they shattered the notion that government worked best when it was limited. Government became a Mecca for interest groups that wanted to secure benefits from Washington, so much so that FDR, after his First Hundred Days, could not control the claimants. Cities flooded Congress with requests for road-building money; veterans won cash bonuses for past service; the silver lobby wangled from Washington more subsidy money than even the farmers could manage. American politics had crossed a threshold.<p>
The Republican Contract is a response to the rise of this welfare state and to the twofold protest that the New Deal/Great Society programs mostly haven't worked, and taxes to pay for them are too high. These two points are addressed in part by the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it had included Congressman Dick Armey's flat-tax proposalinstead of seeking to manipulate the current system of tax deductionsthe Contract could have challenged the New Deal more effectively. Special-interest politics, as Roosevelt learned, needs to extract money from some groups in order to support others. A progressive income tax is indispensable to a growing welfare state. In office, FDR soon hiked the top marginal tax rate to 79 percent; later he pushed it to 90 percent. A flat tax, by contrast, forces supporters of new government programs (and old ones, for that matter) to admit they will tax all to benefit a few. That admission alone might lead many to rethink the strong role of government in American society.<p>

Of course it wasn't the same as those Hundred Days. In March 1933, when FDR got Congress to enact a slew of government-aggrandizing lawsthus triggering the New Deal that vastly expanded Washington's control17 million citizens had lost their jobs, 5,000 banks had collapsed, and the nation was mired in the most frightening depression in its history. Amid mass desperation, a Democratic president with a fresh mandate was able to get a Democratic Congress to more or less pass anything he wanted.<p>
The national mood in January 1995, by contrast, was nowhere near as frantic. When Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans uncorked their political revolution, they benefited from none of the panic-driven momentum that the Depression had lent Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats 62 years earlier. Instead, they faced an enemy in the White House, a largely hostile press corps, a $1.6 trillion federal establishment more likely to munch ground glass than relinquish power without a death-struggle, and a Senate led by Bob Dole.So, no, in terms of legislation completed, Gingrich's First Hundred Days don't compare with FDR's. But measured against other yardsticks, the House Republicans' quick-march through the Contract With America was even more significant.<p>
The customary formula of federal politics is: The president proposes, Congress disposes. So thoroughly did Gingrich and his army upend that piece of conventional wisdom that by the end of a hundred days, Bill Clinton was reduced to insisting that he still mattered. "The president," he sniffled in a mid-April press conference, "is relevant here."<p>
The Republicans upended another piece of conventional wisdom: that platformsi.e., ideasdon't win or lose elections. The life cycles of modern party platforms are familiar. Party members meet. They brawl over a couple of planks. They vote for a platform everyone can live with. Then they print a few copies nobody will ever read or care about.<p>
In 1994, GOP House candidates followed a completely different path. They gathered to sign a brief "contract" whose details weren't yet drafted, but whose main promisedrastically reduced federal powerwas crystal-clear. The pundits promptly consigned it to oblivion. Tens of millions of copies appeared in print. And an intense ideological campaign was then waged between the party that wrote the Contract and the party that reviled it.<p>
Never in modern U.S. politics has a party platforma party's statement of principlesmattered more. Two years ago, they lost a White House they had virtually owned because their incumbent didn't grasp the power of "the vision thing"; in November, Republicans conquered a Congress thought to be permanently closed to them precisely because they did.<p>
Or did they?<p>
Right after the GOP won its astonishing victory, Gingrich articulated his Prime Directive: "Cooperate, yes. Compromise, no." Right after that, the compromising began.<p>
The provision for a three-fifths supermajority to approve tax increases was dropped from the Balanced Budget Amendment. The national-security bill was stripped of missile defense. The unfunded-mandates bill repealed precisely zero unfunded federal mandates. The GOP's crime bill wound up with the same price tag as the supposedly "pork-filled" Democratic version of last year. The bloated food-stamp program was exempted from welfare reform. Term limits were croaked.<p>
The Clinton tax increases that Republicans had unanimously opposed in 1993 were left virtually intact. Republicans talked of "zeroing out" government subsidies for the arts and public broadcastinguntil Garth Brooks came by to lobby, and the talk dried up. The House passed a legal-reform bill that federalized great swaths of tort law. Enthusiasm for eliminating entire Cabinet departments was limited to feisty freshmen with no clout and conservative think tanks with no vote. And to mark the completion of the First Hundred Days, Gingrich declared in a television address that his party was certainly not proposing to actually shrink the federal budget.<p>
In its First Hundred Days, the new GOP House majority ignited the conservative revolution it had been elected to achieve. Without question, it has changed the terms of debate on the Hill. But before their sprint through the Contract was done, the Republicans were once again showing the symptoms that had always doomed them in the past: weak knees and thin skin.<p>

<p>
Speaker Gingrich and his lieutenants fulfilled to the letter the Contract with America pledge that ten important issues would be taken to a vote in the House. Observers must be impressed, moreover, by the GOP's passage of nine of these, and by the party's ability to round up four-fifths of its members for the failed term-limits constitutional amendment. The new House leadership has established a remarkable working model of a disciplined, responsible party motivated by deeply-felt principleson one side of Capitol Hill.<p>
And when one looks for long-term significance, there's the rub. As of this writing, the Balanced Budget Amendment has already failed in the Senate, which is widely expected to reject or drastically modify other Contract items. In addition, President Clinton may muster the courage, conviction, or pragmatic judgment to wield a veto or two. What comes out of the Senate and White House legislative sausage-grinders will likely strike Contract devotees as inferior bratwurst rather than fine tenderloin. No, this will not be as significant as FDR's First Hundred Days.<p>
What major mistakes did the Republicans make? Clearly they still need to work on what George Bush might have called "the message thing." Admittedly, it is no easy task to get a conservative perspective past the filter of a predominantly liberal-leaning national media, but it can be done. The leadership was blindsided on the school-lunch issue, although the Democratic tactics were predictable. Thanks to Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of political careerism, network television played the term-limits debate as primarily an argument among Republicans rather than one between Republicans and Democrats. In the absence of a Jack Kemp able to explain in appealing terms the importance of preferences for capital gains and savings, the Democrats appear to have achieved an advantage on the tax-equity issue. Finally, the Speaker, for all his intramural leadership skills, oscillates wildly between flashes of brilliance and egregious gaffes. As a result, he enjoys less public esteem than he deserves.<p>
At the end of the hundred days, the Republicans remain locked in a continuing struggle with the Democrats for the soul of an angry, alienated "populistic" segment of the electoratesimilar to the swing constituency once called "Middle America" and these days attracted to Ross Perot. The GOP can prevail when it convincingly depicts the Democrats as the party of the special interests (affirmative-action beneficiaries, welfare bureaucrats, etc.), but the issue can be used by the Democrats when they depict the Republicans as advocates of tax breaks for "the rich" or abusers of mothers and children. The argument remains unsettled; the Republicans need to do a much better job of articulating their side of it.<p>
Corrosively cynical, this populistic electorate seems to see only business as usual in Washington and is unlikely to give the Republicans much credit for an imperfectly fulfilled Contract. It also still appears prone to believe the budget can be balanced simply by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while leaving entitlements and pork untouched. It remains uncertain whether this group, or America at large, is prepared for the consequences of a smaller federal establishment: greater local and individual self-reliance.<p>
One last thought: If conservatives want to be successful, they had better stop depicting themselves as involved in a sweeping effort to uproot the New Deal. Speaker Gingrich (perhaps consciously drawing on the example of Ronald Reagan) was right on target in professing admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt and at least some of his accomplishments. The Republicans were elected to reverse the lingering excesses of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, not to take us back to the world of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.<p><I>

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to speed.<p>
The First Hundred Days of the Republican majority were like a laser showfull of color and sound, but so fast and furious that it was difficult for voters to single out the constituent parts.<p>
The Contract gave shape to the first months of Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, which might otherwise have been characterized by fits and starts. Though designed primarily as a vote-getter, the Contract also served extremely well to enforce party discipline. Everyone understood the promise, everyone was committed to the schedule, and factiousness among Republicans was kept to a minimum.<p>
That was the advantage of speed. The disadvantage is that the individual terms of the Contract, many of which deserved a greater hearing, more explanation, and more time before the public, were given short shrift. Few Americans really understand the benefits of tort reform, welfare reform, or regulatory reform.<p>
In a bravura performance over the First Hundred Days, the Republicans made only two errors. The first was the excessive attention to the question of whether or not to punish Senator Mark Hatfield for his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment. In so doing, Republicans themselves (without help from the media) made Hatfield and, accordingly, internecine Republican quarrels, the story of the BBA's failure. In fact, the story ought to have been the six Democrats who switched their votes and defeated a bill they had supported only months before. Hatfield is a liberal Republican. He voted his conscience. Punishment would have been futile. Besides, his breed is dying out. He does not represent the future of the GOP. Effort spent trying to "fix" him would be better directed elsewhere.<p>
The other error was the failure to anticipate the reaction among liberals (especially in the press) to changes in the school-lunch program. Of course the liberals were dishonest, unscrupulous, and brazen in their depiction of the terms of debate ("starving children" indeed!), but it is the job of conservatives in America to prepare for that pitch and knock it out of the park. Ronald Reagan knew that Jimmy Carter was going to portray him as a mad bomber in the 1980 presidential debates, and he was ready with a riposte: "There you go again." But Republicans were caught flat-footed when Democrats accused them of trying to take food from the mouths of babes.<p>
Still, only two mistakes in three months is an enviable record. I wish I could match it.<p><I>

While the fulfillment of the House Republicans' Contract With America in just 92 days is largely worth rejoicing, this momentous occasion also illustrates how Americans have "defined democracy down" through the years. The House's single-minded passage of the Contract's provisions (with the unfortunate and sloppily-handled exception of term limits) was an exhilarating interval in recent political history. Still, the balloons and streamers flew over the U.S. Capitol after the Contract's completion precisely because the House GOP accomplished what Americans should normally expect of their representatives: They engaged them with ideas. They pledged to vote on them, then did so, as promised.<p>
Although this sort of innovation and accountability should be routine, they instead are refreshing departures from the recent national campaigns that have enflamed public cynicism. George Bush's abandoned "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge and Bill Clinton's phantom "middle-class tax cut" illustrate this problem. The Contract's greatest legacy may be that it reversed the rising tide of antagonism that had severely eroded Washington's goodwill with the American public. Now that House Republicans have actually kept their word on the Contract, Congress today enjoys its highest approval rating in years.<p>
Assuming the Senate and President Clinton cooperate, the enactment of most Contract items, per se, will not influence American politics as profoundly as did FDR in his First Hundred Days. However, the paradigm shift that has accompanied the Contract likely will parallel the new thinking that FDR inspired 62 years ago. The Contract and the GOP's takeover of Congress have led Washington to discuss seriously the abolition of the income tax, the closing of at least four Cabinet departments, and a balanced budget by 2002. House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt has now embraced tax simplification, while Bill Clinton has placed federal affirmative-action policies under a microscope. These realities would have been mere hallucinations just nine months ago. By committing themselves to a coherent "vision thing," today's GOP has moved the entire plate of acceptable discourse tectonically to the right.<p>
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies, however, stumbled badly on the so-called "school-lunch" issue. Democrats stereotypically pummel GOP budget cuts and block grants with dusty rhetoric about "starving babies" and "at-risk infants." Republicans should have anticipated these attacks after seeing them haunt Ronald Reagan and George Bush for 12 years. Opening with a salvo against corporate welfaresuch as having Archer-Daniels-Midland tycoon Dwayne Andreas explain to a subcommittee why his multi-billion-dollar agroempire deserves federal subsidieswould have blunted Democratic charges about GOP "greed" and "meanness." So would have energetic reminders that vibrant economic growth especially lifts the poor and unemployed.<p>
The Contract also failed to address the coming entitlements meltdown. While Speaker Gingrich insists it is "off the table," Social Security, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and other give-away programs, jeopardize America's future financial well-being. While a promise to vote on affluence-testing or privatization of these programs would have made the Contract far more controversial, it also would have shown the GOP exhibiting genuine courage. Now, without a mandate to do so, the Republican-led 104th Congress must show even greater bravery by confronting entitlements (try balancing the budget without doing so). Or, it simply can stand back and watch Social Security and Medicare eat us alive. <p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the new Republican House leadership deserve thanks and congratulations for the successful completion of the Contract With America. What a revolutionary (or more correctly, counterrevolutionary) series of events has taken place! With the Contract, a promise to the American people was made; in a little less than the promised hundred days, the promise was kept. Of what other Congress in this century can that be said?<p>
Certainly some needed changes were made to vexing and intolerable House rules; for the first time, national laws passed by Congress will apply to the House as well as ordinary Americans. Having to live by the rules made for the rest of us cannot but raise the consciousness of the rulemakers and dissuade them from their excesses.<p>
Certainly some important legislation was passed by the House in those historic hundred days. Congress agreed to stop imposing mandates on state and local jurisdictions without paying the bill; such progress was nearly undreamt of in our philosophy just a few months before the Contract was unveiled. Is this important? Indeed it is. Is it enough? Perhaps not. Our liberties have already been eroding for decades; what's worse, the cost of the erosion has been passed down the line. Far better for Congress to forswear dreaming up silly rules to begin with; agreeing to pay their cost only solves half the problem. But let us not quibble with progress in the right direction. The looming struggle to actually cut federal spending by billions of dollars may preclude any more erosions.<p>
Congratulations are also deserved for passing a tax cut and for stepping forth on welfare reform. Has the American public forgotten the promises made by then-Governor Bill Clinton when he campaigned for president? A middle-class tax cut? The end of welfare as we know it? The new House leadership promised both, and they, not Clinton, kept the promise.<p>
But a word of caution on the welfare-reform proposals: Just as limited congratulations are due for eliminating unfunded mandates, limited caution is due for proposing to send money to the states in the form of block grants with no strings attached. This will create, as someone has noted, "funded unmandates."<p>
For those of us in California, this is an interesting exercise in neofederalisma tasty bit of proper philosophy, or revolutionary devolution, if you will. The warning is this: The California legislature, perhaps more than any other state legislature, has suffered from Congress-envy for at least the last three decades. If California legislators suddenly find billions of dollars dropped in their allegedly bare general-fund cupboard, what mischief might they do? Conservatives and libertarians alike want major programs such as welfare brought closer to us, closer to our scrutiny, closer to our effective control. Will we get what we want, or will we get a more fearsome monster than the current federal system? In this case, sense may have been sacrificed for speed; again, the federal government would do far better to reduce taxes, forswearing the revenue, than collecting and then returning the money in skewed proportions.<p>
All in all, hearty congratulations to the House Republican leadership! Promises made, promises keptwho could ask for more? At least, who could ask for more in the First Hundred Days? May the next five hundred days go as well! Legislators keeping promisesit might catch on.<p><I>

The Contract With America committed the House Republicans to raising and voting on each of the Contract items. This was accomplished and should be considered a major shift from politics as usual.<p>
One major frustration that Americans have expressed in recent years is that they vote for change but get only lip service from political leaders. The significance in the Contract With America is that a group of politicians did what they said they would. The Contract raises the level of political debate to one of performance and effectiveness, rather than distortion, political expediency, and misrepresentation by political officials, candidates, and parties.<p>
The greatness of these hundred days is that they changed the political process. The substantive change is yet to be determined. It is still too early to tell whether the policies passed by the House in the First Hundred Days will become law, and if so, what effect they will ultimately have on American life and culture.<p>
Even now, however, we can see a shifting of attitude among the American people. Inherent in the policy and legislative changes proposed in the Republicans' First Hundred Days are the notions of individual responsibility and accountability for one's actions. Government appears to be seen as a catalyst and facilitator for change, but not the ultimate determinant of the individual lives of our citizens.<p>
Major mistakes during the First Hundred Days include the failure to support term limits as forcefully as other elements of the Contract. The leadership vacillated and approached this issue tentatively. They should have committed firmly to this issue, which was approved in all of the 22 states where it was considered by the voters.<p>
The leadership allowed the debate to deteriorate into "them vs. us" on issues such as the school-lunch program and the group-home concept for unwed teenage mothers without stable homes of their own. The leadership allowed these ideas and "those conservative Republicans" supporting them to be portrayed as insensitive or callous. They should instead have placed the true nature of these issues at the center of the debate.<p><I>

Buried deep within one of the many articles that sought to account for the tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain last year was a most surprising revelation. According to Village Voice writer Sarah Ferguson, the grunge-rock pioneer's favorite television shows included Leave It to Beaver and Mayberry, R.F.D.<p>
That a cutting-edge cultural icon married to alternative rock's premier feminist (Courtney Love, of the band Hole) could have such retrograde, politically incorrect viewing tastes was, in Ferguson's mind, "odd." But it was also revealing. Grunge rock "is music for kids who grew up too fast," Ferguson says. "It engages in a kind of mournful nostalgia for a childhood without violation." <p>
Cobain was certainly no stranger to violation. Every significant examination of his life regards the divorce of his parents as a major turning point. In fact, so painful were Cobain's memories of the divorce that he once held a gun to his head and told his wife, "I'd rather die than divorce."<p>
Clearly, one does not have to regard Mayberry as nirvana in order to believe that Cobain and many members of his generation would have fared far better if they had grown up in something resembling Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. Yet, few people todayeven conservativesare prepared to confront the problem that first sent Cobain's young life reeling. Indeed, when Dan Quayle returned last year to the San Francisco club where he gave his famous 1992 Murphy Brown speech, he was quick to point out that when he spoke of the problems surrounding single-parent families, he wasn't referring to "households where the father has died, or even where he is separated by divorce." Rather, Quayle said, he was referring to "those households that have never known a father."<p>
Now, in fairness to Quayle, he also noted that "the ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family." Nevertheless, by suggesting that divorce has more in common with death (which is almost always involuntary) than with illegitimacy (almost always voluntary), Quayle's remarks contribute to the trivialization of divorce at a time when social scientists are increasingly likely to agree that the impact of divorce on children is almost always negative and often devastating.<p>
Indeed, as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead argued in her celebrated article on family break-up in the Atlantic Monthly, divorcelike illegitimacyis strongly linked to a wide variety of negative outcomes for children, from child abuse and neglect to serious juvenile crime. A 1994 study of juveniles in the Wisconsin correction system found that 1 in 3 came from divorced or separated homes. Several studies show that unmarried girls whose parents divorce are much more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant out of wedlock than girls from intact households. A 1994 study by researchers at Duke and North Carolina State University reported that family dissolution is a stronger predictor of suicide for young males than such factors as unemployment.<p>
Despite the clear impact of family break-up on children, "some people aren't comfortable talking about divorce and adultery," former Education Secretary William Bennett told a Christian Coalition conference last year. "But it seems to me we have to talk about them. They are before us, and they have great consequences."<p>
Great indeed. The number of children directly affected by divorce has more than doubled in a generation, from 463,000 in 1960 to 985,000 in 1991. Until political and cultural leaders give proper attention to the link between divorce and many of our nation's most serious social problemscrime, poverty, educational declinewe stand little chance of reversing these trends. <p> <b><center>Too Close to Home</b></center>
<p>
One of the obvious reasons there is less public handwringing about divorce than illegitimacy is because divorce hits closer to home in middle America. As Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute recently observed, "Whereas illegitimacy happens mostly among people who live on the other side of the tracks, much divorce and separation takes place in 'our' own neighborhoods, indeed among our friends and relations, and sometimes even ourselves." Divorce is subject to the phenomenon Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "defining deviancy down," in which a society loses its capacity to define certain problems as problems because of their sheer prevalence. Illegitimacy, conversely, continues to be viewed as "deviant" because it is still fairly rare among the middle and upper classes.<p>
It is frequently asserted that half of all marriages end in divorce. The number, derived by comparing the annual number of marriages to the annual number of divorces, overstates the likelihood of a failed first marriage.  This is because the number is skewed upward by the experience of men and women who have gone through divorce many times. The truth is that about one quarter of all adults who have ever been married in America today have also experienced divorce.<p>
Still, divorce is common enough that to raise concerns about it publicly is to risk being impolitic. As Bennett puts it, "The rules are broken down. If you leave your wife and get yourself a 'trophy wife,' you're not going to be greeted with condemnation or even a raised eye by most people, because it has become a convention."<p>
Not only has this convention stifled debate, but it has helped create an expectation of marital failure that can be seen throughout our culture. A recent cartoon in a major publication depicted one young adult saying to another, "It's only marriage I'm proposing after all, not a lifetime commitment." Similarly, in a recent Newsweek story on divorce, one young woman explained why she limited the guest list at her wedding to 70 people, less than one third the size of her sister's wedding list: "I was afraid to make that much of an investment," she said. "What if it didn't work out? Then, I'd have to tell all those people." <p>
Such apprehensions about marriage are especially common among those whose parents have split up. A study by Pamela Webster, a sociologist at Brown University, found that adults whose parents had divorced rated their own chances of divorcing to be considerably higher than did adults whose parents had not divorced. This finding held up even when comparing groups of couples who rated their marital happiness equally. <p>
Sadly, expectations of marital failure have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologist Silvio Silvestri reports that adult children of divorced parents are four times more likely to get divorced than adult children of intact couples. <p><b><center>The Myth of the Good Divorce</center></b> <p>
Another hindrance to public discussion of marital dissolution  is that many Americans still want to believe that divorce can lead to greater personal fulfillment and stronger relationships between men and women. In the closing scene of the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire, the central character offers some grandmotherly advice to a young girl trying to come to terms with her parents' break-up. "Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together," Mrs. Doubtfire says. "They don't fight all the time and they can become better people and much better mommies and daddies." <p>
However much many would like to believe this view of divorce, it is increasingly at odds with the experiences of both children and adults. A study at the University of Oregon found that the impact of divorce on a woman's health and well-being is far more serious than the impact of being fired. Another study, from the University of Alberta, shows that divorced or separated individuals are roughly three times as likely to commit suicide as married people. The University of Texas reports that "divorced men exhibit substantially higher rates of psychological distress and alcohol consumption than do married men." And David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research reports that "being divorced and a non-smoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying married."<p>
These and other research findings recently prompted an eclectic group of prominent scholars known as the Council on Families to issue a report decrying the state of marriage in America. The report observed, "In the domain of marriage and family life, our recent explosions of freedom have taken a terrible and largely unexpected toll. Relationships between men and women are not improving; they are becoming more difficult and more unhappy. Many women are experiencing chronic economic insecurity. Many men are isolated and estranged from their children. Many more people are lonely."<p><b><center>Rebuilding the Walls</b></center>
<p>
Over the last three decades, the walls surrounding lifelong marriage have crumbled. The age-old social barriers to divorce, promiscuity, illegitimacy, and cohabitation have been removed in the name of promoting personal freedom and self-expression. A growing number of peopleespecially those in Cobain's generationnow know first-hand that the walls that were thought to entrap and restrict were really there to protect.<p>
So how can the walls be rebuilt? How can confidence in the institution of marriage be restored? Although it would be a mistake to draw inspiration from the last three decades of welfare-state activism, there are some constructive models for addressing certain social problems. One such model is the anti-smoking movement.<p>
At a time when virtually every other area of American life was becoming more and more permissive, the anti-smoking movement succeeded in convincing the American public to adopt less permissive attitudes about smoking. Not only did many Americans change their own behavior (the proportion of adult smokers fell from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 25.6 percent in 1991), but Americans supported efforts to modify the behavior of others. <p>
The anti-smokers' success was due to many factors, including:<ul>
<li>
The careful collection and dissemination of compelling research on the health risks of smoking and inhaling second-hand smoke;<li>
The effective use of media persuasion, including articles, op-eds, essays, reports, and public-service advertisements;<li>
The tireless pursuit of incremental changes in public policy (limiting sales to minors, banning smoking on airplanes and in public buildings, etc.); <li>
The periodic sponsorship of special events (like the Great American Smoke-Out) to raise public awareness and spur private action;<li>
The ongoing provision of practical services (counseling, support groups, etc.) to people interested in behavioral change.</ul>
<p>
To restore confidence in marriage, we need a similar multidimensional strategy. This strategy should seek to repeat the anti-smokers' success, giving particular emphasis to the following four ideas:<p>
Focus on the future. For many people, the subject of divorce is intensely personal and extremely painful. It evokes bad memories and bitter feelings. As such, no attempt to restore public confidence in the institution of marriage is likely to succeed unless it is forward-looking. <p>
This means focusing public attention on lowering the divorce rate henceforth. And it means giving greater emphasis to the future choices of today's young people than to the choices made by their parents. "It may be unreasonable to expect a widespread change of heart about marriage among today's adults," states the Council on Families. "But young people can and often do strive to rebel, to be idealistic, and to do things differently than their elders."<p>
Indeed, in one marriage-related areasexualitythere is already evidence of a movement among today's young people to challenge norms ushered in by their parents' generation. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of young people have joined public campaigns pledging to save sex for marriage, and the proportion of high schoolers who report that they have had sexual intercourse at least once has declined by at least 6 percentage points since 1990.<p>
A youth-oriented campaign extolling the virtues of lifelong marriage is likely to win support from intact married couples. And it should win support as well from many who have experienced divorce, since most divorced parents want marital success for their children every bit as much as intact couples do. 	<p>
Still, success will not come easily. While many children of divorce long for the strong, enduring marriages their parents never had, many are wary of commitment and fear repeating their parents' mistakes. This is one reason cohabitation is so prevalent among the young. Yet, far from increasing the likelihood of marital success, "trial marriages" actually are linked to higher divorce rates. Indeed, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that 40 percent of cohabiting unions disintegrate before marriage, and that marital unions that begin as a cohabiting relationship have a 50 percent higher rate of divorce than those that do not. <p>
Challenge the church. No cultural institution is more important to the restoration of marriage than the religious community. Churches and synagogues claim a time-honored, divinely-ordained role to help couples understand the moral and spiritual nature of their marriage vows. Religious institutions bear a unique responsibility for helping those embarking on and struggling to maintain marriage commitments. Similarly, only faith communities can offer redemptive hope to people who have experienced marital failure.<p>
While religious leaders do not bear full responsibility for the absence of public discourse about divorce, they can hardly blame others for the failure of many marriages. Author Michael McManus notes that many churches have become "blessing machines" that wed interested couples but offer few marriage-related services, like counseling for engaged and married couples, practical advice on how to strengthen troubled marriages, and mentoring programs for younger couples.<p>
Sermons that warn against divorce or condemn the casual termination of marriages are not popular among some ministers, McManus says. Sermons that acknowledge that the Bible prohibits remarriage in some cases (Matthew 5:32) are even less popular, even though unqualified acceptance of divorce and remarriage can only discourage marital perseverance.<p>
The failure of the church (particularly the Protestant church) to significantly influence the surrounding culture can be seen in the fact that four of the six states with the worst divorce rates in the country (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) are found right in the heart of the Bible Belt.<p>
When religious leaders take seriously their responsibility for strengthening marriage in their congregations and their communities, divorce does decline. For example, several years ago, ministers in Peoria, Illinois, adopted a community marriage policy that stated none of the city's churches would marry any couple that had not completed a premarital counseling program. In the three-year period after the pact was adopted, Peoria's divorce rate fell nearly 20 percent.<p>
Elevate marriage in public policy. America's retreat from marriage is first and foremost a problem of the heart. It cannot be fixed by the issuance of a government decree or by the adoption of a new government policy. <p>
This does not mean, however, that reform of public policy has no place in a larger strategy to restore confidence in marriage. The law is a teacher. America's casual attitudes about marital permanence are both reflected in and advanced by laws that permit "no-fault" divorce in cases where one spouse wishes to preserve the union, and by laws that require some married couples to pay dramatically higher taxes than cohabiting couples.<p>
Reversing these misguided policies will not only help those directly affected by them, but will also teach others that lifelong marriage is the normative standard our society upholds. Thus, pro-marriage policy reform is both an end in itself, in that it corrects legal wrongs, and a means to an end, in that it stimulates a broader cultural appreciation of marital permanence.<p>
How, then, do we solve these problems? Michigan's state legislature is considering a divorce-reform proposal that would require the establishment of "fault" in cases where one spouse wants to preserve the marriage. This change (and a similar provision requiring "fault" in cases where children are involved) would make family abandonment more difficult by offering greater legal protection to innocent parties in divorce cases.<p>
In the tax front, three ideas deserve attention. Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute advocates the resurrection of "income-splitting," a practice that allows married couples to divide their total earnings evenly between them before assessing their tax liability. This practice prevents a second income from kicking couples into a higher tax bracketwhether that second income comes from a wage-earning wife or a moonlighting husband. <p>
Another tax option worth considering is a deduction that would adjust tax liability not just for marital status, but also for marital longevity. Tax benefits that modestly increase with each year that a couple stays together would allow a portion of the societal benefit associated with marital stability to be claimed by those who have been married the longest.<p>
Certainly, one must guard against wildly skewing the tax code to promote social goals. But if divorce truly imposes economic costs on society (higher crime, greater need for remedial education, higher health-care costs, and the like), then it may be beneficial to allow lifelong married partners to pay slightly lower taxes than their contemporaries who are married for the second or third time.<p>
Finally, we should consider eliminating "means-testing" in various government programs, since income-based limits on program eligibility tend to penalize marriage. Some married households with income above the threshold can qualify for benefits if they split up and form two separate households. Likewise, some cohabiting couples able to claim benefits as unmarried individuals would lose their benefits if they were to marry and combine their household income.<p>
Valorize marital toughness. There is a common misconception that couples who have good, solid, enduring marriages are "lucky." Supposedly, happily married couples do not face any of the conflicts and struggles that other couples face. They do not go through rough times or encounter serious relational turbulence.<p>
The truth is, every marriage faces trials and hardships and breakdowns in communication. Yes, some couples manage to limit conflict better than others, but every marriage faces difficulties. Ruth Bell Graham was once asked if she had ever contemplated divorcing her husband, evangelist Billy Graham. "No," she said, "but I have considered murder."<p>
If every marriage faces challenges, why is it that some survive and others do not? According to John Gottman, of the University of Washington at Seattle, couples that succeed work hard at resolving conflict. In his recent book, Why Marriages Succeed or Fail, Gottman argues that many of the theories about why some couples divorcemoney problems, sexual disagreements, incompatibility, and so onfail to explain why other equally dissatisfied couples confronting these very same issues do not split up. The real issue, Gottman concludes, is not money or sex or compatibility. The real issue, instead, is whether couples are willing and able to work out their marital differences.<p>
Research by social scientists Nick Stinnett and John DeFrain shows that one of the seven characteristics commonly found in strong, healthy families is the ability to deal effectively with conflict and crisis. Like Gottman, Stinnett and DeFrain find that couples who have to work through difficult problems believe that experience strengthens their marriages. This is important, because most public discussion about divorce revolves around whether divorce would be better than a marriage in which spouses are fighting all the time. This framework assumes falsely that a marriage gone sour can never be made sweet again. It encourages many couples to throw in the towel prematurely. <p>
David Blankenhorn, the president of the Institute for American Values, argues that a broad spectrum of marriages exists in America today. At one end are a small percentage of marriages that are almost effortlessly blissful; at the other, a small percentage that are headed for almost certain failure. Between these two extremes, Blankenhorn says, are the overwhelming majority of marriages: unions that can, with grit and perseverance, not only endure but prosper. <p>
Encouraging lasting commitment in a society that seeks instant gratification is no small challenge. But if it is true that people tend to do those things that are most apt to earn them a good reputation, then it follows that deliberate efforts to valorize marital toughness and perseverance are needed in everything from high-school textbooks to Hollywood movie scripts. At the very least, such efforts could help counterbalance existing cultural messages that undercut marital permanence and stability.<p>
Efforts to valorize enduring commitment should be particularly targeted at men, who historically have shown a greater propensity to neglect family responsibilities than have women. Turning the hearts of men to their families may do more to address divorce (and many other social problems) than any other proposed remedy. On this front, the most encouraging signs on the cultural landscape are the emergence of groups urging men to see that self-sacrifice is a defining characteristic of authentic masculinity. The National Fatherhood Initiative is devising strategies to restore the importance of fathers in society's thinking about family and community life. The National Center for Fathering helps provide dads with practical childrearing skills. The Promise Keepers movement challenges men to make and keep a set of pledges to their wives and families. This year, more than 600,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers conferences and seminars.<p>
Given the tenuous state of marriage in Americaand the tragic consequences of divorce on kids like Kurt Cobainone should hope that these efforts succeed. America desperately needs more men to commit themselves to their wives in the way that Theodore Roosevelt once did. On the day that his wife accepted his marriage proposal, Roosevelt wrote in his journal: "The aim of my whole life shall be to make her happy and to shield her and guard her from trial, and, oh, how I shall cherish my sweet queen. How she, so pure and sweet and beautiful can think of marrying me, I cannot understand, but I praise and thank God it is so."

It was a horrible tragedy, as much for the mental images it generated as for the death toll. On September 3, 1991, at around 8 a.m., a fire broke out at a chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina.  As the grease fire started on a chicken fryer and spread quickly inside the Imperial Foods Products building, workers tried desperately to escape the smoke and flames, clawing at locked exit doors in panic. Twenty-five Imperial employees didn't make it. Fifty-six more were injured in the blaze. The event made national headlines and attracted everyone from network news reporters to Jesse Jackson, who visited in an attempt to link the chicken-plant tragedy to the national civil-rights movement. "I see the same faces here that I saw in Memphis, Tennessee, with Dr. [Martin Luther] King," he said. "Just basic, humble people who want to work and get a fair day's wages for a fair day's work."<p>
Furious voices denounced state and federal safety inspectors, as well as the state's business community. During 1992 and 1993, the Hamlet fire became the cause clbre of politicians and activists seeking tougher workplace-safety laws in Congress, including a greatly expanded Occupational Safety and Health Administration and new mandates on businesses. As Hamlet became a national symbol for corporate irresponsibility in workplace safety, one small but significant detail escaped the notice of many in Congress and the media. Those exit doors that sealed the deathtrap had been ordered closed and locked by the federal government.<p>
The problem with the Imperial plant, a U.S. Department of Agriculture poultry inspector had said the previous June, was flies. "Both doors at the [trash] compactor was [sic] open when I arrived at 8:45 p.m.," the inspector wrote in a deficiency report. "Several flies [were] observed in all areas of the plant." Imperial's response, also written into the deficiency report, was to promise that the outside doors "will be kept locked." The inspector verified that corrective action had taken place.<p>
Imperial Foods was hardly blameless in the tragedyvarious safety problems existed at the time of the firebut heavy-handed government regulation was also partly responsible. The chicken plant was one of the few employers in a poor, rural community. It ran on a very thin margin, using an old building and struggling every week to keep production going. Installing state-of-the-art alarm doors at the side and rear of the plant was an expensive proposition. When forced by federal edict to make a tradeoff between food quality and worker safety, plant managers chose the former, with disastrous results.<p>
Fast forward to 1995. A new Republican majority in Congress, intent on balancing the federal budget, has targeted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for cuts. In an attempt to defend OSHA, the Clinton administration announced a plan in May to make compliance less onerous to business and to judge safety inspectors on the basis of safety records for companies they oversee, not on the number of citations they write. "This is the new face of OSHA," said Elaine Kamarck, senior policy advisor for Vice President Gore and director of his "reinventing government" initiative.<p>
But a Congress committed not only to budget savings but also to sound policymaking should go far beyond redesigning OSHA's inspection program or, as some GOP lawmakers have suggested, simply cutting its budget in half. There is no need for the federal government to inspect American workplaces, issue regulations, and fine employers for violating federal safety rules, and the attempt to do so has accomplished virtually nothing for American workers except burden their employers with regulations.<p>
A 1991 study by Wayne B. Gray of the National Bureau of Economic Research found that OSHA regulations have "significantly reduced productivity growth in the U.S.," even more than those from the Environmental Protection Agency. Some OSHA standards have put a search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Benzene standards, for example, have cost firms and consumers $23 million per life saved; arsenic standards, $24 million. Standards for asbestos, EDB, and formaldehyde have also cost many millions of dollars per life saved. These huge sums might better be spent publicly or privately on other measures that save lives at dramatically lower costs. Screening programs for cervical and colon cancer, for example, cost about $50,000 per life saved, while measures to increase highway safetysuch as improving lighting, upgrading guard rails, installing median barriers, and improving bridgescost between $100,000 and $200,000 per life saved.<p>
OSHA has required employers to label machines and substances at the workplace with little regard for reason or significant risk. Dr. Michael Segal, of Harvard Medical School, reports that OSHA regulators have ordered suppliers of many of his laboratories' chemicals to label them as workplace hazards, including sodium chloride (table salt): "WARNING: CAUSES IRRITATION. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Avoid breathing dust. Wash thoroughly after handling." Similarly, another chemical's label provides a "Waste Disposal Method: Dissolve or mix the material with a combustible solvent and burn in a chemical incinerator equipped with an afterburner and scrubber. Observe all federal, state, and local environmental regulations." The hazardous material in question, Dr. Segal says, is candle wax.<p>
This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 2,000 inspectors across the country. As large as this effort is, its main task is even larger: to inspect 6 million workplaces with 93 million employees. On average, a company can expect to see an OSHA inspector once every 10 years. Even doubling or tripling the number of inspectors, in other words, wouldn't accomplish very much if the means of ensuring worker safety is to be workplace inspection. No doubt when OSHA was created in 1970, with the strong backing of labor unions, the impossibility of its task wasn't yet evident.<p>
In a smaller, performance-oriented, "reengineered"  federal government, OSHA would survive only as an advisory agency, or perhaps wouldn't survive at all. Its role in promoting worker safety has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector incentives. Companies make bad decisions on occasion, of course, sometimes endangering the safety of their workers. But as the Hamlet case shows, so do regulators. The difference is that companies pay an economic price for their mistakes.<p><center><b>The Workplace Safety Record</b></center><p>
The Hamlet fire, and a few other workplace disasters, are tragic and make good copy or news footage, but they tell us virtually nothing about worker safety in the United States. And the reality is that worker safety has been improving for decades. Companies have undertaken massive campaigns of training, coordination, technological investment, and management innovation to realize tremendous safety gains. Businesses have huge incentives to promote safety, such as lost productivity and workers' compensation or liability insurance costs, that swamp the prospect of regulatory violations. They have found that safe workers are happy workers, and happy workers are productive ones.<p>
Northern Indiana Public Service Company's Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station is far more typical of corporate America's record on safety than Imperial Foods. Each year, all employees must attend two safety-education classes. In addition, the plant holds weekly "safety tailgate sessions" with all its workers to discuss specific safety topics. Accidents and "near-misses" prompt an intensive incident review, whose results are discussed at weekly safety sessions. Workers and managers alike think of safety not as a program but as a process. The plant's motto typifies everyone's commitment: "Safety, Pride, Teamwork." "We were able to make significant strides by having our employees buy into our cause," says J.N. Kocsis, personnel and safety supervisor at the Mitchell station. In just 10 years, from 1982 to 1992, the rate of accidents at the plant fell by 57 percent.<p>
Nationally, the number of people injured annually, at work and home combined, fell by 15 percent from 1970 to 1990, with most of the decrease occurring during the 1980s. Accidental deaths show an even steeper decline; both the rate and the actual number of deaths have been falling for more than 60 years. The number of workplace accidental deaths fell from about 20,000 in the 1930s to less than 10,000 in 1993. Factoring in population growth, the National Safety Council reports that accidental-death rates at work fell from 15.8 to 3.5 per 100,000 peoplea 78 percent drop. Measures of specific hazards also show a steady downward trend. In just the 10 years from 1983 to 1992, the number of firefighters and civilians killed by smoke and flames fell by 34 percent and 20 percent respectively. <p>
Accidental-death rates may well be a better overall guide of safety trends than reports of all injuries and illnesses. There is good reason to believe that the latter may understate safety gains because companies, workers, and individuals have become more likely to report accidents and injuries over time. <p>
These safety gains can't be attributed to regulatory efforts on the part of federal, state, and local governments. Accidental deaths at work adjusted by population, declined at roughly the same rate before and after the passage of the 1970 Occupational Health and Safety Act.<p>
One way to think about the relative efforts of government and business in the safety arena is this: On any given day in America, thousands of local, state, and national safety regulators are inspecting businesses, studying test data, issuing regulations, and adjudicating violations. <p>
But on that same day, millions of American workers, managers, designers, and engineers are working to make their workplaces safer, to maximize sales and revenues, minimize losses, and maintain good, long-term relationships with productive employees. The magnitude of private-sector safety efforts, both in time and money spent, far exceeds that of even today's bloated regulatory bureaucracy.<p>
Safety gains have occurred across the economy, from highway fatalities to child poisonings, but it is at the workplace, over which businesses have greater direct control, where safety gains have been the largest. While accidents still happen and some jobs remain more dangerous than others, there have been very few years in the past six decades in which workplace accidental deaths have risen rather than fallen. To understand why firms might spend a great deal of time and money improving worker safety, you must first get a clear picture of how costly it is to have a serious accident in a workplace.<p>
There are two main private-sector "regulators" of occupational safety. The first is the labor market itself. In the market for workers, perceptions of risk have a significant impact on the wages employees demand. If a profession or individual business is known to be unsafe, potential workers will want more salary or benefits to compensate for the higher risk. Even if workers don't know going in how dangerous a particular workplace is, their subsequent discovery can cost firms a bundle. For example, when a business loses a proficient worker in an accident, even for a relatively short time, that worker must be replaced with a new one, often needing training. The injured employees' coworkers also reappraise their own job risks, sometimes resulting in higher wage demands. The firm's hiring and training costs rise again if disaffected workers quit. The resulting turmoil can wreak havoc on production, costing the firm sales.<p>
The safety risks posed by businesses differ dramatically, but studies have estimated that the labor market adds an average risk premium of about $1,000 to each worker's salarymeaning that, on average, workers demand $1,000 more in salary than they otherwise would to compensate them for the workplace risks they perceive. Finding ways to reduce that cost is clearly a desirable goal for any business, large or smalland keep in mind that this $1,000 is only the mean. Some firms face very high risk premiums and save a lot of money from even modest safety improvements. Occupations such as logging, meat-packing, mining, and construction continue to pose a higher-than-average risk of injury. For these occupations, says Duke University economist Kip Viscusi, "the marketplace generates enormous wage premiums for risk on the order of $80 billion a year in terms of higher wagesthat's where firms get their financial incentive for safety."<p>
In the search for safety gains, employers have a strong ally: the insurance industry. By law, most employers must have workers' compensation insurance for their employees, but can purchase their coverage from the private insurer of their choice. The workers' comp system is at least partially "experience rated"; that is, the premiums bear some relationship to a business's rate of accidents. Firms that find ways to cut their accident rates pay lower insurance premiums. Insurers who help their subscribers cut accident rates and costs are more likely to keep their customers in the future. So both business managers and insurance underwriters have huge financial incentives to improve workplace safety (although unwise state regulation still keeps the system less efficient and safety-promoting than it could be). "If you're a good company with a good safety record, insurance companies are knocking on your door for your business," says Steve Reynolds, safety supervisor at Crowder Construction Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. Many workers' comp insurers employ armies of consultants, engineers, and designers to help their subscribers reduce accident rates and cut the costs of claims.<p>
The cost of mandated workers' compensation coverage on American business skyrocketed during the latter half of the 1980s, not so much because of an actual increase in danger at the workplace, but because of federal court decisions liberalizing eligibility requirements. Workers found it easier to file claims, while state governments made mandatory benefit levels more generous. The result was a surge in workers' claims, pushing the total bill for workers' compensation insurance to $70 billion a year. While this development had many negative consequences for economic growth, particularly for states with higher benefit levels, it also meant that the insurance market became more competitive than ever, as American companies sought ways to cut down of one of their most explosive labor costs.<p>
Compared with the risk premium imposed on firms by the labor market and workers' comp premiums imposed by insurers, the prospect of being fined by OSHA is almost laughably tiny in dollar value. Average OSHA fines per U.S. worker were about 50 cents in the early 1990sup from 35 cents in 1983 but below the peak of 65 cents in 1978, according to Duke's Viscusi. Considering that the likelihood of being inspected, much less found in violation, is low in a given year, these fines obviously play little to no role in business decisions about safety. Increasing OSHA inspection or increasing fines aren't likely to change that underlying economic calculation very much. <p>	<b><center>Gains Through Innovation</b></center>

Innovative and responsible companies and insurers have spent years learning how to reduce safety-related costs by reengineering workplaces, training employees, and using new technologies. Even small changes can reap big rewards. Take Rosendin Electric, Inc., a San Jose, California-based electrical contractor. Linda Johnson, Rosendin's benefits administrator, says that when she first came to the company in 1991, it wasn't tracking workers' compensation costs in an efficient manner. Rates of accident frequency and severity were soaring to worrisome levels.<p>
Teaming up with the firm's safety director and risk manager, Johnson employed a new computer software package to track the type and total number of injuries, as well as dollars being spent in premiums. She found that approximately 50 percent of total claim costs were for back- and eye-related injuries. Back injuries alone were costing the company an average of $15,000 to $20,000 for each instance. "Many of the injuries could have been prevented if they'd been tracked effectively," Johnson says.<p>
Supplied with up-to-date reports on how and where accidents were happening, Rosendin managers were able to find their biggest risks and address them. The company started a program to train workers about the importance of back-support belts (providing them to the workers for free) and how to work with the least amount of stress on the back. Rosendin managers also found that a major cause of eye injuries was that workers weren't wearing their safety glasses when they needed to. Much of the company's work was done on high ladders, but safety glasses were needed only some of the time. Workers ended up leaving the glasses at the bottom of the ladder rather than balance them precariously at the top, but then didn't bother to climb all the way down to retrieve the glasses when their use was warranted. "Employees needed something to keep their glasses around their necks when they weren't wearing them," Johnson explains. A simple solution followed: Each pair of glasses was equipped with a cord to go around a worker's neck. That one seemingly minor action reduced eye injuries by 20 percent. Between October 1992 and October 1993, Rosendin workers' comp claims decreased in frequency by 35 percent. The severity rate fell by 10 percent, and the company saved 27 percent in claims.<p>
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive found another simple way to achieve safety gains at its Lafayette, Indiana, plant. Twice a day for five minutes, all employees are encouraged to participate in group exercise workouts. Twisting to workout standards like the theme from Rocky, employees stretch their arms, legs, necks, and backs before beginning work assembling cars, moving materials, or even typing on computers. New employees also learn about exercise and physical exertion during their two-week orientations. Of 80 hours of orientation, 45 hours are devoted to physical training. Employees participate in various exercises depending upon their upcoming responsibilities in the plant. In-house physical therapists coordinate these programs, and more than pay for themselves in reduced workers' compensation costs, say Subaru-Isuzu officials. "Our goal is to prevent injuries," says Mark Siwiec, manager of safety and environmental compliance. "If injuries do occur, however, they should be less severe."<p>
Other companies have found similar results from modest changes in operation or training. When too many AT&T workers were getting injured working on telephone poles, the company started a "pole-climbing school" to teach the three-point contact methodmeaning that workers should keep three limbs touching the pole at all times. Once AT&T workers mastered the method, accident rates fell. Similarly, Coca-Cola Bottling Group cut accident rates among its truck operators by instituting warm-up exercises, improving interior lighting in company trailers, adding more trailer hand grips, and lowering the trailers two inches to make it easier for workers to pull out the cases of drinks.<p>
LSG/Sky Chefs, an in-flight caterer based in Arlington, Texas, has realized significant safety gains by experimenting with financial incentives. In the late 1980s, the firm was logging 1,000 injuries a year and losing more than 18,000 workdaysthis at a company with 8,000 employees. Sky Chefs kitchen workers were constantly straining their backs lifting heavy objects, an injury that costs $25,000 in workers' comp claims on average. <p>
New president Michael Kay introduced a safety program in 1991 to address the problem. Employees were taught how to lift objects without back strain. Kitchen workers got a weekly five-minute "safety short" taught by one of their coworkers. And the firm began offering financial rewards to workers with good safety habits. Supervisors passed out $20 Sears gift certificates to employees who lifted or cut in an exemplary way or who took the initiative to clean up a spill. Supervisors, in turn, saw their own compensation change to make safety a priority. A quarter of their bonus was tied to their unit's safety record. These and other changes helped reduce lost workdays at Sky Chefs to 8,500 in 1993 and about 5,000 in 1994. Focusing on rewards rather than punishments was the key to the new program's success, says Kay. "Our old approach was called the Stop program. It was designed to catch employees doing something wrong. This one's had a remarkably better effect."<p>	<b><center>Insurers Play Role</b></center>
<p>
Some of the most sizable gains in workplace safety have take place in recent years under the tutelage of insurance companies. Insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, for example, helped one of its clients, a book publisher, set up a worker safety program that included routine monitoring, goal setting, active involvement by management, strategic planning, and bonuses tied to safety performance. The publisher had seen its accident rate rise and its workers' comp costs shoot up by 41 percent from 1987 to 1990. After Johnson & Higgins helped the company install its new safety program, workers' comp claims dropped by 35 percent and dollar losses by 63 percent the first year. Georgia-Pacific Corp., the forest-products company, worked with insurers in Georgia to reduce accidents by 31 percent in 1991 and 1992, with Georgia-Pacific's sawmills experiencing only one half of the industry's average number of incidents.<p>
Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company in Connecticut has made a $562 million business out of reducing workplace accidents. The firm is now the leading provider of boiler and machinery insurance in the United States. "Our interests and our customers' interests are aligned," says Wilson Wilde, president of Hartford Steam Boiler. "Both of us are going to be hurt financially if an accident occurs, so we can justify investing time and money in loss prevention." Most of the company's 4,000 employees are  scientists, engineers, and technicians, who work with electric utilities, chemical plants, and paper manufacturers. They have developed an array of devices, processes, and designs to enhance safety, including a device introduced in 1990 to examine hard-to-reach boiler tubes for corrosion. The company has worked with utilities to detect problems with steam-turbine rotors to head off high replacement costs. It used new sensor technology to diagnose a turbine's vibrations and signal when to weld cracks shut. Fixing rather than replacing rotors saved millions for the insurer's utility subscribers while reducing the danger of faulty rotors coming apart in generators.<p>
Reengineering workplaces using principles of ergonomics has become a common strategy for businesses and insurers to reduce worker injuries, particularly cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) such as wrist strain, elbow strain, or the more serious carpal tunnel syndrome. CTDs are a fast-growing category of both occupational illnesses and workers' comp claims, but the severity of the injuries has been exaggerated significantly by the media. (Carpal tunnel syndrome is the seriously debilitating illness so often mentioned, but it accounts for only 1.4 percent of all work injury or illness cases, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Nevertheless, muscle strains caused by repetitive motions or poor posture do cause discomfort and pain, limit mobility, and reduce worker productivity. To address the problem, companies consult ergonomics experts and buy redesigned office furniture and machinery from manufacturers such as Michigan's Haworth Inc., which makes motorized tables that adjust height during the course of a working day, and Nova Office Furniture of Effingham, Illinois, which sells desks with computer monitors built into them so workers peer down at them like newspapers rather than up at them like televisions.<p>
OshKosh B'Gosh, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of children's clothing, used several strategies to reduce CTDs at its main plant in Oshkosh. The company's employees were performing numerous tasks involving small, awkward motions that require force. Inspectors checked the snap crotch of each pair of pants, pinching 600 snaps per hour. Machine operators developed back trauma from twisting and turning heavy garments, and sustained shoulder and hand problems from bending over to reach different-sized clothing.<p>
The company's safety team decided to purchase 7,000 padded, adjustable chairs at $100 each and redesign many of its own machines. Company engineers devised an air-driven, automatic "crotch-snapper." Mechanical "feed dogs" were installed to dig their metal "teeth" into fabric and pull it through sewing machines. Plant workers were encouraged to report minor pain or discomfort so company engineers could address the problems. They were also rotated through several different jobs within plants, to reduce constant stress on one part of the body. After an initial surge in reported injuriesworkers were being told, after all, to report even minor problems more oftenworkers' comp claims fell as did the severity of reported injuries. From 1992 to 1993, workers' comp costs at OshKosh B'Gosh fell by a third, more than paying for the company's safety innovations.<p>
In the search for workplace safety, even industries considered to be "dangerous" have made great strides. Consider the mining industry, which has posted the most dramatic decline in injury rates during the past 20 years. In 1976, mining had the third-highest rate of total injury cases and the highest rate of any industry for injuries with lost workdays. By 1992, its rate of all injuries and of injuries involving lost workdays had dropped below the rates not only for all the other goods-producing industries but also for parts of the service sector. The efforts of enterprises like Kerr McGee Coal Corp.'s Jacob's Ranch Mine in Gillette, Wyoming, have contributed to this impressive record. The mine's incentive program for zero accidents is a quarterly award of $100 in gift certificates from local merchants. For every accident, each of the mine's 400 workers loses $10 from their awards. "Everyone gets penalized so there's a real incentive to wear safety glasses and do the right things," says safety supervisor Lenny Altenburg. The company spends $205,000 a year on the gift certificates, but the investment is paying off: The firm had no lost-time accidents at all from 1991 to 1994. Other mining firms have introduced new technologies, begun safety training programs, and used similar financial-incentive systems to minimize accidents. Compare the mining industry's typical death toll today (97 in 1992, for example) to the 3,500 annual deaths typical in the first part of the century, and you have some idea of the progress that's been made.<p>
Rail safety is another area where the incentives of the private-sector marketplace dwarf those of the public sector. The E.H. Harriman Memorial Awards, given for railroad safety since 1913, helped to illustrate this point in 1994, as privately owned railroads took prizes and publicly owned or publicly subsidized railroads posted mediocre or poor safety records. Among the largest railroads in the country, Norfolk Southern took first place while Amtrak, the federally subsidized national passenger rail system, came in last. Similarly, among nine medium-sized railroads, the three publicly owned lines ranked 5th, 7th, and 9th. Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., which operates lines in New England, won its category (small railroads) despite allegations of safety problems over the past few years by labor unions and federal regulators (whose ranks are dominated by union veterans). Colin Pease, executive vice president at Guilford, explains that while many publicly owned or subsidized railroads rely on "feel-good programs" to promote safety, private lines must operate safely or go out of business. Insurance costs, replacement costs, and disruption of freight deliveries all skyrocket when lines are unsafe. "There is a major economic impact to whether your workers perform their jobs the right way or not," he says. "But the motive breaks down in the public sector." Pease believes that when workers are working safely, they're working productivelyand naturally, in a competitive enterprise like transportation, productivity gains are the only way to stay ahead of competing rail or trucking firms. Guilford supervisors provide daily safety instruction and perform "test and observation" procedures 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<p>
The efforts of these and many other American companies to reduce accidents and injuries are ongoing and massive. But conscious decisions by corporate managers and workers to address safety aren't the only cause of safety gains. Larger trends in the economy, reflecting innovation and productivity gains linked to goals other than safety, have also contributed to lower rates of accidental deaths and safer workplaces. For example, it now takes fewer employees to manufacture goods in Americaand that means fewer chances for injuries and accidental deaths. Also, the quality of medical care provided both at the workplace itself and in hospitals and urgent-care centers has steadily improved, reducing the severity of injuries and the risk of death from accidents. Furthermore, a great deal of recent job growth has occurred among the smallest businesses in the country, which also have tended to post the best safety records (large businesses post the second-best safety records, while medium-sized firms have traditionally reported the most accidents).<p>
While interpreting safety data and identifying causes and effects of particular trends can sometimes be challenging, the overall message about corporate responsibility in this area shouldn't be obscured. Driven by the pressures of the market to lower costs, keep skilled workers, minimize legal and insurance costs, and avoid bad publicity, American businesses have toiled endlessly to make their workplaces safer. <p>
To a large extent, they've done so. In a real sense, the tremendous reduction in accidental deaths accomplished in the past 60 years represents an advance in the quality of life of workers and consumers no less significant than pay raises or price reductions. Horrible accidents such as the Hamlet chicken-plant fire are human tragedies, but in the context of corporate decisionmaking in a market economy they are also economic disasters. That's why responsible firms today are investing so much time and money trying to avoid them.<p>
OSHA, whether upsized or downsized, reengineered or left alone, has little value to add to the worker safety picture. But its costs, measured in lower productivity and wages as well as higher prices and taxes, are significant. This is one more area where Congress needs to rethink the need for federal government involvement.

Every day, hundreds of travelers and visitors to New York City arrive at 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Station, after a disorienting bus trip from Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. Most of the passengers stepping out onto the sidewalk have a single goal: to find a taxicab. Meanwhile, beside each idling bus awaits another group, equally intent on their own mission: to steal from the disembarking travelers.<p>
These are Grand Central's "bag hustlers," the muggers, swindlers, and con men drawn to the area by the steady stream of bus passengers, as well as by the half-million or so commuters who pass through Grand Central each day. To these men, a confused tourist is like a limping gazelle: slow, defenseless, and tasty.<p>
Early one afternoon, a middle-aged visitor from Austria arrives at 42nd Street. Bags in hand, he scans the street for a cab. Before his eyes can even adjust to the light, he is approached by a bag hustler. The hustler, a stocky man in his late 30s, is confident, aggressive, and talks quickly. He offers to carry the man's bags and find a cab. His $20 fee, he explains, will cover the cost of the ride to the man's hotel. The man assents, unaware that the hustler has no intention of paying for the cab with the $20. Instead, he plans to take the moneyand perhaps the man's entire walletand run into the crowd.<p>
As the two walk together to the curb, a third man appears, dressed in what looks like a policeman's uniform. "Excuse me," he says to the tourist, pointing to the hustler, "do you know this man?" The tourist, looking confused, shrugs. "Then why is he carrying your bags? He's a thief." Soon, other tourists are looking on, and the policeman repeats his charge to the crowd. "This man is a thief," he says in a loud voice, "stay away from him." The hustler drops the bags, and the cop escorts the now thoroughly confused but grateful tourist to a legitimate taxi stand down the block. In less than a minute, and with little fuss, the policeman has saved the tourist from one of New York's oldest scams.<p>
Except the man in uniform is not a policeman. He is a private security guard, hired by local property owners, and possessing no legal powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen. He is a member of a security detail employed by an organization called the Grand Central Partnership. In less than 10 years, this man and several dozen of his colleagues have helped transform the area around the train station from a chaotic maze of threatening streets into one of the safest sections of Manhattan. They have done it without wholesale arrestsand without the use of public money.<p>
Traditionally, security guards have been employed almost exclusively by businesses: either companies whose assets are so valuable that they require extra protection, such as banks and jewelry stores, or those whose size or physical structure renders police patrols ineffective against crime, like hospitals and railroads. But the role of private security is expanding. Increasingly, civilian guards are providing protection in places where only sworn police officers have walked beats: in public parks, central cities, and residential neighborhoods. And increasingly, the salaries of these guards are being paid not by businesses to protect goods, but by citizens hoping to protect their families and neighborhoods.<p>
The history of private security may be nearly as old as crime itself. The earliest security guards may have been the temple priests in the ziggurat at Ur, enlisted by wary Sumerian moneychangers in the third millennium B.C. to protect their lucrative banking operations. In the United States, where businesses have always assumed a large degree of responsibility for protecting themselves, private security guards predate police departments by more than 200 years. Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant and barrelmaker-turned-detective, started the country's first guard-for-hire service in 1860. His first job: dispatching uniformed civilians to protect meat-packing plants in Chicago. Pinkerton's company, which by the 1990s had revenues of more than $600 million, now shares the market with about 57,000 other private security firms in the United States.<p>
Private security is among the fastest-growing industries in the country. During the 1980s, security companies expanded at twice the rate of public law enforcement, and received 70 percent more funds. There are now two security guards employed in the United States for every federal, state, and local police officer. Civilian guards protect everything from nuclear-power plants to theme parks to government buildings, and their role in public life is growing larger. <p>
Private security companies can never take the place of police officers, and most do not want to. Security guards lack the moral authority that only government can give law enforcement. They also are hobbled by law. Civilian guards have only limited powers of arrest. In most states, citizens may make arrests only when a crime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And in some states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspect over to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest. <p>
For these reasons, security guards cannot routinely respond to violent crime. They cannot interrogate suspects or solve murders or negotiate the release of hostages. But they can augment police efforts, helping to maintain order in places where police forces are absent or spread thinly. And they can encourage citizens to follow community standards in a way police officers often cannot.<p>
Security guards can perform these tasks more cheaply than most police departments. Unlike police officers, guards spend nearly all of their time on the job. Since they seldom make arrests, they have little paperwork, and rarely have to testify in court. They are free to walk their beats, andof great importance to employersthey accrue little overtime.<p>
Perhaps most important, security guards are flexible. Because they are not required to respond to calls for emergency service, they can go wherever they are needed to deter crimeand stay there. A business owner who fears robberies cannot force a police officer to stand outside the door of his business. But hired security guards can do just that. Private security gives citizens more control over their own safety. Used intelligently, security guards can be as efficient as any police department at keeping public order.<p><center><b>Law and Disorder</center></b>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, the streets of midtown Manhattan seemed to be sliding into chaos. Aggressive beggars clogged filthy sidewalks. Crimes of all kinds were on the rise. Local business owners became increasingly frustrated with the city's apparent inability to clean up the area. Some companies left Manhattan for good. A cluster of midtown property owners decided to stay, and to restore their neighborhood without the help of City Hall.<p>
In 1985, a group of planners led by real-estate developer Peter Malkin formed a "business-improvement district," a primitive form of quasi-government charged with keeping streets safe and clean. The group carved out a 50-square-block area surrounding Grand Central Station and on the cusp of Times Square. They called it the Grand Central Partnership. The owners of the 220 commercial properties within the district got to vote on the plan, and a majority agreed to join. Soon after, the New York City Council approved the plan. Although the area was not physically vastabout 80 acres of streetsit was in the center of one of the densest commercial districts in the country. Once its boundaries were set, the Grand Central Partnership contained more than 6,000 businesses, comprising a total of some 51 million square feet of commercial space, about the same as in all of downtown Los Angeles.<p>
To raise money for improvements, the property owners began taxing themselves, first at the rate of a little more than 11 cents per square foot of space, later at about 12.5 cents. For small businesses, the levy worked out to a couple of hundred dollars in extra taxes per year. For large properties, such as the PanAm building, the tax could add up to $300,000 annually. Collecting the revenue was easy. A state law passed in 1981 allowed the city of New York to gather the money along with municipal property taxes each year. The city then sent the money back to the partnership. The city threatened property owners who refused to pay with foreclosure. <p>
By 1994, the Grand Central Partnership was raising $6.3 million a year in property taxes. Most of the money went to visible projects. The partnership hired more than 30 street sweepers and trash collectors to pick up after the thousands of litterers who walk through midtown each day. It purchased new garbage cans, street lights and flower boxes, and built new sidewalks and gleaming granite curbs.<p>
To help foreign tourists find their way, the partnership hired multilingual guides and placed them outside of the train station. To make catching a cab easier, it built two taxi stands and stationed a guard in each to direct traffic. To make the neighborhood more inviting to pedestrians, the partnership spent $3 million to install 136 high-power halogen floodlights, which illuminate the Grand Central terminal at night. When more money was needed for capital improvements, the group issued $35 million in bonds, the interest on which was paid for by the property tax.<p>
<b><center>Vacating the Vagrants</b></center>
<p>
Completed in 1913, Grand Central Station was crumbling by the 1980s, and had become a magnet for every kind of social affliction. City police seemed unable or unwilling to restore order. In 1987, the New York Times described the area outside the train station as "chaotic and forbidding, often filthy and sometimes dangerous." Much of the chaos and filth, as well as much of the danger, could be traced to the nearly 500 vagrants living in the building. <p>
Since it had no jurisdiction within the train station, the partnership could not make the vagrants leave the terminal. Instead, it decided to lure them away. For years, hundreds of homeless men and women had gathered on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central to receive food handed out by volunteers. Starting in 1989, the partnership opened a "drop-in center" for the homeless in an old Catholic boys' school a couple of blocks away. Soon, the center was serving meals to hundreds of the same people who had once queued up outside Grand Central.<p>
Inside the old school, the homeless could sit down to eat. And unlike the street in front of the station, the drop-in center was safe, protected by a metal detector and security guards. As additional enticements, the center offered hot showers and job-training classes. Employees of the partnership began to help vagrants living in the train station find more permanent housing, relocating scores of them to shelter at YMCAs and even in city housing. Before long, Grand Central was nearly free of vagrants.<p><b><center>The Shock Troops</b></center><p>
As the partnership's social-service arm enjoyed success with the area's homeless population, its security division worked to assemble a guard force. By the winter of 1988, the security force was ready. Using $1.4 million of its annual revenues, the partnership put 18 uniformed security guards on the street around Grand Central each day, working overlapping shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week.<p>
Gerard Panza is a retired detective who runs the day-to-day operations of the partnership's security force. From his office in a building next to the train station, he plots the movement of crime through the district. On one wall hangs a map of midtown, with colored push pins marking the locations of recent crimes. Though the map is riddled with holes, few pins remain, testament to the success of the partnership's strategy for fighting crime. <p>
At times security guards have tackled serious, violent crime. Guards have disarmed a gunman and also foiled an armed robbery. But as Panza explains, the partnership's most important task is keeping the streets orderly. Security guards, he says, have set out to shove even the pettiest of criminals out of the partnership's domain. No public violation of law or exhibition of disorder is too small to merit the attention of security guards. As a result, Panza says, the incidence of crime of all kinds has fallen. <p>
The New York City Police Department agrees. According to the department's statisticians, within two years after the guards arrived, reports of crime within the Grand Central Partnership had dropped by 20 percent. The decline was even more precipitous in the area immediately surrounding the rail terminal. On the western part of Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Station, a street long famous for muggers and drug dealers, reported crimes dropped 83 percent (from 2,140 in 1988 to 367 in 1990). After three years, reports of crime in the district had dropped 36 percent, an achievement the city's assistant chief of police called "phenomenal." By the spring of 1994, more than five years after security patrol started, reported crime in the Grand Central Partnership had decreased by nearly 53 percent.<p><b><center>A Few Good Men</b></center><p>
The group's directors understood that the guards they hired would do much to shape the partnership's public image. It was a challenging task, because the public perception of private security has never been good. A 1971 Rand report described the "average security guard" as an "underscreened, undertrained, undersupervised, and underpaid" ne'er-do-well with "little education beyond the ninth grade." To this unflattering portrait, the Rand scholars might have added "uncontrollably aggressive" and "psychologically unstable." It is widely believed in the private-security industry that the mentally unbalanced are drawn to guard work. A number of recent, highly publicized incidents in which current and former security guards have committed crimes or gone unaccountably berserk have only seemed to confirm the stereotype. <p>
In order to screen out maladjusted candidates, the Grand Central Partnership advertises the jobs in relatively upscale publications like the New York Times and takes referrals from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Although no federal laws regulate the hiring practices of private security companies, most states require guards to be at least 18 years old, and to be reasonably upstanding, sober citizens with no recent felony charges. In addition to these requirements, the partnership hires only applicants with a high-school diploma, and gives preference to those with military service. Each recruit is required to take a psychological exam and a drug test. Once they meet these standards, rookie guards are trained for seven days, mostly in the specifics of New York law.<p>
There are no explicit physical requirements for the job, but Richard P. Dillon, who runs the security operation for the partnership, says he likes to hire guards who are "as smart and as big and fast as we can get." In at least one category, it is clear he has succeeded. The partnership's guardsmost of whom are mentend to be physically imposing. Some are huge. The guards do not carry weapons, so physical size can be an important source of authority during an altercation.<p>
Successful applicants are paid well by industry standards. Salaries start at $10 an hour, rising to about $13 with seniority and good service. Benefits include health and life insurance, and two weeks' paid vacation. Once on the force, discipline is strict. Absenteeism and lateness are not tolerated, nor is sloppy dress, smoking in public, or even minor violations of the organization's many rules. Guards must use good manners, including courtesy titles, in their dealings with the public. Their uniforms, which bear a distinct and intentional resemblance to those of the city's police department, are crisp and clean. Under them, guards wear bullet-proof vests. <p><center><b>Tight Supervision</center></b>
<p>
Though they have succeeded in forming a largely professional force, the partnership's directors are under no illusions about the quality of person drawn to guard work, or about what could happen if the guards were managed poorly. Direct and quick communication between guards and supervisors is crucial to ensuring that guards are effective and stay within the bounds of the law. Guards are linked to their supervisors at all times by radios routed through the partnership's dispatching center on 34th Street. As they walk their rounds, guards talk frequently with their overseers, checking in over the radio and seeking approval for any consequential decisions.<p>
The partnership's supervisors are well-equipped to offer guidance. Each is a retired New York City police officer, with a minimum of 20 years on the force. The head of the group's security force, Richard Dillon, was a cop for 32 years before retiring in 1988 as assistant chief of the department. Most other supervisors retired as detectives or inspectors. <p>
Veteran supervisors are the partnership's insurance policy against mishaps. In addition to their superior equipmenteach carries a concealed pistol and a radio with a direct line to the police departmentsupervisors bring a solid knowledge of the penal code. While guards, many of whom aspire to be police officers, are apt to swagger and overstep their authority, supervisors remain cool. William O'Connor, a retired detective who keeps watch over seven guards, says he struggles every day to keep his men within their legal bounds. "They're loaded with enthusiasm, and they would want to do more than private citizens can do." But, as O'Connor reminds his guards repeatedly, they are nothing more than civilians in uniforms.<p>
The distinction is vital. Nothing could destroy Grand Central Partnership's security force more quickly than a guard who assumes police powers and abuses citizens. It has happened before. In the late-1980s, members of the Nation of Islam began providing security to public-housing projects in several cities, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. With grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the sect's security firm sent guards into projects to clear out drug dealers. For a time, the group restored a measure of order to the projects. In the process, however, the security guards intimidated not only the drug dealers but residents as well. In a number of housing complexes, police had to intervene to keep the guards under control. In one case, the group lost its contract with a housing project in Los Angeles after being charged with negligence.<p>
In order to avoid similar mistakes, the partnership drills its guards on the limitations on the use of force. Physical force may be used, the guards learn again and again, only as a final resort, in self-defense, or to protect the life of another person. The partnership's security handbook, which explains the limits of civilian authority, is referred to as "the Bible"; guards take refresher courses on it every Thursday afternoon. To further protect themselves from liability suits, guards are required to call their supervisors the moment a problem arises. If the guards make an arrest or become involved in an altercation with a citizen, supervisors routinely interview bystanders as potential witnesses. In the event of a lawsuit, the statements they take may be used to protect the guard. So far, the precaution has not been necessary. The partnership's security force has been sued only once, by a bystander who was injured by a guard chasing a suspect.<p>
The supervisors' broad experience allows them to fill another role as well, that of ambassadors to the city's police. A working partnership between the two groups is vital to the success of the security force, but relations did not come easily. Like most police officers, New York cops are naturally suspicious of security guards, or "square badges," as they are unaffectionately known. In the eyes of police, guards seem to occupy a confusing gray area between public official and private citizen that many cops find disconcerting.<p>
To the surprise of no one, the partnership's guards received a chilly welcome from police when they first arrived in midtown. Due partly to the presence of retired cops in its ranks, however, the guards ultimately developed an amiable relationship with local cops. The two groups now share a substation across from the train terminal, and meet monthly to discuss crime trends.<p><b><center>A Cop's Best Friend</b></center> <p>
Over the years, police have adopted a laissez-faire view of minor lawbreakers around Grand Central, including baggage hustlers, aggressive panhandlers, and small-time marijuana salesmen. "The police are involved with other matters," explains Panza, who spent more than 30 years on the force. "They cannot concentrate on the quality-of-life crimes when they have major crimes. They must first reduce homicides, robberies, assaults."<p>
For police officers, the priorities make good sense. When a cop makes an arrest for disorderly conduct, for instance, he is likely to spend the rest of his shift at the station house filling out forms.<p>
In the meantime, his post out on the streets may remain unfilled, creating opportunities for additional, perhaps more serious crimes to be committed. "That's where we come in," says Panza. "We are the eyes and the ears of the police department. They appreciate our work because we try to solve some problems ourselves, without police intervention."<p>
Guards often go to great lengths to avoid summoning police unnecessarily to the scene of a disturbance. When a knot of marijuana dealers proved especially hard to dislodge, for instance, security guards simply took photographs of the sellers and handed them over to police. Most of the dealers quickly found new retail locations. As in the vast majority of cases handled by the partnership's guards, police never became directly involved. <p>
Of the 6,916 incidents to which the partnership's guards responded in 1994, only 624 required police assistance, and 122 resulted in arrests. That year, guards came across 31 people smoking marijuana in public. In each case, the guards told the smokers to move along, and in each case the smokers did. In cases of narcotics dealing, police were called just 6 percent of the time; in bag-hustling cases, 2 percent; in illegal panhandling cases, 1 percent; and disorderly conduct cases, 9 percent.<p>
In January 1993, security guards told 141 unlicensed peddlers to leave the area. One hundred and thirty-five obeyed the guards without incident. Police were called to handle only six of those cases; only two peddlers were belligerent enough to get arrested.<p>
Most of the time, guards convince violators to comply by explaining which laws they have broken, then politely asking them to leave the area. Most accede. Some do not. <p>
Three-card monte dealers, in particular, have a reputation for ferocity, and only the largest security guards are sent to ask them to vacate the sidewalk. When they are challenged, however, it isn't physical strength most security guards are likely to rely upon, but the power to arrest.<p>
Like all citizens, guards can make arrests when they see crimes committed, hold suspects until the police arrive, and act as complainants in the case against the arrestee. The difference between security guards and most civilians, however, is that guards will, when pushed, actually make an arrest. Most lawbreakers in the area know the guards aren't bluffing.<p>
The threat of even a citizen's arrest is apt to get a wrongdoer's attention. As security chief Richard Dillon puts it, "Criminals, even in New York, where they know they're not going to stay in jail very long, still don't want to be arrested." And, according to Dillon, security guards will make a genuine effort to arrest some criminals. "Our guys chase them five or ten blocks."<p>
When the victims of crime are tourists, security guards make an additional effort to see that the perpetrators are locked up. Visitors from out of town make appealing marks partly because criminals know that even if they are caught, their victims will most likely never return to testify against them in court. The charges will be dropped. To encourage tourists to testify, the partnership authorizes its guards to offer to pay victims' airfare back to New York for the court date. The guards believe this policy makes criminals more inclined to plea-bargain.<p>
<b><center>Deterring Petty Thieves</b></center> <p>
The partnership's guards look strikingly like New York City cops. The resemblance is deliberate. Says Panza, "We want people to think from a distance that it may be a police officer. That is a deterrent. By the time they ascertain that the guy is not a police officer, maybe the opportunity to commit the crime has disappeared." When they are not putting the hustle on bag hustlers, the guards spend their days doing what New York's police department no longer has much time to do: walking a beat and deterring thieves with their uniformed presence. <p>
Coconuts, a music store next to the train station, has lost large amounts of merchandise to theft. Professional shoplifters carry double-walled "booster bags" lined with aluminum to neutralize the store's electronic security system, and they routinely load up with free compact discs and cassette tapes. Store employees, knowing police would be slow to respond, could do little. But the security guards, says Edwin Ortiz, the store's manager, have helped cut down on the thievery. "I call them and they come running and hold the shoplifter till the police come." <p>
Joel Oks, owner of Portabella, a men's clothing store on Vanderbilt Avenue, also had a problem with shoplifters. Now, he says, the thieves have moved on to other areas, along with the drug dealers who used to stand outside his store. The criminals, he claims, have been frightened away by the security guards. "Wouldn't you be scared of this guy?" asks Oks, pointing to Jimmy Mena, a guard the size of a rhinoceros. "We don't have security problems any more. I give them all the credit." <p>
Oks may give the guards credit, but he has no idea how much he gives them in taxes. Like every store owner I surveyed, Oks did not know what he pays each year to the Grand Central Partnership. And like the rest of the owners, he does not seem to care. Whatever the amount, he says, the protection he receives is "well worth it."<p>
Alan Maleh, owner of Goldrush Fine Jewelry at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, agrees. "I haven't seen a uniformed policeman around here in years." The guards, by contrast, "are there all the time. If we give a call, they come running over." Before the security guards, he says, "there were no cops." Muggers "would snatch a purse right in front of the store and they would be laughing, not even running away, walking away. They can't do that now. So they go somewhere else." Without guards, he says, "it's like a jungle out there."<p>
Store owners take comfort in the fact they can reach guards at any time on their portable radios and expect an immediate response. Toni Klein, who owns Cohen's Fashion Optical on 42nd Street, says she does not wait for a crime to occur before calling for help. The moment menacing-looking people enter her store, she requests a guard, who invariably arrives in moments. Like many citizens, Klein might feel foolish calling the police to deter crimes before they are committed. But the money she pays to the partnershipeven though she is unsure of its amountmakes her feel entitled to preventive police protection.<p><b><center>Fresh Flowers in the Men's Room</b></center>
<p>
Perhaps no location in midtown Manhattan has benefited more dramatically from the presence of security guards than Bryant Park, a nine-acre patch of grass  behind the city's public-research library and adjacent to Times Square. Situated in the center of the city and ringed by office buildings, Bryant Park is a natural place for couples to stroll and office workers to eat lunch. For years, however, few dared enter the area. Until the late-1980s, the park was a dangerous and notorious place: Drug-dealing was rampant, people lived on park benches, and there were murders. <p>
Bryant Park's fortunes began to change when two security guards were assigned to the area. The guards started enforcing some simple rules: no panhandling in the park, no drinking, no drugs, no sleeping on the benches, no feeding the pigeons, and no wading in the fountain. For those who didn't get the message, a sign was hung listing the prohibitions in bold letters. Within a short time, many of the park's seedier tenants left for more hospitable terrain. Soon, law-abiding citizens took the place of vagrants, and the atmosphere  began to change. <p>
Bryant Park now hosts concerts during the summer, and free movies on the lawn every Monday night. There is virtually no serious crime. "We're getting so many good folks here doing so many good things," says William O'Connor, who supervises guards in the park." You're an oddball when you're sitting out there being drunk or disorderly."<p>
Nothing illustrates the revival of Bryant Park more powerfully, however, than the condition of its men's room. By their nature, bathrooms are among the most vulnerable of public spaces. In New York, they are often stark symbols of urban decay. Frequently scarred by graffiti, and filled with drug dealers, amorous homosexuals, and vagrants bathing in the sinks, public men's rooms are places most savvy New Yorkers avoid at all costs. <p>
Bryant Park's men's room, however, is different. Its full-time attendant keeps the room tidy and stands guard. As a result of his vigilance, the men's room is as spotless as the lavatory in an upscale restaurant. Next to the sink is a bouquet of fresh flowers, fragrant evidence of the power of private security to enforce order in public spaces.<p>
More communities are certain to follow the example of the Grand Central Partnership. They may have to. Just as rising medical costs have forced hospitals to give more responsibility to nurses, cities may find that sworn police officerswhom they must train, pay relatively well, and sustain on pensionsare too expensive for fighting and deterring certain types of low-level crimes. To maintain basic civic order, rent-a-cops may be a better deal. <p>
Many communities already think so. In 1993, residents of Georgetown, an affluent and historic neighborhood on the western edge of Washington, D.C., hired a security guard from the Wells Fargo Company. Crimes, particularly thefts from cars, had been increasing in the area for years. About 100 neighbors chipped in approximately $160 a yearabout 44 cents a day per householdto hire a uniformed guard to patrol their six-block area. From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., five nights a week, the guard passes each house in the area at least once every hour.<p>
After a year of employing the guard, residents found their streets transformed. Fresh graffiti stopped appearing on buildings. Burglaries within the six-block area decreased by 55 percent, robberies by 50 percent. The security guard also stopped at least two serious crimes. In one instance, he frightened off two men attempting to kidnap a local couple. <p>
The decrease in crime was so dramatic that other parts of Georgetown soon began hiring guards. Within a year and a half, 90 percent of the neighborhood was covered by security guards.<p>
In the mid-1980s, East Hills, New York, a village of 6,700 on Long Island, hired about 30 uniformed security guards to take the place of sworn police officers. The unarmed guards cruise the streets of East Hills 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to county police, and generally acting as guardians of order. Although the service costs residents an extra $360,000 a year in property taxes, it has remained popular. Local politicians credit the program with reducing the town's burglary rate.<p>
Citizens concerned about disorder in their neighborhoods may find that security guards are the most cost-effective way to make their streets safer. "We don't do homicides, we don't do rapes," says O'Connor of the Grand Central Partnership. "But we do other quality-of-life things. Police are not going to come for an illegal peddler when they're up to their necks in gun runs. That's the reason we're here: We do the work the police have trouble getting to because they're so busy." If the results of these private security firms are any indication, this sort of policing can help restore community lifekeeping everyone less busy worrying about crime and more busy building families and neighborhoods.

<p>
Francis A. Biunno, a Philadelphia trial judge, had just sentenced a murderer to death. He then turned to the courtroom, called on those present to sit down, and asked the public to reflect on the breakdown of our democratic system that had led to the killing.<p>
The murder in question was of a 21-year-old rookie police officer, Daniel Boyle, who stopped a stolen car in North Philadelphia. The driver of the stolen car, Edward Bracey, fired numerous shots through the windshield of the patrol car, hitting the young officer in the head. A police radio tape chillingly captured the fatal shots and the fallen officer's final words. A few days later Danny's father, veteran Philadelphia police detective Patrick Boyle, buried his only son.<p>
This tragedy didn't have to happen. Philadelphia police, Judge Biunno said, had previously arrested Bracey for car theft. Twice Bracey had been released without bail or supervision under terms of an order issued by a federal court. Twice Bracey had failed to show up for trialin fact, he was a fugitive from justice when he killed Officer Boyle. This killing wouldn't have taken place, Biunno suggested, if the federal court hadn't required the defendant's release.<p>
Criticism of a federal court on the part of a local trial judge is highly unusual. But Biunno's statement reflected the anger and frustration that officials in Philadelphia harbor toward a federal order that has wreaked havoc on their city's criminal-justice system. The court order to which Biunno referred places a cap on the number of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, and it sharply restricts the ability of judges to imprison defendants prior to trial.<p>
Last year, the city's judges were forced to release defendants in 15,000 cases. Thanks to the court order, the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justicedefendants who have been charged with a crime but do not even bother to show up for trial. Philadelphia police arrest the same criminals over and over again, only to see them immediately released. In the nine years since the order was approved by Judge Norma Shapiro, of the U.S. District Court, defendants released under federal court order have gone on to commit tens of thousands of crimesincluding thousands of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery.<p>
The federal court's order is technically called a "consent decree," because it was agreed to by a previous mayor of Philadelphia. But it no longer enjoys the consent of the governed. Philadelphia's elected leaders, including its present mayor, its district attorney, and most of its city council, are deeply opposed to the consent decree but powerless to overturn it. Philadelphia may be the home of the Liberty Bell, but the federal consent decree is making a mockery of the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.The Philadelphia prisons, which house defendants before trial and sentenced prisoners, have been the subject of various class-action lawsuits since 1972. Past conditions in the prisons have been unacceptable. Over the years, many experts have observed inadequate medical care that has led to the death of inmates, unsanitary food preparation, vermin infestation, and poor plumbing, ventilation, and heating.<p>
In 1986, these conditions prompted inmates at an old, decrepit facility called Holmesburg Prison to file a lawsuit against then-mayor W. Wilson Goode. The mayor decided to settle the case rather than go to trial. The resulting federal consent decree, agreed to by Goode's lawyers, did nothing to address medical care or other conditions in the city's prisons. Rather, it sought to limit the number of prisoners, and, more important, forbade pretrial detention for defendants accused of broad categories of crime. The architects of the plan apparently presumed that reducing the number of prisoners would improve the prison environment for the remaining inmates.<p>
Instead of individualized bail review, with Philadelphia judges considering a criminal defendant's dangerousness to others or his risk of flight, the consent decree requires a "charge-based" system of prison admissions. Suspects charged with so-called "non-violent" crimes, including stalking, car jacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges, are not subject to pretrial detention.<p>
In determining pretrial detention, Philadelphia judges can no longer consider a defendant's prior record, his history of failing to appear in court, his mental-health history, his ties to the community, or his drug or alcohol dependency. These factors become completely irrelevant. A major drug dealer carrying a loaded Uzi and a plane ticket out of the country cannot be detained before trial in Philadelphia.<p>
As a result of this system, Philadelphia has become an especially attractive location for drug dealing. Narcotics agents assigned to the international airport routinely apprehend (and are forced to release) drug couriers, who have been assured that carrying over $100,000 of marijuana to Philadelphia is risk free. One newly arrested drug dealer, knowing that he would be released in a matter of hours, cheerfully gave his pretrial bail interviewer a phone number where he could be reached-in Cali, Colombia. <p>
Another drug dealer, Walter Lewis, unwittingly schooled undercover narcotics officers on the benefits of dealing drugs in Philadelphia. Lewis had been awaiting trial in Philadelphia for drug dealing but had already been released because of the federal consent decree. Undercover narcotics agents from neighboring Montgomery County arranged a narcotics deal on City Line Avenue, the street dividing Montgomery County from Philadelphia. When Lewis arrived, he tried to convince the undercover officers to move the drug deal to the Philadelphia side of the street. He carefully explained that they could all be sent to jail if they stayed in Montgomery County. After the officers refused to move, Lewis mistakenly let greed guide him. He completed the deal, the officers immediately arrested him, and he went straight to jail, where he remained until trial. If the deal had occurred in Philadelphia, he would have been released in a matter of hours. <p>
The consent decree has crippled Philadelphia's already struggling criminal-justice system. Once criminals knew that they could not be detained prior to trial no matter how many times they failed to appear for court, Philadelphia began recording unprecedented fugitive rates. A study conducted by John Goldkamp and Kay Harris, nationally recognized experts on the bail process, found, for example, that 76 percent of all Philadelphia drug dealers become fugitives within 90 days of their arrest. Nationally, only 26 percent of drug dealers become fugitives within one year of their arrest. By comparison, only 3 percent of Philadelphia defendants charged with aggravated assaulta crime not subject to the release provisions of the federal consent decreefail to appear for court.<p>
The skyrocketing fugitive rate has produced a system with more defendants in fugitive status than awaiting trial. In the first six months of 1994, over 11,000 new bench warrants (the arrest document issued when a criminal defendant does not appear for a court hearing) were issued for defendants released under the federal consent decrees, representing 74 percent of all the bench warrants issued during this period. Under the consent decree, the number of fugitives in Philadelphia has nearly tripled from 18,000 to almost 50,000, equivalent to a year's worth of criminal prosecutions. And no wonder: Under the consent decree, state courts are powerless to compel a defendant's appearance in court.<p>
Unfortunately for Philadelphians, the defendants released because of the consent decree do not lay lowthey just keep on committing new crimes. In an 18-month period (1993 and the first six months of 1994), Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because of the consent decree. These defendants were charged with 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.<p>
These crimes cannot all be attributed to the federal consent decree; some defendants would have been released under normal Pennsylvania procedures. But apparently half or more of these crimes could have been prevented. Goldkamp and Harris found that pretrial detainees released under the consent decree committed crimes at more than twice the rate of defendants released under state-court bail programs. Within 90 days of release, 18 percent of federally released defendants were rearrested for new crimes, compared with an 8 percent rearrest figure for comparable state bail programs. <p>
Retailers complain of a sharp increase in shoplifting and robberies by criminals immune from incarceration. In April, Charles Pembroke was released for the fifth time in 1995 because of the Philadelphia prison cap. In the last six months, Philadelphia police have arrested Pembroke three times for retail theft, once for robbing a pharmacy with a starter pistol while threatening to kill the victims, and once for drug dealing. Pembroke has failed to appear for court seven times and, as of this writing, is a fugitive on three of his cases. Philadelphia's criminal-justice system just keeps seeing the same defendants over and over again, but can't do anything until they commit a crime so serious that the consent decree finally permits the prison to admit them.<p>
The consent decree also weakens the effectiveness of programs for criminal defendants who never would have been detained prior to trial. State judges are no longer allowed to sanction those criminal defendants who violate conditions of bail, fail to appear for trial, or commit new crimes. State-court bail programs have atrophied into virtual non-existence. Conditional-release programs providing drug treatment, aimed at lifting new offenders out of their recently acquired lives of drugs and crime, are forced to wait for offenders to become serious criminals with a long-term addiction. <p>
The case of Frederick Hightower vividly demonstrates the absurdity of the consent decree. Hightower was a trained helicopter mechanic from a solid family who became addicted to crack at age 29. He quickly turned to burglaries.<p>
Given Hightower's age, lack of prior criminal-justice contacts, and long-term ties to the community, the local court system (had it remained in charge of the pretrial detention process) probably would have released him without bail for his first two burglaries. But by the time he was arrested for his third burglary, the local judge would have suspected a drug problem, sent him to jail, and permitted his conditional release (again without posting bail) a few days later into an in-patient drug treatment program. If this had worked (admittedly an optimistic outlook) and he had remained in treatment, he would have been a prime candidate for a sentence of probation with the condition of continued drug treatment.<p>
But the federal consent decree wouldn't allow the local criminal-justice system to operate. Without the threat of pretrial incarceration, Hightower wouldn't enter a drug treatment program. Philadelphia wasn't permitted to keep Hightower in jail until he was finally arrested for his 10th burglary. Hightower now was no longer a candidate for probation. Instead he received a 10-year maximum sentence, and must serve a minimum of two and a half years before he is eligible for parole.<p>
The cost of this folly: numerous crime victims with substantial financial losses (and he surely wasn't caught every time); prison bed space occupied longer (a few years, at a cost of approximately $25,000 a year, instead of a few days); increased court costs (each one of his new cases involved police witnesses, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and court personnel), less chance of drug rehabilitation (the treatment came later in his addiction); and loss of tax revenues (Hightower was a skilled, employed taxpayer). <p>
The Philadelphia Federal Courthouse overlooks Independence Hall, the cradle of American liberty and the Constitution. How ironic, then, that the federal court's consent decree tramples on the right of Philadelphians to a democratic political system.<p>
Mayor Ed Rendell and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, both elected Democrats, won office pledging to do what they could to overturn the prison-cap and prisoner-release provisions of the consent decree. Philadelphia's top leaders, including most of the city council, are united in their view that the federal court's rules on pretrial release of defendants are a serious threat to public safety, effectively decriminalizing property crime in Philadelphia, and harming the financial viability of the city. But the federal court has rejected all challenges to the consent decree, and shows no indications of ceding oversight over the issue. Philadelphia's elected leaders are powerless to change agreements made by a prior administration, and so powerless to set their own criminal-justice priorities.<p>
Our democratic system presumes that policies made by today's elected leaders, whether by legislation, regulation, or policy statements, can be altered by their successors in office. Through periodic elections, the public can throw out arrogant public officials who try to insulate their governmental vision from change or from the will of the electorate. Philadelphians do not consent to the consent decree that is destroying their criminal justice system. It's time that Philadelphia's elected leaders be allowed to do the job for which they were elected. Isn't that what America's independence was all about?

Friends of federalism are right to celebrate the recent Supreme Court decision striking down the federal law banning guns on school grounds. While we certainly must work to keep guns out of our schools, this is a state and local concern, one which almost all states already have addressed through their own legislation.<p>
In United States v. Lopez, the court ruled that Congress had relied on an indefensibly broad interpretation of the Constitution's interstate-commerce clause in claiming that possession of a firearm in a school zone could interfere with interstate trade. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that the Gun-Free School Zones Act "is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms."<p>
Though correct in claiming that Congress hadfor nearly 60 yearsused the commerce clause to justify the gradual encroachment of federal power over our lives, conservatives err when they pretend there are no serious threats to interstate commerce legitimately subject to congressional regulation. On the contrary, there is a growing and ravaging menace to interstate commerce that forces good products off the market, stifles innovation, hurts our ability to compete in the world marketplace, and is unjust both to consumers and manufacturers. It is embodied in the uncontrolled liability rulings and legal expenses that characterize the civil-justice system of most states in the nation. Despite conservative fears of legal reform at the national level, true federalists should embrace limited federal tort reform to rescue a court system that is helping to undermine the economic base of numerous businesses and industries.<p>
<center><b>First Principles</center></b>
<p>
We must, however, limit intervention from Washington according to the principles of federalism and with an understanding that the potential risks of national intervention always are high.<p>
When our Founding Fathers met in Philadelphia in 1787 they were faced with two major problems: The Continental Congress was having trouble raising money to conduct a national defense; and the states were engaging in the economically and socially destructive practice of taxing goods coming from all other states. The Framers solved the first problem by giving Congress the power to impose certain taxes. They solved the second by establishing national jurisdiction over interstate commerce, with the aim of promoting what Federalist 11 calls "a free circulation of the commodities of every part" of the union. <p>
Today we face threats to interstate commerce analogous to those faced by the Founders. Interstate commerce is restrained and even stifled by state-based liability rulings and legal transaction costs as destructive as the taxes about which the Founders were so concerned. The clearest example is in product liability, in which rulings and their costs create not a series of competitive state markets, but rather a restrictive, illogical, and inefficient national market. Moreover, we effectively already have a single unitary tort system in the law of products liability. Unfortunately, our unitary system comprises not a coherent, consistent body of laws, but the most commercially restrictive features of the tort laws of individual states. <p>
It is not difficult to see how this has come about: The law of the state in which the alleged harm occurs generally decides tort cases. Yet our market for products is national, so every company must be prepared to be sued in any state in which its product might be used. If a car built and sold in Michigan by a Michigan corporation is in an accident on a California freeway, California's tort law will determine whether the car maker is liable. If the California legislature decides that side air bags are a necessary safety feature, it could impose strict liability on the manufacturer of any car made anywhere in the United States without one.<p><center><b>No Experimenting Here</center></b>
<p>
Michigan cannot prevent this with tort reform. As a result, insurance companies already set their product-liability rates nationally, because under the current system all companies must abide by the law of the state with the strictest rules.<p>
Under these circumstances, how can states serve as "laboratories of democracy" in the area of product liability? No state will know or have any real incentive to find out whether its product-liability "experiment" has succeeded or failed. Why? Because liability costsin the form of higher prices for goods and servicesare spread nationwide. Meanwhile, the benefits of the state's product-liability system flow primarily to its residents, who constitute the vast majority of potential plaintiffs. A state that elects a less costly set of product-liability rules will see the benefits of that system shared by in- and out-of-staters alike, while its residents will continue to pay almost as much for products because of more costly out-of-state tort systems. Congress does not face the same obstacles in enacting product-liability legislation. It, and it alone, can develop a set of national rules designed to maximize the common good whose costs and benefits will be shared by all citizens.<p>
But, while Congress is uniquely qualified to undertake this task, that does not mean that it will in fact perform it well. Legislative efforts might be hijacked by one or another faction, leading to either excessive or insufficient liability being imposed. Indeed, virtually all political scientists and theorists agree that the Framers systematically underestimated the risks of national factions, largely because modern communication has profoundly changed politics.<p>
Nevertheless, product-liability reform presents fewer risks in this area than do most issues. The reason is that the status quo is bad enough that congressional intervention probably will make it better, and is quite unlikely to make it worse. We need federal action because the system is not just broken, it is falling apart.<p><b><center>Personal and Social Costs</b></center> <p>
One obvious problem with our system: It keeps even real victims, who have been injured and need financial help, from collecting their fair share of damage awards. Tillinghast Research reports that 57 cents of every dollar spent on civil suits in this country go to pay lawyers and other legal costs like the public expendses of the court system. <p>
Consumers also suffer. The huge costs of our legal system create a "liability tax" of 2.5 percent on the average product, built into the selling price by manufacturers. The figure is much higher for other products, such as step-ladders (30 percent) and vaccines (95 percent) that tend to attract lawsuits.<p>
In addition to making things more expensive, liability taxes make necessary goods scarce or even unavailable. Lawyer and engineer Peter Huber reports that between 1965 and 1985, the number of U.S. vaccine manufacturers shrank by more than half; by 1986, we relied on a single supplier for vaccines against polio, rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies. Our own Senate Commerce Committee reported that two of the three companies making the Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DPT, vaccine stopped production because of liability costs: They could not afford all the suits arising from the now clearly discredited theory that the vaccine might in very rare instances cause brain damage. <p>
The results of such policies can be devastating, particularly to the sick and helpless. There are some 5,000 diseases that affect small numbers of Americans. Many of these diseases, including leprosy, are extremely serious. But a number of them have gone untreated, because pharmaceutical companies cannot afford the risk. A West German chemical company, for example, at one time supplied Americans with botulinum. A paralytic poison, the drug controls a rare but incapacitating disease that affects the control of eye muscles. The company cut off American supplies to avoid being held liable should people misuse its product.<p>
Dozens of examples like this one prompted the federal government in 1983 to enact the Orphan Drug Act. This act provides special incentives and waivers to companies researching and manufacturing drugs for rare diseases. One of its purposes is to overcome the disincentives to produce needed products that have been built into our legal system, and it has done some good in this area. But orphan drugs are only the most visible signs of a deeper problem. Research and development are undercut when companies are afraid to enter the market for fear of massive, unfounded lawsuits. The result is a lack of innovation and improvement as well as a lack of competition among companiesthat is, a loss of the best means by which to keep quality up and prices down.<p>
The system also hurts our economic competitiveness. A 1994 Business Roundtable survey of 20 major U.S. corporations reveals that they receive 55 percent of their revenue from inside our country, but incur 88 percent of their total legal costs here. Clearly such discrepancies in legal costs put our companies at a disadvantage in the world market. So does our yearly litigation-related costs of $300 billion, or 4.5 percent of our gross domestic product.<p>
Given the nature of the American economy, then, our product-liability system can best be reformed at the national level. We need uniform standards encouraging safe conduct and discouraging frivolous lawsuits aimed only at garnering unjust rewards. In particular, we must limit punitive damage claims and bar joint liability. At the same time, we need a provision holding each defendant accountable for that portion of the damage for which he or she actually was responsible.<p><b><center>State Reforms</b></center>
<p>
Product-liability reform will not address all of our problems, however. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that product-liability reform will help only 35 percent of small businesses. The other 65 percent are not involved in these cases and so will not benefitand even may suffer worse harm by being brought into lawsuits under joint and several liability rules.<p>
Product manufacturers and sellers do not shoulder all of the burden of unjust tort claims and awards. According to Inside Litigation, there were 50 cases in the United States in 1994 in which jury verdicts exceeded $17.5 million. Of these, only seven were product-liability cases. The remaining 43 involved disputes concerning employment, securities, lenders, accountants, environmental claims, insurers, business torts, state and local governments, volunteer firefighters, medical claims, and personal injuries not involving products.<p>
What, then, should we do about these other suits? How should we protect volunteers, lenders, and others from our flawed legal system?<p>
We could devise a national standard for all civil litigation. In this way we could ensure uniformity in standards of conduct and thus much more uniform results. But national standards are neither necessary nor proper, in my view, outside the field of product liability. This is because other types of civil cases do not produce the same disproportionate consequences across states as do product-liability suits. Suits against hospitals are mostly by local patients, suits against volunteer firefighters are mostly by local litigants. Most of the rules for such litigation should properly be determined by the states.<p>
Even so, there are some implications for interstate commerceand therefore grounds for some federal involvement. Some of these lawsuits do involve cross-state litigants, and a dynamic similar to that in product-liability law has led to a systematic bias in favor of plaintiffs that is harmful to interstate commerce. States are unable to protect in-state defendants from unreasonable suits by out-of-state plaintiffs, because the plaintiff in an interstate suit can choose which state to litigate in, and therefore which state's laws apply. By contrast, states can easily establish rules that benefit in-state plaintiffsand they frequently do so. Thus the same pattern the Founders fearedby which state taxes are used against out-of-state goods and interfere with economic productivityis at work.<p><b><center>Ending Windfall Profits</b></center>
<p>
Rather than taking over underlying liability laws, we should use federal power judiciouslyand humblyin order to make modest changes in the structure or legal machinery by which decisions and judgment awards are made. We should replace state law with federal rules, however, only when we are dealing with clear casesbearing in mind the risks, as well as the benefits, of federal action.<p>
Here is my prescription. First, national lawmakers should extend to all civil cases the replacement of joint liability with proportionate liability for non-economic damages. Under the current system, partially responsible parties must pay for more than their fair share of the damages because other defendants have become judgment-proof. For example, in Walt Disney World Co. v. Wood, a woman was injured when her fianc struck the go-cart she was driving at Disney World. The jury found her 14 percent at fault, her fianc 85 percent at fault and Disney only 1 percent at fault. But, under the doctrine of joint liability, Disney was required to pay 86 percent of the plaintiff's claimed damages.<p>
Second, the existing structure of punitive damages is rife with abuse. The courts have rightly regarded punitive damages as the equivalent of a state-imposed fine. Huge punitive damage awards can put a company or individual into bankruptcy. Such awards are meant to be rare and aimed only at particularly egregious conduct. They also are supposed to be awarded only in addition to economic and non-economic damages.<p>
Yet Yale Professor George Priest reports that punitive damage claims have become "almost routine." According to Professor Priest, lawyers increasingly use punitive damage claims to bully even innocent defendants into settling cases for higher amounts. Our high and unpredictable punitive damage claims thus encourage litigation because in too many cases they produce "windfall profits"huge unearned rewards.<p>
A federal cap on punitive damages at some reasonable level would take nothing essential away from the plaintiff. It would, however, protect defendants and society from unfair and financially disastrous awards. These awards hurt all of us by raising prices for goods and services, sometimes so high as to make them effectively unavailable. They hurt, even bankrupt, small businesses in particular, and so cost jobs.<p><center><b>Rediscovering Discovery Costs</center></b>
<p>
Finally, we must do something about the enormous transaction costs incurred under the present system, which nobody can defend. Eighty percent of the cost of the average lawsuit is incurred during discovery. Sifting through documents, taking depositions and so onall of these practices consume massive amounts of time and money. And discovery costs relate as much to issues of courtroom tactics as to actual questions of fault and damage. The process is so costly because attorneys seek to "discover" absolutely everything about their opponents that might possibly be useful in the battleground of the courtroom. <p>
One way to attack this problem would be to change the incentives in the system to encourage parties to settle their disputes early. By encouraging settlement before discovery is complete, we will save everyone a great deal of time, money, and aggravation.<p>
How can we do this without infringing on anyone's right to full compensation? No one wants to deny any Americans the right to their day in court if they feel they are not being fully compensated for their damages. But just as surely, none of us wants to continue with the wasteful, unfair status quo.<p>
We should reward defendants for making full and fair offers early on, without declaring that the plaintiff must accept just any offer. We should increase and speed up recoveries for meritorious claimants. At the same time, we should reduce both the incentives of defendants to drag out these disputes through whatever means available and the costs of those recoveries to defendants.<p>
The method would be simple: Provide protection to defendants who quickly promise to pay the plaintiff's full economic damages, plus, perhaps, an additional amount set by a state schedule based on the severity of the injury. This helps plaintiffs by restoring in full their economic losses without months or years of legal struggle. It helps defendants by protecting them against unlimited non-economic damages claims if they make a fair offer early on. <p>
Faced with such a system, defendants will offer fair compensation more quickly, and plaintiffs will be less likely to turn down a fair offer. Both sides would benefit from early settlements by avoiding long, expensive, and perhaps unsuccessful litigation. Thus lawyers and litigants no longer would hold out for more money and higher fees unless they clearly are warranted. And defendants and their insurance companies would no longer drag out litigation in hopes of making plaintiffs give up their suits and go away. <p>
All of these reforms will increase the fairness and efficiency of our legal system. Moreover, all are amply justified under federalist principles by the peculiar incentives in our present systemincentives that encourage states to develop laws benefiting in-state plaintiffs at the expense of the public interest.<p><b><center>A Federalist Escape Clause</center></b>
<p>
We still should take care to protect and nurture federalism, however. In the case of my early-offer recommendation, for example, I would allow a state to opt out of the federal reformin whole or in partfor disputes entirely between citizens of that state. This would encourage those states that feel strongly about the issue to retain their own legal machinery, but only if they can justify to their own people that the machinery is sound and only if its costs and benefits are allocated to their own citizens.<p>
Some may not be convinced that other reforms (including barring of joint liability and punitive-damage caps) are justified by federalist principles. These people should consider going along with the reforms, but attaching a state opt-out provision. If a large number of states opts out of a particular reform under these circumstances, it would serve as a strong signal to Congress and the people that the national "reform" may in fact have been the product of national faction, rather than a necessary preemption of an illegitimate burden imposed by the states on interstate commerce. <p>
An escape mechanism of this sort could also be useful in other areas beyond legal reform, where there are legitimate differences of opinion on whether federal intervention is needed or desirable. In particular, Congress should consider allowing this opt-out provision whenever it exercises its commerce power to remove burdens on interstate commerce caused by a systemic bias that state competition cannot correct (see Easterbrook, "Madison, the State, and Public Choice," University of Chicago Law. School Record [Spring 1995]). Professor Akhil Amar also suggested an inquiry along these lines in a conversation with a member of my staff. If widely used by the states to evade provisions of federal law, the provision also would help us identify areas in which Congress was wrong to intervene, because the burden imposed on interstate commerce was in fact a legitimate state interest.<p>
This leads us back to Lopez. I have no doubt that civil-justice reforms crafted along the lines I have discussed would pass muster with the Supreme Court. The link between the legislation and interstate commerce would be quite clear. In addition, an opt-out feature of the sort I have described would eliminate cases in which there is no real connection between interstate commerce and the practice in question. Finally, an escape provision for close caseswhere there is some reason to believe that competition among the states' legal regimes is not functioning properly, but the evidence is not overwhelmingwould allow the system to send a useful signal to the Court. It would show that the underlying law was intended as a legitimate exercise of Congress's power to alleviate perverse burdens on interstate commerce, and not as a grab for power in the interests of some national faction.

Every morning for seven years, Linda Desrosiers  packed her lunch before heading to work as a high-school cook. "I wouldn't touch the food they had us make," she says. "People looked at it and smelled it, but no one ate it."<p>
School janitors in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, an impoverished textile-mill town, confirm Desrosiers's stories of platefuls of grayish green beans and "beef surprise" winding up in the dumpster. One janitor said he changed the high school's industrial-sized garbage bags at least twice in each of the three lunch periods. <p>
In recent months, liberals led by President Clinton have argued that the federal school lunch program "ain't broke" and shouldn't be fixed. They argue, persuasively, that kids who are hungry won't learn. But they also make the false assumption that students actually eat the meals that the government subsidizes. Rhode Island is proving that students' nutrition levels can improve dramatically when subsidies for school meals are slashed.<p>
This academic year, the state of Rhode Island radically reformed its school-lunch program by dumping a quarter-century of centrally planned purchasing, hiring, and cooking. The state cut its $11-million school-lunch appropriation to less than $200,000 and fired all but 11 of the 780 workers who administered, cooked, and served the lunches. Now, private food-service contractors like Marriott and ARA Corp. plan the menus and feed the students. The school districts still get reimbursement from Washington, but the federal money is sent directly to the local districts on a per-meal basis. As a result, combined federal and state subsidies have fallen from more than $23 million in 1993-94 to $12 milliona 48 percent cut. <p>
The result: Kids are eating better. In the past seven months, student participation in school-lunch programs has soared, nutrition levels have risen to among the best in the nation, and poor school districts like Woonsocket are generating a profit.<p>
Brandon Powers, a sixth-grader at Woonsocket Elementary School, says the only downside of the privatized system is that it has put an end to daily "school-slop sculpture contests." "Now the food is pretty good," he says, "so people prefer to eat it rather than build with it." Even Desrosiers, now a cook for Marriott, eats it every day.<p>
Students at North Smithfield High School now eat their hamburgers instead of conducting experiments on the effects of mustard, catsup, and relish on burger flight. And students at a magnet high school in Providence no longer request extra gravy with their mashed potatoes just to provide greater contrast for finger-painting with their food. <p>
School officials back up students' claims that they are eating more. Since a private contractor took over Woonsocket High School's lunch program, janitors haul away 75 percent less garbage from the school cafeteria. Irene Scripsack, the business manager for the North Smithfield school district, says her janitors only collect 5 percent as much garbage as they used to. Scripsack won't say how often she ate the state's food, but admits it was "quite rare."<p>
"The state-run program suffered from what I call 'orange-ravioli syndrome,'" says John Caparco, the principal of Woonsocket High School. "Just providing food students should eat does not mean they'll eat it.  They were simply out to lunch when it came to making the food appealing." Caparco admits even he didn't eat the old food. "Now I get it all the time."<p>
Ellen McKenna, a junior dietetics major at the University of Rhode Island, demonstrated that plate waste was cut dramatically at schools that used private contractors. For instance, she found that most of the hot-food trays were "completely cleared of food" before they were emptied in the trash at Marriott's Potter-Burns Elementary School cafeteria in Pawtucket, where 32 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Likewise, at ARA's Central Falls Elementary School, where 89 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, students ate almost all of their carrots, breads, burritos, and sandwiches. <p>
At the state-run cafeteria at Lonsdale Elementary School in Lincoln, a wealthier community where the state-administered program had not yet been phased out, students were "picking at their food," rather than eating it. On the majority of the trays, most or all of the rice, bread, and fruit had been left uneaten. McKenna reports that students had difficulty identifying the food, and tended to push it around the tray rather than eat it. For instance, one student said he couldn't identify his ham-salad sandwich. McKenna described it as a "pink mush on a roll."<p>
After privatization, not only are students eating more of the meals on their trays, but more of the kids are buying meals.  In Woonsocket, for instance, where more than 77 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, participation has soared under Marriott's direction. During the 1991-92 school year, this "severe-need" district served 2,652 lunches a day. Now it averages 3,486 lunches dailya 31 percent increase. Similarly, under the state-run system, Woonsocket only served 288 breakfasts daily; now it serves 597a 107 percent increase.<p>
Woonsocket is the rule, not the exception. In Providence, where more than 70 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price meals, participation has increased 22 percent since a private vendor took over the cafeterias. And wealthy school districts, like North Smithfield, have recorded 25 percent more students eating school lunches since the state system folded.<p>
Between bites of a chicken-patty sandwich, Pauline Goin says she and her friends rarely bought lunch when the state ran the cafeteria, because the food was always a mysteryin both appearance and taste. "The other stuff was, you know, welfare food, and it tasted like it," the sixth-grader says bluntly. "This stuff is regular foodyou know, for humans."<p>
Greater participation seems to improve discipline during the once-raucous lunch period. Woonsocket's Caparco says that the time his office spends handling discipline problems has been cut by about 20 percent. "If the kids are eating, it's harder to be fighting," Caparco notes.<p><b><center>Have It Your Way</b></center>
<p>
Ruth Eshelman, a nutrition professor at the University of Rhode Island, says that options are essential to students' satisfaction. "If I have a choice, I am much more likely to eat what I choose," Eshelman said. "If I have to eat carrots, they will be terrible, but if I pick carrots over green beans, the carrots might be wonderful."<p>
The state-run school lunch program offered no choice. Each week, newspapers across the state printed the upcoming menu with a total of five listingsthe entire state had one option each school day. Private vendors, on the other hand, offer about 20 alternatives daily. Woonsocket High School students, for instance, can now choose from five meats, several cheeses, and two kinds of bread in the deli line. They can also pick from a list of three or four hot sandwiches, two salads, and a pasta dish. In addition, the menu offers pizza and burritos. Even if the student tires of these regular items, several specials are offered each day. Students also choose from a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables at every meal. And parents are sent a monthly menu describing each day's choices and their nutritional value.<p>
Private vendors also increase participation by using name brands: Pizza is supplied by a local Domino's franchise, and burritos are cooked according to a Taco Bell recipe. The name-brand packaging and advertising raise the likelihood that students will actually like the meal.<p>
Private vendors recognize that student involvement is vital to customer satisfaction. In Woonsocket and Providence, groups of students and parents meet monthly with Marriott's food-service directors. Dina Dutremble, Woonsocket's business manager, says the state never responded to local concerns; private contractors, on the other hand, conduct weekly taste-tests. <p>
Sandra Caron, a senior at Woonsocket High School who is a vegetarian, says that these meetings have allowed her to buy her lunch at school for the first time. After explaining to the food-service director that she and several other students would be willing to buy lunch if vegetarian entres were more readily available, the company promised to look into it. "I suspected they would do what had always happened. Nothing ever happens," Caron says. "But within two weeks, there was a vegetarian item on the menu every day."<p>
Ellen Haas, a USDA official who supervises the school lunch program from Washington, doesn't trust the private sector. She insists that devolution to local districts, like Rhode Island's privatization initiative, will lead to "short-term malnutrition and a lifetime of serious and costly health problems." Her fears were echoed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who equated devolution to "a dagger pointed at the hearts of our children." But a careful review of nutritional data demonstrates that Rhode Island's new, private programs outperform its state-run lunches. Haas's office did not return several phone callls.<p>
Current USDA regulations require that school lunches provide at least a third of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of seven nutrientsranging from vitamins A and C to iron and thiamin. Rhode Island's state-run school-lunch program, however, did not meet these minimums. Bethany Algier, a nutritionist with Rhode Island's Department of Health, notes that a 1991 nutritional audit of the school-lunch program found that  the state's program fell short in vitamin C and iron and did not meet the target for calories. Plus, this audit assumed implausibly that the students were eating everything on their trays. Although liberals can speak of the value of mandating nutrition levels, Rhode Island demonstrates that these mandates are not even enforced, and it is impossible to ensure the students will even eat the food.<p>
The private vendors, however, combat both these flaws by providing more nutritious meals that the students actually want to eat. According to the Department of Health's nutritional audit, Marriott's menus exceed the state's program by at least three-fold in each of the RDA's seven nutrient categories. In fact, the private-sector program provides students with more than double the RDA of vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A600 percent of the federal minimum for school lunches.<p>
In addition to the RDA nutrients, the private vendors' meal plans have less fat, cholesterol, and sodium and more fiber than Rhode Island's state-run program. Over a 10-week period, the average Marriott lunch contained 33 percent less fat, 40 percent less cholesterol, and 40 percent less sodium than the state's lunches. Marriott's average lunch contained only half the saturated fat and twice the fiber of a government lunch.<p>
Desrosiers and other cafeteria workers don't find these numbers surprising. In the private kitchens, fruits and vegetables rarely come from the can, since the two leading companies, ARA and Marriott, can use their buying power to get price breaks on more nutritious fresh and fresh-frozen produce. In North Smithfield, the independent school-lunch program has promised parents that it will never deep-fry a single item it sells; it even uses low-fat mozzarella cheese on its pizza. This district's hamburger meat contains about 15 percent fat, while the state-run program never used beef with less than 30 percent fat.<p>
Most remarkable, however, is that private vendors don't just provide healthier meals that students will eat, they do it at a profit. Like discount book chains, Marriott and ARA make money selling a high-quality product cheaply by counting on high volume. The per-meal federal reimbursement formula gives the contractors an incentive to provide nutritious meals that kids will like, because the more meals they induce kids to buy, the greater their margins beyond fixed costs. So far, the strategy has paid off.<p>
The secret to making it all work is the plan's clever payment system. The complicated arrangement provides the private contractor with an incentive to feed more students and allows the school district to keep most of the profits. School districts pay the contractor an annual fee to run the program. This fee pays for everything from capital improvements to salaries and food. The school district then keeps all the money the students pay. In addition, the district keeps all of the per-meal subsidies Washington sends it. If these revenues fall short of the district's payment to the private contractor, the contractor assumes the loss. This way, the district can't lose money and the contractor has an incentive to keep costs down while serving more meals. If the district turns a profit, the contractor gets a small cut.<p>
Dutremble, the business manager for the Woonsocket School District, says that the school lunches were a daily headache under the state-run program. While the state provided all of the workers, menus, and food, her district had to pay for high-priced food-service equipment out of its local operating budget. These costs were often so high that some school districts could not afford "sneeze guards" in their serving lines.<p>
Under Marriott's direction, the program is self-sufficient and has already turned a $42,000 profit this year, most of which the district keeps. In Woonsocket, the money is being used to purchase a new $30,000 dishwasher and a truck to deliver meals more efficiently to the elementary schools. Providence's program will profit by more than $100,000 this year, and North Smithfield was $5,000 in the black as of January 1. <p>
In addition, fears that poor or small school districts would be ignored by private vendors are unfounded. In fact, poorer school districtssuch as Woonsocket and Providenceare considered more desirable contracts for private vendors. These students are less likely to bring a lunch than their more affluent peers and therefore participation rates rise more dramatically when the food improves. Small school districts in Rhode Island joined together to negotiate joint competitive contracts. Lastly, the state limits the threat of corruption by putting the program out for bid frequently. Rhode Island prohibits  school-lunch contracts of more than a year, and limits the number of renewals.<p>
Rhode Island's experiment with privatized school lunches is the brainchild of a state legislator, Paul Crowley. A restaurant owner, Crowley was appalled to discover wages in state-run cafeterias were more than $4 per hour higher than at private restaurants, while nutrition levels were substandard. <p>
For years, Crowley's efforts to privatize the program were blocked by state-employee unions. Two years ago, however, Crowley found that the Providence school board had conducted a study showing that a private vendor would save the district more than $600,000 a year. School officials there said they abandoned plans to privatize their program under union pressure. Crowley said the unions even sent busloads of lunch workers to their meetings. After public hearings, Crowley amended the state's Fiscal Year 1995 budget to phase out the school-lunch program this school year. Under the new system, local school districtsrather than the stateare reimbursed directly from the federal government. As in all states, students pay some, all, or none of the lunch cost depending on their parent's income; Washington coughs up the rest.<p>
"We should be in the business of teaching, not feeding," Crowley says. "If other people make a better mousetrap, it makes more sense to buy theirs than build your own." <p>
Although school-district officials universally praise the private-sector lunch program, some are concerned about the GOP's block-grant proposal. Providence officials, for instance, expect the district-wide student body to increase by at least 800 kids next year, and fear that the block grant will not cover extra meals. But Crowley claims the program will still thrive under the block grant proposal. As a district's population increases, more students will buy meals. Since private contractors get paid on a per-meal basis, a larger student body would compensate for a reduction in per-student dollars.<p>
Rhode Island is evidence that converting federal funds to block grants can only improve the nation's school-lunch program. Given full responsibility for the programs, Crowley predicts more states will turn to innovative private alternatives that cost less and maintain higher standards.<p>
In fact, Crowley believes if school lunches had been devolved years ago, Rhode Island would have privatized sooner. "We have found that local districts are best off when they handle this on their own," Crowley said. "Blockgranting can only help us continue on this path."

<p>
Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interestsor even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agendaas we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quoincluding the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying effortsbut such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

<p>

I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.
<p>

You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.
<p>

You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs -- victory in spite of all terrors -- victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.
<p>
<I>-- First address to the House of Commons as Prime Minister</i><br> 
May 13, 1940
<p>

I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necesary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government -- every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, weshall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

Yesterday, December 7, 1941-- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.
<p>

 As commander in chief of the army and navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
<p>

No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.
<p>

I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
<p>

Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
<p>

With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.

I have just returned from Berlin, the city from the which the Germans intended to rule the world. It is a ghost city. The buildings are in ruins, its economy and its people are in ruins.
<p>

War has indeed come home to Germany and to the German people. It has come home in all the frightfulness with which the German leaders started and waged it.
<p>

The German people are beginning to atone for the crimes of the gangsters whom they placed in power and whom they wholeheartedly approved and obediently followed.
<p>

We also saw some of the terrific destruction which the war had brought to the occupied countries of Western Europe and to England.
<p>

How glad I am to be home again! And how grateful to Almighty God that this land of ours has been spared!
<p>

We must do all we can to spare her from the ravages of any future breach of the peace. That is why, though the United States wants no territory or profit or selfish advantage out of this war, we are going to maintain the military bases necessary for the complete protection of our interests and of world peace.
<p>

Our victory in Europe was more than a victory of arms. It was a victory of one way of life over another. It was a victory of an ideal founded on the rights of the common man, on the dignity of the human being, on the conception of the State as the servant -- and not the master -- of its people.
<p>

A free people showed that it was able to defeat professional soldiers whose only moral arms were obedience and the worship of force.
<p>

We tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war the most powerful nation in the world -- the most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not in the sense some of us believe it to be true.
<p>

The war has shown us that we have tremendous resources to make all the materials for war. It has shown us that we have skillful workers and managers and able generals, and a brave people capable of bearing arms.
<p>

All these things we knew before.
<p>

The new thing -- the thing which we had not known -- the thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society of self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other kind of society, however disciplined, however centralized.
<p>

We know now that the basic proposition of the worth and dignity of man is not a sentimental aspiration or a vain hope or a piece of rhetoric. It is the strongest, most creative force now present in this world.
<p>Now let us use that force and all our resources and all our skill in the great cause of a just and lasting peace! ...

<p>

My fellow countrymen, today the guns are silent. A great tragedy has ended. A great victory has been won. The skies no longer rain death -- the seas bear only commerce -- men everywhere walk upright in the sunlight. The entire world is quietly at peace. The holy mission has been completed, and in reporting this to you, the people, I speak for the thousands of silent lips, forever stilled among the jungles and the beaches and in the deep waters of the Pacific which marked the way. I speak for the unnamed brave millions homeward bound to take up the challenge of that future which they did so much to salvage from the brink of disaster.
<p>

As I look back on the long tortuous trail from those grim days of Bataan and Corregidor, when an entire world lived in fear, when democracy was on the defensive everywhere, when modern civilization trembled in the balance, I thank a merciful God that He has given us the faith, the courage, and power from which to mold victory.

We have known the bitterness of defeat and the exultation of triumph, and from both we have learned there can be no turning back. We must go forward to preserve in peace what we won in war.
<p>

We stand in Tokyo today reminiscent of our countryman, Commodore Perry, 92 years ago. His purpose was to bring to Japan an era of enlightenment and progress by lifting the veil of isolation to the friendship, trade, and commerce of the world. But, alas, the knowledge thereby gained of Western science was forged into an instrument of oppression and human enslavement. Freedom of expression, freedom of action, even freedom of thought were denied through suppression of liberal education, through appeal to superstition, and through the application of force.
<p>

We are committed by the Potsdam Declaration of Principles to see that the Japanese people are liberated from this condition of slavery. It is my purpose to implement this commitment just as rapidly as the armed forces are demobilized and other essential steps taken to neutralize the war potential. The energy of the Japanese race, if properly directed, will enable expansion vertically rather than horizontally. If the talents of the race are turned into constructive channels, the country can lift itself from its present deplorable state into a position of dignity.
<p>

To the Pacific Basin has come the vista of a new emancipated world. Today, freedom is on the offensive, democracy is on the march. Today, in Asia as well as in Europe, unshackled peoples are tasting the full sweetness of liberty, the relief from fear.
<p>

In the Philippines, America has evolved a model for this new free world of Asia. In the Philippines, America has demonstrated that peoples of the East and peoples of the West may walk side by side in mutual respect and with mutual benefit. The history of our sovereignty there has now the full confidence of the East.
<p>

And so, my fellow countrymen, today I report to you that your sons and daughters have served you well and faithfully with the calm, deliberate, determined fighting spirit of the American soldier and sailor based upon a tradition of historical trait, as against the fanaticism of any enemy supported only by mythological fiction, their spiritual strength and power has brought us through to victory. They are homeward bound -- take care of them.

We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.
<p>

These are the boys of Pointe de Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.
<p>

Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet, you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.
<p>

The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
<p>

You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you. 
<p>

The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of invasion was spreading through the darkness back home. They fought -- or felt in their hearts, though they couldn't know in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a.m., in Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing the Liberty Bell.
<p>

Something else helped the men of D-Day: their rock-hard belief that Providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an ally in this great cause. And, so, the night before this invasion, when Colonel Wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer he told them: Do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see God and ask His blessing in what we're about to do. Also that night, General Matthew Ridgeway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua: "I will not fail thee nor forsake thee."
<p>

We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent. But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation. In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union, so, together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever....

...[N]ow we stand triumphant, for the third time in this century, this time in the wake of the cold war. As in 1919 and 1945, we face no enemy menacing our security....
<p>

The values we hold dear as a nation -- equality of opportunity, freedom of religion and speech and as-sembly, free and vigorous elections -- are now revered by many nations. Our greatest victory in World War II took place not on the field of battle, but in the nations we once counted as foes. The ideals of democracy and liberty have triumphed in a world once threatened with conquest by tyranny and despotism.
<p>

Today we celebrate the world's evolution toward freedom, we commemorate democracy's fallen heroes, the defenders of freedom as well as victims of dictatorship who never saw the light of liberty. Earlier this year, when former adversaries joined us in the stand against aggression in the Persian Gulf, we affirmed the values cherished by the heroes of the Harbor.
<p>

The friends I lost, that all of us lost, upheld a great and noble cause. Because of their sacrifice, the world now lives in greater freedom and peace than ever before. It is right that all of us are here today. And it is right that we go on from here.
<p>

I have no rancor in my heart towards Germany or Japan, none at all. And I hope, in spite of the loss, that you have none in yours. This is no time for recrimination. World War II is over. It is history. We won. We crushed totalitarianism. And when that was done, we helped our enemies give birth to democracies. We reached out, both in Europe and in Asia. We made our enemies our friends, and we healed their wounds. And in the process, we lifted ourselves up.
<p>

The lessons of the war itself will live on, and well they should: Preparedness; strength; decency and honor; courage; sacrifice; the willingness to fight, even die, for one's country -- America, the land of the free and the brave.
<p>

No, just speaking for one guy, I have no rancor in my heart. I can still see the faces of fallen comrades, and I'll bet you can see the faces of your fallen comrades too, or family members. But don't you think they're saying, "Fifty years have passed; our country is the undisputed leader of the free world, and we are at peace."? Don't you think each one is saying, "I did not die in vain."?
<p>May God bless each of you who sacrificed and served....

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

	  <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n Father's Day 1986, Richmond Police Detective George Taylor 
stopped Wayne DeLong for a routine traffic violation. DeLong, recently 
released from prison after serving time for murder, shot and killed the 
policeman.</P>
<P>	Leo Webb was a divinity student at Richmond's Virginia Union 
University who liked helping people. One of those he helped was a man 
named James Steele, on parole for a malicious wounding. One day in 1991, 
Steele entered the bakery where Webb worked part time, shot him to death, 
took his money, and went out partying.</P>
<P>	Tragic as such stories are, what makes these two particularly 
disheartening is that both could have been easily prevented. Both killers, 
jailed earlier for violent crimes, spent only a fraction of their sentences in 
prison. We are now paying the dividends of a liberal justice system that 
refuses to take punishment seriously: Virginia has witnessed a 28 percent 
increase in criminal violence over the last five years. Three out of every four 
violent crimes--murder, armed robbery, rape, assault--are now committed by 
repeat offenders.</P>
<P>	This is why my administration pushed through legislation, which took 
effect on January 1, 1995 that will impose penalties for rape, murder, and 
armed robbery more than twice the national average for those crimes. We 
have abolished parole, established the principle of truth-in-sentencing, and 
increased as much as fivefold the amount of time that violent offenders will 
actually spend in jail. Experience vindicates what commonsense has always 
told us: The only foolproof crime-prevention technique is incarceration.</P>
<P>	 Our new system is attempting to unravel 30 years of paper-tiger laws 
based on the questionable philosophy that people can change, criminals can 
be rehabilitated, and every violent criminal--even a murderer--deserves a 
second chance. The new law in Virginia will prevent thousands of crimes, 
save lives, save money, and restore trust in the criminal justice system. 
Despite this, we now face entrenched opposition from liberals in the General 
Assembly, who hope to thwart reform by withholding funds to build the 
minimal number of prison facilities needed to house Virginia's most violent 
inmates.</P> 
<P>	A few weeks after taking office in January 1994, I created the 
Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform. It was a bipartisan 
commission of prosecutors, judges, crime victims, law-enforcement officers, 
business leaders, and legal scholars. William Barr, a former attorney general 
of the United States, and Richard Cullen, a former U.S. Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Virginia, co-chaired the commission. They had a daunting 
task.</P>
<P>	I called for a special session of the General Assembly in September 
1994 to focus the public's and the legislature's attention on this issue. I gave 
the commission six months to demonstrate the need for change, develop a 
detailed plan, and explain its costs and implementation.</P>
<P>	We were quickly able to show why a complete overhaul was necessary. 
Convicted felons were serving about one-third of their sentences on average, 
and many served only one-sixth. Violent criminals were no exception. First-
degree murderers were given average sentences of 35 years, but spent an 
average of only 10 years behind bars. Rapists were being sentenced to nine 
years and serving four. Armed robbers received sentences averaging 14 years 
and served only about four.</P>
<P>	Amazingly, a prior conviction for a violent crime did not affect this 
phenomenon. Even murderers, rapists, and armed robbers who had already 
served time for similar offenses were receiving the same sentences and 
serving the same amount of time as first offenders.</P>
<P>	Statewide, the violent crime rate had risen 28 percent in five years, 
even though the crime-prone age bracket (15 to 24 years) was shrinking. 
Criminologists widely regard trends in the size of this demographic group as 
the best predictor of criminal activity. Unfortunately for Virginians, the 
crime-prone-age population is expected to rise sharply in the state beginning 
in 1996--all the more reason to press forward with reform. The peak age for 
murder and armed robbery has been dropping steadily; by 1993, it stood at 18 
years for both crimes. More than three-quarters of all violent criminals in the 
system in 1993 had prior convictions.</P>
<BR>
<H3>The Plan</H3>
<P>	Only a multi-pronged approach can begin to turn these numbers 
around. Virginia's new law means, first of all, eliminating discretionary 
parole, in which a parole board can release an offender after he has served 
only part of his sentence. In Virginia, this policy clearly was being abused: 
offenders received 30 days of good time for every 30 days they served--
effectively cutting their sentences in half as soon as they came in the door.</P>
<P>	But this is not all. We need to eliminate "good time" as well. In order to 
encourage good behavior among inmates and allow correctional officers to 
maintain order, the commission proposed a system of earned-sentence 
credits. This system would allow inmates to earn a maximum of 54 days per 
year--a dramatic reduction from the average of 300 days they had been given 
in the past.</P>
<P>	Long before our bill became law, we held town meetings across the 
state to solicit advice from citizens, and discussed the plan's details with 
prosecutors, victims-rights groups, corrections experts, and criminologists. 
The need for more prison space became a primary concern. Even before I took 
office, Virginia was expected to double its prison population by the year 2005. 
The state was facing a shortfall of 7,100 prison beds by 1999. At the same 
time, opponents of the plan were already carping about too little spending on 
crime prevention and education and too much on building prisons.</P>
<P>	Obviously, judges need some mechanism to guide their sentencing 
decisions. A system with no parole and no "good time" could not afford 70-
year sentences for drug dealers or 150-year sentences for armed robbers. But 
how much do we increase the time served for violent offenders? Our 
commission found an answer by evaluating the relationship of recidivism to 
time served and age of release. The data showed that the longer an offender 
remained behind bars, the less likely he is to commit another crime after 
finishing his sentence. Similarly, the older the offender upon release, the less 
his propensity to commit more crime. In fact, after 37 years of age, the 
likelihood of violent crime drops dramatically.</P>
<P>   Although preventing criminals from committing further acts of violence was 
the primary goal, the increases had to reflect the notion of retribution as well. 
We wanted Virginia to send a message to violent criminals: We will not 
tolerate violence, and if you commit a violent crime, you will stay in prison 
until you're too old to commit another one.</P>
<P>	Virginia increased prison time for violent criminals as follows:
<UL>
<LI>  100 percent increase for first-time violent offenders.
<LI>  125 percent for first-time murderers, rapists, and armed robbers.
<LI>  300 percent for those with previous convictions for assault, burglary, or 
malicious wounding.
 <LI> 500 percent for those with previous convictions for murder, rape, or armed 
robbery.</UL>
<P>	To target the young violent offender, we counted comparable juvenile 
offenses as felony convictions when determining a sentence. For example, if 
John Smith is found guilty in a juvenile court of armed robbery at age 14, and 
was convicted of another armed robbery at age 19, the sentencing guidelines 
call for a 500 percent increase in the time he normally would have served 
under the old system.</P>
<P>	By abolishing a bankrupt parole system, and by drastically reforming 
the "good time" credit provisions, Virginia courtrooms are redefining what the 
truth-in-sentencing debate is really about. Under our system, every inmate 
convicted of a violent crime will serve a minimum of 85 percent of his or her 
sentence. Nationwide, criminals on average serve well below 50 percent of 
their sentences. There is simply no surer way for the state to protect its 
citizens from society's most dangerous members.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Saving Lives and Money</H3>
<P>	 Had the law been in effect nine years ago, it would have saved the life 
of Detective Taylor. Had it been in effect four years ago, Leo Webb would be 
alive today.</P>
<P>	The most conservative estimates show that more than 4,300 felony 
crimes would have been prevented between 1986 and 1993 if the current 
system had been in place. That number is based on actual convictions--real 
cases, not projections.</P>
<P>	Over the next 10 years, the new law will prevent at least 119,000 
felonies, including 26,000 violent crimes. Because of those averted violent 
crimes, an estimated 475 lives will be saved, 3,700 women will be spared from 
rape, and more than 11,300 aggravated assaults will not be committed. As a 
result, citizens will save more than $2.7 billion in direct costs.</P>
<P>	Back in September, when it became clear that the legislation would 
pass with overwhelming support, some vocal opponents claimed that 
abolishing parole was a declaration of war on young black males. They 
demanded that the Commonwealth spend more money on prevention 
programs, and charged that, by focusing on punishment, we were merely 
catering to "white fear." Their arguments fell on deaf ears.</P>
<P>	The crime prevented as a result of the new law will benefit the African-
American community--one-fifth of Virginia's population--more than any 
other group. Of the preventable murders that occurred between 1986 and 
1993, about 65 percent involved black victims. For assaults during that same 
period, about 60 percent of the victims were black. Taylor and Webb were 
both African Americans.</P>
<P>	Of all the crimes committed by recidivists during that same period, 60 
percent would have been prevented if the current law had been in place. 
There is no other prevention program that can show even a fraction of this 
success. That is not to say that other prevention programs are not valid or 
important. However, it is clear that when it comes to violent offenders, 
incarceration is the most just and the most efficient.</P>
<P>	Virginia has been spending an average of $658 million in taxpayers' 
money each year on handling recidivists. This is the cost of new 
investigations, new arrests, and new trials. The total cost of the prison 
construction needs for the next 10 years is about $750 million. The new law 
will force us to build more prisons--but not many more. Virginia would have 
doubled its prison population in the next 10 years anyway.</P>
<P>	The difference is that under the old system, the ratio of violent 
criminals among the prison population to non-violent has been 50:50. 
Marijuana dealers, embezzlers, and petty thieves have been serving time in 
the same $40,000-per-year hard cells as murderers, rapists, and armed 
robbers. Under the new guidelines, the inmate ratio will be 70 percent 
violent, 30 percent non-violent. This is obviously a more cost-effective use of 
medium- and maximum-security prison space.</P>
<P>	Try telling that, however, to the liberals in the General Assembly. I 
asked lawmakers in February for $402.6 million as a first installment in 
revamping our prison system. They voted to provide only $104.4 million. They 
are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous 
criminals will be released early--and be back in our neighborhoods. 
Increasing prison terms without increasing prison capacity is precisely the 
mistake that too many other states have already made.</P>
<P>	Part of the problem with the current system of incarceration is its near 
inability to distinguish between dangerous criminals and the more routine, 
petty offenders. Under our plan, we are building low-cost work centers to 
house first-time and non-violent offenders. These work centers operate at 
about half the cost per inmate as a standard prison, and they ensure that the 
inmates get work opportunities while incarcerated. The average length of 
stay at a work center will be about 10 to 18 months. We can build these 
facilities quickly, freeing up bed space in the prisons for violent criminals.</P>
<P>	The abolition of parole and establishment of truth-in-sentencing rules 
was the centerpiece of my campaign for governor in 1993. During that 
campaign, critics claimed my approach was too drastic and too costly. Pundits 
and politicians still doubt that Virginia can overhaul its entire criminal-
justice system without breaking the bank. Those naysayers failed to hear the 
public's demand for change. The people of Virginia--particularly crime 
victims and their families--are tired of seeing criminals walk free after 
serving only a fraction of their sentences. Businessmen can't afford to watch 
deals collapse because potential clients are concerned about crime. 
Prosecutors and police are frustrated that their hard work often amounts to 
abbreviated prison stints for criminals.</P>
<P>	In order to overturn the status quo approach to crime reduction, we 
listened to all those people and presented extensive research to show that 
what we had been doing was not working. Public safety is the primary 
responsibility of government. Without it, nothing else can succeed. Education, 
economic development, and health care all suffer when people feel 
threatened.</P>
<P>	Virginians came together to formulate and implement this reform. We 
looked at what North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and the federal government 
had done in the area of sentencing reform. We borrowed some of the best 
aspects of those systems and avoided some of the mistakes they made. In the 
end, we did it the Virginia way.</P>
<P>	The principle that guided this effort, and should guide policymakers in 
all issues, is honesty. Easy-release rules prevent judges and juries from 
preempting the community's judgment about the proper punishment for 
illegal conduct. Under the new law, judges will not have to play guessing 
games when imposing sentences. Police officers will not have to see the same 
criminals out on the streets only a year after their last arrest. Criminals will 
know that they cannot beat the system. Crime victims and their families will 
finally see justice done. Virginia's citizens can now trust that their 
government is working to make this Commonwealth a safe place to live, to 
work, and to raise families.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT></B>rop subsidies for the 400-acre farm that we rent here in northwest Missouri 
average $10,000 a year, and I've gotten in the habit of spending it all. But Pat Roberts, 
congressman from Dodge City, Kansas, and the new chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, assures me that I won't have to wear bib overalls with a scarlet "S" for 
"subsidy" on the front. Well, that's a relief.</P>
<P>	Roberts's sense of humor is as dry as the West Kansas wind. And this year he'll 
need it, because 1995 will see the reauthorization of the Farm Bill, the huge piece of 
legislation that will govern federal agricultural programs for the next five years. As a 
defender of the existing subsidies, Roberts may find himself as lonely as a Dodge City 
vegetarian.</P>
<P>	Several rounds of budget-cutting have pared farm programs by half, or $14 billion 
annually, since 1989. Roberts intends to protect what is left, and that may take more than 
a good sense of humor. He will have few allies. The Clinton administration has no 
interest in agriculture, except for a desire to turn the Midwest into a gigantic wetland, and 
to do whatever the poultry industry wants. Bob Dole, normally a roadblock in the way of 
farm reform, will be busy running the Senate and his presidential campaign. The new 
leadership of the House of Representatives includes Dick Armey, who looks at farm 
subsidies the way a dog looks at a bone. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, has opened the debate with a list of 53 questions about farm 
policy. His first one: "Should we have a farm program at all?" (Roberts likens Lugar to 
Lizzie Borden, taking 53 whacks at farmers.) Farm programs have been on the defensive 
for years, but Lugar is the first leading farm-state legislator to question their very 
existence. Roberts is circling the wagons to do what agriculture-committee chairmen have 
always done--protect the subsidies--but this time he may lose.</P>
<P>	Although I have long been a critic of farm subsidies in principle, Lugar's 
questions and the programs' unpopularity have suddenly turned a philosophical question 
into a frighteningly personal one. In addition to his 53 questions, the 54th and most 
important one is: How would I replace the $10,000 in subsidies that I receive each year?</P>
<P>	Well, for one thing, I'd grow more beans. My corn crop is directly subsidized, but 
my soybean crop isn't. So guess which crop I grow more of. Without corn subsidies, 
growing soybeans would be more profitable for us here in Westboro, and in many years 
beans are more profitable even after we receive our green government checks. But we 
consistently plant more than half our acres in corn to protect our corn base. Base is the 
number of acres planted to a subsidized crop, and is used to determine the size of 
government payments.</P>
<P>	If we plant more soybeans to take advantage of their greater profitability, we lose 
some eligibility for future corn subsidies. Fathers pass many important lessons along to 
their sons. Here in the Corn Belt, a 60-year-old lesson is: Protect your base!</P>
<P>	We could offset some of these lost subsidies by reducing our costs of production. 
Soybeans are cheaper to plant, and their yield is less dependent on timely rains. We could 
save on the expensive insecticides we have to apply to the 20 percent of our land that is in 
continuous corn.</P>
<P>	We could also save on commercial fertilizer. Soybeans "fix," or capture, nitrogen 
from the air and leave it in the soil. Some of that nitrogen is available as nutrient for the 
following year's crop. By increasing our soybean acreage, we could do with less 
fertilizer. (The two crops compete for the same acres in this region; if soybean prices 
dropped because lots of other farmers made the same decision, then corn would become 
more profitable.)</P>
<P>	Another thing we'd do without farm subsidies is grow more. In order to qualify 
for government payments, we must leave part of our farm idle. This spring, for instance, 
we will plant on only 380 of our 400 acres. We could plant those other 20 acres without 
any additional investment in tractors, or combines, or rent. Without the acreage 
limitations imposed by farm programs, we would spread our fixed costs over more acres.</P>
<P>	And perhaps most important of all, there is gumbo. Gumbo is the soil that makes 
up much of our river-bottom ground. The spring after we plant corn on gumbo, the soil 
has the consistency of well-cured concrete. There are only two solutions to this problem: 
fall plowing, which is terribly expensive, or rotation to soybeans.</P>
<P>	Without the program, we could increase our average yields through better crop 
rotation. Corn after soybeans consistently yields 10 to 20 percent more than second-year 
corn. So part of the lost subsidies would be replaced by higher yields.</P>
<P>	The largest single expense for any farmer is the cost of his land. And this is where 
the farm program has its biggest impact. The first thing farmers want to know when a 
neighbor's farm comes up for sale is the size of its crop base. Farms with a large corn 
base are eligible for higher subsidies, and so are worth more than those with a smaller 
one--another reason to protect the base. When farm subsidies diminish, the price of land 
falls. Farmers compete with one another for land.  Farm policy has the effect of 
subsidizing established farmers who own much of their land, and making it more difficult 
for younger farmers to buy or rent land to establish themselves. Farm programs are often 
touted as an attempt to save the family farm. But when the capitalized value of subsidies 
raises the costs to families who want to farm, the programs serve as a barrier to entry. Not 
surprisingly, the average age of farmers is well over 50. Cuts in farm subsidies would 
allow easier entry into farming, and less expensive transfer of farms between generations.</P>
<P>	Without subsidies, we would be freed of a number of bureaucratic burdens. This 
spring, we will have to trek to the local Consolidated Farm Services Administration office 
to receive approval for our crop plan. After all of our crops are planted, we must return to 
certify that we did what we said we would. Government planes fly over our farm to take 
photographs and make sure that our corn plantings are within the limits. (Since we 
farmers don't have antiaircraft batteries, the USDA needn't resort to spy satellites.) We 
also have to file conservation plans and plan our crop rotations years in advance.</P>
<P>	How much of the $10,000 that I've become so attached to would be replaced if I 
could farm without all these constraints? I don't know. If full-scale production led to 
huge surpluses, and crop prices fell to extremely low levels and stayed there, then I would 
suffer a great deal. But without the guarantee of protection from Uncle Sam, surpluses 
might not be as much of a problem as in the past. Loan rates (the floor under the market 
price) were set above the cost of production in the 1980 farm bill, and huge surpluses 
were the result.</P> 
<P>	But sometimes we learn from our mistakes: Since 1990, loan rates have been 
below market-clearing levels. Record harvests in 1992 and 1994 have not produced a 
huge carry-over of grain. In fact, prices are slightly higher now than after the 1992 
harvest, even though corn production in 1994 was considerably higher. And in years of 
short supply, my profits might well rise without farm programs, because the government 
sells its grain stocks to set a ceiling on prices.</P>
<P>	Senator Lugar wants to know why some crops are subsidized and others are not. 
He also wants to know whether unsubsidized crops are consistently less profitable than 
subsidized ones. As I've pointed out, we can make as much profit on soybeans, which are 
not directly subsidized, as on corn. The greenhouses where we grow unsubsidized 
geraniums are the most profitable enterprise on my farm, and I don't have to wait for a 
government check. Cattle and hogs have no subsidy programs, yet hogs are consistently 
among the most profitable of agricultural commodities. Florida oranges receive no 
government support, while California oranges are grown under government rules that 
constrain supply and raise prices. Are Florida growers selling out and heading for 
California? I hardly think so.</P>
<P>	Any government subsidy increases costs in the subsidized industry, and any 
government-provided profits tend to be bid into the factors of production. There is little 
evidence that subsidies boost profits in the long run, and the fact that some crops are 
subsidized and others are not is an accident of history and politics.</P>
<P>	In the last two years, farmers witnessed two events that will make more difference 
in the long run than any farm bill could: the passage of GATT and of NAFTA. These 
trade agreements will raise agricultural exports and prices by large amounts. GATT will 
require the European Union to cut subsidies by 36 percent. Export subsidies for more 
than 8 million tonnes of European exports will have to be cut. American farmers are the 
low-cost producers of most of the commodities that Europe subsidizes, and we stand to 
gain most of that business.</P>
<P>	GATT is expected to raise incomes worldwide by as much as $5 trillion in the 
next 10 years. Many of those dollars will be spent to improve diets, as consumers 
worldwide boost their consumption of meat. Since the passage of NAFTA, agricultural 
exports to Mexico have risen by 22 percent, or $670 million, in the first 10 months of 
1994.</P>

<H3>New Farmers' Market</H3>
<P>	That giant sucking sound you hear emanates mainly from Midwestern grain bins, 
busily shipping corn and soybeans south of the border. When Mexico recovers from its 
peso crisis, NAFTA is expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports annually by $2.6 
billion.</P>
<P>	As trade barriers around the world fall, the number of people who can afford to 
buy what I produce is increasing. China has a middle class 100 million strong. With 22 
percent of the world's population, and an economy growing at 10 percent per year, 
China's potential as a market for food is mindboggling. As NAFTA expands to include 
Central and South America, more new markets will open. When the decline in trade 
barriers is combined with growth in worldwide incomes, U.S. farmers may well be 
entering a golden age for agriculture. And here on my farm in Westboro, I may find that 
being part of a freer world market pays better than farming for Uncle Sam.</P>
<P>	I've thought a lot about Senator Lugar's questions. I've tried to figure out how it 
would affect me financially if the answers to those questions persuade Congress to end or 
drastically reduce farm programs. And I think the answer is clear. I can survive without 
subsidies. In some years, I might even be better off. And there is one more question that 
Lugar asked that goes to the crux of the matter: "What is the rationale for transferring 
public funds from taxpayers, most of whom have moderate incomes, to all farmers, 
including those whose incomes--are substantially above--average?" Well, I don't 
know how you justify that.</P>
<P>	Recently, my brother took his 15-year-old son along with him to the local USDA 
office. One of the employees behind the counter pointed out that my nephew was the 
fourth generation of our family that she had worked with. I'm a little uncomfortable with 
being on the dole for that length of time, and I'm particularly uncomfortable knowing that 
my income and assets would qualify me as solidly middle class. The lady behind the 
counter retired shortly afterwards. I don't imagine it was the thought of another 
generation of Hursts that drove her into retirement, but I do believe that maybe four 
generations of middle-class welfare is enough.</P>
<P>	As Congress scrutinizes farm programs, it needs to keep one thing in mind. Pat 
Roberts tells the story of one of his constituents, who said, "I don't care what you do to 
me, as long as you let me know."</P>
<P>	Farmers have planned their businesses with the expectation of continued farm 
payments. Any reform of agricultural policy must keep those expectations in mind. We 
have been adjusting to lower subsidies for five years, and have made those adjustments 
fairly easily. Perhaps we should allow another five years to wind down this 60-year-old 
experiment in central planning, retire our overalls with the red "S," and let farmers do 
what we do best: produce the cheapest and most plentiful food supply the world has ever 
known.</P>

<p>        	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT></B>othing could be more heart-breaking than the sight of a baby born with an 
addiction to cocaine. There is very little doctors and nurses can do to ease the pain of 
these innocent newborns, whose mothers' use of hard, illegal drugs during pregnancy 
constitutes nothing less than blatant child abuse.</P>
<P>	Walk into the neonatal unit of any hospital in America, and you will see crack-
cocaine babies. Some cry and shake uncontrollably. They refuse to take food. Many die.</P> 
<P>	And those who survive are far more likely than other children to be sentenced to 
lives of behavioral problems, birth defects, and learning disabilities.</P>
<P>	Nationwide, one in 10 children born has been exposed to cocaine in the womb. 
This condition affects 350,000 babies a year. Our society can address this problem 
effectively. We can significantly reduce this type of child abuse. Unfotunately, the policy 
of the Clinton administration is to protect, not the children, but the "rights" of the mothers 
to escape the consequences of their actions.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, when I was serving as a circuit solicitor in South Carolina, I 
became aware of the growing problem of crack-cocaine babies at Charleston's Medical 
Unversity of South Carolina (MUSC). My office worked with the hospital to aggressively 
confront pregnant women with the consequences of their drug use. Over a five-year 
period, we presented all pregnant mothers who tested positive for cocaine use with a 
choice: Either seek drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.</P>
<P>	This became one of the first "crack-baby" prevention programs in the nation. And 
the program worked. Scores of women agreed to enter rehabilitation and stayed off drugs 
for the remainder of their pregnancies. Before-and-after statistics present a clear picture. 
Before the sanctions took effect, 24 pregnant mothers a month tested positive for cocaine. 
Virtually none of them was willing to seek help voluntarily. Then, beginning in 1989, 
when we launched a tough amnesty program, the number testing positive for cocaine 
dropped to five or six a month. Prenatal visits as well as live births at the hospital stayed 
the same. Other states were looking at our success as a model.</P>
<P>	Tragically, the cocaine-baby program, which was clearly saving lives, was 
effectively shut down by the Clinton administration. Under the president's direction, a 
swarm of federal officials came to Charleston making unfounded allegations of 
discrimination and accusing the hospital of violating the "privacy rights" of the addicted 
mothers. The Clinton administration warned us that a private civil-rights suit was 
pending, and threatened to cut off $54 million in federal assistance, or about 60 percent 
of the facility's annual budget. Last year, the hospital finally relented, ending the 
successful intervention program.</P>
<P>    Now, once again, the babies cry out in agony. And once again, hospital staff with no 
legal recourse must watch pregnant women knowingly cause neurological damage to 
their unborn children. MUSC nurse Shirley Brown expressed the frustration eloquently: 
"You just have to sit around with your hands tied and watch them destroy a baby." 
Indeed she is right. If this is what President Clinton has in mind when he calls for a return 
to individual and community responsibility, then this administration faces a profound 
moral crisis.</P>
<P>	Administration officials and representatives of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) called the cocaine-baby program punitive, discriminatory, and invasive. 
In fact, it was none of the above.</P>
<P>	By the late 1980s, nurse Brown and her staff noticed an increasing number of 
pregnant women coming to the hospital--not for prenatal care, but because of 
hemorrhaging or other acute problems related to their pregnancies. In the course of 
treatment, many of these women tested positive for drug use, usually cocaine. Thus the 
program grew out of a deep concern among the hospital staff for the welfare of both 
mother and child.</P>
<P>	At first, the hospital tried to educate the women about the damage they were 
causing to themselves and to their unborn babies. Sadly, hospital workers could not 
convince many of the expectant drug-addicted women to enter a drug-treatment program. 
Most wouldn't even return for any type of prenatal care at all. The women--mostly poor 
and uneducated--received free counseling. They were offered free drug treatment and 
free prenatal care, but few participated in the program voluntarily.</P>
<P>	At the same time, the delivery and treatment of crack babies was putting a 
tremendous strain on hospital resources, as well as on the moral sensibilities of hospital 
personnel. Normal neonatal delivery costs can be as low as $500 per baby, but the costs 
of cocaine babies and the intense postnatal care they require have increased 
tremendously. The hospital has seen bills reach $750,000.  Most are born to welfare 
mothers, so Medicaid and the hospital were picking up the bill. According to the General 
Accounting Office, a single cocaine baby can run up a lifetime tab of $1 million in 
medical and educational costs.</P>
<P>	At the time we launched the cocaine baby program in Charleston, I was circuit 
solicitor. Last year, I was elected attorney general for South Carolina, and now view the 
problem from a statewide perspective. Hospitals across our state see drug-damaged 
babies with growing frequency. In every major city in the country, hospitals have units 
devoted to crack mothers and crack babies. But no one dares to forcefully address the 
causes of the problem. We are merely watching it happen and paying an increasingly high 
price in dollars and human suffering. We saw an opportunity to make a difference.</P>
<P>	During the operation of the cocaine-baby program in Charleston, everyone 
concerned was brought to the table--social workers, people from Charleston County 
Substance Abuse, drug-rehabilitation specialists, law-enforcement officials, hospital 
officials, and my office, which was willing to prosecute when necessary. We all agreed 
on one principle: We needed a program that used not only a carrot, but a real and very 
firm stick.</P>
<P>	Those who argued most forcefully for the cocaine-baby program were people who 
dealt with drug addiction every day: the rehabilitation specialists. They told us that 
"unless you have sanctions in place, unless you understand the basic irresponsibility of 
these drug-addicted women, it won't work."</P> 
<P>	Working closely with Chief Reuben Greenberg of the Charleston Police 
Department, we set up an amnesty program with sanctions for those who don't abide by 
the rules. Whenever a prenatal patient tested positive for drugs, hospital staff first 
counseled the mother about what she was doing to her unborn baby. They presented her 
with a letter from the solicitor's office explaining that she faced arrest and prosecution 
(crack cocaine use is a felony in South Carolina) if she refused treatment. The solicitor's 
office then promised to drop all charges if the woman successfully completed a drug-
treatment program. We saw this as a child-abuse prevention program with a goal of 
producing a healthy child.</P>
<P>	We had solid legal grounds to act in this manner, especially in the third trimester 
of the pregnancy. During the final trimester, the fetus is regarded as viable, that is, 
capable of sustaining life on its own, and is therefore granted significant protections 
under both federal and state law. Indeed, the viable fetus is a person under the law. In this 
legal context, we offered pregnant women immunity from prosecution, free medical 
services, and free access to a program of drug rehabilitation. All we asked of them in 
return was to enter the program in good faith and to stop abusing their unborn children 
with illegal drugs.</P>
<P>	Politically correct resolutions by the American Medical Association and the 
American Pediatrics Association denounced the policy as punitive and unwise. The 
National Institutes of Health also sent down some officials, who made the incredible 
claim that the hospital was conducting coercive experiments on pregnant women. Then 
the Clinton administration, ideologically driven by the absurd notion that a woman's 
privacy rights overrule a mother's most basic responsibility to her own child, would not 
allow us to protect the lives of the babies or their self-destructive mothers. Donna 
Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent an investigative team from the 
department's ethics division. One HHS official, without offering any evidence, claimed 
the program had "a chilling effect on minority pregnant women seeking prenatal health 
care."</P>
<P>	Of course, the cocaine-baby program was not punitive. The program was not 
designed to put people in jail. It was a humanitarian effort to save lives through tough, 
decisive action under urgent circumstances. In fact, the women involved in the program 
almost invariably avoided jail.</P>
<P>	Most of the pregnant women who tested positive for crack cocaine (after they 
understood their options) agreed to enter the drug program. The small number who 
refused the program were indeed arrested, but nearly all of their cases were dismissed 
because the women quickly agreed to enter the program once they saw we were serious. 
Only two continued to refuse help, and they were ultimately placed on probation. The 
cocaine-baby program was not a punitive "lock-up" program, but an amnesty program. 
And it was working.</P>
<P>	Also, there is absolutely no evidence that it scared anyone away from prenatal 
care. Remember, very few of these women came to the hospital in the first place to take 
advantage of prenatal services. They came because of urgent medical problems related 
either to their pregnancy or to their addiction.</P>
<P>	Opponents of our cocaine-baby program continually failed to understand that 
prosecutorial action, like a thermostat, can be constantly adjusted. Charges can be 
dropped at any time. We can add conditions.</P> 
<P>	The system has a great deal of flexibility that can be used to motivate 
irresponsible people to take responsible action. Many public defenders (though they are 
not likely to admit it publicly) thought the cocaine-baby program was a great idea.</P>
<P>	Cocaine addicts need a strong motive to mend their ways. And most drug and 
law-enforcement officials also agree. A federally funded research survey showed that 
about 30 percent of those who enter public drug-treatment programs do so only because 
of direct or indirect legal pressure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy noted in a 
1992 report that "the criminal justice system can steer offenders toward drug treatment as 
a condition for deferred prosecution."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration, however, seemed utterly unconcerned with common 
sense or practical solutions to a problem that is literally destroying the lives of adults and 
infants. Within a matter of weeks, HHS also sent investigators from its Office of Civil 
Rights. They alleged that the program was discriminatory toward blacks. Marie Chretien, 
a regional manager in the Office of Civil Rights, claimed in a letter to the hospital that its 
substance-abuse policy "may result in an adverse disproportionate impact on African-
American women."</P>
<P>	It is true that most of the women treated were black. The hospital serves a 
primarily indigent population, and most of the patient population is black. The South 
Carolina Drug Prevalence Study showed blacks were more likely to use cocaine than 
whites.</P>
<P>	Ask Police Chief Greenberg, who is also African American, if this policy was 
discriminatory. He would be among the first to tell you that cocaine use is much more 
common in South Carolina among blacks than whites--and that the black community 
was benefiting most from the prenatal program. "[The program's opponents] don't care 
about the race issue. They're just using this as a tactic," Greenberg says. "I was glad that 
somebody was finally doing something to help kids in the black community. It was 
giving kids a chance who otherwise would not have anything close to an equal playing 
field. At least at the point of birth, that child ought to be given the best opportunity for a 
full and productive life."</P>
<P>	In spite of all this, the HHS civil-rights office threatened in a letter last June to cut 
off federal money to MUSC unless it backed away from its aggressive treatment program. 
"It is the government's obligation to ensure that federal funds do not support a program 
which discriminates," Chretien wrote in the letter. "This obligation entails making a 
formal determination of whether there is a violation of the Title VI regulation--and if 
negotiations for voluntary compliance fail, the initiation of administrative enforcement 
proceedings to terminate federal financial assistance."</P>
<P>	What continues to amaze me, as the state's chief law-enforcement officer, is the 
groundlessness of the discrimination charge. In October 1993, the liberal, feminist Center 
for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a civil suit against the hospital alleging that its 
policy was racially discriminatory, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment. The New York-based center, an offshoot of the ACLU, asked a 
federal judge to issue an injunction against the hospital to suspend the drug-testing 
program. The judge declined, finding no basis for the discrimination charge.</P>
<P>	It's no coincidence, by the way, that shortly after the feminist group failed in its 
lawsuit, investigators from the Clinton administration swooped down on the Medical 
University. I am convinced their plan was coordinated with HHS officials. So is the 
hospital. "It was obvious to us there was collusion between the center and all the federal 
agencies that came down on us," says the university's president, Dr. James Edwards.</P>
<P>	Whether HHS officials would have followed with their own lawsuit is unclear. 
Almost certainly they could not have won in court. But they didn't need to. The hospital, 
dependent on federal funding, never had a chance. HHS agents made an ex parte decision 
that the program was discriminatory. And so they exercised the federal version of the 
golden rule--that is, they've got the gold, so they make the rules.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration was willing to withhold millions of dollars from the 
Medical University, stop all of its Medicaid assistance, shut down its children's hospital 
and its cancer center, discontinue dozens of medical services from radiation oncology to 
pediatric surgery, close down its 558 beds, and force the hospital to turn away its 
patients--all to end a program that offended the liberal sensibilities of Donna Shalala and 
Bill Clinton. A gun was held to the hospital's head, and for the protection of all the other 
patients, the hospital had to agree to give up.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, this saga isn't over yet. The Office of the Solicitor and virtually 
everyone else involved in the hospital's prenatal drug policy is being sued by the Center 
for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of five women who tested positive for cocaine.</P> 
<P>	They want $3 million. It's a complicated suit, but it boils down to a claim that the 
program violated their right to privacy. In fact, the so-called constitutional right to 
privacy does not protect the results of a drug screen, especially not in this case.</P>
<P>	First of all, you don't have a right to use crack cocaine; it's a felony. Second, all 
of the women knew about the amnesty program--there were public-service 
announcements about it, the women voluntarily came to the only hospital in the state that 
sponsored it, they were counseled about the consequences of testing positive, and they all 
signed consent forms before being screened.</P>
<P>	Medical personnel are held legally accountable for the health of both mother and 
unborn child throughout the pregnancy. In fact, malpractice insurance exists to support 
the obligations of primary-care providers in just such cases. If a fetus is damaged by 
inadequate, mistaken, or negligent medical practice, the hospital would quickly face 
lawsuits. So how is it that we have no legal means to keep mothers from seriously 
damaging or destroying their own babies? "If the mother is not going to be held 
responsible," says nurse Brown, "then I don't think any nurse or physician giving 
obstetrical care should have to be held liable."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration apparently believes that infants have no rights at all 
until the umbilical cord is cut. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never said that the states 
do not have a compelling interest in protecting the health of the unborn in the third 
trimester when they can live outside the womb. Indeed, case law in South Carolina and 
elsewhere suggests that society does have certain obligations to the unborn child, 
certainly at very advanced stages of development. South Carolina courts have interpreted 
"person" to include a viable fetus.</P>
<P>	We put tremendous resources into prosecuting child-abuse cases because of the 
great damage done to children, and we make no apologies for that. The cocaine-baby 
program we started in South Carolina was, most of all, a child-abuse prevention program, 
protecting the smallest and the most innocent of children.</P>
<P>	President Clinton and his messengers appear to be fundamentally unconcerned 
with the hundred of thousands of cocaine-addicted women who stagger into the delivery 
units of hospitals across the land. The only remedy they offer to the horribly damaged 
children who result from this madness is to increase the flow of Medicaid dollars, 
provided by taxpayers, to pay a price so large that it is literally impossible to calculate. 
And the greatest frustration of all is knowing that this increasingly expensive tragedy can 
be prevented. One of the most basic responsibilities a mother has is to her child. If a 
mother injected cocaine into the tiny arm of her infant, causing permanent brain damage 
or death, certainly that mother would be arrested and prosecuted.</P>
<P>	Yet that is exactly what addicted mothers do when they consume cocaine 
throughout their pregnancy. In South Carolina, we tried to do something about it. The 
program we created was working. Now it is no more. And as long as powerful federal 
bureaucrats continue to manipulate federal funding to serve a bizarre agenda that is deaf 
to the cries of damaged babies, there is nothing more we can do.</P>
<P>	Why is the Clinton administration stopping us from protecting our children?</P>

	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>hen Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith offered to help Congress find alternative 
sources of money to replace federal funding of public-television broadcasting, PBS 
supporters protested en masse. And when Jones Intercable--which already distributes 
adult-education courses through its Mind Extension University--offered to take over 
programming for PBS, the cries of outrage grew louder. Public broadcasting, which has 
always presented itself as an impoverished charity case throughout years of on-air beg-a-
thons, was suddenly described by PBS president Ervin Duggan as a valuable business 
enterprise that should not be "sold off for scrap."</P>
<P>	A similar contradiction surfaced when House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) first 
announced on National Empowerment Television (which receives no tax money) that 
he'd like to "zero out" federal subsidies for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Lobbyists attacked him for wanting to "kill" public broadcasting. This same lobby 
counters criticism of its reliance on tax money by pointing out that the federal share of its 
revenue was only 14 percent of the total.</P>
<P>	The conflicting arguments of public-television advocates against the privatization 
of the industry illuminate the broad contours of the debate: Congress is now debating 
proposed cuts in appropriations for public broadcasting of 15 percent for 1996 and 30 
percent for 1997. But the issue is about more than just $285.6 million in tax money; it is 
also about the role and reach of the federal government and an elitist culture determined 
to manipulate it for its own purposes:</P>

<H3>Plenty of Money</H3>
<P>	Public broadcasters maintain that the federal share of their income is sacrosanct, 
the "seed money," and quite unlike the remaining 86 percent that comes from other 
sources. But, in fact, the federal matching formulas work precisely in the opposite 
manner. It is the non-federal money which is the "seed money" for public broadcasting, 
as anyone who has ever watched a pledge-week special will recognize. The federal 
government offers to match the amount of private funds each station succeeds in raising. 
This is the reason large urban stations with wealthy viewerships perversely receive more 
money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting than do small, rural stations. It all 
prompts the question: Why are CPB advocates so certain the rest of their income could 
not be generated outside of federal coffers?</P>
<P>	It was a curious thing to watch this hostility to businessmen displayed by 
representatives of an institution that usually, at least in public, sings honeyed praises of 
"public-private partnership." These same elites point to the many <I>Fortune 500</I> 
corporations that enjoy enhanced prestige through their association with PBS: General 
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, GTE, New York Life, and Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	Indeed, private-sector benefactors who offered to raise money for the educational 
broadcasting system were described by Frank Rich, a columnist for the <I>New York Times</I>, 
not as generous philanthropists, but rather as "circling vultures." The privatization that 
had once been described as impossible is now denounced as being all too likely.</P>
<P>	The availability of private funding sources reveals that the fundamental issues are 
ideological and not financial. Proponents of federal support for public broadcasting want 
the government to be involved because they dislike private enterprise. They claim to fear 
the "trash" that a market-based broadcasting system could produce. They say they want 
to make television "safe for kids."</P>
<P>	What they dislike, however, is not poor-quality programming, but the very idea of 
the market. If it were the former, then how can PBS justify <I>Tales of the City</I>, a campy 
soap opera; <I>Tongues Untied</I>, which was both crude and lewd; Frontline's <I>Death of a 
Playboy Centerfold</I> and <I>Death of a Porn Queen</I>, subjects more suitable to tabloid 
television; and <I>Yanni: Live at the Acropolis</I>, which some might consider of doubtful 
value? Clearly such programming is not intrinsically superior to <I>A Current Affair</I> or 
<I>Inside Edition</I>. In fact, trash is not in the least offensive to the fans of public 
broadcasting--commercial trash is.</P>
<P>	In the PBS world view, exposure on public television can even elevate 
commercial television into art. Take the case of <I>I'll Fly Away</I>. A CBS drama starring Sam 
Waterston and Alfre Woodard, it did well critically, but poorly in the ratings, and was 
canceled after one season. PBS picked it up, producing one new episode and then airing a 
full season of repeats. The series depicted the effect on one family of the civil rights 
movement in the South, and flattered the sensibility of the liberal professionals who make 
up the core PBS audience. No doubt they could identify with this well-educated Southern 
family, which was manifestly superior to the backwards rednecks who made up the rest 
of the white folks in the series.</P>
<P>	The program was among the highest-rated shows ever broadcast by the network. 
If anything, the success of <I>I'll Fly Away</I> has indicated that a show by commercial 
producers was just what public broadcasting needed. But that was not what happened. 
Despite the series's appeal, no further commercial drama has appeared on the network. 
Indeed, PBS even canceled a development deal with producer Brandon Tartikoff, who 
had been president of NBC when it was at the top of the ratings.</P>
<P>	Commercial-drama producers were not welcome at PBS even after the success of 
<I>I'll Fly Away</I>, just as Bell Atlantic is not welcome as a replacement for Uncle Sam. The 
reason is simple: Public broadcasters see themselves as an aristocracy and, like aristocrats 
everywhere, they find commerce beneath them. No matter that the U.S. Constitution 
prohibits titles of nobility; public broadcasters see themselves like the Dons of 18th-
century Spain, with neither dust on their boots nor soil of commerce on their hands.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic pose of public broadcasting, and protestations of independence 
from mainstream American tastes, is curiously dependent precisely on the patronage of 
the federal government. Otherwise, the status of the enterprise is no different from that of 
any other broadcasting entity. Indeed, the aristocratic pretension even informs the refusal 
of the public-broadcasting lobby on Capitol Hill to submit CPB to the Freedom of 
Information Act. To disclose information to the American public--to mere commoners--
would be to lose stature. The mystery of the enterprise would be disturbed, and without 
the mystery, there would be little majesty.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conceit also undergirds broadcasters' refusal to ensure, as the law 
requires, that programming is objective and balanced. The Public Broadcasting Act of 
1967 specifically calls for such balance in all matters of public controversy. This was 
necessary for the same reason Congress passed the ban on domestic dissemination of the 
Voice of America--that it would be dangerous to allow the federal government's power 
over the press to be exploited by a victorious political faction.</P> 
<P>	In 1992, after complaints of imbalance and the intercession of Senator Dole (R-
KS), Congress strengthened the statute to provide for a procedural review of 
programming and commissioning of remedial fare whenever public broadcasters violated 
standards of objectivity. Yet, after almost three years, the CPB has never admitted a 
single mistake, nor commissioned a single hour of remedial programming.</P>
<P>	A desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for this 
otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. For to admit error would be to place public 
broadcasting on the same plane as the commercial press. <I>The New York Times</I> prints 
corrections every single day. The <I>Washington Post</I> has an ombudsman. When NBC was 
caught rigging a crash test on Dateline NBC, the company fired the president of NBC 
News. But when PBS aired the fraudulent <I>Liberators</I>, which falsely gave credit for the 
liberation of Buchenwald to African-American troops instead of the 6th Armored 
Division, WNET in New York retracted it after substantial public pressure from Jewish 
groups and World War II veterans. Yet not a single head rolled, and no corrective 
programming was aired.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conception of status also thrives in the relation of CPB to 
Congress. Although dependent on the federal government for its annual appropriation, 
the CPB regards its role as a "heat shield" against Congressional critics rather than a 
regulator. That is, public broadcasting must be permitted to receive federal funds and 
commission programming with no questions asked. The government-weary electorate 
demands accountability for tax money spent on every other government program. Yet 
public broadcasters stand with the National Endowment for the Arts as one of the few 
recipients who claim a special exemption.</P>

<H3>Kids as Shields</H3>
<P>	PBS's attitude is bad enough when it is programming for the "new class" of 
professionals and educators. But it is even worse when it hides behind supposed concern 
for the sensibilities of children. Commercials, one of the engines of revenue, are deemed 
hazardous by a cadre of "experts" in education and media, who need to certify shows as 
"educational."</P>
<P>	But here's the rub: When advertising aimed at children became increasingly 
restricted on the networks, PBS became the venue for licensing bonanzas connected to its 
shows. For example, over 5,000 products connected to Sesame Street are grossing almost 
$1 billion in annual sales. Yet the show is nevertheless considered "non-commercial" 
because it is certified as such by "experts" in educational psychology, such as Gerald 
Lesser, a founder of Children's Television Workshop (which created <I>Sesame Street</I>) and 
a professor at Harvard University's School of Education.</P> 	
<P>	PBS executives try to have it both ways. On the one hand, they shun commercial 
television because of its commercializing influence on children. On the other hand, those 
with the franchises for PBS shows enjoy exclusive advantages no other toy vendors can 
claim--for they carry the noble title, "educational," and the PBS seal.</P>

<H3>Big-Bucks Programming</H3>
<P>	In public broadcasting, the democratic institution of Congress, which is 
responsible to the taxpayer, relinquishes the power to approve programs to an unelected 
bureaucracy. In deciding who gets grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has 
depended on judgments from expert panels of industry insiders, rather than the board of 
directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Again, the principle is 
clear: CPB should be accountable neither to the marketplace nor to the taxpayers and 
their representatives.</P>
<P>	In fiscal year 1993, CPB distributed some $289.4 million to 200 affiliated 
television stations and 490 affiliated radio stations. That was about 14 percent of the 
total--about $2 billion--spent on public radio and television. By way of comparison, in 
fiscal year 1993, CBS was the number-one rated television network in the country, with a 
prime-time Nielsen rating of 14.0, and earned broadcasting revenues of about $2.3 
billion. At that time, public television stations spent about $1.2 billion for an average 
prime time rating of under 2.5. In other words, CBS was paying $164 million for every 
ratings point in 1993, while PBS was paying about $480 million per ratings point.</P> 
<P>	Were PBS viewers three times as valuable as network audiences, or was the 
federally-subsidized network simply paying three times as much to reach the same 
people? Rather than reaching the most people for the least amount of money--a 
democratic mission--public broadcasting strives to reach a select group of people, no 
matter the cost. Such targeting of consumers happens all the time in the commercial 
marketplace. But it's hard to justify for a democratically funded organization.</P> 
<P>	This phenomenon of elitist and parochial disdain, then, begins to explain the 
unwillingness of the public broadcasting lobby to engage in the debate over the specifics 
of public broadcasting. The problem is not lack of money. It is simple snobbery on the 
part of public broadcasters. Federal tax dollars are considered "clean." Private donations, 
sponsorship, or underwriting is considered "dirty."</P>
<P>	Could the public broadcasting system become self-sufficient? Of course. The 
money is already there, within the same system that has been growing for more than 27 
years. As President Clinton himself told Brian Lamb in a C-Span interview during the 
1992 campaign, the public broadcasting system is pretty healthy, and he "didn't know 
that we needed to spend any more money on it." The president's own budget line item for 
CPB has been essentially frozen since he took office, and his administration actually 
proposed a 6 percent cut for public broadcasting in its 1996 budget.</P>

<H3>Drawing from the Well</H3>
<P>	Where could taxpayer funding find a substitute? Any number of combinations and 
permutations of replacement funders spring to mind.</P>
<UL><LI>  More than 5.2 million members contribute some $391 million annually to public-
broadcasting stations. That's about $75 each. Since public-broadcasting membership 
represents the top stratum of the socioeconomic ladder, were each subscriber simply to 
pledge $56 additional each year, it would yield public broadcasting $290 million--the 
entire federal share. Not too difficult a challenge, considering that the average net worth 
of the membership of WETA, a PBS station in Washington, D.C., is $627,000, according 
to <I>USA Today</I>.<BR> 
<LI>  The private foundations that support public broadcasting are among the richest entities 
in America today. They include the multi-billion-dollar Ford, MacArthur, Warhol, and 
Rockefeller foundations. Certainly these vast accumulators of wealth could increase their 
contributions to public broadcasting as well. The Ford Foundation alone has a $6 billion 
endowment. If public broadcasting were a genuine priority for them, private foundations 
could make up the $290 million annual appropriation from their own bank accounts.<BR>
<LI>  The commercial radio and television networks that benefit from the fact that PBS and 
National Public Radio serve to crowd out potential competitors could fund public 
broadcasting in the same way that cable companies pay for C-Span, as a cost of doing 
business and a way of increasing corporate goodwill. Split between NBC, ABC, CBS, 
and Fox, the sum required would be about $75 million each, and no doubt the networks 
could barter programs onto the schedule as part of the contribution. This system was 
actually used by Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain to establish Channel 
Four--originally proposed as taxpayer-supported. A private corporation owned by the 
other commercial television companies and known collectively as Independent Television 
(ITV), Channel Four was so successful at nurturing alternative and diverse television 
programming that it has actually begun to support itself, even attracting commercial 
sponsors. It frequently draws better than the BBC's arts and cultural channel, BBC-2.<BR>
<LI>  Hollywood stars are quite vocal in their support of public broadcasting, lining up to 
testify at congressional hearings. But they haven't yet confessed that they are in a better 
position than most to make up for the federal share. Entertainer Barbara Streisand, who 
makes $10 million to $15 million per picture while warning about the deleterious effects 
of cutting public television funding, admitted in a recent speech at Harvard that 
Americans spend about $340 billion annually on the entertainment industry. A donation 
from the Hollywood moguls totaling only one-half of 1 percent of those receipts would 
amount to more than five times the federal share to all of public broadcasting.</UL>
<P>	What's going on here? Are CPB and its offspring, NPR and PBS, hapless paupers 
dependent on the federal dole? Or are they sophisticated business ventures whose profit 
potential remains untapped? Which is it? Although Streisand denounces conservatives for 
emphasizing the private sector, she has chosen to work with commercial Hollywood 
studios and record companies. Stars like Streisand, along with other "arts advocates" 
from groups like the Creative Coalition such as Blair Brown, Christopher Reeve, Ron 
Silver, and William and Alec Baldwin, could agree to donate their time to do one 
television special a year for public broadcasting. They could get their Hollywood friends 
to join them, and the programming could be used as pledge specials. If such stars 
appeared for free on PBS, their shows could be used for fundraising, much like <I>The Three 
Tenors</I> is used now.</P>
<P>	How much money could Hollywood raise for public broadcasting? You do the 
math: Streisand brought in a cool $1 million for then-candidate Bill Clinton at a 1992 
fundraiser. In 1986, she raised $1.5 million for a group of six Democratic congressional 
candidates. Forbes magazine estimates Streisand earned $52 million in 1994.</P> 
<P>	Other big-money show-business stars (according to Forbes) include Oprah 
Winfrey, who made $53 million last year, Bill Cosby ($34 million), Harrison Ford ($27 
million), Bruce Willis ($19 million), Tom Hanks ($16 million), Kevin Costner ($15 
million), Tom Cruise ($14 million), Eddie Murphy ($13 million), and Roseanne ($13 
million). The richest of them all is Steven Spielberg. Forbes magazine estimates 
Spielberg makes $165 million to $170 million annually.</P>
<P>	We know where at least some of their money goes. Spielberg donated $161,000 to 
Democrats running for Congress. Five studio political-action committees gave $866,798 
to Democrats (compared to $187,050 to Republicans). MCA chairman Lew Wasserman 
gave more than $230,000 to Democrats in 1992, compared to $6,000 to Republicans. In 
1992 Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg (now partnered with Spielberg and music mogul David 
Geffen in a new company) gave over $100,000 to Democrats and $2,000 to Republicans. 
Disney's Michael Eisner gave $19,000 to Democrats and $3,000 to Republicans. Eisner, 
it should be remembered, sold almost $200 million worth of Disney stock after the 
election of Bill Clinton because he feared higher taxes. That one transaction was worth 
almost the entire amount the Corporation for Public Broadcasting spent on PBS in 1992.</P>
<P>   With the biggest names from the silver screen appearing on PBS, there is no question 
but audiences would rise to the occasion. In fact, PBS President Duggan, in a speech to 
affiliates last year, said he would love to have a Barbra Streisand special on PBS for 
pledge week. No doubt CD sales alone would make a startling contribution to the PBS 
budget. Yet so far, Barbra is still operating in the commercial sphere. Why?</P>
<P>	Underwriters would surely love to be associated with top stars, and so private 
support would no doubt more than make up the federal shortfall. Indeed, producers like 
Norman Lear (founder of People for the American Way) might even agree to produce 
series for PBS and donate their fees as contributions, with residual rights reverting to 
PBS.</P>
<UL><LI>  As Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) showed, the telephone companies seem to be willing 
to provide free over-the-air educational and cultural programming in exchange for the 
right to enter the broadcasting business. Certainly regulators and corporations could 
arrange to make duplicate television stations available for other purposes while 
maintaining the core mission of public broadcasting as a cost of doing business.<BR>
<LI>  Cable companies like Jones Intercable also appear ready to step into the breach, 
providing public-service broadcasting in order to expand their activities. Such offers 
should be seriously considered. Another cablecaster expressing interest is the Discovery 
Network, which also runs The Learning Channel.<BR> 
<LI>  Finally, PBS could strike better deals with the producers of <I>Barney, Sesame Street, The 
Civil War, The Frugal Gourmet</I>, and the dozens of other extremely lucrative programs 
with merchandising tie-ins carried on the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves. Valuable air time 
is now given away for free to these producers, who know what to do with it. Producers of 
<I>Sesame Street</I>, for example, use the subsidized exposure to sell $800 million worth of 
some 5,000 licensed products annually. The show's producer, Children's Television 
Workshop, has about $70 million in stocks and bonds and pays its top executives more 
than $300,000 a year. Barney was estimated to sell about $500 million worth of products 
in 1993, and <I>Shining Time Station</I> garnered $250 million. Intelligent licensing deals alone 
could probably make up the lost federal subsidy from products connected to PBS's 
children's programming.</P></UL>
<P>	The recent announcement that CPB would get a share of <I>Barney's</I> net profits is 
unfortunately mere window dressing. In show business, only gross points are real dollars, 
and CPB does not share in the gross under any known contract. One reason that 
producers connected to public broadcasting have enjoyed such sweet arrangements is that 
the system is federally subsidized, There is no incentive to strike the most profitable deal. 
As media critic Brent Bozell noted in recent congressional testimony, it is very hard for 
public-broadcasting executives to go up to Capitol Hill and ask for increasing amounts of 
taxpayer money if they are making millions from selling T-shirts.</P>
<P>	And they are. The <I>Wireless</I> and <I>Signals</I> catalogs produced by Boston's WGBH 
and Minnesota Public Radio, for example, yield about $150 million in total. On the East 
Coast, PBS stations are partners in the Learningsmith chain of stores, pioneered by 
WGBH and WETA. On the West Coast, KCET owns a chain, The Store of Knowledge. 
Both are private firms that benefit from the cross-promotion, advertising, and corporate 
goodwill of their association with PBS. But their books are sealed to the public, exempted 
from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
<P>	Public broadcasting can survive, indeed thrive, without a penny of scarce taxpayer 
dollars. There are many alternative sources of revenue, from station members, to 
corporate underwriters, to alternative programmers. Better deals can be struck with those 
who are exploiting the present system. The opposition to self-sufficiency is based not on 
practical considerations, but rather on an ideological commitment to the role of the 
federal government as the guarantor of culture and education--much as in Britain, where 
there are jams and jellies carrying the emblem, "by appointment to Her Majesty."</P> 
<P>	That is why the current debate over public broadcasting is so fierce. It is a 
struggle between those with an "unconstrained vision," in the words of economist 
Thomas Sowell, of an all-powerful central government run by an educated elite that does 
everything, including decide what is cultural and educational television. On the other side 
are those who feel a commitment to limited government. As Representative John Kasich 
(R-OH) recently put it, "the vast majority of people we hear from say, as we go into the 
21st century, government doesn't need to run a television station."</P>
<BR>
<B>LAURENCE JARVIK <I>is the director of the Washington office of the Center for the Study of 
Popular Culture.</B></I>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>ashington is a city of monuments. Its grandest and most expensive is a work 
still in progress, but nearing completion: the District of Columbia itself, which 
commemorates the ruin of American liberalism.</P>
<P>	The D.C. government is bankrupt today because liberal policies have decimated 
its tax base. Washington is a hollow community of extreme rich and poor. Landlords and 
private employers have fled by the thousands, followed by nearly the entire middle class 
of taxpayers. Although Washington is the center of one of the most dynamic information-
based economies in the U.S, it has a declining population and a growing number of 
people below the poverty line. This year, twice as many households as in 1988 lack 
phones. In no other laboratory of democracy has the liberal experiment taken such pure 
form. Nowhere else have the results been so damning. </P>
<P>	The District is perhaps the most liberal city in America. Nine of every 10 
registered voters are Democrats, and the Socialist Workers Party fields more candidates 
for local office than the Republican Party. Conceived at the high tide of American 
liberalism, the District government is a product of its times, more concerned with the 
rights of groups than with the responsibilities of individuals. Many of the original office 
holders, political activists with no experience in private enterprise, are still in power 
today. The results are tragic. Among all U.S. states, the District has the highest per-capita 
murder and violent-crime rates, the highest percentage of residents on public assistance, 
the highest-paid school board, the lowest SAT scores, and the most single-parent 
families.</P> 
<P>	The political activists have built a government they can't afford. Although the city 
takes in an astounding $8,950 in revenue for every man, woman, and child in its 
jurisdiction (compared with $4,100 and $3,700 in nearby Maryland and Virginia, 
respectively), the District still manages to spend $1,000 more per person than it receives. 
The result is a budget deficit edging closer to $1 billion with each new audit. </P>
<P>	The victims of this ferociously progressive government are not the wealthy and 
privileged, but the middle class and beleaguered. Today, in some parts of the city, it 
seems entire neighborhoods are for sale. In places like Shepherd Park, Lincoln Park, 
Marshall Heights--communities once redolent of African-American pride and history--
there are lonely streets whose only splash of color appears on the real-estate signs that 
seem to sprout from every other garden plot. </P>
<P>	At the end of one of these streets stands the Florida Avenue Grill. From behind 
the counter of the often-crowded restaurant, Lacey Wilson Jr. has seen the District of 
Columbia ebb and flow. These days, it's mostly ebbing. Back in 1944, when Wilson's 
father opened his soul-food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th Street, 
near the LeDroit Park section of Northwest Washington, the city was a thriving 
community of educated descendants of freed slaves, flourishing family businesses, and 
urban sophistication. It was also a magnet of opportunity for blacks seeking to escape 
rural poverty. At mid-century, wartime Washington offered stable, well-paying white-
collar jobs in the federal bureaucracy. People came and put down roots. </P>
<P>	Eighteen years ago, when Lacey Wilson Jr. began working at the Grill full time, 
the neighborhood brimmed with well-kept houses and children playing. Today, the Grill 
stands alone in an otherwise vacant lot. In the short time since the District was granted 
home rule in 1974, Washington has gone from promised land to no-man's-land. "Most of 
the families who lived here have moved out to Maryland," says Wilson, himself a refugee 
to "the peace and quiet" of suburban Virginia. Those who stayed in the neighborhood, 
according to Wilson, are trapped in houses that have lost 30 percent of their value in the 
last eight years. </P>
<P>	Business used to be better, says Wilson. The vacant lot next door means more 
taxicabs can park at lunch time, but the crime that holds this city hostage each night has 
cut his after-dark dinner traffic by half. Proud of his restaurant's permanence in a 
turbulent world, Wilson stands below rows of signed photos of his famous patrons--
athletes, musicians, and local politicians, including a young Marion Barry glowing with 
promise before dissipation hardened his face and tarnished his reputation as a can-do 
mayor.</P>
<P>	Wilson and his patrons are concerned that Washington, once the incubator of 
America's black middle class, is now a place from which to escape. After reaching a peak 
population of 800,000, the city has withered to just 578,000 last year, and the trend has 
accelerated. Ten thousand residents desert the city each year. Even worse news is who is 
leaving: the homeowners, the entrepreneurs, the role models--in short, the black middle 
class. They are leaving for the suburbs, and with every defector, D.C. loses a taxpayer, 
which shrinks the tax base available for feeding a voracious welfare state that causes 
more frustrated residents to leave, and on and on.</P>
<P>	Census figures reveal that during the second half of the 1980s, 157,100 residents, 
or one-fifth of the entire population, moved out of the District. About half of those 
emigrants moved to Maryland and 12 percent to Virginia. According to the Greater 
Washington Research Center, black households earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year made up a disproportionate number of these refugees. In their place, affluent, single 
whites are moving into the city, but not enough to offset the loss. The result is a city 
rapidly dividing into segregated communities of economic extremes.</P>
<P>	Ask people at the Florida Street Grill about middle-class flight, and they'll tell 
you it is the little things that make life difficult in the District. Thomas Jones, finishing up 
his lunch before driving back to his job in Virginia, says it costs too much to live in the 
city. "Not just money," he says, "but time and aggravation." The Grill attracts an 
unusually diverse crowd for Washington, but there is agreement on one point: The 
government is no longer a neutral referee for self-sufficient citizens, but a muscular 
competitor against private enterprise. "For all the forms I need to fill out and all the 
inspections I'd have to have--and I'm not even talking about the fees and taxes," says 
one would-be entrepreneur, "why should I do business here? They've got open arms in 
Maryland. They make it easy there." A discussion soon erupts over the merits of 
suburban life, including such "innovations" as drive-through car registration, a one-stop 
business office where permits and licenses are issued, and same-day street repairs. The 
District, on the other hand, offers a notoriously slow motor-vehicles department, a 
bureaucracy suspicious of any profitable endeavor, and patchwork streets that haven't 
seen new asphalt in years. </P>
<P>	Wilson, Jones, and a number of other patrons own at least one rental unit in the 
city--often the place they used to live in. Thanks to the city government, these units are a 
steadier source of frustration than of income. The District has some of the most stringent 
rent-control and tenant's-rights provisions in the nation, but instead of helping 
disadvantaged renters, the laws tend to discourage rental activity. "It's not worth it to rent 
out your property," says Jones. He tells a harrowing story of a tenant who exploited all 
the rules to live, rent-free, for more than 16 months. "She had me in court. Never paid me 
anything, and she had the nerve to sue me!" Wilson and others at the counter nod 
knowingly. "I'll never rent out again," Jones declares. "After getting it up to code, what 
with rent control, it takes you 20 years to get your money back."</P>
<P>	Behind the cash register at the Florida Avenue Grill stands Edgar Featherson, a 
native Washingtonian with a quiet, genteel grace that reminds you of the once courtly 
city. After the lunch crowd dwindles, Featherson drives home through the LeDroit Park 
neighborhood in the early afternoon. The sidewalks overflow with students from the four 
public schools in the area. The children are a concern to Featherson.</P>
<P>	"They don't have the kind of family I was blessed with," he says. He is proud of 
his education, much of it the result of lessons his mother drilled into him years ago. The 
world has changed dramatically since then. He tells a story of the time he prepared dinner 
for his nephew and a friend from the neighborhood. "This boy had never seen anything 
like it. I made them put their coats away and wash their hands before we sat down," he 
recalls. "By the end of the night, you know that boy would not leave the house? He never 
had anyone telling him how to act, never had anyone treat him like a normal child." With 
a mixture of disgust and guilt, Featherson shakes his head. "This boy was so starved for 
love, he wouldn't leave." </P>
<P>	Featherson's nephew doesn't go to public school. He attends Archbishop Carroll 
High School in another part of town, partly because parents there are more involved in 
their children's education than they are in D.C. public schools. "If you don't show up at a 
parent-teacher meeting at Carroll, you get fined," he says. "They'd never try that in 
public school." To Featherson, public education is a mechanism for downward mobility, 
not a ladder out of poverty. "Look at Franklin Smith [the Superintendent of D.C. Public 
Schools]. He sends his kids to private school. He has a choice and he doesn't even send 
his own children to public school. Now what does that say about D.C. schools?" </P>
<P>	He mentions a news item from the Washington Times, reporting that in the 
seventh-grade "intensive" English class at one of the city's elite junior-high schools, not a 
single book was assigned to the class during the entire year. "And that's in the best 
schools," he says. "You can imagine what they're like in the rest of the city."</P>
<P>	John Robinson, another Grill customer, founded Black Diamond Industries in 
1976 to manufacture stainless-steel kitchen equipment for McDonald's and Wendy's 
restaurants. He exudes a world-weary optimism. His office is decorated with a yellowed 
picture of Jackie Robinson and a framed portrait of his mother. Robinson has not left the 
city yet. "This is where I live, my family is here, my church is here," he says. Still, the 
thought crosses his mind often.</P>
<P>	"Paperwork is my Achilles' heel," says Robinson. "With 20 employees, if I have 
one person doing nothing but government paperwork, non-income producing paperwork, 
then I've got 5 percent of my work force doing useless stuff." Robinson complains that 
he is a good employer in a city that needs private-sector job creation, yet the city ignores 
his needs. </P>
<P>	"The D.C. government doesn't care about my business--they don't see us we're 
so small--but it's businesses like this, with under 50 people, that are the real job 
producers," Robinson says. Washington has become something of a private-sector jobs 
vacuum. Job creation since 1980 has been anemic: 7 percent growth in employment, 
compared with 40 percent in suburban Maryland and 94 percent in suburban Virginia. 
Had D.C. managed to create jobs at the national average, it would have generated 80,000 
more jobs between 1980 and 1993.</P>
<P>	"Small business is about family and the community," says Robinson. "I work 
here. I live in the city. I hire people from the neighborhood. The government should be 
encouraging me, not just some big corporation. When I complain to the city government, 
they say `What's the problem? Every other business can do it. Why can't you?' But I'm 
not Marriott, I'm not MCI. I can't wait six weeks for an inspection or a permit. I'm out of 
business in six weeks. I could do about $100,000 more business a year if I didn't have so 
much paperwork," says Robinson.</P>
<P>	The solution to the worst of his problems is simple, Robinson says. "The city 
should announce tomorrow, `If you've got less than 50 employees, you don't need a 
license, you don't need a permit, all you have to do is pay taxes on time.' Just let me go 
to work. Nothing would make my life easier than that."</P>
<P>   If you drive along Minnesota Avenue in Anacostia, you'll see few private businesses. 
Many of the small outposts of enterprise are liquor stores, and likely owned by Korean-
born entrepreneurs. Douglas Kim, a small-businessman and head of the Korean-American 
Chamber of Commerce, says that nearly a third of all business licenses in the District of 
Columbia are held by low-capital Korean merchants. Recent immigrants often start up in 
the more hostile parts of the District. The risks may be higher, but the initial investment 
required is small compared to the more affluent suburbs. "After six or seven years," says 
Kim, "they move their business out of the city." Surveys show that 96 percent of all 
Koreans who own businesses in the District already live in the suburbs. </P>
<P>	Koreans are torn between the city and the suburbs, Kim says. The crime rate 
disturbs them. A recent survey showed that 89 percent of Korean merchants felt the 
police were "untrustworthy" or "very untrustworthy." But the biggest obstacle to a 
thriving Korean community in D.C. is the public-school system. "We come here for a 
better life for our children," says Kim, who lives in Virginia so his children can attend 
public schools there. "You know, it's the American dream." Kim's wife, who immigrated 
more recently, is still uncomfortable with the anonymity of the suburbs. "When my boys 
graduate," he says, "we'll move back to the city, but not now. --If there were excellent 
public schools in the District like there are in Virginia, all the Koreans would be living in 
the city tomorrow!"</P>
<P>	Many of the D.C. refugees are doubtless fleeing crime and the city government's 
inability to protect them from it. Don Scoggins, a refugee himself, is a real-estate broker 
who has helped hundreds flee bleeding neighborhoods. "Crime is more devastating to 
these communities than racism or Jim Crow ever was," says Scoggins, "but the city 
officials still think they're leading the civil-rights movement. They'd rather talk about the 
`root causes of crime' instead of locking up the criminals."</P>
<P>	To Scoggins, a black government worker-turned-entrepreneur, the story is 
depressingly routine. "The people running D.C. are more concerned with the people who 
can't take care of themselves," he says, "at the expense of the rest of us, the ones who 
have made an investment in the city's future." </P>
<P>	Joe Corey is a restaurateur in the upscale Glover Park section of Northwest D.C. 
Though his business required a large initial investment, he's not so different from the 
Korean merchants across town. When he had a chance to expand his business, he chose to 
open a restaurant in Virginia instead of D.C. "The taxes are too high, the bureaucracy is a 
mess," he says. "I told [former city council chairman] John Wilson on a radio call-in 
show that I wanted to stay in the city, but I couldn't afford the time and effort. You know 
what he told me? `Don't let the door hit you on the way out.' Is that anyway to treat a 
taxpayer?"</P>
<P>	It's the small things that make Corey think of leaving town--like the city's 
passion for writing parking tickets. Most residents will agree that the one thing the 
government does with breathtaking efficiency is issue tickets. "To them it's another 
source of income, so sure they write as many as they can, whether they're valid or not," 
says Corey. Since there's revenue at stake, the city for once turns to the lowest-cost 
provider, a private corporation called Lockheed Information Management. "The city is so 
shortsighted," says Corey. "They ticket my customers so they can raise a couple of 
hundred dollars in revenue, and they drive the customers away. They don't think of the 
business I'm doing and the taxes I'm paying. My business is worth much more to them in 
the long run than the few bucks they'll get from parking tickets." </P>
<P>   Corey perceives a hostile climate for business in the District. "They neglect you if 
you're a taxpaying business," he says. "When I call the city government, I can never get 
the right person on the phone or the right answer to a question. I can call down there on a 
Wednesday afternoon and no one answers the phone at all. But if I lose an employee, that 
guy gets unemployment benefits the next day, and God help me if I make a mistake with 
unemployment insurance. They're all over me." Corey speculates that career city 
employees are suspicious of anyone making money. "In this city, non-taxpayers are more 
privileged than the ones who are paying the taxes." As a result, many businessmen have 
fled the District, leaving behind an anemic economy in which the Washington Post and 
McDonald's are two of the largest private employers.</P>
<P>	For the Washingtonians who have invested their lives in District neighborhoods, 
there is sometimes no escape. Benjamin Thomas has lived in Benning Heights since 
1958. "It's a nice neighborhood, good working people," he says, but for five years the 
community has been besieged by drug dealers and the murderous outgrowth of their 
trade. "We're overrun by crime. I heard gunshots just last night and no one will respond." 
The breakdown of law and order is almost total. "We've got cars driving around here 
with no license plates, never been inspected, parked anywhere they come to a stop." 
Overwhelmed by violent crime, the police don't bother to enforce the basic laws that 
protect a neighborhood from chaos. "We're completely surrounded here," says Thomas. 
His home is now on a hostile frontier, and he sees little chance to escape. "Where can I 
go? Even if I find somebody who wants to buy my house, I won't have enough money 
even for a down payment anywhere else."</P>
<P>	Thomas places the blame squarely on the city government. "I've written letters to 
the mayor, to the city council, but no one ever answers. We're on our own out here." 
Thomas recalls the city was unresponsive even before the neighborhood disintegrated. "I 
fought 10 years to get a traffic light on Benning Road [a major point of entry to the city], 
and I never heard a thing from downtown."</P>
<P>	As Ray Dickey sees it, the transformation from neighborhood to no-man's-land 
begins at home. Dickey says he was the first black to move into the North Michigan Park 
neighborhood, back in 1957. "It starts when parents don't spend time with their kids, and 
don't let their children's friends in the house." The children eventually get the message 
that they're on their own, and they grow up not caring about anyone but themselves. 
"Neighbors don't even talk to each other anymore," says Dickey. "Now I live in a 
neighborhood of strangers. It's sad."</P>
<P>	North Michigan Park suffers from a disorder that no amount of government 
largess can remedy. "It's not about money," he says. "Money won't fix it. Government 
can't bring these people together and make them care." Dickey looks for non-government 
institutions to help bridge the gap, but finds them badly weakened by middle-class flight. 
"There are 10 churches in this neighborhood," says Dickey, "but they're not part of the 
neighborhood anymore. The people coming to church are all from the suburbs. They 
come on Sunday for an hour, then leave. The rest of the week, the doors are locked."</P>
<P>	A government's main mission is to ensure the safety of its citizens. Yet in the 
middle-class neighborhoods of Ward 6, the police presence has been cut back just when 
the neighborhood needs it the most. "I'm trapped in my own home," says Sheila Stamps, 
a widowed mother of five living in public housing on Capitol Hill. "You can't let 
children out by themselves, and the playground is littered with intravenous needles." 
Marion Barry, the newly elected mayor, recently threatened to withdraw the police from 
Ward 6 unless its city-council representative supported a controversial tax increase. This 
news brings Stamps to a boil. "You can't touch the police and the fire department. That's 
public safety. You can't touch that and expect people to stay here much longer."</P>
<P>	Stamps knows what's wrong with her city and what to do about it. "There are two 
things that must be there," she says. "Public safety and good schools." She wants the 
police to build a substation in her neighborhood so the same policemen can live and work 
in the area. "We need police here so they can live with the problem, so they'll know what 
it is like." Stamps also wants school choice. "Any child in this city should be able to go to 
the best schools," she says. "If they meet the criteria, let them go." She says the 
politicians and the media people who live in affluent Ward 3 don't want poor black 
children in their schools. "The president can send his child to any school he wants." she 
says. All she wants is the same opportunity. "We've got a lot of smart kids down here, 
hard-working kids. But they don't get the chance."</P>
<P>	Based on the liberal premise that poor citizens will always be poor and affluent 
citizens will always be affluent, the District government is perplexed that middle-class 
citizens are seeking opportunity elsewhere. After hundreds of tax increases, the city's 
ledgers are soaked with red ink. Despite employing tens of thousands of civil servants, 
even basic services are abysmal. The solution parroted by city officials has always been 
to grant statehood to the District. The reality is that the city government has squandered 
what sovereignty it has. More than 50 of the city's agencies are under court control, and 
the District owes $21 million in contempt-of-court fees due to its mishandling of its 
limited responsibilities. </P>
<P>	There can be no solution to the District's problems until the flight of middle-class 
families is stanched and reversed. That will require the District government to compete 
with its suburbs to provide the basic services middle-class taxpayers expect. The city can 
attract new residents by emphasizing public safety and quality public education, and by 
providing a competitive regulatory climate for entrepreneurs and a low-capital point of 
entry to the economy. Projects and services that do not add to the appeal of Washington 
as a place to raise a family can no longer be justified. The city must close the law school 
of the University of the District of Columbia, which produces no lawyers, privatize the 
appalling D.C. General Hospital, and lower its tax rates to compete with those of 
surrounding jurisdictions. </P>
<P>	The solution is hardly draconian. Other cities take great pride in performing the 
basics efficiently. Washington has the advantage of being the kind of city many people 
would like to live in. But it must first shed its Great Society heritage. The D.C. 
government has betrayed the very people it was intended to serve. True, it has succeeded 
in creating an integrated community where African-Americans can live in peace and 
thrive economically. Unfortunately, that community is just over the District line--in 
Maryland's Prince George's County.</P>
<P>	Why does Featherson stay in the District? "Well, it's like the Grill," he explains. 
"We've been here so long, for 50 years. I just hope there are some kids who walk by and 
think, `They've made it, they've been here through everything, they're proof you can 
make it if you work hard.' That's why I stay here. I want these kids to say `If Mr. 
Featherson can make it, maybe I can too.'"</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT></B> tiny "Great Books" college in California, tucked away in a mountain meadow, 
would seem an unlikely minuteman in a struggle for the academic liberty of America's 
colleges, universities, and professional schools. But so it is. Thomas Aquinas College, 
named for the 13th-century Italian saint and patron of Catholic education, was among the 
first to resist the imposition of non-academic standards by regional accrediting agencies. 
Now the accreditors, who grant a scholastic seal of approval--and with it, access to 
federal assistance--are hoping to consolidate and centralize their power over dissident 
institutions.</P>
<P>	Armed with an agenda that includes politically correct notions of "diversity," an 
alliance of accreditors and Washington-based educrats is trying to establish a national 
accrediting body that would oversee every institution of higher learning in the country. 
No school that receives federal money would be immune from attack: By threatening to 
withhold accreditation, and thereby close off millions of dollars in government loans and 
other assistance, a centralized body could impose a political agenda at will.</P>
<P>	This is precisely the lesson in the recent flap over the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education, which insisted that medical schools require training in 
abortion procedures or else forfeit accreditation.</P>
<P>	If the move toward a centralized accrediting body succeeds, the private, collegial 
character of the review process will be in peril. Advocates of diversity and multicultural 
standards instead will be pitted against institutions striving to preserve high academic 
standards along with their own distinctive missions. The autonomy and quality of these 
institutions will be put in jeopardy.</P>
<P>	This is not a hypothetical fear. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education, a nationwide agency, recently voted for ideological reasons to deny 
accreditation to any obstetrics and gynecology program that fails to provide mandatory 
training in abortion procedures. A similar imposition of ideological mandates could occur 
if accreditation of colleges were centralized in one monopolistic organization.</P>
<P>	Accreditation has long been a valuable process in higher education. Until recently, 
it has involved private, professional peer review to make sure that colleges and 
universities actually provide the quality of education they claim to provide. Now 
proponents of "diversity" are using the process to impose politically correct educational 
standards on institutions striving to preserve their distinctive missions. In the name of 
advancing diversity within each institution, they are imposing their own version of 
conformity and threatening true diversity among institutions. At stake is America's 
historical commitment to the integrity, quality, and independence of its colleges.</P>

<H3>The Aquinas Model</H3>
<P>  Since its founding in 1971, Thomas Aquinas has offered only one kind of degree: a 
bachelor of arts in liberal education. Our curriculum is composed of the seminal books of 
Western civilization, and we are unabashedly Catholic. There are no majors, minors, or 
electives. There are no textbooks; we rely only on the original works of those who have 
thought deeply about man, nature, and God. There are no lectures; we hold seminars in 
which professors guide students toward an understanding of the authors before them. 
With its clear and distinctive academic vision, the college offers an exemplary version of 
a classical liberal education.</P>
<P>	We pursue no "affirmative action" for persons or texts. We look for the best 
teachers, the best books, and students willing and able to undertake the life of reason. As 
Catholics, we hold that one intellectual tradition is superior, and we ask our students to 
study in that tradition, as well as to read prominent critics of that tradition such as Marx 
and Nietzsche. We are not about the study of "culture," as the word is used today; we will 
not base our curriculum on authors consciously selected for their race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. Whether the author is St. Thomas or Machiavelli, however, we are studying 
not the man, but what he has to say about the true, the beautiful, and the good.</P>
<P>	Until the 1980s, schools such as Thomas Aquinas thrived under the nation's six 
regional accrediting agencies for senior colleges and universities. These accreditors 
respected their members' independence and judged them in light of their professed 
missions. Countries like France, with their centralized ministries of education, would not 
allow such an enterprise as this. America does, thanks to its tradition of non-
governmental accreditation.</P> 
<P>	The latest mutation in the accreditation process is a story that we at Thomas 
Aquinas College know only too well. Every college and university in the United States 
must periodically submit to a review by one of these private accrediting agencies. 
Without accreditation, schools lose academic credibility among their peers.</P>
<P>	The process in the United States has always been largely in the hands of private 
organizations of accredited schools. After World War II, however, the G.I. Bill and the 
growth of federal aid programs prompted the agencies to take on the additional role of 
approving colleges as the recipients of such funds. And as the gatekeepers of federal 
funds, the agencies in turn had to be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>	As schools became more dependent upon federal funds, the character of the 
accrediting agencies gradually changed. Control over funds gave them great leverage 
over colleges and universities. They became less collegial associations of institutions that 
testify publicly to the worthiness of a college, and more the rulers and regulators of these 
institutions. Now they are threatening to become the guardians of an ideological agenda 
and to advocate diversity standards and politically-correct curricula.</P>

<H3>Diversity over Quality</H3>
<P>	By 1988, with the rise of multiculturalism in academia, the threat was emerging in 
California. Our accreditor, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), 
began promoting more prescriptive standards. These included the following language: 
"The institution demonstrates its commitment to the increasingly significant role played 
by diversity of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds among its members by making 
positive efforts to foster such diversity."</P>
<P>	Stephen Weiner, the executive director of WASC, wrote in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education that WASC's expectations for diversity "affect virtually every aspect 
of campus life, and, therefore, each of our accrediting standards." In one document, the 
new diversity policy is called "the cornerstone of a major new thrust." In other words, 
standards of integrity and academic quality no longer would form the sole basis for 
accreditation.</P>
<P>	The new policy was part of a national movement among accreditors to leverage 
their influence over federal funds on behalf of the cause of diversity. Specifically, the 
accreditors wanted to mandate race and gender preferences in hiring and admissions, as 
well as multiculturalism in the curriculum, on the grounds that they are intrinsic to 
academic quality.</P>
<P>	Colleges and universities began to worry about accreditation's new thrust. This 
concern was not without foundation. One school discovered that WASC evaluators were 
soliciting racial grievances from the faculty of a neighboring college. Another was told, 
in writing, that it had "failed to grasp the concept of diversity" and that its curricula 
would have to be "restructured." A third was ordered to alter the composition of its board 
of trustees and told that a religious profession required of its faculty was "not in 
conformity with [WASC's] expectations."</P>
<P>	Colleges where multiculturalism, feminist studies, and the like had been matters 
of internal dispute, to be resolved internally, became vulnerable to meddling by outsiders 
with a political agenda. Moreover, the traditional purposes of accreditation--frank, 
collegial criticism and public avowal of academic integrity--were undermined by the 
mistrust generated by this new agenda.</P>
<P>	The threat to our college was plain. If WASC meant what it was saying, it could 
not, in principle, accredit our college. In the eyes of the accreditors, Thomas Aquinas 
College is multiculturally incorrect.</P>
<P>	In a lengthy struggle, Thomas Aquinas College confronted WASC's usurpations. 
We rejected the diversity standards when we came up for reaccreditation in 1992. The 
accrediting team of scholars sent to visit the college came away impressed with our high 
academic standards; in response, WASC reaffirmed our accreditation for eight years. 
When WASC circulated to its members a policy statement purporting to clarify its brief 
and vague standards on diversity, Thomas Aquinas College took the lead in raising 
objections and mobilizing opposition. Other institutions, including the California Institute 
of Technology, the University of Southern California, and Stanford, joined us in 
expressing alarm at the WASC statement. Although WASC formally adopted that 
controversial statement, it now requires colleges only to "thoughtfully engage" the issue 
of diversity.</P>

<H3>The Empire Strikes Back</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the story does not end there. Education lobbyists and bureaucrats, 
led by Robert H. Atwell of the American Council on Education, are launching a 
counteroffensive. Atwell co-chairs an ad hoc group called the National Policy Board on 
Higher Education Institutional Accreditation (NPB), which advocates a national 
accreditation organization to police the regional groups and any possible competitors. It is 
being packaged as a way to resist federal regulatory overreach into academia. Don't 
believe it.</P>
<P>	NPB is proposing an organization with unprecedented accrediting clout. It would 
set national standards for all institutional accreditors--in effect, all the agencies that the 
Department of Education uses to determine eligibility for federal money. The 
organization would be both "more specific" in its standards and "more rigorous" in its 
processes. It would establish its own budget, levy dues to be collected by the regional 
accrediting agencies, and wield the authority to impose sanctions against accrediting 
agencies that fail to enforce its standards. This would be the closest thing the nation has 
ever had to a national ministry of education.</P>
<P>	How would Thomas Aquinas, or any college with a distinct mission, fare under 
such a scheme? What would happen to the quality of American higher education?</P>
<P>	The answers are clear from the proposed organization's core standards, which 
include diversity. There is good reason to believe that this new board would promote 
diversity standards nationwide. In fact, the very existence of schools grounded in a 
clearly defined academic philosophy would be at great risk. Atwell has written that 
"diversity among institutions does not satisfy the need for diversity within institutions." 
In other words, colleges and universities whose curricula are specifically dedicated to the 
"great books," a traditional liberal-arts curriculum, a theological focus, or any other 
coherent body of belief would be subject to the multicultural whims of a remote 
bureaucracy.</P>
<P>	Such diversity also could be applied to the internal, everyday workings of all 
institutions that rely upon accreditation: student and faculty composition, trustee 
membership, allocation of resources, and on and on. Atwell has advocated a 
"comprehensive approach that encompasses the makeup of the faculty, student body, and 
staff; the curriculum offered by the institution; and the climate on the campus itself." 
Such a vision invites not diversity, but rather a leveling of the very differences in 
academic emphasis and philosophy that have helped create the finest educational non-
system in the world.</P> 
<P>	Opposition to the new accrediting entity is growing. Among others, American 
University, Boston University, Baylor, Caltech, Holy Cross, John Hopkins, Pepperdine, 
Rice, Stanford, Smith, the University of Dallas, the University of Southern California, the 
University of Missouri, and the University of Vermont all oppose the plan. Congressmen 
William Goodling (R-PA), chairman of the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, and Howard McKeon (R-CA), chairman of its higher 
education subcommittee, have written to Education Secretary Richard Riley: "We would 
certainly oppose any attempt to use accreditation--to impose standards unrelated to the 
fiscal interests of American taxpayers which could force schools to change their nature or 
their mission."</P>
<P>	It is not enough, however, to defeat the nationalization plan or fight WASC to a 
stalemate. A genuinely open and collegial system of accreditation, one that allows 
governments to catch fraud and abuse and yet steers clear of political correctness, is 
clearly needed. Like most college presidents, I would prefer to devote my energies to the 
growth and prosperity of my college, to its unique curriculum, and to its ardent, inquiring 
students.</P>
<P>	My experience with accreditation leads me to suggest a policy of decentralization 
and reform to protect the diversity of ideas, programs, and institutions that has served our 
republic so well over centuries.</P>

<H3>An Outline for Reform</H3>
<P>	First, it is essential to restrain the federal government's impulse to govern higher 
education. The federal government may want to promote college and university 
education, for example through subsidies for student loans. But federal aid should permit 
individual students and their families maximum choice, and leave schools free of 
burdensome and possibly ideological regulations.</P>
<P>	Liberal education, with its historical roots in religion and philosophy, deals in 
those ultimate questions that the  American political tradition leaves to associations other 
than the government. That is why, when the G.I. Bill provided federal dollars, the 
gatekeeping function was assigned to non-governmental accrediting agencies.</P> 
<P>	Second, non-governmental accreditation in its present form--regional monopolies 
like WASC--should confine itself to screening out incompetence and fraud. An 
accrediting agency is not, and cannot be, purely private, since it can shut off federal 
money. Recognizing this power, it must show proper restraint. In the short run, such a 
modest role, in which any criticism is non-binding, is less open to abuse than any form of 
regulation, particularly regulation by state governments, which sometimes serve as 
strongholds of the diversity forces.</P>
<P>	The most lasting way to forestall abuse is to break the monopoly. Federal policy 
should therefore favor the formation of high-quality, alternative accreditation agencies, 
perhaps tailored to institutional types: research universities, liberal-arts colleges, or, to 
address the latest outbreak of academic intimidation, pro-life medical schools. Such 
agencies, being genuinely voluntary, can better accommodate their members than one-
size-fits-all monopolies whose standards must measure institutions as diverse as institutes 
of psychology, comprehensive universities, liberal-arts colleges, and research 
universities. Colleges would have an incentive to earn recognition from truly 
independent, private accreditors, since their approval would mean something. The 
resulting competition and emulation would promote quality much more effectively than 
the present system.</P>
<P>	Third, a limited intervention against rogue accreditors who misuse their delegated 
powers can be useful, at least until the monopolies are effectively broken. One instance of 
prudent intervention occurred when Lamar Alexander, then U.S. Secretary of Education, 
restrained the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools when it tried to bully 
Baruch College and Westminster Theological Seminary into accepting diversity 
standards. But it is better to fashion one's own freedom, as we have tried to do within 
WASC, or as would result from the emergence of alternative accreditors.</P>
<P>	Centralization of regional accreditors is exactly the wrong way to go. It was an 
enormous labor for us to alert some of the 145 schools in WASC to the threats posed by 
regional bureaucracy. I seriously doubt that a stronger bureaucratic organization based in 
Washington, D.C., with a membership in the thousands, could ever be moved with a 
similar effort.</P>
<P>	I understand the desire for accountability when federal funds are involved, and I 
understand the natural ambition on the part of the new Congress to reform from the top 
down, but I think it should be resisted. We should remember what happened to the 
national history standards in Goals 2000. First proposed by Lynne Cheney, the head of 
the National Endowment of the Humanities under President Bush, they were hijacked by 
the educators commissioned to execute the project. At the same time, we should move to 
prevent the centralization of the accrediting process.</P>
<P>	The existing national educational bodies that offer to implement reforms tend to 
support fads like the diversity movement, and will try to regiment independent schools. 
Such centralization brought us mandatory training in abortion procedures among 
accredited medical schools.</P>
<P>	We must not set up a shadow national ministry of education under the guise of 
privatization, efficiency, or better standards.</P>
<P>	Its bureaucrats will be no better than government bureaucrats, and even less 
accountable. Above all, colleges and universities will merit the trust of the public and the 
government if they hold true to the timeless standards enunciated by St. Thomas Aquinas 
seven centuries ago: "The study of philosophy is not directed to the various opinions of 
men, but to the truth of things." Truth, not diversity, is the goal of education.</P>

<P>	   <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n New Year's Eve 1975, after an evening of taking LSD and watching cop 
shows on television, 15-year-old Raul Meza showed up at a convenience store near his 
house in Austin, Texas, armed with a deer rifle. Meza emptied the cash register, then 
marched the clerk, a 20-year-old college student named Derly Ramirez, into the walk-in 
freezer. Meza shot him in the back and left him for dead.</P>
<P>	Ramirez recovered to testify against the man who wounded him. Meza received a 
20-year sentence, and served five years before getting out on parole.</P>
<P>	On January 3, 1982, months after his release, 21-year-old Raul Meza abducted 
Kendra Page, a third-grader, as she rode her bicycle near her home in southeast Austin. 
Meza tortured, raped, and strangled the girl, then left her body behind a dumpster. Three 
days later, he surrendered to the police. Meza received 30 years for the killing.</P>
<P>	While behind bars, Meza racked up demerits for various infractions, and four 
years were added to his sentence after guards found a knife in his cell. Meza came up for 
parole seven times, and each time it was denied.</P>
<P>	By 1993, however, prison authorities could keep Meza no longer. Under Texas 
law, he had accumulated enough credit for good behavior to qualify automatically for 
release. The state freed him under mandatory supervision, a conditional release not unlike 
parole that can be granted without the consent of the parole board.</P>
<P>	No matter how notorious, most felons leave prison with little fanfare. They re-
enter society quietly and soon become anonymous. Some begin new and honest lives. 
Many others, freed from supervision and accountable to no one, commit new crimes. 
Raul Meza might have regained his freedom in the same way. But he never got the 
chance. One hundred and forty miles from Meza's Huntsville prison cell, an Austin 
newspaper editor decided to make him famous.</P>
<P>	In 15 years of covering crimes, Jerry White, the city editor of the <I>Austin 
American-Statesman</I>, had watched scores of criminals disappear from public view after 
sentencing. Most of them left prison years before their sentences expired, often to rob, 
rape, or kill again. "It became apparent," says White, "that even though these folks are 
sentenced and sent away, the story doesn't really end." White began compiling a list of 
inmates who were "fairly notorious" in Austin. Every few months, he called the 
department of corrections to ask when inmates on his list would be eligible for parole.</P>
<P>	In June 1993, the department of corrections confirmed that Meza was due to be 
released soon. Using the state's Open Records Act, the newspaper petitioned Texas's 
attorney general and found where Meza planned to live. An article ran on the front page 
of the Sunday paper eight days before Meza's release. The headline read, "`Nothing's 
Going To Stop It': Killer of 8-Year-Old About to be Freed."</P>
<P>    In a city of about 465,000 people, the story reached 240,000 homes and provoked an 
outpouring of media attention. Film crews greeted Meza as he walked out of the state 
prison and followed him for months. Publicity, mostly bad, seemed to trail him 
everywhere. Corrections officials moved him from town to town, but in each residents 
and local politicians protested his presence. Colin Amann, a Houston lawyer who 
represented the killer after his release, says angry citizens "kicked him in the butt from 
one end of Texas to the other."</P>
<P>	For much of 1993, Texans kept on kicking. Over several months, he was shuttled 
between towns and cities all over the state. Of the 276 halfway houses that were asked to 
accept Meza, 271 refused. "Every town he went to," says Amann, "people were just 
screaming and yelling. Lots of small communities went out and bitched about it. A lot. 
And it happened every time they'd move him, they had the same outcry."</P>
<P>	In August, the parole division placed Meza on his grandparents' farm, west of San 
Antonio. On August 31, local sheriffs charged Meza with "terroristic threatening" and 
disorderly conduct for bullying his elderly grandparents. A judge later dismissed the 
charges, but the incident made nearly every newspaper in Texas. At least 1,000 local 
residents signed a petition asking the state to move Meza again. The parole division sent 
him to Austin.</P>
<P>	His new neighbors protested, held rallies, carried signs. A few moved away. The 
furor subsided a bit when the father of the murdered girl publicly called for citizens to 
give Meza the chance to start a new life. He moved into his mother's house and found a 
job. In the first 10 months of 1994, the <I>American-Statesman</I> ran more than 20 stories on 
Meza. In August 1994, he was arrested for violating the curfew provision of his parole, 
and he returned to the state prison in Huntsville.</P>
<P>	At the time Meza was taken into custody, there were more than 116,000 parolees 
in Texas, 15,000 of whom had outstanding warrants for parole violations. Yet the 
governor's fugitive squad focused its energies on Meza, the most famous one. And while 
parolees in Texas routinely get three chances to break parole before being arrested, Meza 
was taken into custody after only one violation. His supporters cried foul. But the citizens 
of Texas were the better for it.</P>
<P>   Meza needed all the attention he could get. As a group, violent sex offenders have an 
extraordinarily high rate of recidivism. In Texas, about one-third of convicted rapists are 
arrested for new crimes within two years of getting out on parole. Ordinarily, parole 
officers are not able to supervise sex offenders carefully. But because they learned from 
news reports where Meza lived, neighbors were able to keep their children out of his 
path. Relentless publicity forced a troubled parole system to work effectively. And 
information disseminated by the press helped to create thousands of civilian parole 
officers--watchful neighbors who kept an eye on him.</P>
<P> 	Publicity, however, is a blunt instrument, and others were unintentionally 
bludgeoned by Meza's fame. His relatives were humiliated. His victim's parents saw their 
tragedy replayed in the press. And Meza himself was hounded across the state. Nobody 
knows how such attention may have retarded his rehabilitation, but it may not matter. 
Despite the burdens imposed on him and his family--or, more likely, because of them--
Meza did not kill another child while out of prison.</P>
<P>	Even Meza's attorney, a self-described liberal, believes the publicity was worth 
the cost. "I think everybody should know when a parolee is coming to live in their 
neighborhood," says Colin Amann. "That's why crime is committed, because people 
don't know who the criminals are. Once they get out, let's let the entire world know 
where they are going to live. Let's let the community have some responsibility for 
keeping its thumb on them."</P>
<P>	More and more communities are clamoring for that very responsibility. Meza's 
case illustrates what most people already sense: Citizens who know their neighbors will 
be safer than those who don't. Study after study has shown anonymity to be a factor in 
many crimes. Simply put, criminals are more apt to commit crimes in neighborhoods 
where they do not know the neighbors, and where the neighbors do not know one 
another. As James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein explain in <I>Crime and Human 
Nature</I>, their expansive survey of criminology, "the more rapid the population turnover in 
an area, the higher the victimization rate, even after controlling for the racial and age 
composition."</P>
<P>	Conversely, close-knit communities tend to be resistant to predatory crime. A 
criminal is less likely to commit crimes where the neighbors recognize him, particularly if 
they know that he has a criminal record.</P>
<P>	Statistics explain why citizens have a vested interest in knowing who in their 
neighborhood has been convicted of serious offenses. Ex-cons commit a staggering 
amount of crime. As John DiIulio of Princeton University has pointed out, "within three 
years of sentencing, while still on probation, nearly half of all probationers are placed 
behind bars for a new crime or abscond." Nationally, recidivism for parolees is about the 
same as for probationers. DiIulio cites a revealing study of Florida convicts:</P>
<P>	"Between 1987 and 1991, about 87 percent of the 147,000 felons released from 
Florida prisons were released early. Fully one-third of these parolees committed a new 
crime. At points in time when they would have been incarcerated had they not been 
released early, these parolees committed nearly 26,000 new crimes, including some 4,656 
new crimes of violence--346 murders, 185 sexual assaults, 2,369 robberies, and 1,754 
other violent offenses."</P>
<P>	Not only are felons on supervised release dangerous, but there are a lot of them. In 
1993, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a total of 671,000 Americans were on 
parole or probation. There is considerable evidence that many parole and probation 
officers are responsible for far more offenders than they can possibly supervise, even 
those housed under one roof. A investigation in 1993 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 
that one of every six convicted felons placed in Colorado halfway houses escaped. That 
year, the study found, 526 felons walked away from halfway houses and into the 
surrounding neighborhoods. Seven of the escapees were convicted murderers. "In most 
cases," the paper concluded, "no one looked for them."</P>
<P>	Informed neighbors don't always just keep offenders from committing crimes; 
sometimes they can help ex-cons straighten out. Mike Elsworth got out of prison in 
Washington, D.C., for the last time on Halloween 1990, after serving two years for 
selling cocaine. Elsworth, who was paroled to the same part of town where he grew up, 
credits his neighbors for helping him keep his record clean since his release. Although he 
was shunned by at least one woman on his block, other "neighbors were supportive and 
understanding of me trying to do better once I got out. They knew I was looking for a job, 
and they would tell me about places that they knew were hiring, and some of them would 
tell me if I needed anything to come on by." Three months after his release, with the 
encouragement of his neighbors, Elsworth found a job.</P>
<P>	Elsworth says his neighbors gave him the help and attention his parole officers 
did not. In two years, Elsworth reported to five different officers. "It was like, every three 
months I had a new one," he says. "I don't know why. They really had little or no 
concern about me as a person." Elsworth met with his parole officer for 10 to 15 minutes 
every few weeks. But he saw his neighbors every day, which ultimately, he says, made all 
the difference.</P>
<P>	Of course, not all neighborhoods would take advantage of more information about 
felons. In some parts of cities, particularly in poor areas where citizens tend to live 
chaotic lives, neighbors often know who is on parole and don't care. Nor would giving 
neighbors the names and addresses of all newly released felons always benefit the felons 
themselves. Critics have long charged that releasing the names of parolees and 
probationers to the public would make it more difficult for convicted criminals to start 
successful new lives once they get out of prison. A federal judge recently struck down 
parts of "Megan's Law," a New Jersey statute requiring released sex offenders to tell 
their communities where they live. In his decision, Judge Nicholas Politan said the 
notification requirement amounted to a form of punishment, and cannot be added to 
penalties already in place before the law was passed in 1994. Requiring a convicted felon 
to notify his neighbors upon release, he wrote, would constitute a "lifelong albatross," 
and would ruin an ex-con's ability to "return to a normal, private, law-abiding life in the 
community." Judge Politan might be right. Ultimately, however, much of what would 
happen if the names of parolees were publicized is conjecture. As it stands, the identities 
of released criminals often remain shrouded in state and federal privacy laws. The Federal 
Privacy Act of 1974, for instance, generally bars authorities from divulging the names 
and addresses of parolees released from federal prisons. Most states, wary of civil-rights 
lawsuits brought by released felons, have adopted similar laws. While the intent of such 
statutes may be noble, their effect has sometimes been devastating.</P>
<P>	Last summer, the residents of Red Hook, a small town in upstate New York, paid 
the price for having an unknown felon in their midst. In June, Richard Moran, a lifelong 
criminal from the Bronx, was released from Rikers Island, where he had spent the 
previous three months on a parole violation, and placed in Red Hook's only homeless 
shelter. No one knew his criminal record. No one was watching.</P>
<P>	Had Moran's record become public, Tommy McCauliff, a 29-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, might still be alive. On a Sunday afternoon in July, McCauliff emerged 
from his apartment, staggered across the street, and bled to death on the sidewalk from a 
knife wound in his back.</P>
<P>	Police picked up Moran and charged him with second-degree murder. He was 
later convicted.</P>
<P>	By the time he came to Red Hook, Moran had spent close to half of his 43 years 
behind bars. First arrested in New York City for armed robbery in 1969, he went on to 
amass 26 different criminal charges, including several violent felonies. Within days of 
being released, Moran made his way to Shelter Plus, a state-financed boarding house for 
vagrants in Red Hook, 90 miles north. Under circumstances that are still not clear, he met 
Tommy McCauliff.</P>
<P>	When an inmate with two or more convictions is released from a state prison in 
New York, within 48 hours corrections officials must notify the police in the town to 
which he is headed. Rikers Island, however, is not a state prison, but a jail run by New 
York City. Authorities there were not required to notify police in Red Hook that Moran 
was on his way to their town. And they didn't.</P>
<P>	The state's department of social services in nearby Poughkeepsie was the only 
agency that knew about Moran's arrival in Red Hook, and New York's confidentiality 
laws require social workers to keep secret the criminal histories of their clients.</P>
<P>	"Anything in our records is confidential," says John Battistoni, the county's 
commissioner of social services. "Parolees just come in like anyone else. If they're 
without a place to go, we're required to give them shelter." Only a court order, he says, 
can force the department to divulge the names of the parolees it places in homeless 
shelters. A call from the local police department will not suffice. For employees who 
break confidentiality rules, says Battistoni, "the penalties could be severe. You'd be 
subjecting yourself and your county to all sorts of suits. It's tough stuff."</P>
<P>	All things considered, says Battistoni, he is not bothered by the secrecy. "I 
suppose people shouldn't be branded," he offers. "People are saying they'd like to know 
if a criminal is placed in their neighborhood. I often wonder what they would do with the 
information if they had it. Put a 24-hour tail on the guy?"</P>
<P>	Lisa Murray has no doubt what she would do with such information. "I would 
keep an eye on that person," she says, "and I would know if that person was near my 
child, if it was a rapist or a child molester, to get my kid away." Murray is one of five 
Red Hook women who formed a group called Concerned Citizens for a Safe Community 
after McCauliff's death. The group advocates changing the confidentiality laws they 
believe were partly responsible for the killing.</P>
<P>	Murray points out that Richard Moran is not the only criminal to move into the 
homeless shelter without the town's knowledge. Since McCauliff's death, police have 
arrested two other residents of Shelter Plus for selling drugs. "Whenever somebody gets a 
DWI or commits a robbery, it's in the paper before they're even convicted of the crime," 
she says. "So why not have a criminal who's already been convicted of a crime and 
released from prison be put in the paper saying where he's going to live?"</P>
<P>	A county legislator named Woody Klose quickly sponsored a resolution requiring 
local police to be notified whenever felons are placed in homeless shelters. Steve Saland, 
a state senator, sponsored a bill that would force corrections officials to notify towns 
whenever a parolee is about to be released into their midst. Unlike the statute in place, the 
new law would apply to jails as well as state prisons. It would require authorities to notify 
the mayor and the chief of police of the town to which the parolee is headed, as well as 
officials in the town where the crime was committed. The written statement would 
include the ex-con's physical description, his known aliases, and his criminal record. It 
would also contain his new home address. Towns would have to post the information in a 
public place, such as a bulletin board in city hall, in post offices, or in advertisements in 
local newspapers. Released offenders would be required to report to local authorities for a 
period of 10 years each time they moved to a new address in New York.</P>
<P>	Saland's notification law would apply only to paroled sex criminals, repeat 
violent offenders, and those convicted of three or more felonies. Saland says the law 
would not prevent parolees from committing new crimes. But it might help neighbors to 
protect themselves from released criminals. "All you can do is provide notice," he says. 
After that, "it's up to the community."</P>
<P>	Tommy McCauliff's death prompted New York politicians to take a new look at 
an old debate. For years, lawmakers have tried to balance the requirements of public 
safety with a belief that stigmatizing released felons makes rehabilitating them more 
difficult. Many states have compromised by requiring parolees and convicted criminals to 
register their addresses with law-enforcement officials, but not with neighbors or 
community groups. States that do provide for community notification when a felon is 
released nearly always limit the notification to cases involving sex offenders.
<P>	Most states that have such laws leave their application to the discretion of law 
enforcement officers. Often police departments get to decide which sex offenders 
constitute a threat to their neighbors. Although the state of Washington allows police to 
release photographs of and information about convicted sex offenders to community 
groups, and news outlets, the law is not always used. In the first 10 months of 1994, for 
instance, county police in Spokane notified the public only once of a paroled sex 
offender, though several were released into the area. Carol Dorris, who follows crime 
legislation for the National Victim's Center, says it is not unusual to see effective laws 
passed, then ignored. "It's fine to put in statutes and legislate something," she says, "but 
to enforce them is a lot harder to do."</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, recent developments show that concerned citizens have several 
outlets for civic action:</P>
<H3>Legislative Action</H3>
<P> The inability of probation officers to effectively track offenders 
argues for comprehensive notification laws--let the community provide the surveillance 
that the state cannot or will not. So far, such laws exist only in theory. For fear of 
destroying an ex-con's chances of success after release, no state has passed laws that 
would give the public the names and addresses of all parolees and probationers.</P>
<P>	Louisiana, however, has taken the lead in warning communities about released 
sex offenders. In 1992, the legislature passed two laws that ensure sex offenders will 
never again live anonymously in Louisiana. Or, as a later revision to the laws put it, 
"Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy." 
In fact, a person convicted of one of the state's 18 sex offenses can expect practically no 
privacy at all.</P>
<P>	The two laws and their amendments are vast in scope. No later than 10 days 
before a sex offender gets out of prison, corrections officials must send letters warning of 
his impending release to his victims, witnesses who testified against him, and the sheriff 
of the parish (county) to which he is going. Once he gets out, a sex offender must register 
with the sheriff and provide his fingerprints, his photograph, his social-security number, 
and any aliases he has used. The ex-con must also give the sheriff a description of his 
offense, including the date and place he committed it, and his home address. Offenders 
who move within the state of Louisiana have 10 days to re-register. The process 
continues for 10 years after their release.</P>
<P>	If his victim was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the offender must notify his 
neighbors as well. Twice within his first month out of prison, he must purchase an 
advertisement in his local newspaper. The ads must reveal his name, his address, and his 
offense. Descriptions of the crimes must be written in language ordinary citizens can 
understand; statute numbers do not suffice. To verify that it meets these specifications, 
the ad must pass muster with a parole officer.</P>
<P>	One such classified advertisement, which appeared in the <I>New Orleans Times-
Picayune</I> on May 8, 1994, is typical of the genre. "John Jones of 701 Teche St.," it said, 
"was convicted of a Sex Offense, Simple Rape." Another, on June 10, 1994, advertised, 
"I, Jim Davis, was convicted of molestation of a juvenile." [<I>Policy Review</I> has changed 
the names.] Other ads placed in the paper in June mentioned carnal knowledge, sexual 
battery, and indecent behavior with a juvenile.</P>
<P>	Once he has notified the larger community of his crime, an offender must tell his 
neighbors about it. The parolee must send letters or postcards with the same 
information--name, address, and offense--to every house within three blocks of his 
home. In cities, this usually means 36 square blocks and hundreds of houses. A parolee 
who lives in a rural area must send letters to everyone within a one-mile radius of his 
house.</P>
<P>	Finally, a sex offender whose victim was under 18 must contact the 
superintendent of the public-school district in his parish, as well as the principals of any 
private or parochial schools in the area.</P>
<P> 	If it chooses, a parole board also "may order any other form of notice which it 
deems appropriate, including but not limited to signs, handbills, bumper stickers, or 
clothing labeled to that effect." All of the expenses involved in the notification, such as 
stamps, envelopes, and advertising fees--not to mention any specially-labeled clothing 
the parole board may require--must be borne by the parolee. If at any time he fails to 
meet any requirement, an offender may be returned to prison.</P>
<H3>Citizen Journalists</H3>
<P>When John Roger, president of the Bayview Civic League in 
Norfolk, Virginia, asked the local police department to release the names of parolees who 
had moved into his neighborhood, it refused. Undeterred, Roger sought information at the 
other end of the criminal justice system: arrestees.</P>
<P>	Unlike the addresses of released felons, arrest records are publicly available from 
the police department. Every month, the league's newsletter, <I>Bayview Bylines</I>, publishes 
the name, race, and home address of each person taken into custody by the police within 
the boundaries of the Bayview neighborhood. Periodically, in a feature called "Pervert 
Alert," Roger also provides descriptions of flashers, peeping Toms, and other unsavory 
characters seen in the area. To pay for printing, local merchants buy advertising space in 
the newsletter. "Want to know why we do it?" he asks. "It's simple. We live here. We 
believe our members have a right to know what's going on."</P>
<P>	Though he prints only 4,000 copies of the newsletters, Roger is confident they 
reach many more people. Residents read it, he says, not only out of a fear of crime, but to 
"find if somebody they know has been arrested." The publicity can have consequences. 
Landlords, says Roger, scan the names of arrestees. "If it happens to be one of their 
tenants, they get rid of him."</P>
<P>	Although it remains difficult in most states to learn the whereabouts of parolees, 
there are other ways citizens can gather information on potentially dangerous criminals. 
In July 1994, John Johansen, a financial consultant in Arlington, Virginia, published the 
first issue of <I>Crime Prevention Bulletin</I>, a quarterly newspaper with a circulation of 
30,000. Police departments in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia 
cooperated with Johansen, giving him the photographs and last known addresses of 
fugitives in the area. Johansen printed the mug shots, some beneath headlines like 
"Wanted for Murder." The papers were distributed throughout the area by members of 
neighborhood organizations.</P>
<P>	The Bulletin was an instant success. In many cases, fugitives were still living in 
the same areas, even at the same addresses, amid neighbors who had no idea they were 
wanted by the law. Local police did not have the resources to track down each of the 
fugitives. But they could respond to tips provided by citizens who recognized their 
neighbors in the <I>Bulletin</I>. In its first six months, police credited Johansen's newspaper 
with the arrests of 15 fugitives in Washington alone. Six of them were suspected 
murderers.</P>
<H3>Do-It-Yourself Advertising</H3>
<P> Sanford "Sandy" Krasnoff, the president of Victims and 
Citizens Against Crime, in Lousiana, says his group devotes much of its energy to 
making certain the state's sex-crimes laws achieve their desired effect. Every Saturday 
morning, the flamboyant Krasnoff, who at various times in his career has been a New 
Orleans cop, a lawyer, and a manager of professional prize fighters, hosts a radio show 
called "Crime Watch." Each week, during three hours of air-time donated by the station, 
Krasnoff announces the names, addresses, and crimes of all sex offenders released on 
parole or probation in Louisiana in the previous week. Krasnoff gets the information 
directly from the parole and pardons board.</P>
<P>	Krasnoff's group also monitors offenders after their release. A volunteer, whom 
Krasnoff refers to as "the sex lady," scans newspapers for advertisements placed by 
parolees under the new law. When he saw that some of the ads were "coming out in 
mumbo-jumbo, referring to act numbers and statutes instead of telling people exactly 
what they were charged with," Krasnoff wrote a letter to the department of corrections, 
which promptly instructed parole officers to reject such ads.</P>
<P>	According to William T. Price, the deputy director of the state's adult probation 
and parole division, the state's new sex-offender laws have not prompted violence from 
the public. In a few cases, people moved upon learning that a child molester had come to 
their neighborhood. But, he says, nobody has yet thrown a fire bomb.</P>
<P>	Price does worry that the laws may be too broad, covering not only child 
molestation and forcible rape, but also non-predatory crimes like bigamy. "If you can 
attach the concept of sex to it," says Price, a crime probably falls under the rubric of the 
new laws.</P>
<P>	For all its willingness to publicize the names and addresses of sex offenders, the 
state of Louisiana still guards information about other parolees carefully. Apart from sex 
criminals, the state's probation and parole division refuses to give out the home addresses 
of the convicts it supervises. The concern, says Price, is that some people, such as bill 
collectors, could put the information to unwholesome purposes. "We don't want to get 
into that business," he says.</P>
<P>	In the fall of 1994, residents of Warwick, Rhode Island, a Providence suburbwere 
desperate to publicize the whereabouts of a man named Craig Price. Five years before, 
Price had admitted stabbing to death four of his Warwick neighbors. Because he was 
technically a juvenile when he committed the murders, he was sentenced to a juvenile 
detention center until age 21. Incensed by Price's crime, a Warwick police captain named 
Kevin Collins organized citizens to fight his release. "This guy had butchered four 
people," says Collins, "knowing that when he gets out at 21, he can go out and obtain a 
gun, [or] work in a day-care center."</P>
<P>	Collins decided to keep Craig Price from ever becoming anonymous. He 
recounted Price's story on radio and television shows. He sent press releases to papers 
around the country. When he heard that Price planned to move to Florida upon release, 
Collins hired an airplane to tow a sign over Miami Beach. The banner read, "Killer of 4 
Craig Price Moving Here? No Police Record!" Similar messages floated over Chicago 
and beaches in Los Angeles and New Jersey.</P>
<P>	Once Price is released, Collins says, he will not be able to tell the public where the 
killer lives. "Once he gets out there--like if he moves into your neighborhood," says 
Collins, "if I went around there knocking on doors, I think they're going to come after me 
on a civil-rights violation." Collins says the memory of the man's crimes may be enough 
to keep Price from killing again in Rhode Island. "Hey, my attitude is, he deserves to be a 
prisoner of public opinion."</P>
<H3>Exercising the Right to Know</H3>
<P> Although no Rhode Island statute would prevent Collins 
from publicizing Craig Price's address once the killer is released, doing so would be 
unwise. As a police officer, Collins could wind up in federal court under Title VII of the 
United States Code. Passed in 1964 as part of Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights legislation, 
the law allows individuals to bring civil action against government officials who conspire 
to deprive them of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the 
law liberally, and it is conceivable that Collins could be found to have violated Price's 
right to privacy, a protection some judges believe emanates from the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>	The state's privacy act prohibits government officials from releasing a parolee's 
medical records, or information about his drug or alcohol treatment. But no regulations 
prohibit the state from giving out his home address to citizens who ask. The privacy law 
does not bind Rhode Islanders who do not work for the government. Says James Jerue, 
chairman of the state's parole board, if Craig Price were released on parole in Rhode 
Island, any citizen could find out where he lived. Not that Jerue thinks citizens would try 
to learn. "It has never happened," he says. "No one has ever asked for a home address."</P>
<P>	Citizens have a right to know when potentially dangerous criminals are released 
into their neighborhoods. But they also have an obligation to make the effort required to 
find the information. And there are many ways to get it.</P>
<UL><LI>  In places like Rhode Island, citizens can simply ask the state for the names and 
addresses of parolees.
<LI>In states with strict privacy laws, such as New York, citizens can lobby the legislature 
for legal reform.
<LI>Individuals can ask newspapers to publish the results of every parole hearing in the 
state, as well as the names of every person arrested and convicted for a serious crime. 
Once such information becomes public, it can be spread to a wider audience on 
community bulletin boards and computer services.
<LI>Citizens' groups can apply political pressure to police departments to release the names 
and addresses of those arrested and of those being released from prison into the area.
<LI>  No citizens' group should underestimate the power of a well-placed news story to make 
police departments more accommodating to its requests. If public scrutiny helps to keep 
criminals honest, it can have the same effect on public officials.</UL>
<P>	More than anything, concerned citizens must be willing to spend time and energy 
gathering information on known criminals. Which means they must be nosy. An informed 
community is not necessarily the most private, but it will be the safest.</P>

<H3> A Felon's Perspective (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	It is clear that social-service providers cannot supply all the supervision many ex-
cons need to stay out of trouble. Neighbors can help. Lewis, a 29-year-old native of 
Washington, D.C., has spent a large portion of his life as a professional burglar. Like 
many current and former criminals, he understands that it is vital to know whether 
neighbors have criminal pasts. "People got to know," Lewis says. "If you don't know 
who's living around you, you're trusting everybody. Most of the people that I know, 
including myself, we want everybody to trust us, because once you get trusted you can do 
basically anything you want to do."</P> 
<P>	As a young man, Lewis broke into houses on his own street. Had the neighbors 
known about his criminal tendencies, he says, "it would have never happened, because 
they would have been better prepared. You'd be surprised at the people who leave 
windows open and go to work. Some people are even stupid enough to get drunk around 
you and leave their keys."</P>
<P>	At 17, Lewis was arrested for several burglaries. He was convicted and sent to 
Lorton prison, outside of Washington, first to the juvenile wing, then to the adult facility. 
By the time he got out on parole, three years later, he had not been reformed, but he had 
become considerably wiser: He stopped breaking into his neighbors' houses. "Quite a 
few neighbors" knew about his burglary convictions, he says. "Basically, it was a `we're 
going to wait and see' type of thing. I was watched and that discouraged me from 
anything."</P>
<P>	Instead, Lewis says, he looked in other neighborhoods, especially crowded parts 
of town where neighbors would not recognize him. And he always went on foot. "You 
never drive a different car to a neighborhood because everybody notices it. If people see 
that different car, they'll wait `til you get out of it." Lewis estimates he burgled nearly 50 
houses before being sent back to prison (on drug-dealing charges, not burglary).</P>
<P>	It has been several years since Lewis finished his last term in prison. He is 
married and lives in Prince George's County, Maryland. He says he has no regular job, 
but works on and off for a temporary agency. His current neighbors do not know about 
his burglary convictions, and sometimes Lewis is tempted to steal again. "The urge will 
hit when I'm broke," he says. "Sometimes when it gets a little tight with money and she 
starts bitching, you start thinking what you can do for money. And you think, `I could 
always do what I used to do.' "</P>
<P>	Although Lewis has chosen not to tell his neighbors about his criminal past, he 
does not believe other criminals should have the same choice. "Why not alert people to 
the fact that you got a known criminal in the neighborhood, you got a burglar living next 
door to you?" he asks. "The burglar who lives next door to you will get you sooner than 
you think, especially if you don't know, because he can see you every day, he sees your 
moves every day."</P>

<H3>States Take Action (sidebar)</H3>

<P>Some states require notification of local police when a released convict moves into town, 
including:</P>
<B>Alabama</B>--Those convicted of two or more felonies must register with the town sheriff 
within 24 hours of moving to a new address.</BR>
<B>Florida and Mississippi</B>--All convicted felons must register with the town sheriff within 
24 hours of moving to a new address.<BR>
<B>Minnesota</B>--Only those convicted of certain crimes must register, such as murder and 
child molestation.</BR>
<B>Missouri and Tennessee</B>--Only those on parole need register.<BR>
<B>Nevada</B>--All felons who stay for more than 48 hours must register with the police, as 
must all visiting ex-cons who come to the state five or more times within 30 days.
In a number of other states, community-notification laws apply only to sex offenders. Though 
provisions of last year's federal anti-crime legislation may ultimately require all those 
convicted of sex crimes to register with state authorities, so far only some states keep 
track of sex offenders. They include:<BR>
<B>Arkansas</B>--The staff of a facility that is releasing a habitual child molester must send 
state police the offender's new address.<BR>
<B>California</B>--Citizens will soon be able to call a state-run 900 number to receive 
information about those convicted of child molestation.<BR>
<B>Connecticut</B>--Released sex offenders must register with state law enforcement.<BR>
<B>Delaware</B>--Police may announce a sex offender's release in a newspaper advertisement.<BR>
<B>Georgia</B>--As a condition of parole, chronic sex offenders must notify the sheriff in the 
town to which they move upon release from prison.<BR>
<B>Indiana</B>--Police departments must tell any citizen who asks the names of child molesters 
who live in his or her county.<BR> 
<B>New Jersey</B>--Sex offenders must notify the police of their home addresses every three 
months, and in some cases must continue doing so for life.<BR>
<B>Oregon</B>--When a child molester goes free, the department of corrections may alert 
police, churches, convenience stores, neighbors, businesses, or other places where minors 
congregate.</BR>
<B>Washington</B>--Police may post flyers giving the names, photographs, and addresses of  
chronic sex offenders.<BR>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he most popular outdoor basketball court in New York City is half the regulation 
size, offers no place to sit, and has sidelines bounded by a chain-link fence 20 feet high. 
Those who play here are literally encaged. Yet this ridiculously inadequate court, on 
West 4th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, has drawn the likes of Denzel 
Washington and Julius Erving for pickup games. And the summer league based here is 
probably the most prestigious in the city. Each year, the West 4th Street League attracts 
more than 30,000 spectators--city-dwellers and tourists--who stand in blistering heat 
just to glimpse their favorite players and snap up league T-shirts at $12 apiece.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street basketball owes its popularity to the inner-city leadership of its 
volunteer commissioner, a limousine driver named Kenny Graham. With little support 
from city hall or local civic groups, he has spent the last 18 summers building the league 
into a New York institution. Lloyd Daniels, Mario Ely, Anthony Mason, Rod Strickland, 
and Jason Williams honed their skills here before going on to N.B.A. careers, and some 
of them still show up during the off-season. Former pros like Detroit's Kelly Tripuka mix 
it up with high-school dropouts.</P>

<H3>Midday Basketball</H3>
<P>	West 4th Street has developed its share of stars, but this is not the league's true 
purpose. In an era of commercialized sports, it is important to understand the 
contributions of a community league composed primarily of players whose glory days are 
over--25- to 35-year-olds with talent and pride, but no N.B.A. contracts. The league and 
its fans cherish players the media overlook, while putting sports and sportsmanship back 
into the community. It is midnight basketball played in broad daylight and without 
government handouts.</P>
<P>	A recent documentary film called <I>Hoop Dreams</I> dramatizes the pathos of the 
nearly-great athlete. William, a high-school phenom from Chicago, ponders his future as 
a scholarship recruit. In the final moments of the film, William reflects on all the people 
who've asked him,  "Will you still remember me when you're a big star in the N.B.A.?," 
and says, "I should've asked them, `Will you still remember me if I'm not?'" Promising 
inner-city players are typically groomed from the age of 12 or so. This process has 
obscured the virtues of athletic competition and replaced them with illusions of easy 
wealth. For a lucky few, lucrative professional careers represent a materialistic triumph 
and escape from the neighborhood.Graham's league, on the other hand, showcases those 
who cannot escape, who must remain behind and make their community work.</P>
<P>	"I started working there refereeing league games for $10 a game," Graham recalls. 
"The next year the league was falling apart and no one wanted to take over, so I decided I 
would be commissioner."</P>
<P>	Founded in 1968, the league had struggled along for several years with only eight 
teams, unreliable funding, and a shortage of referees. Today, Graham runs the oldest 
summer-basketball program in New York City. There is a game every day of the week in 
June, July, and August, five on Saturdays and Sundays. Each year, more than 600 players 
altogether participate in the 24-team men's division, a women's division of six teams, and 
an eight-team division for boys 15 and under. Its prowess is known nationwide. Last year, 
the Summer Pro-League outdoor championship, sponsored by Nike and shown on ESPN, 
was won by the defending champions from New York. But that team, which defeated a 
Chicago squad in the finals by 30 points, had finished second at West 4th Street.</P>
<P>	Youth teams have come from as far away as Seattle and France to play in the 
preliminary games before the seniors begin, but collegiate players rarely play here 
because the league is not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. In his youth division, Graham 
prefers to work with younger, pre-high-school players, because high-school-age youths 
are often spoiled and difficult to control.   "We have trouble getting teams with 
responsible adults to control the players," he says. "It can be very difficult to talk to them. 
Last summer, we had high-school-age girls' teams, and fighting became a problem. At 
age 13 to 14, the kids will listen."</P>
<P>	The tiny court must hold two referees and 10 quick and often large players, so 
personal fouls proliferate. That makes refereeing difficult. "No one wanted to come down 
there to ref because West 4th Street was very rough," Graham says. "The first year I was 
commissioner, we had only one incident, and I took a stand. The players knew right then 
that I would not walk away from a problem." Arizona Pearson, who has played in the 
league for 11 years and now directs its youth program, has watched Graham keep the 
peace. "Kenny gets in the middle," he says, "but you have to do that, you have to be in 
control. With Kenny, it takes a lot to get him upset. If there's shouting and threatening, 
people apologize afterward."</P>
<P>	The cramped conditions also make ball control extremely difficult. Passing lanes 
are limited, and it is much easier here than in the N.B.A. for a defensive player to 
abandon his man to attack the dribbler or the post-up man waiting to turn and shoot. At 
the same time, the New York style of playground basketball frowns upon the staid jump 
shot in favor of the driving lay-up, with its infinite possibilities for blind pass-offs or shot 
creation. These factors produce a game of ferocious strength, speed, and competitiveness. 
The discipline and control of this style amazes outsiders and accounts for the league's 
popularity.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street smoothes the transition for many of the 98 percent of New York's 
good collegiate players who do not make it to the pros. The close of a competitive career 
can prompt an emotional letdown and demoralize young men with leadership abilities. 
Tony Hargraves was the co-captain of Iona College's basketball team in 1984-85 and was 
named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press, but he could not get 
a professional contract. Now an operations manager at Bear Stearns with a home and 
family in the suburbs, he continues to play regularly in the cage. "Good players still have 
a desire to play against people at their own level," Hargraves explains, "and West 4th 
Street offers this." When N.B.A. players show up, regulars treat them with respect, but 
they also relish the chance to show up the pro athletes.</P>
<P>	"The small court makes you do all the right things," Hargraves explains. "It 
improves your game. This is a place where you cannot continue to make mistakes. 
Anthony Mason [a power forward with the New York Knicks] is a prime example. West 
4th Street defined his game. He learned he had to move much more quickly. He became 
one of the stronger players in the city, and now he's one of the stronger players in the 
N.B.A."</P>

<H3>Respect Without Fear</H3>
<P>	I first became drawn to these players in the early 1980s, when I saw in their 
character something missing in the bright young MBAs at our big Wall Street trading 
firm. I saw in young players like Tony Sherman (who still plays) and Mario Ely (who 
won a championship ring with the Houston Rockets last year) awe-inspiring toughness, 
masculinity, and personal pride. These players are courteous but not chatty, fearless but 
disciplined. The better players have grit and a capacity for physical exertion that, I fear, 
our increasingly computerized society seems to devalue.</P>
<P>	Pearson sees the role of competitive basketball in the city quite clearly: "Of 
course it is fun, you can work off frustrations. But it's really about getting respect. That's 
what living in the city is about, you know." At West 4th Street, that means being looked 
up to by others. It's not the same as the fashionable notion of "self-esteem," which is of 
little use on the streets.</P>
<P>   Kenny's idea of respect is not built on fear. "I'm not militant and I'm not a cult leader," 
he explains. "I want people to learn they gain respect if they give respect. That's the 
bottom line.... Often black organizations are poorly run, and I tell players, `When you 
carry on, you reinforce stereotypes. If you make us and the league look bad, we could 
wind up with no league--and then you would have no chance to showcase your talents, 
we want a mutual respect for peers.... And respect for a program and an organization.... 
You can teach respect. I do it by talking, by challenging a person mentally. People judge 
others by their behavior, and I tell people that in their actions they represent their 
heritage, their culture, their race. A lot of so-called black leaders won't challenge black 
people about their behavior. It's easier to tell them [their problem is] white people."</P>
<P>   Fans must arrive early to reserve a good spot at courtside. For big games--the playoffs 
or the all-star game--youngsters sit on the fence or hang from tree branches. Graham or 
one of the staff wits uses a bullhorn to announce the games, and their commentaries are 
humorous, improvisational performances.</P>
<P>	The league has become an integral part of the lives of its 600-plus participants. 
Most of the players do not live in the neighborhood. They come mainly from Brooklyn, 
Harlem, or the Bronx to the playground here because they like to play before the big 
crowds in the Village.</P>
<P>	Sid Jones, a Brooklynite who has been coaching winning teams for 15 years, is 
particularly attuned to the sense of community the league has developed. "Generally, 
people don't spend time getting to know each other, but at this park, you meet people," 
Jones says. "The people you meet may help you in other parts of your life. Kenny and the 
league have been bringing people together for years, and it's now a community. You 
wonder, why can't people get along like this outside of sports? --Just about every 
subway line stops here, so you get people from all walks of life. It's a real melting pot. 
Players will come here when they won't go everywhere else. And I'll tell you, when you 
win a big game down here, you don't want to go home."</P>
<P> 	The city government provides the league nothing except a permit to play. "They 
are not that concerned with us," Graham says, "because they see we are doing OK. They 
are worried about their own programs. Occasionally a mayor will come down here to help 
get some votes. ... But they are not here to help the league."</P>
<P>   Graham never passes the hat. He and a few of his staff were once granted the status of 
part-time employees by the New York City Parks Department, but that was discontinued 
years ago. Money to run the league now comes exclusively from entry fees--$500 per 
team--and corporate sponsors. The principal sponsor for the last two years has been Fila 
Inc., a sportswear manufacturer, which subsidizes uniforms and gives sneakers to each 
team. Since 1986, Nobody Beats the Wiz has provided television sets for the winners of 
the Most Valuable Player and Sportsmanship awards. The nearby McDonald's feeds the 
staff more than 500 free meals each summer. The maker of Olde English 800 malt liquor 
provides a scoreboard and money for trophies and shorts.</P>
<P>	None of the league's successes--its local following, corporate sponsorship, and 
national recognition--would be possible without its reputation for serious, disciplined 
basketball. So Graham insists upon high standards of behavior. A public league held in a 
public park draws all kinds, and no one can be refused admission, but Graham works hard 
to maintain the dignity of the league. Sometimes a player or fan will challenge this. "One 
day right after a game, a guy on one of the teams dropped his pants," he recalls. "I didn't 
think it was funny. I laced into him something fierce. I embarrassed him right on the spot. 
What he did was totally wrong." As commissioner, Graham's decisions are final. If a 
player starts fights or disgraces the league in any way, he is banned for the season.</P>
<P>	Graham is a gifted leader who embodies positive thinking--necessary for 
entrepreneurs, but rare among administrators. Graham also takes great pride in delivering 
what he promises. Once when the TV prizes were held up due to a clerical snafu, he 
didn't hesitate to cover the costs. (Eventually, he was reimbursed.)</P>
<P>	Graham's devotion to excellence and good manners filters throughout the 
neighborhood. Good-humored and charismatic, he can quickly summon dozens of helpers 
to do whatever is needed--keeping score or sweeping the court before games. 
Afterwards, they leave the whole area cleaner than before. In this way, even street people 
become part of the league culture. "We take all kinds," says Graham. "We're all human 
beings. Sometimes people will tell me to get rid of a guy who maybe has a drinking 
problem. I say, if a man has a problem and I can help him, I will. Everybody can't be on 
the level we'd like them to be. Some guys have gone through their whole lives being 
rejected, but I will help somebody who wants to be helped. I can deal with them."</P>

<H3>Creating an Identity</H3>
<P>	Graham is proud of the fact that the league plays a part in the lives of many 
players and staff, even those who do menial work. "Many guys down here are not part of 
anything but a joint or a bottle of wine," he says. "We give them an identity above that 
stuff." Graham, who shuns smoking and alcohol, does not allow even surreptitious 
drinking in the park during games. He has also been known to chase smokers away, even 
though smoking is legal. He feels it creates a bad atmosphere for the kids who come to 
watch. He often reminds players that they are "guests" in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>   Even those who never became professional grow as players and as individuals. One of 
these is Tony Sherman, one of the best players in the league never to enjoy a good prep 
career or go to college. "He used to live down there," says Hargraves. "Every day at 3 
o'clock he'd be there working on his game. He's now a great player, and he's done it 
without a good high school record or any college experience.--At the park he became 
popular and he gained respect. That's a big thing in New York City." Pearson agrees: 
"Sherman's grown a lot. He could have been a troublemaker, but he watches his mouth 
now."</P>
<P>	Graham says Sherman has gradually earned the recognition he craves for his 
talent. He has come to follow the example set by Graham and some of the older players, 
and takes defeats with dignity.</P> 
<P>   "Sherman was once the king of the park," says Graham. "Many guys respected him out 
of fear. Now he's older, he's got responsibilities. I think he's realized that people give 
him respect. It's an important difference."</P>
<P>   Last year, then-Governor Mario Cuomo inaugurated the New York State Midnight 
Basketball League at a celebrity function in uptown Manhattan. The governor told the 
out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters for whom the league was created that "we have 
not done well by you, [but] we'll try to make it up to you." This was not the spirit that 
made West 4th Street.  Graham is not driven by paternalism or guilt, nor even by 
altruism. Like his players, he is motivated instead by a need for personal recognition and 
respect from the players and the basketball community. "It's nice to have people say, `I'm 
glad you're back,'" he says. Players and staff alike seek the rewards that come with 
excellence, not charity. "I tell them you don't have to love me--but you should respect 
me."</P>
<P>	Graham believes that other communities can duplicate the success of West 4th 
Street. First, he says, "develop a following. Develop a symbol. Our symbol is West 4th 
Street, playing in a cage. Our shirts are known all over New York--every kid wants one." 
Second, "develop people with character. You've got to let people know that you don't 
have to be out there, you've got a job and other things in your life. They can't just do 
what they'd like to."</P>
<P>	Sociologists like to point out that chaos and disorder are common aspects of 
malfunctioning inner-city families. One of Graham's greatest talents is for organization: it 
is he, not some government agency, that provides continuity for these New Yorkers. The 
order originates within the community rather than being imposed from without. There are 
lots of Kenny Grahams in every community. If such leaders are encouraged, they will 
come.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT></B>ust the other day, it seems, the national debate about the U.S. role in the United 
Nations turned for the most part on the issue of money--on U.S. contributions and U.N. 
waste, and how reducing the former might diminish the latter. That issue remains. In 
1994, the U.S. spent no less than $3.5 billion on a largely dysfunctional U.N. system--
with scant returns as measured by U.S. national interests. (See sidebar.)</P>
<P>	But the debate has a scary new dimension. The U.N. is reinventing what used to 
be called "peacekeeping." In the last several years, that do-good concept has been 
stretched to encompass a range of U.N. operations that typically involve the use of force, 
even the waging of war. Moreover, President Clinton's U.N. representatives are willing 
collaborators in developing a one-size-fits-all justification for multilateral interventions 
that bear only the most attenuated relation to U.S. interests--if any at all.</P>
<P>	And that, along with peacekeeping's mounting bills, adds up to serious business 
indeed.</P>
<P>	It is now the business of the 104th Congress. As a component of its Contract with 
America, the House of Representatives already has passed the National Security 
Revitalization Act, which reins in the wild proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping, limits U.S. 
participation in these operations, and imposes some controls on U.S. contributions to the 
U.N. generally. The next orders of business are to fend off efforts in the Senate to weaken 
these provisions--which constitute only a minimal package--and then to be vigilant 
about implementation. The question still to be answered is what the U.N. is worth to us--
whether, that is to say, the U.S. gets back in national priorities anything commensurate 
with its $3.5 billion annual investment.</P>
<P>	Ten years ago, there was a consensus in the United States that radical surgery was 
called for. Numerous studies and investigations, many of them instigated by the U.N. 
itself, had revealed a pattern of waste, mismanagement, and duplication (see sidebar, page 
66). The U.N.'s socioeconomic agenda called for the redistribution of wealth from the 
industrialized democracies to the less-developed countries of the Third World. On the 
political side, national-liberation movements (good) and colonialism (bad) were the 
buzzwords of choice.</P>
<P>	As a result, a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1984 overwhelmingly approved 
the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment to the authorization of the U.S.'s 25 percent share 
of the U.N.'s administrative budget. The terms of the amendment seemed unambiguous: 
Shape up, impose fiscal discipline on yourself, and move toward some form of weighted 
voting on the U.N. budget in the General Assembly, with "bonus" votes for big 
contributors in rough proportion to their contributions, or else suffer an annual 20 percent 
withholding of the U.S. payment.</P>
<P>	Now, let the record show that Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and 
Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) had the right idea then--that the U.N. had to be 
reformed if ever it were to become a useful agent of world order--and it is the right idea 
still. But for the most part, Kassebaum-Solomon failed. Congress is now back at work on 
the problems of a dysfunctional U.N., using the power of the purse as one lever of 
reform. The problems have deepened, however, both in complexity and in their deadly 
import. The U.N. has recently engaged in the promiscuous use of force under the 
authority of resolutions that may violate its own charter, and the Clinton administration 
has been willing, even eager, to plunge into the resulting swamp.</P>

<H3>The Peacekeeping Trap</H3>
<P>	Kassebaum-Solomon <I>redux</I> is embodied in the new House act; and, in the Senate, 
a companion bill covers some of the same ground. Both are reasonable first cuts at 
shaping a long-term policy. U.S. costs and U.N. waste are still at issue. But these bills 
focus on U.N. peacekeeping--which is itself a misnomer, and a dangerously misleading 
one.</P>
<P>	The U.N. peacekeeping budget and its expansive peacekeeping agenda are 
escalating out of control. In 1994, the U.S. was assessed almost $1.2 billion for what the 
U.N. calls peacekeeping operations. (The U.S. share is supposed to be fixed at 30.4 
percent, but in fact has crept up to 31.7 percent.) On top of that, the U.S. volunteered in-
kind operational support services--ranging from air- and sealift to armored personnel 
carriers to state-of-the-art communications and intelligence assets--that are valued in the 
House bill's "findings" at $1.7 billion in 1994. (Sources within the national-security 
establishment set their value at close to $2 billion. The administration claims that a major 
part has been reimbursed, but exactly how much is unclear.) These costs were skimmed 
off U.S. defense appropriations that were never intended for peacekeeping or any other 
U.N. program.</P>
<P>	This has contributed to a state of unreadiness in the U.S. military. Appearing 
before a House appropriations subcommittee on January 25th, General John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Defense Secretary William 
Perry conceded as much. They attributed about half of a $2.6 billion defense 
supplemental request to "unanticipated" U.N. peacekeeping costs: $600 million for Haiti 
alone, another $312 million for Bosnia, and lesser amounts for other operations.</P>
<P>	As recently as 1990 or 1991, U.N. peacekeeping was pretty much just that: the 
assignment of ad hoc U.N. forces to monitor truces, police cease-fires, and provide 
buffers between contending parties. These forces prided themselves on scrupulous 
neutrality, and were deployed with the agreement of the parties. The models were 
Kashmir, Cyprus, Lebanon, or the Sinai (where it all began in the 1950s). These were the 
renowned Blue Helmets, drawn from the armed forces of smaller countries (such as Fiji, 
Ghana, Ireland, and Norway); they collectively and deservedly received two Nobel Peace 
prizes. The U.N. peacekeeping budget was appropriately modest and generally 
predictable from year to year. A decade ago, the entire U.S. contribution to the U.N. for 
all programs was less than the U.S. assessment for peacekeeping alone in 1994 
(excluding the "free" support services).</P>
<P>	But now U.N. peacekeeping means almost anything--feeding the hungry, 
responding to "911 calls" (Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's favorite 
formulation), holding elections, building national infrastructure--that the U.N. wants it to 
mean. And this is a U.N. that is avidly seeking "new" missions in the post-Cold War 
world.</P>
<P>	In Cambodia, peacekeeping meant preparing for "free and fair" elections in what 
essentially remains a war zone. Yet the Vietnam-controlled regime that lost the elections 
is still effectively in power. Cost: in excess of $2 billion.</P>
<P>	In Somalia, peacekeeping meant pacifying warring tribal factions, then feeding 
the war's innocent victims, then (unsuccessfully) running the principal warlord to ground. 
Now the warring factions are back at it. Cost: $1.5 billion and counting, plus 30 
Americans and scores of other troops dead. In Haiti, peacekeeping meant invading a 
sovereign country (without opposition or casualties, fortunately) to restore a deposed 
president. With operational control now passing from the U.S. to the U.N., there are 
disquieting signs that violence could resume. Cost: as much as $1 billion so far, and no 
telling how much more for how much longer (one estimate is about $180 million for the 
next six months).</P>
<P>	In Bosnia and Croatia, peacekeeping has become surreal. A force of almost 
25,000 keeps open supply lines to civilian populations--whenever the Serbs choose to let 
the convoys through. The U.N. command has demarcated various "safe havens," which 
the attacking Serbs have violated with impunity. Retaliatory NATO airstrikes, which 
require U.N. concurrence, have been too little, too late. This U.N. peacekeeping force 
cost more than $1 billion in 1994. A "peace-enforcement" operation of open-ended 
duration, with peace nowhere in sight, may require at least 50,000 troops at an annual 
cost of $3 billion. The recently retired U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose of the United Kingdom, may have said more than he intended in a BBC 
documentary: "We are not here to protect or defend anything other than ourselves or our 
convoys."</P>
<P>	The point is not that these U.N. operations are all without merit. But all of them 
were set in motion under Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter as responses to "threats 
to peace and international security"--and, except for Bosnia, where even the U.N. claims 
only a "humanitarian" mission, not one of them meets that rigorous standard. They are of 
questionable legitimacy, and the U.S. picks up 31.7 percent of the tab.</P>
<P>	Besides paying the biggest share of the bills, the U.S. has acceded to all of these 
operations as one of the Security Council's permanent five. In Haiti and Somalia, the U.S. 
committed armed forces as well. Right now, anywhere from 50,000 to 70,000 U.S. 
military personnel are assigned to U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Exactly how many is 
in dispute. The House puts the number at 70,000; Perry testified to "just under 50,000" as 
of late January.) Some are serving in war-zones, some are off-shore or in aerial 
surveillance and interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving 
under the authority only of U.N. Security Council resolutions as implemented by the U.S. 
commander-in-chief.</P>

<H3>What Can Be Done?</H3>
<P>	This is the range of problems that Congress now confronts. The bills pending in 
Congress address the issue of U.S. contributions to an open-ended U.N. entitlement 
program in the guise of peacekeeping. But they also raise a genuine constitutional issue: 
the commitment of U.S. armed forces--arguably, the ultimate exercise of public 
authority--without the explicit consent, or even involvement, of Congress.<P>
</P>	The House act passed in February inhibits, but does not prevent, the president 
from engaging U.S. armed forces in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and in particular from 
putting U.S. forces under "foreign" and/or U.N. command. (In the latter case, the U.S. 
officers in direct command of U.S. troops would retain the right to report to and to appeal 
any orders they receive to "superior U.S. military authorities." The president, moreover, 
would have to state in a prior legal memorandum to Congress the grounds for believing 
that such an action is not a violation of the Constitution; the burden of proof is on the 
president.) The president has to give Congress 15 days prior notice of any action 
contemplated or, in an emergency, report within 48 hours afterward. The president has to 
justify the action taken as "necessary to protect national security interests of the United 
States," and project as best he can both the cost and the duration of the operation. These 
requirements should have a chilling effect on the president's propensity to undertake such 
commitments lightly. One can only wonder, had this been the law at the time, how the 
president would have justified our engagements in Somalia or Haiti, and on the grounds 
of what "essential" U.S. national interest.</P>
<P>	There is more. The House act makes it very difficult indeed to fund any expansive 
U.N. peacekeeping operations at all, especially new ones. Effective October 1, 1995, 
there is to be a 25 percent cap on the U.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping--period. 
Moreover, no defense appropriations can be used for any U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping, whether assessed or voluntary: All contributions have to be funded 
explicitly, from earmarked appropriations. Finally, the president is required to present an 
annual accounting of the "fair market" value of all voluntary in-kind contributions 
provided to the U.N. in the prior year and, unless reimbursement is received, offset the 
total "incremental" cost of these contributions against the U.S. assessment for the year 
ahead.</P>
<P>	The loophole opened here, and it's a huge one, is the definition of "incremental." 
Presumably the base pay of U.S. military personnel would be the same whether or not 
they served in a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But what about tanks and jeeps and 
aircraft, or air- and sealift? How in such cases are add-ons computed, as against the 
"base" cost of the U.S. military establishment's sophisticated hardware? And how are 
costs assigned to wear and tear on the U.S. forces as well as to providing necessary 
downtime and retraining? The proof of this effort to restrain peacekeeping costs will 
depend on the rigor with which the test is applied. Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) of 
the House Committee on International Relations estimates that the offset will be in the 
range of $300 million to $400 million, rather than the $1.7 billion for total voluntary 
contributions in 1994.</P>
<P>	In his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, in September 1993, President 
Clinton said that he favored a 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping assessments and that 
the U.N.--and he might have added, the U.S. representatives there--would simply have 
to learn to say "no" to all but the most urgent requests for "peace" operations. The bills 
now in Congress take him at his word.</P>

<H3>How Not to Reform the U.N.</H3>
<P>	It is instructive to recall the lessons of the Kassebaum-Solomon experience. No 
sooner had the amendment taken effect than the ranks of the U.N.'s leadership were filled 
with born-again reformers. The fewer the U.S. dollars, the greater their zeal. The then-
Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, appointed a select experts' committee that 
very nearly--the Soviets said "no" at the last minute--recommended a major U.N. 
restructuring that would have satisfied about 99 percent of the amendment's intent. The 
experts' committee was able to enact the requirement that the administrative budget could 
move from committee to the General Assembly plenary only by consensus. This 
consensus procedure amounted to a U.S. veto on the U.N. budget.</P>
<P>	But a veto is only as good as the will to use it. Budget growth in the following 
two years was held to zero, but not a finger was laid on the waste, duplication, and 
overlap, nor on the obsolete programs that beset the U.N. then, and still do. On the basis 
of that two-year record, the president--Ronald Reagan himself--certified to Congress 
that the "spirit" of Kassebaum-Solomon had been satisfied, and full U.S. funding 
resumed.</P>
<P>	The U.N. paid no price at all for the endemic inefficiencies and uncontrolled 
spending that gave rise to the congressional reforms in the first place. The dollars that 
were withheld are now being paid up. These are the very "arrearages," in fact, that have 
fueled charges that the most generous contributor to the U.N. is the world's number one 
deadbeat.</P>
<P>	There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this experience. First, merely 
focusing on the process by which the administrative budget is adopted is not enough. The 
loophole of "going along" is too big, and offers too easy a way out. Second, the budget 
itself is not quite the issue: the programs funded by the budget, and the priorities among 
them, have to be scrutinized year after year. Finally, for any U.N. reforms to take firm 
hold--which calls for a persistent effort by the U.S., leading a coalition of the like-
minded within the U.N.--the president and Congress have to be reading off the same 
page. Most of the job, in fact, has to be done by presidential appointees and the 
permanent bureaucracy responsible to them. Congress can (and should) establish the 
benchmarks; but, in the absence of determined executive action, nothing much will be 
accomplished.</P>

<H3>Tightening the Screws</H3>
<P>	This time around, Congress is considering sterner measures: a stronger version of 
last year's Pressler amendment. Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) tied full U.S. funding of 
U.N. operations to the president's certification that an independent U.N. Office of 
Inspector General was up and running. This, in turn, was a follow-up to the key 
recommendation of the Thornburgh Report, in 1992-93, that an inspector general with 
clout was essential to jump-start meaningful U.N. reform. The House act requires the 
withholding of 50 percent of the U.S. peacekeeping assessment and all voluntary 
contributions every year, as well as 20 percent of the regular assessment, pending the 
president's annual certification that an independent U.N. inspections office is in operation 
and that the inspector general has been chosen on the basis of professional credentials, 
has subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records, issues annual and unexpurgated 
public reports, and that the inspector general's recommendations are being implemented.</P>
<P>	Congress, for its part, has to be prepared not to take "yes" for an answer. The best 
way for the U.S. to save money is for the U.N. not to waste it--and that means probing 
behind the numbers to the U.N. programs that ought to be trimmed back, or zeroed out, or 
rejected in the first place. Congress must be on the right track, because administration 
witnesses are already warning of the imminent collapse of the West--maybe even of 
U.N. peacekeeping as we now know it--if this total legislative package is enacted. And 
that, of course, is the point.</P>
<P>	I would add two modest proposals to the package. First, the U.N. ought to 
overhaul the present scales of assessments. Congress should require the president to open 
negotiations at once to revise both the administrative and peacekeeping assessment scales 
within one year. Capping the peacekeeping assessment at 25 percent is only a start: all of 
the allocations, which are supposed to correspond to the GNPs of the U.N. members, are 
hopelessly out-of-date. Russia, for example, pegged at 10 percent for the administrative 
budget and 11.5 percent for peacekeeping, pays too much. China, on the other hand, 
which claims a GNP in excess of $2 trillion, pays less than 1 percent on both scales. The 
spread overall is from 25 and 30.4 percent for the U.S. (for the administrative budget and 
peacekeeping, respectively) to one-hundredth of 1 percent for 85 countries--close to a 
majority of the U.N.'s total membership of 185. Saudi Arabia and Brunei are ranked 
equally with Benin and Bangladesh.</P>
<P>	A second proposal refers to the sidebar on "The High Cost of U.N. Membership": 
What in fact do we spend on the U.N., on all of its various parts, including also the value 
of the in-kind voluntary services that the U.S. routinely contributes? No one, as best I've 
been able to determine, keeps an authoritative ledger; someone ought to. Congress should 
require that the president submit an annual, comprehensive U.S./U.N. budget request. 
That way, we might better be able to answer the question with which we began.</P>

<H3>What Is the U.N. Worth to Us?</H3>
<P>	On balance, I believe the answer has to be "not much." Even if the U.N. were to 
be substantially reformed--which in my judgment is very unlikely--the answer would be 
only slightly more upbeat.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is what we made it. There is little evidence that, in the late spring of 
1945, the U.N.'s founders had any inkling of the proliferation of mini-states that would 
result from the breakup of the colonial empires in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
Simply gathering together all the countries in the world into one grand and ill-assorted 
institution did not then, and does not, now constitute a "community" at all, and certainly 
not a community of like-minded liberal democracies with a consensus on how to design 
and maintain the framework of a tolerable world order. Yet that is the fundamental 
premise built into the U.N. Charter--which today is essentially a fraud.</P>
<P>	At least half, and as many as two-thirds, of the U.N.'s 185 members should, on 
the Charter's own principles, either be expelled or suspended. Yet they comprise a 
working majority of the U.N. General Assembly. They adopt the budget, allocate 
resources, and permit a significant part of these resources to be wasted. Much of the 
waste, as noted already, is on redundant socioeconomic programs that they perceive to be 
beneficial to themselves; the rest pays for plum jobs in the Secretariat for their own elites. 
The fact that these programs do more harm than good, by confirming them in their bias 
toward statism, cuts little ice. The U.N. is their organization. Not surprisingly, they use it 
in their own interests.</P>
<P>	Now, it will be objected that all this is beside the point, that the General Assembly 
itself is beside the point: simply a shadow-play, in which the mini-states debate toothless 
(if often mischievous) resolutions that nobody heeds. Subsidizing this exercise is, so the 
argument goes, the price we pay for maintaining a functioning U.N. when we need it.</P>
<P>	"When we need it": This always is the mantra of last resort. It apparently refers to 
those "threats to peace and international security" to which only the U.N. Security 
Council can respond with force or the threat of its use. Thus Warren Christopher argued, 
in vigorously opposing the limits on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping, that their 
effect would be to force the U.S. to "go it alone." It's either the U.N., such as it is, or 
isolation. But "going it alone" looks not so bad, if it means standing aside from, even 
vetoing, ill-defined, open-ended "peace" operations that arguably exceed the U.N.'s 
authority and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence. Secretary 
Christopher may make unapologetic isolationists of us all.</P>
<P>	In some circumstances, our government's own judgment of the national interest 
may coincide with U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating forceful responses to 
"threats to peace." North Korea's invasion of the South was one such circumstance, 
Iraq's aggression against Kuwait another. But in both cases, it was the prior U.S. 
judgment, and its firm commitment to resist aggression, that carried the day in the 
Security Council. The U.S. and its like-minded allies would have taken the actions they 
deemed necessary, with or without the cover of U.N. resolutions. It may well be, in fact, 
that the U.N. served more to inhibit than to unleash the resulting "peace-enforcement" 
operations, and limited their effectiveness as a consequence.</P>
<P>	Looking back over these last 50 years of U.S. national security policies, what is 
most striking is the almost total absence of the U.N. from the historical record. When 
something does matter, whether it is an alliance to deter aggression (NATO) or carrying 
out an effective foreign assistance program (the Marshall Plan) or negotiating the rules of 
free and fair international trade (GATT), the United States invariably has entered into 
multinational engagements with the genuinely like-minded. This should come as no 
surprise. It is the mark of a serious country, seriously pursuing its national interests.</P>
<P>	Most of the U.N.'s success stories have in fact been those of the results-oriented 
specialized agencies--as, for example, the virtual eradication of smallpox (WHO), the 
care and feeding of refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), and the 
green revolution in South Asia (several agencies involved). Many of these agencies 
predate the U.N. itself. And the most successful have been those most careful to insulate 
themselves from the "political" U.N. in New York.</P>
<P>	For now, it is probably enough just to cut back on the U.S. commitment to the 
U.N., to be discriminating in acceding to the use of force in U.N. "peace" operations, and 
to prevent as much costly mischief as possible. The approach being taken by Congress 
seems about right--but no less will do.</P>
<P>	The threat to withhold consensus on the administrative budget, vigorously 
applied, could squeeze a useful amount of fat from the Secretariat. Insisting on an 
independent inspector general is not about to produce a lean and mean U.N. bureaucracy 
overnight, but every little bit helps. In the specialized agencies, picking and choosing 
among programs worth supporting--as we do in UNESCO, even as a non-member--
makes a lot of sense. A runaway Security Council calls for particular vigilance, and an 
ever-ready veto, which the total package of congressional limitations should satisfy--yes, 
Mr. Secretary, even at the risk of "going it alone."</P>
<P>	I fear that putting the U.N. out of its misery altogether would incur unacceptable 
costs. The predictable firestorm among our allies would weaken relationships that are far 
more important to us than the U.N. itself. It may be cowardice, or it may simply reflect 
the enormous effort involved in fundamental U.N. reform for a rather modest payoff. But 
I would settle for putting the U.N. back in its box and keeping our eye on it. A wary eye, 
and a parsimonious one.</P>

<H3>The High Cost of U.N. Membership</H3>

<P>	Somewhere in the United States Budget for Fiscal Year 1996 there is an entry for 
just about everything, from midnight basketball to research on the reproductive cycle of 
fruit flies. But search as you will, nowhere in that huge tome that documents the roles and 
responsibilities of $1.6 trillion's  worth of national government is there a total for 
projected U.S. contributions to the United Nations.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is not exactly a new kid on the block. It will celebrate its 50th birthday 
this June; and after tens of billions of dollars in U.S. contributions over the years, it might 
be supposed that someone would want to assess the value to us of membership in this 
multinational conglomerate. A total annual budget figure would help.</P>
<P>  To get started on such an evaluation, here are the numbers for the 1994 calendar year, as 
best as I have been able to put them together:</P>
<UL><LI>  The U.S. share (25 percent) of the U.N. administrative budget, which funds all 
Secretariat staff and programs: $298 million.
<LI>  The U.S. share (31.7 percent) of the peacekeeping budget: $1.2 billion.
<LI> U.S. contributions to all U.N. specialized agencies (World Health Organization, Food 
and Agriculture Organization, High Commissioner for Refugees, et cetera): $368 million, 
exclusive of capital contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</UL>
   Cumulative total: almost $2 billion.<BR>
<P>   This total does not include the value of goods and services that the U.S. contributes 
voluntarily to the U.N. system as a whole. For U.N. peacekeeping operations alone, 
voluntary contributions in 1994 represented about $1.7 billion in "fair market" value, and 
some sources put the total in excess of $2 billion. (The administration claims some of this 
total has been reimbursed, but does not say how much.) For other programs, a reasonable 
estimate is even more difficult for an outsider, but there is a steady flow of experts from 
the Washington bureaucracy to U.N. headquarters, and similar ties with the specialized 
agencies. Add in these numbers, and the total approaches $4 billion.</P>
<P>	That isn't small change. Now that we know roughly what membership costs us, 
the question we need to answer: What does our investment in the U.N. buy us?</P>


<H3>The U.N.'s Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	In 1992 and 1993, former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh served as 
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management with a specific 
mandate to evaluate the U.N.'s effectiveness. After a year on the job, he prepared a report 
on U.N. mismanagement and waste and tried repeatedly to galvanize the secretary general 
into effective action. In frustration, he went public with his recommendations and 
testified on March 5, 1993 before the House Subcommittee (of International Relations) 
on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. Here are some 
highlights of his report and testimony:</P>

<B>Inspector General.</B> Key recommendation: to uncover "waste, fraud, and abuse" within 
the Secretariat, an independent, professional Inspector General has to be named, with full 
subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records.<BR>
<B>Peacekeeping Field Operations.</B> A McKinsey & Co. management audit uncovered no 
less than $100 million in annual waste owing to duplication and overlap, managerial 
incompetence, and lack of communications within the field structures.<BR>
<B>"Featherbedding."</B> One example: 500 typists employed to transcribe the dictation of 
translators. Use of basic word processors would save about $20 million a year.<BR>
<B>Financial Management.</B> McKinsey & Co. recommended improvements in foreign 
exchange transactions, centralization of cash management, and automated payments. 
Projected annual savings: $12 million to $15 million.<BR>
<B>Career Service.</B> Nearly 90 percent of all staff assessments are positive. As Thornburgh 
notes, not only does incompetence carry no penalty, there is no incentive for meritorious 
service. Top jobs in the U.N. Secretariat are compensated up to 150 percent of 
comparable U.S. supergrades--and it's all tax-free.<BR>
<B>"Consultants."</B> Although it is in violation of the U.N.'s own regulations, top bureaucrats 
are routinely "retired" (with lump-sum separation pay up to $500,000) and then 
immediately rehired as "consultants" at 85 to 100 percent of previous pay.<BR>
<B>Procurement.</B> In 1990-91, of 5,450 contracts let, only 17 percent were put out for 
competitive bidding, contrary to U.N. regulations for all except "emergency" cases.<BR>
<B>Printing.</B> About two-thirds of all printing needs are generated during the annual three-
month General Assembly. Yet the print shop is fully staffed year-round. Contracting out 
during peak times would, according to Thornburgh and a 60 Minutes investigation 
(broadcast September 20, 1993), save "tens of millions" annually.<BR>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT></B>arents and politicians tend to blame the education establishment for the sorry 
state of learning in American public schools. The educrats are not taking this lying down. 
They've found their own scapegoat: parents. Public-school boosters have decided that lax 
parental involvement is the reason children fail. And so some have begun turning the 
schools into Big Mother.</P> 
<P>	The newest trend in education "reform" is the inclusion of parental-education 
programs and curricula that require parental involvement in student activities. President 
Clinton's Goals 2000, enacted last year, includes an entire section on "parental 
assistance," also called "parent training." Some schools even require parents to sign a 
pledge that they will perform assigned, pseudo-educational tasks, which could include 
playing "Simon Says" or rolling cookie dough with their third-grader.</P>
<P>	Of course parents should be involved in their children's education. And, of 
course, problems at home--messy divorces, absent fathers--can cause problems for 
children at school. But the "parent education" movement seeks to blame all parents for 
academic failure, not just parents who are neglecting their kids or destroying their own 
families. The movement does not seek to make parents more demanding of their children, 
nor, no surprise, of the schools. To the contrary, new curricula urge parents to be 
nurturing and uncritical--sort of the way public-school officials would like parents to 
treat them.</P>
<P>	This philosophy is becoming institutionalized in California. Consider the math 
curriculum rated most highly--a perfect 100 percent--by a state education panel that 
chooses which textbooks should qualify for state subsidies. "Investigations in Numbers, 
Data and Space," from the Dale Seymour Publications Series, appealed to the panel 
because it included home assignments that require parental involvement.</P>

<H3>New New Math</H3>
<P>	Under this curriculum--call it New New Math--which eschews rigorous 
memorization of multiplication tables, teachers send home periodic "Dear Family" 
missives to third-grade parents with the following advice:</P>
<UL><LI>  "Don't worry if your child doesn't use a ruler accurately yet--it's a skill that will 
develop over time, with more and more opportunities to measure."<BR>
<LI>  "Children have very interesting ways to figure out these problems. You can help by 
asking your child to tell you how he or she got an answer. There are many ways to do 
these problems--and no single `right' way. What's important for your child to know is 
how his or her own way works."<BR>
<LI>  "When your child has an assignment to do at home--such as collecting data about the 
ages of pets and oldest relatives--offer your help, and ask your child about what he or 
she is doing in class."<BR>
<LI>  "There is one thing we ask you not to do. We won't be using some of the step-by-step 
methods of addition and subtraction in this unit that may be familiar to you--nor will we 
be teaching borrowing or carrying. All too often, we have found that children this age 
memorize these step-by-step procedures and do not learn how to apply the processes of 
addition and subtraction. This year we will support students in developing several 
strategies for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and we prefer that they do 
not memorize a single set of procedures."</UL>

<H3>Educational Relativism</H3>
<P>	This New New Math adds up to a new way of letting schools off the hook for not 
teaching children. It's not enough that we have moral relativism in English and Social 
Studies. Now we have it in math, too.</P>
<P>	The Dale Seymour third-grade program instructs parents to "make roll-out 
cookies with your child" to explore shapes, include children in family math decisions 
(such as how many floor tiles to buy) and explore "fair shares," which is politically-
correct educratese for "sharing food." Clearly the intent of these instructions is to force 
parents to spend quality time--at least as defined by educrats.</P>
<P>	So what's wrong with that? Supporters argue that parents, especially single 
parents, may not spend enough quality time with their children and would benefit from 
programs that nudge them to do so. But not all parents need this nudge, and some object 
to the schools' sledgehammer approach. And many may object to a pervasive touchy-
feely, there's-no-such-thing-as-a-wrong-answer attitude being foisted upon parents.</P>
<P>	In Petaluma, California, a mandatory high-school course called Human 
Interaction, or HI!, has provoked an angry reaction from some parents.</P> 
<P>	They resent take-home assignments that tell them how to be parents. The 
program's take-home and in-class "teen/parent" worksheets have included these queries 
for ninth-graders:</P>
<UL><LI>  Whether "how much money your parents make" is a private issue or can be discussed in 
class.<BR>
<LI>  Whether any "close relatives" has ever suffered "alcoholism" or "mental illness."<BR>
<LI>  Whether students "feel OK about crying" and "allow" themselves to do so.<BR></UL>
<P>	Other questions explore whether students recycle, eat fast food, use public 
transportation and "accept the way [they] feel about things."</P>
<P>	According to administrators, the course is a hit with kids. You can see why. No 
boring memorization or flexing of the gray cells here. Student assignments encourage 
teens to go with their feelings. "Denying" them, they are told, is passive behavior. A class 
worksheet on "family systems" assures teens that "open" families are "`pure' 
democracy," while "closed" families are "hierarchal."</P>
<P>	Federal law prohibits schools from asking children for highly personal 
information without parents' permission. The district explains that teens are meant to fill 
out the worksheets for their own private use, but at least two teachers in Petaluma told 
students to turn in signed worksheets. And Stephen Collins, the assistant superintendent 
of the Petaluma School District, admitted last fall that, once such worksheets are passed 
out, it is very likely that these topics will be discussed in class.</P>
<P>	Petaluma parents Jay and Tura Avner pulled their two children from HI!. "They 
want to be surrogate parents," Tura Avner complains. She especially resents the district's 
assumption that "unless the schools taught me how to manage my kids, they'd be running 
wild in the streets."</P>
<P>	But the Avners' efforts to liberate their children have not been easy. The district 
would not assign the Avners' son to an alternative, academic class. Instead, he was forced 
to be a counselor's aide for that period. Worse, the district dragged its feet for months 
before granting a "waiver" from this program. So much for "voluntary" parental 
education.</P>
<P>	District administrators sometimes insinuate that dissenters are right-wing religious 
fanatics. These days, that is a standard response to complaints. State law allows parents to 
pull their children from classes for reasons of religious belief or moral conscience. The 
Petaluma district, however, wouldn't let parents remove their children without a fight. 
Last year, the superintendent's cabinet, the district counsel, and HI! officials crafted a 
waiver form requiring parents to list their "reason(s) why they did not want their children 
to attend, and declare that they would provide appropriate alternative educational 
experiences" on HI! topics. This tactic clearly was designed to prompt parents with 
religious objections to proclaim themselves, giving administrators potential grist for the 
anti-fundamentalist mill. Yet California law clearly protects parents' right to keep private 
their reasons for objecting to a class.</P>
<P>	The kicker: Until the Rutherford Institute, a religious-freedom advocacy group, 
threatened a lawsuit, the district proposed that parents sign the waiver forms "under 
penalty of perjury." The penalty for perjury in California is a jail term of up to four years. 
Was the district planning to arrest parents who don't teach their children recycling? "I 
don't know that we were going to do anything," assistant superintendent Collins 
explained at the time. "We knew that when we went into this it was going to be revised."</P>
<P>	Collins was forthcoming in his defense of HI!'s "individual growth, physical 
growth, and social growth" curriculum. It is "pretty generally believed," he said, that 
most parents don't communicate with their children. Then there's the if-schools-don't-
teach-this-children-will-die argument. Collins explained that the board determined that 
HI! "was a matter of life and death." "If students don't have the tools to deal with the 
pressures" and destructive elements in life, he said, the board feared teens "would make 
the wrong choices and it would be fatal."</P>
<P>	This thinking betrays a strong anti-parent bent. Parents, apparently, fail to instill 
their children with self-esteem or AIDS awareness, so the schools must fill the void. 
Educrats have concluded that children who ignore their oafish parents' words on, say, 
safe sex will miraculously heed their teachers. Worse, HI! assumes that teens will build 
more self-esteem by talking about their feelings than by learning to speak a foreign 
language or play a musical instrument.</P>
<P>	Similarly, New New Mathmeisters seem to have a Rousseauesque view that 
children will grasp math intuitively if not distracted by narrow-minded parents or 
teachers. For example, the California math-curriculum panel disapproved of exercises 
that are "generally under the direction of the teacher." That Californian teachers' unions 
have supported this shows how far they have moved from their support of traditional 
pedagogy.</P>

<H3>Why Have Schools?</H3>
<P>	Maureen DiMarco, Governor Pete Wilson's education adviser and a critic of the 
New New Math, is baffled by this natural-learning approach. If kids learn so well by 
themselves, she asks, why have schools? "The assumption that, if children wander 
aimlessly they will automatically find all the prizes that are out there educationally is 
totally ludicrous," she says.</P>
<P>	Despite the rhetoric about parental involvement, administrators favor things that 
parents don't like. A poll by Public Agenda found that 86 percent of respondents want 
students to learn arithmetic "by hand" before they use calculators. But a 1993 survey 
found that 82 percent of math educators thought that "early use of calculators will 
improve children's problem-solving skills and not prevent the learning of arithmetic."</P>
<P>	If educators want parents to be involved in public education, it certainly isn't 
because teachers and administrators value their views. Parents in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and elsewhere complain they have been systematically frozen out of 
power in school-based councils. The message: Be seen and not heard.</P>
<P>	And maybe cough up some money for a field trip, books, or computers.</P>
<P>	New New Math programs effectively freeze parents out in another way. Even as 
New New Math mavens ostensibly increase parental involvement, many new curricula 
don't even include textbooks. "The concept of what they mean by parental involvement 
in these materials implies the parents should be involved," says DiMarco, "but then tells 
parents not to impose their own math learning styles and knowledge on their children. 
And worst of all, when the student doesn't get what is going on in class and the parent 
has to help with the homework, too often the parent will be confronted with only a 
worksheet. There is no textbook that explains the work to be done--leaving the parent 
and the student without another alternative than just the teacher's explanation."</P>
<P>	Sadly, parents are often the first to embrace parental education, even if their 
parents rarely helped them. A generation ago, it was believed that children learned best 
by working through their studies on their own. Somewhere along the way, educrats 
abandoned that notion and began to insist that parents assist with the homework.</P>
</P>	In addition, the proliferation of AIDS, teen pregnancy, and single-parent families 
have led many to demand that schools take on responsibilities that parents 20 or 30 years 
ago would never have dreamed of giving up. Today, the generation that believed in 
questioning authority is asking the authorities to raise their kids.</P>

<H3>Wrong Target</H3>
<P>	Brace yourselves--things may grow worse. Petaluma has begun a pilot program 
for grade-school counseling called SUCCESS, an acronym for "Self Understanding Can 
Create Everlasting Secure Selves." Counselor Susi Brodie told the <I>Petaluma Argus-
Courier</I> that counseling children often involves counseling parents.</P>
<P>	Big Mother's attention wrongly falls upon functioning families. Neglectful 
parents aren't going to roll out the cookie dough to teach shapes; only families who 
already bond with their children will. Troubled students largely lack structure, not 
attention.</P>
<P>	Two years ago, I rode in a van operated by the San Juan Unified School District, 
in Sacramento. The 35-foot van housed the district's mobile Student Attendance Review 
Board (S.A.R.B.). According to Carolynn Salter, the district's child welfare and 
attendance counselor, the district purchased a van for S.A.R.B. hearings because parents 
frequently failed to show up for their children's truancy hearings.</P>
<P>	The four students the van visited that day were in elementary school. One 
kindergartner had missed 57 days, while his second-grade sister had missed 66. Their 
prognosis was frightful: They were both to be kept back a grade. The boy couldn't even 
use scissors.</P>
<P>	Schools and government should intervene in such clear-cut cases of severe child 
neglect. But Big Mother does not have the stomach to deal with these messes. A bill 
sponsored by the late B.T. Collins, a GOP assemblyman, that would have ended welfare 
benefits for parents with truant children never made it out of committee.</P>
<P>	Instead of getting tough with parents who don't provide their children with basic 
needs--nutrition, shelter, education, stability--the schools have turned their attention 
where it is needed least. </P>
<P>	They target parents who provide for their children and are well-meaning and 
gullible enough to be taken in by faddish curricula. The parental-involvement movement 
seeks to teach parents to  value self-esteem over academics. This is a clever ploy by a 
system that is shortchanging American children. </P>
<P>	As happens in so many areas these days, the government is treating good people 
like bad people, while letting the worst problems fester.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT></B>f 1992 was the "Year of the Woman" in American politics, then 1994 was the 
"Year of the Conservative Woman." Nine women incumbents--all liberal Democrats--
lost their House seats in the November elections. Seven conservative Republican women 
were elected to the House freshman class, while moderate Republican Olympia Snowe 
moved from the House to the Senate.</P>
<P>	The new Republican women in the House do not claim sisterhood with the so-
called "women's agenda." Instead, they define the GOP's Contract with America as a 
"women's issue," and their campaigns centered on tax cuts, congressional reform, and 
reducing or eliminating scores of government programs and entire agencies. Sue Myrick, 
a two-term mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, was named to the House Budget 
Committee because of her experience controlling municipal spending. She's also a co-
chairman of the GOP "freshmen task force" to eliminate the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. Since the mid-1960s, she says, HUD and other federal agencies 
have spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty, and poverty won.</P>
<P>	Barbara Cubin of Wyoming and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho intend to protect 
women and men alike by calling for an overhaul of federal regulation. They've been 
active in the effort to defend property owners from intrusive federal regulators, and to 
give states more flexibility in controlling natural-resources development on public lands 
within their borders. Both Chenoweth and Cubin are on the GOP task force to reform the 
Endangered Species Act to protect animals and plants without jeopardizing jobs or 
property rights. Sue Kelly, of New York's Westchester County, is the only pro-choice 
woman in the crowd, and styles herself an economic conservative. She'll be pushing tax 
and regulatory relief for small businesses.</P>
<P>	These women participate in the first Republican-led Congress in 40 years, which 
offers them unprecedented opportunities for influence. Policy Review looks at three of 
the new lawmakers, who should be on anyone's list of members to watch in 1995 and 
beyond:</P>

<P><B>Andrea Seastrand (CA-22)</B></P>
<P>	For many, the death of a spouse means a time for quitting--a time when long-held 
hopes are wrapped up and put into storage. Not for Andrea Seastrand.</P>
<P>	When her husband Eric, a California assemblyman, died in their 26th year of 
marriage, Seastrand ran for his seat and won. They were a team, "movement 
conservatives" devoted to making government work, by fighting bureaucracy and red 
tape. But it was always Eric who worked in the limelight of elected office. She was 
supportive, in the background, stuffing envelopes and going door to door. "I was the one 
writing the letters and getting others to write," she says. "I never saw myself as the one to 
receive the letters."</P>
<P>	She would be receiving a lot of them. Elected in 1990, Andrea served four years 
in the General Assembly. Then, last year, she saw an opportunity to run for the Santa 
Barbara-area congressional seat vacated by Michael Huffington in his bid for the U.S. 
Senate. She ran on the Contract with America and immigration reform, calling for 
speeding up the deportation of illegal aliens convicted of and imprisoned for serious 
crimes. She supported Proposition 187--the state ballot initiative to end state services to 
illegal immigrants--because she thinks legal aliens are most likely to play by the rules 
and build lives for themselves and their families. "I'm a believer in immigration--legal 
immigration," she says. "I want to help people who are here legally to work through the 
red tape to become citizens more quickly."</P>
<P>	Seastrand's political education began at the all-girls Catholic high school she 
attended in Chicago. During a visit to the school, a bishop who had been exiled from 
Lithuania explained what communism meant in his country, and described the deadening 
effect of a totalitarian government on its citizens. The experience made the 15-year-old 
staunchly anti-Communist. The nuns at school gave Seastrand what might be called a 
practical civics lesson: "No matter where you come from, no matter what your 
background, if you use your God-given abilities and talents, and work hard, the sky is the 
limit to what you can achieve." This simple principle has affected her views on 
everything from welfare reform to school choice.</P>
<P>	The former elementary-school teacher learned another lesson from her nuns: The 
importance of living by example, of mentoring young people in basic conservative values 
of family and citizenship. Fulfilling a promise with her husband, Andrea has continued 
"adopting" students, taking them under her wing for national conventions and boosting 
their involvement in civic life. Her students typically serve as interns in her office, 
community volunteers, and political and neighborhood activists. One of the students she 
took to the Republican National Convention in 1984 is now her congressional district-
office director. An immigrant from Mexico who once served as an intern is now a Wall 
Street banker. Another former intern is a lobbyist in California for a transportation trade 
association.</P>
<P>	Shortly after the death of her husband, Andrea established the Eric Seastrand 
Memorial Youth Fund, using her skills at grassroots political organizing for non-political 
community-outreach projects. Her fund has benefitted dozens of students by providing 
scholarships, supporting 4-H programs, buying a wheelchair to enable a child to 
participate in the Special Olympics, and supplying train tickets for grade-school field 
trips.</P>
<P>	Like most freshman Republicans, Seastrand's immediate objective is to pass all 
provisions in the Contract With America. But her top legislative priority is to free the 
commercial space-launch industry from the bureaucratic maze of regulation by 
overlapping agencies. She's sponsoring a bill that would create a single agency for 
oversight and regulation, and permit tax-exempt bonds to fund the conversion of obsolete 
military bases into spaceports.</P>
<P>	Her plan would require no direct federal expenditures. Seastrand says her bill 
would help the U.S. compete in the global market for commercial launches, and create 
high-tech jobs in a depressed area severely hurt by base closures and declining military 
expenditures. As a state legislator, Seastrand successfully pushed through commercial 
spaceport legislation, creating the California Spaceport Authority and the first 
commercial spaceport in the nation at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In Congress, she has 
secured positions on the two committees that would handle this issue: Science and 
Transportation.</P>
	
<P><B>Linda Smith (WA-3)</B></P>
<P>	The House Republican leadership calls her "the woman who wouldn't blink." 
When the House wrangled over the Balanced Budget Amendment, Linda Smith insisted 
that it include a provision to prevent Congress from raising taxes without a three-fifths 
majority vote. It was a daring move for a freshman, for it amounted to a rebellion against 
the leadership of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey. Though the tax-limitation provision 
was part of the Contract, its most vocal supporters soon backed off when it became clear 
that it lacked broad congressional support. But not Smith and a handful of her colleagues. 
They convinced the GOP leadership to promise to vote next year on whether tax hikes 
should require a three-fifths majority.</P>
<P>	This came from a woman who didn't even run for Congress. Ten days before the 
primary in her congressional district in southwest Washington, the leading GOP 
candidate suddenly withdrew. Smith, a state legislator, was persuaded to run as a write-in 
candidate because she had organized a strong grass-roots base of more than 10,000 
volunteers. Smith's volunteers hit the streets and got out the vote. She won the primary as 
the first successful write-in candidate in state history, and then won the general election 
with 51 percent of the vote.</P>
<P>	 During her tenure in the state legislature, Smith launched two successful state 
ballot initiatives. The first, concerning campaign-finance reform, ushered in a new code 
of conduct for incumbent legislators, and outlawed public financing of elections. </P>
<P>	The other, the Taxpayer Protection Act, imposed a limit on state government 
spending, and called for voter approval of tax increases.</P>
<P>	That sort of lawmaking gets noticed in the new Congress: Two weeks after Smith 
came to Washington, Representative Jan Meyers tapped her to be chairman of the Small 
Business Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance. The best way to promote small 
business, she argues, is to get government out of the way. One of her top priorities is to 
reduce capital-gains taxes to lighten the load on small businesses and spur economic 
growth.</P>
<P>	Years spent navigating the federal tax system motivates this agenda: Smith 
worked as a tax planner in Washington state for 16 years, without giving politics much 
thought. In 1983, after a series of tax hikes, Smith watched her state legislature double 
the tax rate on small businesses. That's when she decided to leave the tax-consulting 
business to get into the tax-limitation business. Not only did Smith, with no political 
experience, run for a seat in the state Assembly, but she ran against a veteran in a 
Democratic stronghold--the man who'd cast the deciding vote to raise taxes. Her own 
party assured her that a conservative woman had no chance of getting elected in her 
district. Nevertheless, she won in a landslide. After four successful years in the state 
Assembly, Smith ran for the state Senate against an incumbent considered unbeatable. 
Again, she shocked her political opponents. Her come-from-behind victory helped give 
state Republicans their first legislative majority in 33 years.</P>
<P>	There is no way to explain Smith's political successes outside of her populist 
appeal. She describes her mission in Washington in the simplest of terms: "Clean up 
Congress, get rid of the debt, and secure our future." If Smith sponsors even half as much 
legislation as she shepherded in her home state, she'll be known as one of the most 
reform-minded House members in recent history.</P> 
<P>	In addition to tax reform, she wants to enact a campaign-finance reform plan that 
prohibits the transfer of political funds from one person's campaign to another. She 
believes that candidates alone should be responsible for their fundraising activities. This 
widespread practice, if outlawed, would cut against the grain of all members, regardless 
of party affiliation. It would mean that in a tight race, where an infusion of last-minute 
cash might influence the outcome, a candidate's campaign could no longer receive 
thousands of dollars in surplus funds from another politician's war chest. </P>
<P>	Smith would restrict out-of-state campaign contributions to less than half of a 
candidate's financing. She would subject political-action committees to the same 
restraints currently placed on individual contributors--$1,000 per election cycle, rather 
than the current $5,000. She wants to prohibit incumbents from using the congressional 
frank for mass mailings of constituent newsletters within three months prior to an 
election. Believing that politicians have the million-dollar advantage over their 
challengers--by way of a taxpayer-funded congressional budget--Smith contends that 
bulk mailings unfairly boost an officeholder's name identification.</P>
<P>	Smith is not known as a compromiser. Critics say that her stubbornness in 
pushing through her agenda borders on arrogance. Smith, on the other hand, likes to 
remind them that she did not run for office; she was drafted. She says her populist reform 
agenda is part of a larger movement in the newly elected House membership. "Don't 
break the spirit of this freshman class," she warns the GOP leadership. "This spirit is 
what the country needs."</P>

<P><B>Enid Greene Waldholtz (UT-2)</B></P>
<P>	Ever since Utah's Enid Greene Waldholtz was elected to Congress, she has been 
passionately concerned about her job's fringe benefits--she wants to amend, slash, and 
eliminate them. Waldholtz wants all members of Congress to reduce their retirement 
benefits, eliminate automatic pay raises, and roll back their salaries to $89,500--a 31 
percent cut--all in the name of good government.</P> 
<P>	And that's just for starters. She wants Congress to cut its own budget by 25 
percent, return to its former status as a part-time legislature, and restrict the ability of 
lobbyists to wine and dine members and their staffs. "Everything about the federal 
government needs to change," Waldholtz says.</P>
<P>	Her top priority is reform of congressional pensions. Members of Congress now 
receive retirement benefits that are roughly double that of individuals in the private 
sector. Waldholtz has co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the existing plan and replace it with 
a 401(k) employee-contribution plan.</P>
<P>	Talk about putting your money where your mouth is: Waldholtz has declined to 
accept her own congressional pension, and she has refused government-paid health 
coverage. She and her husband will purchase their own coverage until Congress acts on 
meaningful health-care reform, including portability of insurance benefits, for all 
Americans. She is also trying to figure out how to reduce her annual salary or funnel the 
difference between her current pay and her proposed salary toward charity or reducing 
the debt. She specifically intends to prevent the money from returning to the House 
Speaker's slush fund, the current repository of all unspent funds from congressional 
budgets.</P>
<P>	Although critics contend that she is feigning sacrifice, because of her personal 
wealth, she argues that to effect real political change on Capitol Hill, "the government 
must lead by example." She says it is essential that members "show that we are cutting 
our own budget, that we are living under the same conditions and rules that people in the 
rest of the country are."</P> 
<P>	Reform of congressional pay and benefits is vital, says Waldholtz, when Congress 
is asking sacrifices of its constituents in order to control federal spending and eliminate 
the deficit. Waldholtz says voters in her 2nd district of Utah understand the need for 
shared sacrifice; they know the budget cannot be balanced painlessly. "People in my 
district will support reduction in government even if it means fewer benefits to some of 
them," she says, "as long as they know Congress did it in a fair way, that they were not 
unduly penalized, or asked to take more than their fair share of the burden." </P>
<P>	Waldholtz, a longtime conservative on social issues, was a Bush supporter in the 
1980 presidential race who has since become more conservative on fiscal issues as well. 
She is a good listener, has the negotiating skills of a diplomat, and is well respected by 
both conservatives and centrists within the GOP. This is perhaps one reason why Newt 
Gingrich gave her a highly coveted slot on the Rules Committee, the gatekeeping body 
that determines which legislation makes it to the floor for debate. The first freshman 
appointed in over 80 years, she represents a part of a coalition charged with helping to 
shape legislation to appeals to a majority of the Congress.</P>
<P>	When it comes to welfare reform, for example, such a coalition will need both her 
experience and her bargaining skills. While serving as the deputy chief of staff to Norman 
Bangerter, a Utah governor, she served as his liaison for social services and spent a great 
deal of time in welfare offices talking to case workers and welfare recipients. Her 
conclusion: "The current welfare system verges on immoral," she says. "It penalizes 
people for getting married, for holding a job, and for acting responsibly. It also 
encourages recipients to have more children out of wedlock. The system is completely 
backwards, and it traps people in poverty."</P>
<P>	All of these women gained national office through more than hard work, or savvy 
campaigning, or the incompetence of their opponents. They were propelled by a common 
disgust for the status quo in Washington--a disdain shared by an overwhelming majority 
of the voting electorate last November. As Waldholtz puts it, "The federal government 
has created a hostile atmosphere for states, for communities, and for families to take care 
of themselves."</P>
<P>	Undoing this state of affairs is not thought of as an issue on a women's-rights 
agenda. But it has become the central issue for these women, because they see themselves 
not only as women, but as citizens. That may make them our best hope for bringing more 
citizenship, and less tribalism, into our politics.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the 1992 presidential race, the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop Thinking 
About Tomorrow" became the official anthem of the Clinton campaign. Once in office, 
the new administration lost little time infusing every facet of its domestic agenda with 
concern about the future. But its defense agenda has been curiously immune to long-term 
thinking. Rather than planning for tomorrow, the administration's defense policies reflect 
a disturbing preoccupation with the concerns of the moment.</P>
<P>	This is a dangerous flaw. The record of the 20th century suggests that the present 
period of diminished global tensions will not last, and that major new threats to national 
survival may emerge in the near future. However, the Clinton administration seems to 
assume that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history, at least as far as great-
power threats to national security were concerned. The result is a U.S. defense budget 
that exhibits high levels of consumption and very low levels of investment.</P>
<P>	Both in their rhetoric and in their resource allocations, senior Pentagon executives 
and many congressional Republicans have been preoccupied with "readiness"--the 
ability to fight effectively on short notice. Readiness is a notoriously nebulous concept, 
but in economic terms it translates into consumption: Money is spent to preserve and 
enhance current capabilities rather than prepare for the future.</P>
<P>	Like other forms of consumption, readiness tends to be bought at the expense of 
procurement of new weapons. In inflation-adjusted terms, Pentagon procurement 
accounts now stand at the lowest levels since 1950, the year the Korean War began. The 
$39 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for weapons procurement in fiscal 
1996 constitutes only 16 percent of a defense budget that itself has shrunk to a mere 15.5 
percent of overall federal expenditures. In other words, the Pentagon's planned spending 
on all types of equipment for military services in fiscal 1996 adds up to only 2.5 percent 
of the federal budget--an amount of money equal to about four months' of sales by the 
Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration contends that this low level of investment is justified 
by a diminished threat and the huge inventory of weapons accumulated during the Cold 
War. It also claims that a planned increase in procurement will lead to "recapitalization" 
of the armed forces toward the end of the 1996-2001 Future Years Defense Plan. 
However, the Pentagon's current predictions for 2001 may not be any more reliable than 
those of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is possible that spending on 
procurement will remain depressed. If that occurs--while high levels of readiness are 
sustained--the armed forces will suffer continued depletion of their weapons inventories.</P>

<H3>Lessons of the Past</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the depletion of capital stocks could coincide with the reemergence 
of threats abroad and a revolution in military technology, creating a situation not unlike 
that of the 1930s. The current debate over national-security needs presents a rather 
distressing spectacle in historical amnesia. The struggle with communism for the past two 
generations has so strongly influenced policymakers that they exhibit little apparent 
capacity for interpreting that experience in a broader context.</P>
<P>	The Cold War was the third occasion in this century when the U.S. mobilized to 
prevent anti-democratic forces from dominating Eurasia. The century began with the 
challenge posed by German imperialism, and barely a generation later the U.S. was at war 
again, this time to defeat fascism. The outcome of WWII then set the stage for the anti-
communist crusade of the post-war period. </P>
<P>	Note that the same pattern repeated itself with each new danger. Regional powers 
gradually accumulated land and resources while the United States was distracted; early 
warnings that a great-power threat was emerging were greeted with widespread 
skepticism; when the threat became urgent, U.S. leaders discovered they were woefully 
unprepared and commenced a hasty mobilization; once the threat passed, the nation 
engaged in an equally hasty demobilization. After a period of relative tranquillity, the 
cycle has repeated itself.</P>
<P>	It is remarkable that the political elite of a world power could experience three 
complete threat cycles in one century and still not grasp the basic lesson that a fourth 
such challenge is likely sometime relatively soon. As Colin Gray, a military theorist, has 
noted, "American policymaking in the national security area tends to be dominated by 
people with a poor sense of the value of history." Whatever the explanation, current U.S. 
defense policies reflect a startling lack of strategic vision.</P>
<P>	For example, the 1993 Bottom-Up Review was conceived by the Clinton 
administration as a comprehensive assessment of military resources and requirements for 
the post-Cold War period. It prudently concluded that U.S. forces should be able to 
successfully prosecute "two major regional conflicts that occur nearly simultaneously." 
And yet nowhere in the document is the historical significance of regional conflicts 
clearly spelled out--that great-power threats to U.S. security typically originate in 
regional aggression not countered in a timely manner. </P>
<P>	From this perspective, the real danger posed by Saddam Hussein in 1990-91 was 
not his violent annexation of Kuwait, for the invasion of Kuwait was no more significant 
than Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 or Germany's remilitarization of the 
Rhineland in 1936. The danger lies in the bolder designs an aggressor might pursue if he 
encounters no resistance.</P>
<P>	History thus provides a compelling reason for being ready to fight. But it also 
teaches that the emergence of aggressive great powers is characteristic of the geopolitical 
landscape, and that unless the United States continually invests in new defense 
capabilities, it may eventually be unable to avoid defeat at the hands of such a power.</P>
<P>	Viewed against this backdrop, the fundamental defect of the Clinton 
administration's defense plan is all too evident: It purchases current readiness at the price 
of future preparedness. When procurement spending is inadequate, high levels of 
readiness inevitably use up weapons for which there are no replacements. Meanwhile, a 
drop in military contracts prompts the production base of the defense industry to atrophy. 
The U.S. thus gradually loses the military and industrial capacity to respond effectively to 
aggression.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration recognizes this problem and therefore has begun to 
plan for the "recapitalization" of the armed forces--an unfortunate appropriation of a 
term usually associated with the restructuring of bankrupt organizations. But the concept 
of bankruptcy may not be entirely misplaced, because administration plans make future 
procurement increases contingent on raising the overall defense budget and realizing 
substantial savings from base closures and acquisition reform. None of these sources can 
be counted on to generate enough money for a sustained surge in investment.</P>

<H3>The "Procurement Holiday"</H3>
<P>	The Congressional Budget Office refers to the current slump in weapons 
purchases as a "procurement holiday." But like Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" 
during the darkest days of the Great Depression, this is merely a pleasant way of 
describing a system on the verge of collapse. The real buying power of the Pentagon's 
procurement budget declined 67 percent between fiscal 1985--the peak year of President 
Reagan's defense buildup--and fiscal 1995. The administration proposes a procurement 
budget of only $39 billion in 1996, which would bring the total reduction from the peak 
in fiscal 1985 to 71 percent. Backlogs in defense contracts are expected to contract 
eventually by a similar amount, forcing many defense contractors to exit the business and 
reducing competition among those who remain.</P>
<P>	No other part of the defense budget has experienced a comparable decline. The 
major categories of weapons-related expenditures correspond roughly with the key stages 
in the product life cycle: research and development, procurement, and operations and 
maintenance. The operations and maintenance budget includes most of the spending 
related to readiness, whereas R&D, together with procurement, constitutes most 
investment spending. All three accounts declined between fiscal 1990 (the year the Berlin 
Wall fell) and fiscal 1995. But procurement shrank from 28 percent of a relatively large 
budget to 17 percent of a much smaller budget. In constant 1995 dollars, procurement 
spending fell in just five years from $94 billion to $43 billion--a 54 percent cut.</P>
<P>	The impact of declining procurement expenditures on the production of major 
weapon systems has been dramatic:</P>
<UL><LI>  In fiscal 1996, the Air Force does not plan to purchase a single fighter or bomber. In 
fact, it plans to purchase no new bombers throughout the 1996-2001 Future Years 
Defense Plan, even though nearly half of its long-range bombers are more than 30 years 
old, and the sole fighter program it has in development (the F-22) has been repeatedly cut 
back and delayed.<BR>
<LI>  The Navy plans to purchase seven ships in fiscal 1996, only a third as many as it 
purchased in 1990. Over the course of the Future Years Defense Plan, it will buy just one 
submarine every other year from its last remaining sub manufacturer, and many observers 
believe the recently authorized CVN-76 will be the last large-deck carrier the service 
procures.<BR>
<LI>  The Army has stopped purchasing main battle tanks, and has no plans to resume 
purchases any time in the next 15 years. It has been unable to find sufficient funding to 
support upgrades to its existing tanks at an economic rate.</UL>
<P>	The Clinton administration argues that reduced levels of procurement are an 
appropriate response to the end of the Cold War, and that the high procurement 
expenditures of the Reagan-Bush years have made it possible to adequately equip 
shrinking military forces without buying new weapons. Senior administration officials 
point out that R&D spending for new weapons technologies has declined only 
moderately, and that when recapitalization commences early in the next century, it will 
not be necessary to replace weapons on a one-for-one basis. They also claim that by the 
time it is necessary to increase procurement, acquisition reforms will make it possible to 
acquire some military systems more quickly and less expensively from commercial 
sources. Finally, they note that a 47 percent real increase in procurement is planned 
between fiscal 1996 and 2001.</P>
<P>	If all of these assertions proved true, there would be little reason for concern. The 
U.S. would presumably be well-positioned for the challenges that might arise in the next 
century. However, the administration's positions obscure as much as they reveal, and are 
based on assumptions that may prove to be unreliable. For example, the same acquisition 
reforms that supposedly will enable the armed forces to buy advanced technologies more 
quickly and cheaply from commercial sources will also facilitate the transfer of those 
technologies to potential adversaries. As the acquisition system places increased 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies with both military and commercial applications, it is 
inevitable that foreign nations will gain greater access to advanced military capabilities. 
Acquisition reform could thus hasten the emergence of new threats.</P>
<P>	The contention that a smaller force structure can be adequately equipped from 
existing weapons inventories has some validity. For instance, the average age of ships in 
the Navy's active fleet is declining despite the low level of new procurement, because 
older ships are being retired in large numbers. However, the administration's own data 
demonstrate that many key military systems are approaching the mid-point of their 
projected lives, and will eventually require replacements. Furthermore, continuously 
depressed levels of new procurement will gradually erode the defense industry's capacity 
to produce those replacements. In the case of the submarine business, the Navy will soon 
be dependent on a single shipyard that is producing only one boat every two years. If 
even one submarine is removed from the production schedule, the supplier base will 
probably collapse.</P>
<P>	The most misleading argument the administration advances is that it is cutting 
procurement while maintaining R&D specifically in order to prepare for future threats. 
That ignores what is being developed and what is actually being procured. In December, 
the administration announced that the Army's highest-priority acquisition program, the 
Comanche helicopter, would be kept in development and not moved forward to 
production. The Comanche is the only truly stealthy aircraft likely to enter the Army 
inventory in the next 20 years, so deferring its production means soldiers will have to 
face future threats in increasingly vulnerable conventional helicopters. Thus the benefits 
of a decade of development are being lost because of a decision not to procure.</P>
<P>	Similarly, the administration is resisting congressional efforts to procure 
additional B-2 "stealth" bombers even though there is extensive evidence that the planned 
force of 20 B-2s and 200 older bombers cannot meet projected operational requirements. 
Opposing further purchases of the B-2 might make sense if a cheaper and equally 
survivable alternative were under development, but it isn't. Instead, the Air Force plans to 
rely on vulnerable B-1s and B-52s to carry out the bulk of future long-range bombing 
missions. Here again, the benefits of a $20-billion development effort are being 
squandered, with no long-term plan for recovery in sight.</P>

<H3>Bad Trade</H3>
<P>	It is obvious that such decisions are not being driven by doctrinal or operational 
considerations. They are dictated by budgetary pressures. The Clinton administration 
apparently has concluded that unless there is a significant increase in defense spending, 
readiness can only be maintained by drastically limiting investment. This is a tradeoff that 
cannot be continued indefinitely because low levels of procurement eventually translate 
into low levels of preparedness. It is a tradeoff that is not only unacceptable, but 
unnecessary. To avoid this trap, the Pentagon must get serious about privatizing military 
support functions.</P>
<P>	In recent years, many private companies have restructured their operations to 
focus on core competencies. By shedding activities that either are not central to the 
organization's mission or can be performed less expensively by others, companies are 
able to emphasize what they do well and thereby improve their efficiency. The 
Department of Defense is overdue for such a restructuring. Although the department has 
undergone considerable downsizing and there is much talk of "reinventing" what 
remains, there is little evidence of greater efficiency. The result is that even in the midst 
of a budget crisis, the Pentagon continues to waste huge amounts of money.</P>
<P>	The defense department lacks market discipline, and exhibits many of the 
managerial defects of a top-down monopoly. That is hardly surprising, because the 
department was established to exercise a monopoly in the application of military power, 
and like the rest of the federal government it is not a product of economic forces. But it 
still can benefit from those forces.</P>
<P>	After WWII, the department accumulated a vast array of support functions--such 
as supply management, equipment maintenance, dependent health care, data processing, 
accounting, and commissaries--that, while necessary to the effective exercise of military 
power, do not need to be performed by the government. One way of freeing up money for 
additional procurement is to gradually privatize those support functions that can be 
provided by private-sector sources.</P>
<P>	The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the federal government 
saves nearly $10,000 every time the functions of a worker are contracted out. On average, 
the government "outsourcing" saves 20 to 30 percent per contract. However, contracting 
out and privatization have been constrained by convention and by concern that critical 
services might not be available from private-sector providers in wartime. There is little 
empirical basis for this concern, and the cost of continuing to make policy as if it were 
valid is staggering. For example, studies of the $15-billion depot-maintenance system for 
conducting weapons repairs have found 25 to 50 percent of the system is unneeded 
capacity. Some outsourcing of depot maintenance already occurs, but complete 
privatization could probably save billions of dollars every year.</P>
<P>	There are numerous other examples of defense support activities that could be 
privatized. About 48,000 civilian and military personnel are engaged in supply and 
distribution activities. Overhead costs for goods delivered by these personnel average 70 
to 90 percent of the value of the goods themselves, a high figure by private-sector 
standards. The transportation, storage, and administrative costs associated with buying 
and distributing spare parts alone is roughly $5 billion per year, not counting the cost of 
the parts. Many private-sector companies have developed advanced inventory 
management and distribution systems that could substantially cut these costs.</P>
<P>	Financial-information systems is another area that could benefit from 
privatization. The Pentagon reported in 1994 that of 28 major audits of its operations in 
the previous year, 26 were unfavorable. During the same year, the department was unable 
to match $19 billion in disbursements to specific contractual requirements, meaning the 
money may have been paid erroneously. The level of unmatched disbursements is all the 
more striking in view of the fact that it requires more than 100 separate transactions for 
the department to issue a single check. Despite all of these steps, many of which 
presumably exist to prevent mistakes, the chief of staff of the Air Force recently said that 
"it would be nice if we knew what actual costs were, but our accounting systems often do 
not perform this simple and reasonable service."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration is striving mightily to "reinvent" the Pentagon's 
financial management systems, but "deinvention" might make more sense. The private 
sector is full of data-management and accounting firms that long ago solved the challenge 
of tracking money within large organizations. Many large firms have turned over their 
day-to-day financial-support requirements to these firms. The Pentagon should seriously 
consider doing the same thing, just as it should consider turning over the post-exchange 
and commissary functions to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>	An example of how greater reliance on the marketplace could reduce defense 
support costs is provided by the General Services Administration's 1991 decision to 
transfer time-urgent delivery functions to FedEx Corp. The General Accounting Office 
estimates that relying on private-sector sources for overnight delivery reduced the 
government's costs by 76 percent. FedEx's performance was such an improvement that 
the Air Force is increasingly relying on private-sector providers for its own deliveries of 
critical spare parts.</P>
<P>	Nobody really knows how much money the Department of Defense might save 
through the wholesale privatization of support functions. But the annual savings could 
eventually be sufficient to sustain higher levels of procurement without cutting readiness 
or force structure. In fact, privatization would have multiple benefits for the procurement 
budget: Not only would it free up funds for weapons purchases, but transferring 
weapons-support functions to the companies that make the systems could also help 
preserve critical industrial capabilities and reduce the overhead costs they charge on 
procurement contracts.</P> 
<P>	If there is a final lesson in all this, it is that there is no substitute for vision, 
whether strategic or managerial. We may not be able to know the future, but we certainly 
can have a reasonably clear idea of what the past tells us about the range of possibilities. 
In the case of defense spending, past experience warns against a prolonged drought in 
investment, particularly when high levels of readiness are gradually consuming existing 
capital equipment. In the case of defense management, past experience dictates that the 
marketplace is the most efficient provider of goods, and that continuing to perform 
support functions within the government reduces the military's capacity to accomplish its 
mission. These are easy lessons to grasp; the question is whether we will have the 
courage to act on them. Investing more in modern weapons while privatizing support 
functions would prove that, for once, we have learned from our past mistakes.</P>

<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Arguments in favor of a prayer amendment are usually based on symbolism rather 
than raw moral reasoning. In truth, moral reasoning can be authentically employed in 
perpetuating either view.<P>
<P>	If this acknowledgement is denied, then the issue becomes a "distraction," as Joe 
Loconte ("Lead Us Not into Temptation," Winter 1995) suggests, with evangelical 
devotion to the cause somewhat "misplaced."</P>
<P>	Inasmuch as school prayer is "symbolic," it mirrors the perception that the moral 
underpinnings of American society are eroding, if not eroded. The more important 
question hence might be: What is the fundamental role of the Christian community in 
contributing to the moral fabric of a wider American culture? </P>
<P>	This wider issue requires a wider strategy than mere constitutional revision at the 
present political time. The common arguments in favor of a prayer amendment are, by 
themselves, unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>	 First, prayer is a recognition that the state is not God. While certainly symbolic of 
a higher truth, it cannot in and of itself guarantee the reverse.</P>
<P>	Second, that sundry societal pathologies are to be found in the schools themselves 
("Prayer surely won't hurt!") may be true, but is not an argument either. It should be 
remembered that civil disorder stems not from exclusion of school prayer, but from 
voluntary exclusion of religion from the lives of America's people. Thus, a prayer 
amendment is at best a poor antiseptic.</P>
<P>	And even when prayer is important to a majority--perhaps as high as 75 
percent--of Americans, the truth of the matter is that if this devotion to prayer were taken 
more seriously and applied in other available contexts, school prayer might be less the 
political issue that it is.</P>
<P>	Some evangelically minded Christians view a prayer amendment as a "jump start" 
approach to cultural rejuvenation. These individuals would contend that cultural renewal 
is long and tedious; what has been fairly rapidly eroded takes much longer to restore.</P>
<P>	Advocates of a prayer amendment, on the other hand, tend to overlook the fact 
that legislation is reflective of wider culture and not vice versa. To invert this moral-legal 
relationship is to miss the broader issues that are facing Christendom.</P>
<P>	In sum, prayer amendment advocates will need the inconvenient reminder that 
they cannot effectively legislate before they have influenced broader culture. One cannot 
change laws before changing people's minds and habits.</P>

<H3>Dumbed-Down Religion</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	A further argument in favor of Joe Loconte's position on prayer in public schools 
clarifies the difference between religiosity and religion. Religiosity in general transcends 
the specifics of the Catholic or Lutheran or Baptist or Judaic or Muslim religions. And it 
is this generalized religiosity that such prayer in public schools embodies--dismissing as 
trivial the truths of the several great religious traditions that thrive in this country.</P>
<P>	Church, synagogue, mosque--everything is interchangeable in such a scheme. 
Perhaps some religions can accept the dumbing down of religious difference. But the rest 
of us who seriously practice our respective, contending, and contentious religions must 
object.</P>
<P>  Public prayer removed from the specific setting of faith, practiced piety, and the 
corporate, sacred community that offers prayer bears little meaning for Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam.</P>
<P>   When there is a "we," it is always the mystical body of Christ assembled in the name of 
Jesus Christ; or it is the holy Israel, speaking to the One "who has sanctified us by his 
commandments and commanded us"; or it is the Nation of Islam.</P>
<P>   True, we worship one and the same God. But to each of us that God is made manifest in 
specific ways. So far as our deeply held faiths insist, those paths to God, laid out by God 
through Jesus Christ or through the Torah or through the Prophet form the royal road.</P>
<P>	Public prayer that ignores or trivializes and marginalizes the specificity of that 
holy faith forms an affront to the God who has become known to us in the details of our 
revealed faiths. Prayer from no one in particular to whom it may concern bears no 
relationship to the divine service that  our several religions conduct.</P>

<H3>Exaggerated Reliability</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	In light ofthe neo-paganism to which so many Americans have pledged their 
allegiance, it may well be that, as Joe Loconte argues, Christians should be wary of 
school prayer. Nevertheless, the author exaggerates the reliability of private conscience 
and underestimates the importance of public, communal expressions of faith.</P>
<P>	It is quite true, of course, that faith coerced is no faith at all, but that does not 
mean that all of public life may safely be cleansed of that faith which informs Western 
Civilization.</P>
<P>	Public forms of expression work on private consciences. It is not true, as Loconte 
suggests, that "rote prayers" and liturgies are mostly empty and meaningless; indeed, 
evangelicals have their own "liturgies"--repetitive phrases in spontaneous prayers, for 
example. Such repetitions, they rightly sense, inscribe certain truths in the heart and thus 
encourage genuine belief and Christian conduct.</P>
<P>	Furthermore, Loconte is far too quick to reject the majoritarian argument.</P>
<P>	Majority in this case does not refer to shifting numerical majorities in various 
states of the Union, but to the permanent majority at the very heart of Western culture, 
which T.S. Eliot rightly observed, cannot remain itself if divorced from Christianity.</P>
<P>	Finally, Loconte is too ready to accept the notion, retailed by non- and anti-
Christians, that Christianity can legitimize itself only by promoting social progress. He 
reminds us that Christians objected to past mistreatment of black Americans and 
ministered to the urban poor. Such service is to be commended, but it ought to be viewed 
primarily as a sign of that obedience that has, as its principal purpose, His praise and 
glory.</P>

<H3>Protestant Consensus</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Amending the Constitution to permit school prayer admittedly is a thornier 
problem for religious conservatives than most of us admit. On balance, I am slowly 
coming around to Loconte's side of the issue. I write, however, to take issue with two of 
his points.</P>
<P>	First, I agree with Loconte's apparent view that state neutrality towards religion 
is, at least in theory, the best course for a representative democracy. In practice, however, 
neutrality has serious flaws.</P>
<P>	Since the Supreme Court got into the school-prayer business back in the 1960s, 
separation of church and state has evolved from neutrality among religions to neutrality 
between religion and secularism. Worse yet, as Loconte recounts, hostility to religion has 
usually been the means by which the latter form of neutrality  has been pursued.</P>
<P>	Loconte apparently believe that one can eradicate hostility towards religion while 
simultaneously retaining the goal of neutrality. I am less sanguine on this score, 
especially if neutrality between religion and secularism remains the goal.</P>
<P>	Ultimately, trying to remain neutral between the claims of religious belief and 
secularism is like trying to serve two masters at the same time. But as Christ taught, 
humans cannot do this: We will love one and despise the other.</P>
<P>	Second, I find it not a little astonishing that a reputable conservative should 
premise so much of his argument on diversity and multiculturalism. As we all know, our 
society faces a growing number of challenges: crime; a growing underclass; rising levels 
of single-parent households; rampant legal and illegal immigration by persons from the 
Third World who do not share the language, religion, or culture of most Americans. It is 
worth remembering, however, that we have been here before.</P>
<P>	As David Frum points out in Dead Right, our country faced similar problems 
during the first two decades of this century. Frum reminds us that our grandparents grew 
up in cities that, like our own, were violent and unruly. A tide of legal and illegal 
immigration was bringing to our shores a horde that did not speak our language, did not 
share our customs, and felt little loyalty to our country. This resulted in an urban 
proletariat that was not only of unprecedented size, but also poor, violent, and apparently 
immune to assimilation. The very definition of what it means to be an American was 
being called into question by a multicultural tidal wave.</P>
<P>	Fortunately, the Progressives of that era were able to institute a set of reforms that 
in fact assimilated virtually all of the new cultures into a single American culture. This 
American culture was enriched by the new immigrants, but not fundamentally changed. It 
was possible only because reformers knew what it meant to be an American. They knew 
America was more than just an idea. They knew that America had a common culture and 
a common heritage. Assimilating new arrivals to that culture could be painful, but it had 
to be done and it was done. A nation that was stronger and richer in both a material and a 
spiritual sense emerged.</P>
<P>	For better or worse, the Protestant Consensus was a key building block of the 
uniquely American culture our parents and grandparents passed down to us. To be sure, 
as Loconte points out, this led some Jews and many Catholics to opt out of certain key 
institutions, especially educational ones. As many scholars have pointed out, however, 
modern American Jews and Catholics have largely assimilated to the Protestant 
Consensus.</P>
<P>	Accordingly, I think it is now fair to be more concerned with the possibility that 
the absence of school prayer will lead evangelicals (and maybe even some Jews and 
Catholics) to opt out of public education than to be concerned that school prayer will 
deter Jews and Catholics from opting in.</P>
<P>	To be sure, as Loconte points out, our country includes a growing array of 
religions (and even more New Age cults)that have not accepted the Protestant Consensus. 
If I am right in believing that the Protestant Consensus has social as well as religious 
significance, and House Speaker Gingrich is right in believing American civilization is in 
grave danger, starting the school day off with a generic Protestant prayer could become 
an important component in restoring the notion of a unified American culture. 
Accordingly, I reject Loconte's conclusion that school prayer is not an appropriate tool of 
civic order. To the contrary, I suspect that restoration of civic order may not be possible 
without some attempt to use the public schools to inculcate the virtues inherent in the 
Protestant Consensus.</P>

<H3>Blurred God</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Joe Loconte's article is both provocative and persuasive. Advocates of officially 
permitted prayer simply neglect today's "profound cultural and religious diversity."</P>
<P>	When I attended public school in York, Pennsylvania, in the 1930s, Americans 
were far more homogenous. Along with the Pledge of Allegiance, we recited verses from 
the Old or New Testament without comment.</P>
<P>	This unchallenged practice did not violate the establishment clause any more than 
etching "In God We Trust" on our coins.</P>
<P>	Ironically, formal prayer in the schools can have the unintended effect of 
trivializing religion. One sassy pupil, exposed to a canned prayer, said he thought of God 
as an "oblong blur."</P>
<P>	Certainly, the schools--public and private--have an obligation to teach about the 
impact of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam on history and culture. And at the very least 
they should acknowledge the fact that the American founders believed in the majesty of 
God and recognized that this nation and every nation stands under divine mercy and 
judgement.</P>
<P>	Parents concerned about secularization and moral decay should direct their energy 
to restoring the vitality of our Judeo-Christian heritage and encouraging loving two-
parent families that honor God and teach their children the difference between right and 
wrong.</P>

<H3>First Freedom Foremost</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Joe Loconte has both misunderstood my views and neglected he fundamental 
rationale for school prayer in his article. He gives only three arguments, what he calls 
"primary arguments," for school prayer.</P>
<P>	First, he says, there is the historical approach: "American society always has been 
religious and public prayers seems an appropriate reflection of the nation's emphasis on 
faith and religious freedom."</P>
<P>	Second, a religious rationale: "Schools and other public institutions have a 
responsibility to acknowledge Deity--."</P>
<P>	Third, school prayer "could help slow the social chaos and spiritual decay that are 
infecting youth culture"--the plea for civil order as he puts it. These may be arguments 
for school prayer, but they are in fact only supporting arguments and not "primary" 
arguments.</P> 
<P>    The fourth, and missing rationale, is the guarantee of religious liberty and 
freedom of religious expression promised in the First Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. This religious liberty rationale is of paramount importance. Loconte 
includes a highly sentimentalized form of this argument in his first suggested rationale for 
school prayer, but I argue that religious liberty is more than an "emphasis" in America, it 
is part of our raison d'&#234 tre. The American experiment, a novus ordo saeclorum, depends 
upon the freely expressed opinions of its people. Free expression includes religious 
expression. Religious expression includes prayer.</P> 
<P>	Loconte is accurate to say that I am among those religious conservatives who 
agree with the Supreme Court's 1962 "ruling banning state-sponsored school prayer--." 
However, I do not  agree, as he implies that "student-led prayers can have a coercive 
effect in the unique environment of public education." As long as these prayers are 
student-initiated, student-sponsored, and student-led, they are no more coercive than 
student-initiated, student-sponsored, and student-led discussions of religious topics at 
recess. Surely Loconte does not believe in a religiously sanitized playground.</P>
<P>	Furthermore, I have said, "I think our society will not survive unless there is a 
broad-based religious commitment, but it is not the responsibility of the government to 
promote it." However, I have also argued that government has the obligation not to 
prohibit the religious commitments or expressions of its citizens. It hardly seems 
promotional for public schools to allow students to pray, as they feel led, without 
disrupting class time. In fact, to prohibit such student prayer, violates First Amendment 
guarantees against such censorship and suppression of religious speech.</P>
<P>	The Christian Life Commission is the religious-liberty agency of the Southern 
Baptist Convention, the nation's largest non-Catholic religious denomination, with over 
15.4 million members in over 38,400 churches. We will oppose state sponsorship of 
school prayer. We will, however, vigorously support religious liberty. The religious 
liberty rationale entails that students of religious faith, or non-religious commitments for 
that matter, should be free to express their religion or non-religion in their classroom. The 
First Amendment's "free exercise" clause demands no less than free exercise.</P>
<P>	Does the religious liberty rationale entail that Christian students may hear the 
prayers of Jewish students, Muslim students, or New Age students? Of course.</P>
<P>	 In a free democracy, we must protect everyone's right to religious expression. 
Neither school officials nor student majorities may pick and choose which religious 
expression to permit or disallow.</P> 
<P>	Prayer goes up, it doesn't come down. That is, students themselves determine the 
content and frequency of prayer, not government or school boards, and an open forum 
means a forum open to all students' religious convictions.</P>
<P>	As Thomas Jefferson once said, "The opinions of men are not the object of civil 
government, not under its jurisdiction."</P>

<H3>Mission Immoral</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	"Reel Politik: Great Conservative Cinema," by Michael Smith (Fall 1994), was 
great, but I thought it missed the mark in a few cases.</P>
<P>	The Mission, I agree, is "a beautiful film." But hardly "on every level." It is both 
philosophically and theologically as liberal as Howard Metzenbaum.</P>
<P>	Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) has penetrated the barrier of dense jungle and 
primitive culture hoping to establish a mission to the savage Guarani Indians. Eventually, 
he converts them and builds a mission in their midst. But to what does he convert them? 
That is the question by which this movie must be judged. For it is upon that gospel that 
this movie is built.</P>
<P>	Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) learns that gospel. He is a mercenary slave 
trader who has killed his own brother in a jealous rage. For six months he has languished 
in a stupor of self-hate and hopelessness. He is beyond redemption--or so he believes. 
But the gospel of Father Gabriel changes his mind. The gospel of the Bible is never 
mentioned to poor Captain Mendoza. The gospel of The Mission is the gospel of "love," 
small "l." Love your fellow man, sacrifice yourself, do good expecting nothing in return. 
And if you aren't sure how to do "good," just keep watching.</P>
<P>	Rodrigo follows Father Gabriel along the tortuous trail to his jungle mission. In 
penance he drags along a large net filled with the armaments of his mercenary days--the 
great burden of past sins. But this is no Pilgrim's Progress. The burden is not lifted. It is 
finally cut away by his own loving submission to his former victims. When he takes the 
Jesuit vow, he is converted not to God but to "love."</P>
<P>	Meanwhile, the jungle commune has been betrayed by cutthroat capitalists, 
cutthroat governments, and the politics of Rome. Father Gabriel determines to defend the 
mission with love (non-violence) alone. Brother Rodrigo chooses instead to fight for 
right. "If might be right, then there's no place for love in the world," Father Gabriel tells 
him. "Maybe so. Maybe so," he then muses. But "if you are right, God will bless you."</P>
<P>	The massacre that follows, however, bespeaks little blessing on Rodrigo's 
decision. He is crushed. Might, to be sure, is depicted as anything but right. It is 
despicable. Therefore, although Father Gabriel is crushed as well, it appears there is a 
place for love in the world. And how is love defined? You must answer the altar call 
actually printed across the closing scene. Take up the continuing struggle in today's Third 
World. Come to a sympathetic alliance with liberation theology, i.e. Marxism. It seems 
no coincidence that radical leftist priest Daniel Berrigan was an influential advisor to the 
producers of this movie, and appears in a cameo role.</P>
<P>	We are left at the end with a smoldering shell of the mission church and the only 
survivors--one canoe filled with Guarani children. They doff their scant clothing 
(vestiges of a culture that betrayed them) and return to the depths of the jungle whence 
they came.</P>
<P>	Their simple faith has been destroyed by the evil fires of imperialism. Their faith 
in God destroyed? No. That isn't faith that can be destroyed by fire. That was not their 
faith. Their faith was a faith of the mission, and the mission is gone. The gospel of The 
Mission leaves them forever lost in their nakedness.</P>
<P>	Thanks for recognizing the importance of philosophical discernment in movie 
viewing. It's a powerful medium.</P>
<P>	May I suggest another go at it sometime? Perhaps you should give attention to 
The Brothers Karamazov, The Outsiders, The Secret of Nimh, Sergeant York, and The 
Trip to Bountiful.</P>

<H3>Take (The Derivative of) 2</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Michael Smith should watch Stand and Deliver again. The hero and his students 
fight with the school administration about having to take a standardized test a second 
time.</P> 
<P>	The students had achieved unusually high scores on the first test, but their 
mistakes were more uniform than was statistically likely. Although, both of these points 
are of considerable mathematical interest, the movie dismisses them as racism.</P>
<P>	The real problem with Stand and Deliver is that it contains no mathematics at all. 
With all of the cinematic resources that might have been used to convey an intuitive grasp 
of calculus to the high school audience, the movie simply perpetuated the taboo against 
any substantial intellectual content in a movie. There was romantic interest, the struggle 
against racism, Latino pride, but no calculus.</P>

<H3>"Life" Support</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I found mildly amusing Michael Smith's attempts to classify the movies he 
reviewed as conservative, but I cannot sit idly by and allow him to expropriate Frank 
Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, one of the greatest American liberal films ever made.</P>
<P>	Capra was a liberal Democrat and a devout Catholic, and his films portray his 
strongly felt political and spiritual values quite clearly. One of Capra's greatest populist 
heroes is George Bailey, the ultimate liberal activist, who repeatedly forgoes the material 
life (and opportunities to seek his fortune) to ensure that the "little guy" gets a chance to 
own his own home.</P> 
<P>	There was not a lot of money in running a small-town savings and loan, but 
Bailey sticks around to prevent the quintessential wealthy, greedy, heartless 
Republican,Old Man Potter, from shafting the poor, working men of Bedford Falls.</P>
<P>	Potter would certainly have been a Reagan Republican and member of the RNC's 
Team 100, screaming for low taxes on the rich, and complete deregulation of everything 
to increase his fortune at the expense of the common man.</P> 
<P>	At the same time, he would insist publicly that it was for the poor's own good, 
and that it would all somehow trickle down. Maybe he would have believed his own self-
serving rhetoric.</P>
<P>	As for Capra's religious message, It's a Wonderful Life, like many of Capra's 
films, is an allegorical retelling of the story of Jesus. Bailey forgoes the material world, 
continually sacrificing his own chances for comfortable living, to fight for the meek and 
the downtrodden. He goes through a symbolic crucifixion on behalf of the people (and 
his own people seem to reject him), and then is symbolically resurrected (Capra always 
preferred Christmas over Easter for his resurrections; see Meet John Doe).</P>
<P>	Notwithstanding conservative attempts to classify Christian values as 
conservative, Capra's religious views and interpretations of Jesus, comported with his 
liberalism. To Capra, Christianity was about humility, generosity, love, and caring for the 
working-class poor who shall inherit the earth.</P>
<P>	This was quite different than the conservative brand of religion used to justify 
capital punishment, anti-civil rights battles, archaic notions about a "woman's place," 
indoctrination by public school prayer, discrimination against gays, hate-mongering 
against immigrants and minorities, low taxes on the wealthy, and undermining of public 
education through private school vouchers.</P>
<P>	So if a conservative wishes to fallaciously label most of America's great movies 
conservative, many of us will have a good chuckle.  But don't mess with Frank Capra, 
Mr. Smith, because you're not the type he would have sent to Washington.</P>

<H3>Out of Focus</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I was much amused by the irony of the inclusion of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus in 
the article on great conservative cinema.</P>
<P>	Your writer is obviously too young to recall the controversy that surrounded the 
making of that film, which was similar in scope to that over The Last Temptation of 
Christ or Oliver Stone's JFK.</P>
<P>	Both the author of the original "Spartacus" historical novel, Howard Fast, and the 
screenwriter who adapted it for film, Dalton Trumbo, had been severely red-baited by the 
ignorant conservatives of their time; Trumbo in fact even lost several years of his life by 
being imprisoned by the 1950s conservatives' version of The Holy Inquisition, the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities for refusing to testify under oath about his 
affiliations with communists. When Kirk Douglas bravely stood by Trumbo by selecting 
him to adapt the script for Spartacus upon his release from prison, right-wing groups 
called the entire project a communist plot.</P>
<P>	Had your magazine been in existence at the time, you would surely have been 
among the small-minded conservatives crying for the film's suppression.</P>
<P>	So choose: was the HUAC truly an out-of-control witch-hunt that destroyed the 
lives and careers of innocent people, as the liberals assert, or was one of your great 
conservative films actually penned by a Communist?</P>

<H3>Problematic Past</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I believe that Barbara von der Heydt in "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness" (Fall 
1994) has identified some of the real problems in Russia today. As she correctly says, 
many of them have their origins in the social and political distortions brought about by 
almost four generations of Soviet rule.</P>
<P>	Among such problems were the necessity for public lying and hypocrisy 
accompanied by deliberate distortions of historical facts (Aleksander Solzhenitsyn called 
it "the culture of the lie") and a deeply flawed definition of civic responsibility, which 
claimed to foster a benevolent "collectivism," but actually undermined any possibility of 
a genuinely collective moral vision.</P>
<P>	Other problems include a crude, dehumanizing version of atheism which 
attempted to head off any deeply considered and sincerely felt religious notions of God. 
The only divinity was supposed to be a group of leaders whose only motivation turned 
out to be a greedy and self-serving attachment to wealth and power. Their government led 
to conditions which could, but will not inevitably, produce a hideous Zhirinovsky-like 
fascism in the near future.</P>
<P>	I think her analysis could use further thinking along the following lines: In spite 
of Soviet intentions, the previous regime did not succeed in producing a genuinely atheist 
society, as opposed to the heavily propagandized Potemkin Village of Soviet-sponsored 
atheism. Such people as Solzhenitsyn, the martyred Aleksander Men, Valery  Borshchov, 
and many others are paradoxical, but natural, products of the Soviet Regime, under which 
they grew up, heroically battling against cruel suppression.</P>
<P>	The Russian people, and other nationalities in the USSR, did not lose God, 
contrary to the assertions both of communist apparatchiki and some Western 
proselytizers. Russian education, to which von der Heydt only briefly alludes, is presently 
taking gigantic steps toward a program which has at least a realistic possibility of opening 
the way toward a better Russian society.</P>
<P>	Alcoholism, at least in certain important Russian social sectors, is not going up, 
but down: You can no longer retain your job if you come to work drunk, and significant 
numbers of people have found meaningful work which pulls them away from heavy 
drinking. There are many kind of new enterprises and institutions attracting the energetic 
enthusiasm of people who have for years and even decades eagerly anticipated this 
opportunity.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt is absolutely right when she says it is our real moral duty to help 
them in ways both sacred and secular. Such help must be given adroitly, with real 
sensitivity to Russian feelings and real knowledge of Russian and Soviet history and 
culture.</P>

<H3>Band AID</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	In contrast to the shallow reporting which characterizes so many of the 
commentaries about events in Russia written by Western journalists and academics, 
Barbara von der Heydt's essay is an insightful analysis. After four years of involvement 
with Russian educators and frequent contact with many of the "moral renewers" 
described in her article, I can affirm von der Heydt's assessment that "without cultural 
regeneration, neither economic nor political reform will take root and bear fruit."</P>
<P>	Not only is there a need for bridges to be built between those committed to 
economic and political reform in Russia and the leaders of moral renewal, but von der 
Heydt's essay also makes clear that there is a need for a major reassessment of U.S. 
foreign aid currently contributes to the problems.</P>
<P>	I still have not forgotten an observation made to me two years ago by a leading 
Agency for International Development official responsible for assistance to the "Newly 
Independent States." He said "AID has no interest in educational reform in Russia--we 
are only interested in short-term political fixes."</P>
<P>	Teaching Russians the techniques of democratic politics and the free market 
without a serious discussion of the moral and ethical foundations upon which these 
systems are grounded makes no sense and is a waste of resources. Thoughtful Russians 
are asking for counsel on the deeper questions of moral and spiritual renewal; many 
Russian intellectual leaders recognize the moral vacuum left by the collapse of Marxism-
Leninism. What are we doing to strengthen them as they attempt to build a "new Russia"?</P>
<P>	In Russian higher education, there is an unprecedented openness to reform. There 
is a strong desire to "humanize" issues. There is also a great interest in character 
development, which will prepare students to be citizens of a new democratic Russia. The 
effort, in partnership with Russians, to establish the Russian-American Christian 
University in Moscow, the first Christian liberal-arts university in Russia's history, is 
only one sign of the new opportunities that now exist. I hope that we are perceptive 
enough to understand this as we follow developments in Russia, aided by insightful 
observers such as von der Heydt.</P>

<H3>Right on Reds</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	As a 40-year student of Soviet communism, I certainly agree with Barbara von der 
Heydt's grim article and her conclusion that "freedom cannot take root without moral 
reform."</P>
<P>	However, I believe that more emphasis should be placed on the chief cause of the 
spiritual wilderness, namely, the 77-year existence of the communist system imposed on 
the Russians as well as other nationalities in the former Soviet Union by party-state 
terrorist control.</P>
<P>	It should be stressed that communism was not a product of the "Russian soul," but 
an international ideology which took over Russia in the 1917 October Revolution. After 
that time the GULAG, chief administration of concentration camps, was the powerful 
terrorist weapon of communist morality, which allowed the nomenklatura to do anything 
necessary to build and spread the communist system in the international arena.</P>
<P>	In the Soviet Union alone, about 60 million people lost their lives in the process 
of building a communist society. Those who have survived have suffered greatly both 
intellectually and morally, and it will take years for them to recover.</P>
<P>	The long existence of the Soviet Union and other communist-controlled states was 
facilitated, it should be admitted, by the ignorance and cynicism of many Western 
democratic governments. Not only did they grant diplomatic recognition to communist-
controlled states which were not nation-states under international law, but they also 
subsidized and thus prolonged their life by economic and trade relations and technology 
transfers. Many experts believe now that without those subsidies the economic collapse 
of the communist-controlled states would have come much earlier.</P>
<P>	The first American president since Herbert Hoover who refused to deal with the 
Soviet Union as a conventional great power--a mirror-image of the United States--was 
Ronald Reagan, who called it the "Evil Empire" and attacked its communist morality.</P>
<P>	His policy of economic and military pressure was obviously a major cause of 
Soviet collapse. It was not containment or detente, but Reagan's "peace through strength" 
policy that facilitated his early intentions to eliminate the communist threat.</P>

<H3>Bully Pulpit?</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I find the comment by Barbara von der Heydt that the "Russian Orthodox Church 
is in a poor position to meet the Russian people's spiritual hunger," offensive, arrogant, 
and more than a little disingenuous. To begin with, does Von der Heydt see anything in 
the "Christian West" that is better? Does she promote Protestantism and, if so, which one 
of the thousands of denominations does she suggest? Certainly not the large, "main-line" 
churches that have embraced abortion, homosexual advocacy, and hosts of other social 
evils while abandoning virtually all of traditional Christian beliefs.</P>
<P>	And what hope is there in "fundamental" Protestantism? For one thing, they 
would, in total ignorance of the Russian culture and people, try to efface every vestige of 
Orthodoxy just as surely as did the Communists since they interpret it as being either 
papist or pagan. Furthermore, most fundamentalist Protestants have little knowledge and 
less understanding of Christian history prior to the Reformation and tend to see 
everything in light of that historic event. Yet, as each group disagrees with its fellows and 
feels free to go off and start still another "denomination," we see proof that the abiding 
and binding truth of Christianity does not reside within this religious movement, however 
sincere the individual believer.</P>
<P>	And what about Roman Catholicism? The Catholic Church of Western Europe 
and the United States is often no better than main-line Protestantism.</P>
<P>	While it is true that there are troubles in the Church in Russia, Westerners must 
remember that Orthodoxy has provided more Christian martyrs in the last 70 years than 
there had been in the previous two millenia. Bishops, priests, monks, nuns, and lay people 
died in the tens of millions. And still, the Church survived, her people willing to risk 
torture, imprisonment, and death to be a part and make their children part of her.</P>
<P>	Yes, there are still KGB agents in the Russian Orthodox Church, but Western 
churches have also been infiltrated and, in many cases, completely overwhelmed by a 
host of anti-Christian philosophies and personages.</P>
<P>	Politically compromised Orthodox priests and bishops constitute far less of a 
danger than do the Bishop Spongs, Jimmy Swaggarts and Father Foxes in the West. The 
Orthodox Church, steadfast and unchanged since the 4th century, has needed no 
Reformation nor does she changes her doctrines to satisfy the "politically correct." She 
endures despite infiltration and savage persecution, while most of the "churches" in the 
West have capitulated without a shot being fired or a life being lost in defense of the 
Faith.</P>

<H3>Bear With It</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Although we knew that the euphoria many of us experienced when Soviet 
communism collapsed would not last, we could scarcely brace ourselves sufficiently 
against the hammerings of ensuing events. Russia's progress out of the abyss is painfully 
halting, at best. So we find ourselves in a state of emphatic ambivalence, pulled between 
the poles of despair and hope. Our reservations are encapsulated in Barbara von der 
Heydt's "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness." Negative comments outweigh positive ones two 
to one. Yet affirmation prevails by the end, and properly so, I think.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt is of course correct that moral renewal is the sine qua non for the 
political and economic reforms required to make of devastated Russia a normal society.</P>
<P>	Policy wonks above all others need to understand that, in a moral vacuum, 
programmatic proposals are futile. As Michael Novak remarked, "The free society is 
moral, or not at all." But what do we see in Moscow? Old apparatchiki thrive as new 
businessmen. Power-hungry ideologues of extreme Left and extreme Right combine to 
throttle reform efforts. Zhirinovsky and company co-opt the beautiful word "patriot." In 
short, Dostoevsky's The Devils remains as prophetic as ever.</P>
<P>	What Russia most needs now is to come to terms with its atrocity-riddled past in a 
spirit of repentance, both personal and national. For a long-Christian nation, the likeliest 
route to catharsis is religious revival.</P>
<P>	That one is underway we do not know from the Western press. Here, too, von der 
Heydt helps us, with her informative book, Candles Behind the Wall. Into the confusion 
enters Solzhenitsyn, whom von der Heydt shrewdly highlights. Now with his own 
television program, he is the primary messenger of Russian repentance. As in America for 
two decades, so in Russia today, we will underestimate his appeal the populace if we 
listen only to the intellectuals.</P>
<P>	Who knows what rough beast slouches toward a Russian Bethlehem to be born? 
For the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren, this story will be one of great drama 
and world-historical importance.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt magnificently shows us how to approach our reading of it.</P>

<H3>Barbara von der Heydt responds:</H3>
<UL><P>	Events in Chechnya have illustrated that the crisis in Russia is indeed a moral one 
which has political consequences. The newborn democracy in Russia may be strangled in 
its infancy. Russian reformers fear for the future of the country. For example, Duma 
members Valery Borschov and Gleb Yakunin, who were in Chechnya in January to 
monitor the invasion, have soundly condemned the action, and are perplexed at the 
slowness of the West to do the same.</P>
<P>	They say the door to freedom in Russia that swung open dramatically in 1991 
may be swinging closed already.</P>
<P>	It is necessary to act now to encourage the few lights of moral, spiritual and 
intellectual renewal in Russia which illuminate the darkening landscape. The cells of civil 
society that have sprung up in Russia need to put down roots and grow. Their success, or 
lack of it, may well determine what era will follow Yeltsin.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, the kind of change in Russia which is urgently ended, as confirmed 
by Edward Ericson, cannot be brought about with a "quick fix," the kind sought by AID 
officers John Bernbaum rightly condemned as short-sighted.</P>
<P>	The Russian-American Christian University which Bernbaum is co-founding is 
exactly the kind of long-term investment needed to shape the intellectual and moral 
climate.</P> 
<P>	Irwin Weil correctly pointed out that there are a number of efforts underway in 
Russian education aimed at revitalizing the nation. Aleksander Abramov's project to 
rewrite the textbooks for the Russian school system to include moral teachings has 
produced many manuscripts already, but funding is still needed from the West to print the 
books. The urgency of such a project is evident to anyone who understands the power of 
ideas.</P>
<P>	The conclusions presented in "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness" are those of 
Russians, many of whom I have known for some years.</P>
<P>	The Orthodox cited say there is a need for renewal among their own ranks. The 
remarks of Valerie Protopapas are evidence of the inability of some Orthodox to 
acknowledge the truth of Romans 3:23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of 
God." We are all found wanting: that means Protestants, Catholics, and every stripe of 
believer, including Orthodox. Obviously the Western churches are in a state of need as 
well. Every church is flawed and in need of forgiveness, as is every person, myself 
included.</P>
<P>	In a presentation in Moscow this past December Zoya Krakhmalnikova, a devout 
Russian Orthodox author who was jailed in the 1980s for her writings, described three 
acute ailments of her country: "The hatred that destroyed the soul of Russia," resurgent 
nationalism, and the "illness of the church which is an absolute catastrophe for our 
country." She calls for repentance and renewal. Russian Orthodox priest Father 
Alexander Borisov, in his recently released book The Fields are Ripe, takes the church he 
loves to task. "It's a paradox, but our church had preached not Jesus Christ but more 
itself, its own regulations, legends, icons, rituals, chanting and so on." Father Alexander 
has been attacked publicly by elements of the Orthodox Church as a "heretic" for such 
utterances.</P>
<P>	The main issue is not the church, but the character of Russia. Recent events 
indicate that even democratic-minded reformers may opt for untruth and abuse of force, 
in the absence of a moral code that prohibits them.</P> 
<P>	Until the leadership of Russia is willing to acknowledge a power higher than its 
own, and act accordingly, the country will continue to flounder on the shoals of self-
interest, corruption, and chaos.</P></UL>

<H3>End of the Line</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Sadly, Stephen Glass's article "Yes We Kenosha" (Fall 1994) demonstrates the 
kind of facile grand-standing that so often undermines the credibility of conservative 
policy positions. </P>
<P>	Yes, the "Kenosha miracle," such as it is, has brought stability to the economy of 
southeastern Wisconsin. Credit must go to local and state officials who worked to bring 
new businesses into the area; credit must also go to workers who bounced back from 
what was for many a deep personal loss. </P>
<P>	That the complex drama of a community in transition can be reduced by Glass to 
trite sloganeering--e.g. "Doomsayers Silenced," "A Victory for the Market"--should 
give pause to serious students of democracy.</P>
<P>	Glass would have us believe that because Kenosha prospered in the aftermath of 
the plant closing, it provides "a testimony to the resiliency of market capitalism."</P> 
<P>	Yet he tell you nothing of events that led up to the closing, nothing of the new 
assembly plant AMC was preparing to build in Kenosha, nothing of Chrysler's 
commitment to produce cars in Kenosha for three to five years after acquiring AMC (the 
closing came within less than a year), nothing of the betrayal workers felt at the hands of 
their elected representatives.</P>
<P>	Glass praises Governor Tommy Thompson's tax policies, but fails to mention that 
he actively supported a state-sponsored lawsuit against Chrysler, as did local politicians 
during their election campaigns.</P>
<P>	Quoting me out of context, Glass suggests that I "can't comprehend" why people 
welcomed the shutdown, yet neglects to say that a major portion of my book, The End of 
the Line: Lost Jobs, New Lives in Postindustrial America, is devoted to understanding 
this point of view. Kenosha's uneven development--which benefits some, but not 
others--was achieved at the expense of democratic ideals.</P> 
<P>	Do the ends justify any means?</P>
<P><B>Kathryn Marie Dudley</B><BR>

<H3>Stephen Glass responds:</H3>
<UL><P>	I welcome Kathryn Marie Dudley's acknowledgement that the "Kenosha Miracle" 
has brought stability to southeastern Wisconsin's economy. While her 200-page book 
details the pain of autoworkers and their children in the wake of the plant closing, she 
neglects to mention the town's post-Chrysler renaissance.</P>
<P>	Since the plant closed in December 1988, the unemployment rate has averaged 5.7 
percent, less than half the mean of 11.6 percent during the five years preceding the 
shutdown. Average annual wages have increased nearly $2,000 per person and 33 percent 
more employers now operate in the Kenosha area. Moreover, housing sales more than 
doubled, and although homes used to linger on the market for months, they now usually 
sell within 90 days.</P> 
<P>	Kenosha is a tribute to low taxes and deregulation; it demonstrates the beauty of 
American capitalism and the entrepreneurial spirit.</P></UL>

<h2><i>Convention Policy Watch<br>
Day 1</I></h2><br>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
Monday,  August 12, 1996
</center>
<P>
     Day 1 at the Republican National Convention, and I can assure you that there is a flurry of activity in and around the floor, around San Diego, and at just about every event hosting Members of Congress, state delegations, a variety of Governors, and every other VIP. What's interesting is seeing events unfold, and
then watching the convention coverage to see what the "spin" happens to be... Yesterday when I visited
with Vice President Quayle and other former colleagues, I learned that the "spin" in which the media had
the most interest was what happens now to VP Quayle now that Jack Kemp is the Republican VP
candidate. The question was: Does Quayle have a future as President? Has he been supplanted as the
future contender of the Republican Party? 
<p>
Perhaps the media should stop trying to find examples of future friction among the Republicans and focus on the issues the Republicans are trying to discuss -- hope, opportunity and economic prosperity for all Americans Any thoughts? I'll be back tomorrow to follow up.

<h2><i>How Has Republican Stewardship Changed the Way Washington Works?</i></h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a></b>
</center>
<P><font size="+1">A</font>fter roughly 40 years of Democrat control of Congress, how has the Republican stewardship changed the way Washington works?  You be the judge.  Thus far ...
<p><ul>
<li>	Over <b>270 federal programs have been eliminated</b> during this budget session -- at a <b>savings to taxpayers of $23 billion</b> for 1995.
<p>
<li>	<b>30 of 39 federal agencies</b> had <b>smaller staffs</b> as a result of Congressional action.  
<p>
<li>	Projections for 1996 indicate that we now have the <b>lowest federal deficit in 14 years.</b>
<p>
<li>	The <b>first-ever U.S. employee buyout</b> will occur this year in July.  The function currently performed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to do background investigations for federal workers will now be turned over to those who do the job on a contract basis.
<p>
<li>	The budget for the <b>National Endowment for the Arts</b> has been <b>cut by 39%</b> over last year's budget.  In January, the agency laid off 85 workers.
<p>
<li>	The budget for the <b>National Endowment for Humanities</b> was <b>reduced by 35%</b> -- more than under Ronald Reagan.
<p>
<li>	<b>Four major privatization efforts have been approved</b> -- the last time this was tried only two were approved.
</ul><P>
	The Minority Leadership in the US House and Senate is trying to persuade the American people that this is a "do-nothing" Republican Congress.  In my opinion, they certainly are doing something, in fact, many things.  The defenders of the old status-quo cannot sit back on their laurels anymore.  They have to have real and honest debate now about the issues before them.  Isn't it nice to know they are earning an honest dollar?

<title> Feminism at its Finest.... Heritage</title>

<h2><i>Feminism at its Finest....</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>June, 1996</center><P>
	On Tuesday <b>Betty Friedan</b> participated in an interesting panel discussion entitled "The Collapse of Marriage" at ... believe it or not ... the Heritage Foundation! Friedan, the co-founder of the National Organization of Women, the National Women's Political Caucus, and NARAL, gained national prominence after the 1963 publication of her book <I>The Feminine Mystique</I>.  She is currently a Guest Scholar at the Wilson International Center, and her remarks here at Heritage left us with some notable quotables that show that conservatives were right about marriage and family after all.
<p>	
She said....
<p><ul>
<li>"We made a mistake with no fault divorce."  There are unexpected economic consequences and decreases in living standards for women and children.<p>

<li>We have conducted "enough studies that show that divorce is not good for kids."<p>
<li>In a seminar she currently is teaching she claims, "You are not a real man if you have kids and don't take care of them."
<p></ul>
	According to Friedan, she now concentrates on reframing family values in light of economic realities.  Isn't it nice to see another advocate jumping on Dan Quayle's family values' bandwagon?  She thinks we should look at the economic consequences of government policy for women and children -- a step in the "right" direction.  Did you ever think one of the founders of the modern feminist movement would make such an about face?  And at Heritage?

<title>The Presidential Race and the Role of the First Lady - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><img src="/heritage/miller.gif" align=left></a>[Go to the <A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/wgw-forum/ac/dispatch.cgi/thf-cyber/">Forum</A>][<a href="/townhall/wgw-forum/ac/dispatch.cgi/_user/addForm/short">Register</A> -- Free!]

<h2><i>THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND THE ROLE OF THE FIRST LADY</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Both Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton represent a new kind of First Lady - independent, successful, and ambitious.   Laura Blumenfeld of the <I>Washington Post</I> claims that the traditional First Lady role is to stay out of politics, promote do-good projects, and smile.  But, that was then and this is now.  Hillary Clinton's active role was highlighted nationally when her "partner" named her head of the Health Care Task Force - at a cost to taxpayers of $14 million.  On the other hand, Elizabeth Dole intends to raise some $60 <b>billion</b> dollars for charitable organizations.  This is quite a difference from past First Ladies, and quite a contrast between the two front-running contenders.
<P>
	According to Representative Scott Klug (R-WI), the role of the First Lady will be "redefined in the next few years."  He's right. Barbara Bush was the last of a generation - the archetype of the grandmotherly, sophisticated hostess is gone.  She was a very strong lady, but was only interested in promoting her husband.  Her polls were always high because she avoided partisan politics, and issue debate.  Enter Hillary!
<P>	
On the campaign trail in 1992, Bill Clinton quipped "buy one, get one free."  Hillary was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school, selected graduation speaker at Wellesley, and graduated from Yale Law School.  She served as a partner in the now infamous Rose Law Firm as well as held countless board positions from Wal-Mart to the Children's Defense Fund.
<p>
	Hillary's role model as First Lady is (not surprisingly) Eleanor Roosevelt.  But Hillary has gone beyond Eleanor's "pet" issues; she affects day-to-day policy and strategy.  She moved her office from the ceremonial East Wing to the working West Wing, and when Bill Clinton wanted Health Care reform, he turned to Hillary.
<P>	
But what is known of Mrs. Dole?  Here's a sampling of her personality and background.  Now, you can judge which type of First Lady you'd like at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>	
Elizabeth Dole is, as some say, the finest candidate in the race for President this year.  Many pundits have asked why she is not running herself instead of the Senate Majority Leader. At his victory rallies, she interacts exceptionally well with the crowd practically pushing him to follow her lead.  Her credentials are very impressive and speak for themselves.
<p>
	She can speak energetically and passionately about Bob's issues without any prompting or notes.  She has a warmth and southern charm to her that earned her the nickname "Sugar Lips" during the Reagan Administration.  In a 1983 <I>Business Week</I> article, Elizabeth Dole was compared to Jackie Kennedy as "a glamorous, feminine presence draped on a frame of steel." 
<p>
	As for her career, she has served as a Federal Trade Commissioner, the Secretary of Labor under Reagan,  the Secretary of Transportation under Bush, and is currently the President of the American Red Cross.  She has taken a leave of absence from the Red Cross to campaign for her husband.  When she did that in 1988, Peter Jennings declared that one of America's finest women in government was leaving.  
<p>
	Elizabeth intends to continue working as First Lady - she would be the first First Lady to keep a career.  Her answer to this country's problems is community and charitable organization, not bureaucratic task-forces.
<P>
	She has told <I>Ladies Home Journal</I> that she will lead a move to increase giving to churches, non-profits, and other charitable organizations by one percent, which translates into $62 billion dollars more going to those who are actually solving America's problems.  
<p>
	Both women represent the future of the First Lady; they are career-oriented and bright.  They still are devoted to their husbands, and to a large degree sacrifice their own potential successes for their men.  Both also have been accused of being the brains, the heart, or the masterminds behind their husbands' career.  Although they are, and would be, "working" First Ladies, Hillary is unpopular.  Liddy is not.
<p>
	The First Lady now represents America's working women who have to balance home, family, work, and career.  Hillary broke the mold, but who will get to expand and develop the role for the next four years?  What do you think?  Has Hillary set a good standard for those to come?  Has she improved or hurt the image of the First Lady?

<h2><i>TIME TO TEACH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A LESSON</I></h2>
	<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Last week, 40 of the nation's governors met in Palisades, NY to discuss our educational system for the first time in seven years.  Louis Gerstner, the chairman of IBM, and host of the summit declared, "Our educational system is broken."  And education today is an issue on the minds of voters.  According to a recent Gallup poll, education is the top priority voters have in choosing whether or not to support a candidate.  
<p>
	The summit was intended to push higher standards for core subjects from within the states, but the bigger issue that the governor's are not discussing is the future of the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.
<p>	All of the GOP candidates for President last fall supported the elimination of the Department of Education.  From Dole to Gramm to Buchanan to former Secretary of Education Alexander, the GOP insisted that education was the responsibility of parents and localities.  Here are some interesting historical points about the evolution and role of the Department of Education -- and reasons why its elimination is on Congress' radar screen.
	<P>
<b>...IN THE BEGINNING</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> was created in 1979 not long after another useless department, the Department of Energy.  Speaker Tip O'Neill demanded "We need a <b>special</b> department of Education."  He then got his wish, but has it worked?  Has our educational system improved?</ul>
	<p>
<b>RESULTS?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1978, 8% of 8th graders failed to complete high school.  Enter the DOE.  Just in the nick of time, too.  In 1992, that percentage has <b>increased</b> to 12.
	</ul><p>
<b>	RED TAPE ELIMINATION?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Representative Frank Horten (R-NY) stated, "It  [The DOE] does not create a new education bureaucracy.  In fact, it reduces bureaucracy."  Hold on, creating a cabinet department makes less red tape?  According to the Tax Foundation, the Department of Education spends out over 350 million dollars a year for  <b>internal management</b> alone.
</ul><p>
<b>	LOVE HURTS</b>
<p><ul>
<li>But you and I on the outside cannot see the good that results from the day-to-day operation of insiders within the department.  Not exactly.  The two most prominent former Secretaries of Education, Bill Bennett, and Lamar Alexander, have testified in front of Congress that the DOE produces, "bad ideas, harmful practices, needless expenditures, obsolete programs, and dysfunctional regulation."</ul><p>
	
<b>MICROMANAGEMENT FROM BIG BROTHER</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Virginia Governor George Allen claims that, "our recent experience suggests that concerns about federal bureaucratic interference cannot be lightly dismissed."  He is referring to a lawsuit that he is involved in against the Department of Education.  The lawsuit hinges around whether or not a local school can expel a "special" student with excessive behavioral problems.
	</ul><p>
<b>ALERT THE PRESS: SCHROEDER AGREES WITH US</b>
<p><ul>
<li>This issue has never been a conservative/liberal coalition-builder, but even Pat Schroeder claims, "The Department of Education will meddle in <b>everything</b>."  And it has Ohio Governor George Voinovich claims the Department of Education's management is "highly prescriptive and heavily regulated."  
</ul><p>
<b>	STRINGS-ATTACHED MONEY</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The claim is that the feds do so much for education that they have a right to interfere with you idea of how your children should be educated - after all, aren't the feds paying the bills?  Try again.  According to the <I>National Journal</I>, however, <b>less than 10%</b> of education money comes from the federal government.  The Department of Education's programs are as former Rep. Bob Michel said so "irrelevant to the needs of American children," that school districts in a quarter of the states have refused federal funds to avoid implementing federal mandates, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy. Governor Allen suspects that the US government costs local schools more in regulation than it spends on the schools.
	</ul><p>
	The Department of Education stands in the way of real education reform and school choice.  Bob Dole says, "Put parents back in charge of our schools."  He's right about this.  According to Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, education is "a local issue, and it must remain a local issue."  For those of you who still like the DOE, could you answer a question that former Senator S.I. Hayakawa asked at the inception of the DOE.  "How [does] this department make our children literate?"  It does not.

<h2><i>The Energizer Secretary: She keeps going, and going...</h2></i>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996


</CENTER>

<P>

	Hazel O'Leary has been embroiled in scandal after scandal since she became Secretary of the <a href="http://www.doe.gov">Department of Energy</a> under President Clinton, but it may finally catch up with her as a <a href="http://www.house.gov/commerce/o&i.htm">House Commerce subcommittee</a> begins to expand its probe of O'Leary's activities as Secretary.<p>
	I hope to give you a quick run-down on some of the allegations against Madame Secretary, but it is by no means a complete list, as Representative Joe Barton (R-TX)  has said, "the more information we obtain, the more potential problems we appear to be uncovering." <p>
	<b>The so-called Mission of The Department of Energy</b> (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1061.html">Backgrounder 1061</a>, "How to Close Down the Department of Energy")<p>
<ul>
<li> Since the Department was created in 1977, it has struggled to find its proper role or mission after the initial energy crisis of the '70's.<p>
<li>Representative Joe Barton does not &quot;really see a mission for the DOE&quot;<p>
</ul>
                                <b>Travel: Around the World in 130 Days</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary has spent over <b>130 days abroad</b> on 16 trips.
<p>
<li> On two of those trips, she was accompanied by over 50 aides, on another by 48 aides -- well over the number taken by previous Secretaries of Energy or even Secretaries of State!<p>
<li> Her four main missions have cost the taxpayers $2.6 million<p>
<li> She has upgraded from business to first class on 9 flights, and also made use of Madonna's favorite charter plane, the MGM Grand, on three occasions - when cheaper airfare was available.<p>
<li> O'Leary caused dismay last year when she arrived at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency with 38 aides -- not exactly &quot;fiscal austerity.&quot; -- previous Secretaries have taken 2 or 3 aides to similar meetings.<p>
<li> O'Leary claims that these trips brought in $27.7 billion dollars in new business, yet  Rep. Barton has said &quot;we cannot document a single case where the trip itself resulted in a contract that would not have been signed otherwise.&quot;
</ul>	
                                           <p>
<b> O'Leary's Media Consultant</b><p>
<ul>
<li>The DOE spent some $46,000 on a of media coverage study by Carmen International.  The result was a ranking of journalists and coverage of the DOE -- it was accused of being an &quot;enemies list&quot;.<p>
</ul>
<b>	The Department of Energy's New Logo</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary spent over $10,000 in a search for a trendier design for the DOE logo according to <i>Time</i> magazine.  She decided however not to make the move after she found out the cost would be over $1.7 million for the switch -- Hazel O'Leary, the poster child of financial restraint.<p>
</ul>
<p>	
            <b>  O'Leary Takes on the Military</b><p><ul>
<li>Going against a Cold War tradition, O'Leary released the location of over 111.4 metric tons of plutonium that was until now considered to be of extreme national security importance<p></ul>
<p><b>	Friends in Low Places</b><p>
<ul>
<li>O'Leary has also gotten in trouble according to the National Journal for overpaying a department ombudsman who happened to be a personal friend
</ul>
There have been Secretaries in every Cabinet embroiled in some sort of scandal, but the Clinton cabinet claimed to be different. Yet Agriculture's Secretary Espy and Treasury's Deputy Secretary Roger Altman are already gone and O'Leary and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown are under heavy fire.  O'Leary said it best herself &quot;sometimes we have to ... come to work as if you did not need a job.&quot;  Well for your sake, I hope you don't.<p>

<h3>The Non-Farmer's Guide to Agriculture Reform</h3>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996</center><p>Both houses of Congress have passed legislation, dubbed the Freedom to Farm Act, that would open up the American agricultural market by eliminating governmental interference.  The two versions of the bill will now go to a conference committee.  But what exactly is involved in this legislation and what needs to be changed in the conference committee?
<p>
<b>Why do we need Agriculture reform?</b> 
<p><ul>
<li>To take advantage of the substantially lower trade barriers GATT has created -  a new marketplace of 6 billion people.
<p>
<li>To make agricultural markets respond to the demand of the marketplace, not the demand of central government planning
<p>
<li>To breath new life into the rural economy and agricultural infrastructure
<p>
<li>To take advantage of our natural resource edge, and use all productive land to our nation's economic benefit 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/bg1002.html">Backgrounder 1002</a>, "Freeing U.S. Agriculture to Take Advantage of the New Global Markets" for more information.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What's so wrong with the <b>current system?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The current system removes 15% of US acreage from production - if used that acreage could add $8 billion to gross farm income according to a 1994 report by the National Grain and Feed Foundation.
<p>
<li>American government-inflated prices make American exports the last products to be bought -- the "residual supplier."
<p>
<li>Restrictive agricultural policy during the 1980's watched worldwide consumption go up from 3.258 billion metric tons to 3.815 billion metric tons from 1982 to 1990.  Yet US exports went down from .187 billion metric tons to .176 during that same time.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What is the difference between the <b>House HR 2854</b> and <b>Senate S 1541?</b> See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">Issue Bulletin 221</a>, "Agriculture Reform, Can House Succeed Where Senate Failed?"
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; House Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) called this legislation the mark of a "new direction"
<p>
<b>BOTH:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Replace subsidies for wheat, grains, cotton, and rice with fixed declining payments through 2002<p>
<li>Eliminate the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) -  a program that along with the CRP removes 15% of all US farmland acreage from production.
<li>Put agriculture on a market orientated system
<p>
<li>Reauthorize the sugar and peanut provisions<p>
<li>Eliminate Farmer-Owned Reserve, which currently allows the government to control large stocks of surplus grain and dump them on the market in order to drive down commodities prices.<p>
<li>Allow farmers the freedom to decide what, where, and how to plant
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>House bill</b> differs in that it:
<p><ul>
<li>Creates a commission to study future role of government in agriculture<p>
<li>Includes $200 million in cleanup for the Everglades -- thanks to Speaker Gingrich
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>Senate bill</b> differs in that it:
<ul><p>
<li>Includes food stamp provision<p>
<li>Provides 300 million dollars in rural development<p>
<li>Returns to current law in 7 years without further action
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Why is agricultural reform a priority?
<p><ul>
<li>Two million farmers are currently without federal guidelines as planting season starts.  Farmers do not know if they can plant what they wish or what the government wishes.<p>
<li>Farm policy will not be reassessed for another 4 to 5 years which would put us at a further disadvantage with other GATT nations
</ul><p>
What else should be included in the legislation?
<p><ul>
<li>A deep cut in CRP, which is only capped in both proposals.  CRP is the Conservation Reserve Program that was authorized in 1985.  The program is intended to remove land that is highly erodible from production by renting it from farmers for ten years.  But 22 out of the 36 million acres in CRP today are considered to be among the highest classes of land.  Only 4% of the land actually qualifies as highly erodible.    The cut should be from the current 36 million acres to at least 15 million acres.<p>
<li>Eliminates the three-entity rule, a loophole by which farmers can get twice the benefits they deserve.<p>
<li>Phase out the sugar and peanut provisions -- free the entire market<p>
<li>Pass this as a individual agriculture act, save food stamps for welfare reform legislation and save Everglades cleanup for environmental legislation.<p>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> writes that "for sixty years, Washington has tried to manage US agriculture" like a welfare state.  The changes which end the government's manipulation of production for major crops is historic. However, Congress' failure to enact significant reform in the area of peanuts, sugar and dairy means that they will have to finish the task of reforming agricultural policy in the near future.

<h3><I>Notable Quotations from a Founding Father  Washington</I></h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p>

February 22 marked George Washington's 264th birthday, 
and in the past year a new political magazine has appeared on newsstands with 
Washingtons first name on its masthead.   Yet we rarely hear about Washingtons  
thoughts on government.  He is more symbol than man.  True, he is, First in war, first in 
peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen, but what did he intend for our current 
government?
<p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprising, if you look at his presidential speeches, 
Washington does a good job of fleshing out the ideas upon which <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> was founded in 1973: <b>free enterprise, limited 
government, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.</b>
<p>
<center><b>		George Washington on FREE ENTERPRISE</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>In his farewell address, Washington said we should, cherish public credit, and we 
should avoid the accumulation of debt.  He backed a balanced budget -- before it was 
popular.<p>
<li>According to the European bankers handling American credit, during Washingtons 
tenure, our credit rating went from bankrupt to as high as any other European 
powers.<p>
<li>In private life in 1785, in conjunction with the Maryland and Virginia legislatures, 
Washington organized the Potomac River Canal Co., which was likely the first 
development company financed with private and public capital.<p>
<li>Concerning trade, in his farewell address, Washington said, our commercial policy 
should hold an equal and impartial hand to all nations.   
</ul><p>
<center>	<b>	George Washington on LIMITED 
GOVERNMENT</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington was a firm believer in the importance of checks and balances; he said in 
his farewell, we must avoid the exercise of powers of one department to encroach upon 
another.<p>
<li>He also was the first citizen-legislator, since he set the tradition of a two-term 
president.  He was reluctantly drawn into service from his home at Mt. Vernon, VA.
<p></ul>
<center><b>		George Washington on TRADITIONAL AMERICAN 
VALUES</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington said in his farewell, Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.<p>
<li>He also had a strong desire to protect future generations. We cannot ungenerously 
throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.<p>
<li>In his inaugural address, he commented that there was an indissoluble union 
between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage.<P>
 </ul>
<center><b>George Washington on STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE</b></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1790, Washington claimed that to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual
      means of preserving peace. <p>
<li>In his first annual address (it was not called the State of the Union back then), 
Washington said, A free people ought not only be armed, but disciplined.
</ul><p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our founding father believed and supported the basic 
principles of Heritage in his most memorable and important speeches.  Next time you 
think of General Washington, think beyond the Gilbert Stuart painting to the ideas of our 
nations past, present, and future.

<center><h3>FLAT out throw them out: Part II</h3></center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>It's time for sound policy, not sound bytes!</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	First, Steve Forbes and Dick Armey did not invent 
the flat tax this past year.  The flat tax has been around since 1981 when it was introduced 
by Dr. Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabuska.  Early supporters surprisingly included current 
<b>White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta</b>.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Enough on the history lesson, <i>Washington 
Post</i> columnist Jim Glassman said that the press is to blame for much of the poor 
treatment of the flat tax.   So it is our responsibility on a personal level to educate our 
neighbors and associates about the flat tax since the media can't or won't.  Because with 
or without its current messenger Forbes, the flat tax will survive and dominate the future 
of tax reform discussions.  So it is important to get out the message on what the flat tax 
actually is and what its likely effects will be.
<p>
<b>Why everyone should love the flat tax -- the universal appeal...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It's <b>fair, simple, singular and pure</b>.
<P><ul>
<li>	<b>Equality</b> The government will no longer be able to pick winners and 
losers with the tax code because everyone will fill out the same postcard and play by the 
same rules.  Everyone will pay the same rate; if your neighbor makes 10 times as much as 
you do, he will pay 10 times as much.
<p>
<li>	<b>Simplicity</b> Go ahead and toss out all of those 600-odd IRS forms with 
the fine print in favor of a simple postcard that takes minutes, not days to fill out.  
<p>
<li>	<b>Singularity</b> No longer will your money be taxed three or four times.  
Under the current system,  each dollar you earn can be taxed up to four times including 
capital gains taxes, interest taxes, company taxes, and inheritance taxes.  
<p>
	The goal of the flat tax is to tax all income once.  It is possible that after all 
current taxes are paid on your original dollar, you may only have 20 cents left, according 
to Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Dan Mitchell.</a> 
<P>
	 A result of the current loophole-filled tax code, only 11 percent of all income is 
taxed, according to the <a href="http://www.shoponline.com/ncpa/">National Center for 
Policy Analysis</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Purity</b> We cannot let any deduction beyond the personal allowance to be 
included in the proposal because once one deduction is allowed - interest groups will 
demand inclusion of their tax break.  This purity is necessary to keep the code fair and 
simple, as Heritage's Dan Mitchell wrote in <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi85.html">Why Liberals Should Support 
The Flat Tax</a>.
</ul><p>
<b>I keep hearing about the crisis surrounding the elimination of home mortgage 
interest.  What will happen to the housing market if we adopt a flat tax 
proposal?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Housing is a superior good; meaning that as the 
economy grows the housing market will grow accordingly.  Many of the numbers that 
have been raised in opposition to the flat tax were derived from a <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">study</a> done by 
DRI\McGraw-Hill, for the <b>National Association of Realtors</b>, that many experts 
say contains serious flaws. (See <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">Worst Case Scenario: Flat Tax 
Would Boost Home Values by 7 Percent or More</a> by William Beach and Dan 
Mitchell.)
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In the first place, only 22 percent of all homeowners 
use the deduction and a majority of them are wealthy.  When realtors were asked by 
Citizens for a Sound Economy what the most important factor is when buying a home, 
the top two answers were interest rates and down payment.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Great! The flat tax will drop interest rates and put 
more money into the taxpayers' pockets.  Also throw into consideration that without the 
capital gains tax, selling your house would give you more cash.  
<p>
<b>How are you so sure interest rates will fall?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The best example of what would happen is seen if 
you compare municipal bonds and taxable securities.  On average, the interest rate on 
municipal bonds is 1.3 % less than taxable securities, so by implementing a flat tax 
system that does not tax interest, interest rates should fall at least one percent.
<P>
<b>But no one will give to charity anymore without the deductions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	That same argument was made in 1986 after the tax 
cuts, but 1988 was a record year for charity giving.  Only half of donations to charity are 
even deducted, and for the most part this country is a generous one.  The better off we as 
a country are, the more money will be given to charity.  
<p>
<b>All the flat tax will do is add to the deficit because the Treasury will experience 
a reduction in revenues.</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The three biggest annual gains in revenue to the 
treasury were experienced in the 1920's, 1960's, and 1980's, which were three eras of tax 
cuts.  Why?  First, the wealthiest individuals will be less inclined to use tax shelters or 
overseas investments to avoid high tax rates.  Revenues grew 4.8 percent under 
Kennedy's cuts, and 2.2 percent under Reagan's cuts, according to Dan Mitchell. 
 <p>
 
<b>But how much money does this mean will come into the economy?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If the economy only grows one-half of one percent 
faster in ten years that will result in a difference of $5,000 dollars to each family.  The 
National Center for Policy Analysis reports that just raising the annual growth rate from 
2.5 to 3.3 percent will add $2.3 <b>trillion</b> dollars to the economy in 6 years.
<p>
<b>How come the rich do not have to pay money on dividends, when I work all 
week trying to get by and get taxed?</b>
 <p>
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dividends currently are taxed twice -- once on the 
corporate level, and then again on the individual level.  The flat tax eliminates only the 
second tax, dividend checks are merely after-tax payments.  As it is now, those who 
receive those checks are taxed unfairly.
 <P>
<b>Has the flat tax worked anywhere, or is this just academic conjecture?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hong Kong, one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world,  has a flat tax and a budget surplus.  Closer to home, the Joint Economic 
Committee found that in terms of real personal income growth from 1962 to 1994, states 
with flat tax systems on average grew 223%, while progressive tax systems grew only 
175%.  "Even when the initial move is revenue neutral, in the long run, government 
revenues are higher with the flat rate."
<p>
<b>What about the national sales tax?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The sales tax backed by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tx.) 
and Sen. Richard Luger (R-Ind.) has many of the same benefits of the flat tax, but has one 
main drawback.  The transition from income to sales tax would be costly and difficult, 
and there also is the scary possibility of ending up with both systems.
<p>
<b>How can a flat rate help control government spending and balance the 
budget?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to the Tax Foundation, the Forbes plan 
would bring in around $300 billion dollars less in revenues for the first couple of years.  
Not so bad if you ask me, go ahead and cut spending to go along with the tax cut.  Or as 
Grover Nordquist said, "starve the beast."  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Another idea that I like is possibly linking a yearly 
balanced budget with an annual flat tax rate.  Such a system proposed by Glassman 
makes sense.  If Congress wants to spend more in any given year then they will have to 
raise everyone's flat tax rate.  This would put pressure on Congress to cut spending more 
and more every year to lower tax rates.
<p>
<b>Someone told me this was a <i>progressive</i> flat tax...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under most of the current proposal there will be a personal 
allowance on approximately the first $30,000 made by a family of four.  After that 
deduction, each person pays the flat rate on any additional money.  The rich will pay 
more because the personal allowance is a smaller part of their total income.  So the rich 
will pay a higher rate than the middle class using a flat tax proposal, so some call it a 
<i>progressive</i> flat tax.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tell anyone you see -- fill out a postcard yourself .  
It only takes minutes.  See how you do, and I think you will like what you see.  To get a 
copy of the postcard call 1-800 CSE-3CSE, or check out House Majority Leader 
Richard Armey's <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">Flat Tax Home 
Page</a>.   This issue does not have a catchy phrase or slogan to sell it to the public, and it 
will not need one if the public learns what the flat tax <i>is</i>.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	This is a <b>sound policy</b> for our future, not a 
<b>sound byte</b> for our TVs.

<h3>Issues '96:  FLAT OUT SEND THEM HOME</h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p> Election season's traditional kickoffs in Iowa and New 
Hampshire are within sight, so now might be a good time to look at the definitive issues 
of the upcoming election.  1994 was the year of downsizing, and, to an extent, 1992 was 
the year of the balanced budget.  On Wednesday, Representative Bill McCollum of 
Florida said this campaign would revolve around the flat tax and term limits.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My next two columns will try to give you new insights into 
these two issues.  We know why we support term limits, but we don't always have the 
answers to our opponents' arguments.  So here are some questions to anticipate for the 
upcoming year and our answers to them.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The system already has a term limits provision -- it is called the election! 
</b> 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citizens can vote incumbents out of office, but 
challengers to incumbents face an uphill battle from the start.  Do you want to take on the 
name recognition, the franking privileges, the special interest support, and the fundraising 
capabilities of an incumbent?  	Probably not, and neither do a majority of qualified 
candidates.  Incumbents who choose to seek reelection almost always win (about 90% an 
election), so career legislators can stay in office as long as they choose.
 <p><ul>
<li><b>Term Limits is not the issue --  what we need is real campaign finance 
reform!</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Absolutely, but remember the PAC system was a 
reform measure in the first place enacted in the `70s that has led many to believe it is 
more of a problem than a solution.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	At a term limits conference on Wednesday, Senator 
Fred Thompson of Tennessee called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform 
vehicle."  Even if  lobbyists and congressmen are unwilling to restructure the financial 
side of campaigns, term limits offer a viable alternative.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After winning reelection Senators would not have to 
worry, as Thompson said, about "raising another dime."  The result would be more 
challenger vs. challenger races which would decrease the cost to run for elected office as 
well as the influence of PACs.
<p><ul>
<li><b>If we enact term limits, all we do is give more power to Congressional 
staff.</b>
 </ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	An average staff member on the Hill lasts only 
about 5 to 6 years according to a Heritage study, the Hill staff takes direction from 
Congressman, not the other way around. 
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to a majority of the Republican freshman 
that I have spoken to, they hired staff that was untrained in the ways of DC in an effort to 
limit the old-style perk system.  Most congressmen prefer to have staff members that 
think and support the views of the congressman and the district.  
<p><ul>
<li><b>In the past, term limits has been a minor issue - Why is this the year of term 
limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The public opinion polls show up to 80% of citizens 
supporting some sort of term limits legislation.  That overwhelming support is bolstered 
by a growing group of organizations, like US Term Limits and Americans Back in 
Change, that on a grass-roots level are pushing for national and local reform.  
<p>
	&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This year was the first year in which the 
Congressman actually voted on term limits.  Although talked about for years, this is the 
first election year that Congressman can be held accountable on the issue of term limits 
based on actual floor votes. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Why term limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Term limits are an effort to make Congressman 
realize that they are going to Washington temporarily, not making a career move.  We 
need Congressman who come to Washington with the citizen-legislator mentality  -  
"Let's get some things done and then get back home to our families."

<h3><i>Who's Vision of Governance Is America's Best Bet:  Federal Administrators 
v. Local Innovators? </i></h3>
<p>
<center>by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996<p>
 </center>Ever since the infamous Congressional elections of 1994, 
skeptics of the Republican Contract With America have claimed that lower taxes, less 
spending, fewer regulations, and genuine welfare reform sound like good ideas in theory, 
but they cannot be implemented in reality because they are too "tough" on the little guy -- 
the poor, the middle class, the "average" American.   At least, that's what they argue...and 
we all like to hear good arguments, don't we?   It's just that some of us, myself included, 
want them to back up their rhetoric with some really good examples of how their policies 
would be better at solving our nation's ills.  I, personally, take with a grain of salt, the 
economic advice of Harvard University-trained economists and well-meaning politicians.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So, the question we must ask ourselves is:  DO THESE 
IDEAS REALLY WORK?  IF SO, WHEN HAVE THEY BEEN TRIED?    
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We need only to look so far as the states to realize what 
governors -- particularly Republican governors -- are doing on all these fronts.  
Republican governors now occupy 31 state houses across the country, and in these states 
we are seeing some new ways to address the same old problems.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In honor of the <b>upcoming Republican Governor's 
Association Annual Dinner being held in Washington on February 5</b>, I have 
listed some accomplishments of their administrations, showing that local innovations are 
better than overbearing federal usurpations.
<p>
<b>TAX CUTS</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Republicans have always preached that lower tax rates 
yield an improved economy with more jobs.  Governors from New Jersey, Michigan, and 
New York have successfully put this philosophy into place.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman</b> of New Jersey has created 110,000 new jobs 
with her  30% income tax cut enacted in 1994.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has turned a $1.8 billion debt into a $1 billion 
surplus with much of the credit going to the 18 tax cuts he has implemented since he took 
office in 1990.
<P>
<li><b>Gov. George Pataki</b> of New York has reversed the high taxes of the Cuomo 
era in favor of a 25% income tax cut in 1995.  That move has many companies 
announcing that they will remain or even expand in the Empire State.
</ul><p>
<b>WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  As legislators quibble over what the future of welfare will 
be on a national level in Washington, two rising Governors in Wisconsin and Michigan 
are already administrating revolutionary new approaches to welfare.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Tommy Thompson</b> of Wisconsin, through his "Wisconsin Works" 
program, hopes to completely replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) 
with a work-based system providing training and child care.  The <i>Los Angeles 
Times</i> called the plan "the biggest break from the traditional welfare system 
proposed anywhere."
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has also pushed through  a new welfare 
program that emphasizes self-sufficiency.  The <i>New York Times</i> simply noted 
that "the new program would be at once tougher on people who refuse to work and 
gentler on those who make an effort."
</ul><p>
<b>EDUCATION REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  The thrust of Republican reforms in education is to allow 
all parents, rich or poor, to be able to decide where their children attend school.  The hope 
is that the increased competition will improve the quality of education in both private and 
public schools.  Governors in Minnesota and Massachusetts have pushed for such reforms 
in their home states.
<P><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Arne Carlson</b> of Minnesota has given low-income parents of 
Minnesota a $3,000 education voucher to all families with an income below 130% of the 
poverty line.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. Bill Weld</b> of Massachusetts has begun the process of establishing 
charter schools that are designed to focus on one specific subject area.  Thus far 25 such 
schools have opened their doors to Massachusetts families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These are just a few examples of the revolutionary 
changes that are occurring in state houses across the nation.  Washington does not, and 
should not, have a monopoly on what's best for all citizens.  Programs that touch our 
daily lives are best administered at the local and state levels.  The REAL solutions to 
America's problems lie in the hands of the governors who are willing to take on and meet 
the difficult challenges without asking the federal nanny-state to step in and mind the 
store.

Facts are stubborn things.  I have always liked interesting facts or statistics that aren't readily 
available in the day-to-day news media.  Here's a good sample of what the <i>American Enterprise</i> 
magazine called the 1995 indicators.  It includes statistics that can "change the way you understand 
the world" -- how we vote, how we live, how we do business.
<p><p><ul>
<li><b>How Does Talk Radio Fare?</b>  The most popular radio format in the United States 
today is not the Talk Radio of Rush Limbaugh or the rock of Pearl Jam.  It is <b>country</b> with 
some 2,642 stations nationwide.
<li><b>Is Congress still a Country Club?</b> 27 Black Americans ran for Congress on the 
GOP ticket in 1994.
<li><b>Electoral Politics:</b>  According to the Republican polling firm The Wirthlin Group, a 
September 1995 survey showed that one third of American voters could <b>not recall</b> when 
the next presidential election would occur.
<li><b>Were the '80's the Decade of Greed or Prosperity?</b>  According to our U.S. 
Treasury Department, 86% of those who reported incomes in the bottom fifth in 1980 had moved 
<b>upwards</b> by 1988.  In fact, 16% of them made the jump all the way from the bottom to the 
<b>top income bracket</b>.
<li><b>Hillary and Health Care Costs:</b>  After a year of Hillary-style health care meetings, 
official documents show that the Clinton Health Care Task Force cost slightly more than the 
projected $100,000 dollars -- the tab was actually <b>$14 million.</b>
<li><b>The Republican Party Comes of Age:</b> Almost 65% of registered Republicans are 
<b>under the age of 45</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>NAFTA Results:</b>  As of November 1995, 70% of US corporations report that their 
businesses have <b>not been affected</b> by the implementation of NAFTA or GATT.
<li><b>Political Contributors:</b> Only 19% of individuals have ever contributed to a 
<b>political candidate</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>What's a political party, dad?</b> According to an August 1995 Gallup poll, in the last 
fifty-five years, nearly 1 of 5 Americans has deserted the traditional party structure -- Democrat 
or Republican -- to become: independent voters.
<li><b>Budget:</b> In the next seven years under the latest GOP plan, the government will spend 
<b>$12 trillion dollars</b> -- only 7% less than when the Democrats ran Congress under the 
direction of then-Speaker Tom Foley and then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
<li><b>Competition Is a Good Thing:</b>  According to a government study, the emergence of 
14 new discount airlines has saved consumers an average of <b>$100 dollars</b> per round trip 
airfare.
<li><b>TV Viewing:</b>  Nielson research data reports that the average American woman 
watches almost 4.5 hours of <b>t.v. per day</b>, while men average just short of 4 hours per day.
<li><b>The Cost of Bureaucracy:</b> 75% of the World Health Organization's $1 billion annual 
budget goes to salaries, and much of the remainder goes to conferences.

<title>10 Basic Resume Tips  - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">


<CENTER>

<h3>10 BASIC RESUME TIPS</h3></CENTER>

<p>
<b>PURPOSE OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	The purpose of the resume is not to get you a job, but to get you an interview. The 
	resume is the first stage of initial employer/employee contact.</blockquote>

<b>THE LENGTH OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	A resume (particularly in Washington, D.C.) should be one page. If your resume is more than one page, shrink it.  A resume is not a comprehensive, detailed history of your life and career- that is a curriculum vitae typically used in academia, the legal profession and other fields.  A resume should be a summary of your skills and experience.  It should be user friendly- easy and quick to read. .</blockquote>


<b>PAPER COLOR</b><blockquote>
	White or Ivory colored paper is recommended.  It is important to avoid bright neon colors 
	or any colors that appear loud and unprofessional.  It is not the color of the resume that 
	makes a candidate stand out, it is the clarity of his/her resume. .</blockquote>


<b>PROOFREADING</b><blockquote>
	It is important to have three different people proofread your resume for mistakes. The 
	most common mistakes are spelling errors, inconsistency, and gaps in dates.  Ask current 
	or past employers, your colleagues, and your mother or father to critique it for the 
	common errors.	.</blockquote>


<b>RESUME STYLE</b><blockquote>
	In Washington, D.C., it is important to list your resume with experience first.  This is the 
	first item people will look for.  Education and skills should follow.
	 For job seekers right out of school- it is perfectly acceptable to list your education first 
	since experience may be limited. Experience and skills should follow.  
	It is also important to list internships.  This will help recent graduates show some 
	experience and familiarity with the business world.  
	Make sure your resume is written using one or two clear fonts of a reasonable size ( 8 
	point is too small, 16 point is too large). .</blockquote>


<b>SHOW DATES AND LOCATIONS</b><blockquote>
	It is important to list dates and locations for any held jobs, internships, etc. Make sure that 
	dates showing large gaps or overlap are justified. .</blockquote>


<b>AVOID LONG SENTENCES AND LARGE BLOCKS OF TYPE</b><blockquote>
	At first glance, your resume will be scanned and not read.  Make your resume easy to 
	understand, avoid acronyms and lingo. You do not want someone to have to sit and 
	think about what your are trying to convey. .</blockquote>



<b>TAILOR YOUR RESUME</b><blockquote>
	It is fine to tailor your resume so that it emphasizes your skills concerning a particular 
	job. For example, if your are seeking a political job, you should put all relevant political 
	experience (College Republicans or College Democrats, any campaign experience).  If it is 
	a job in the business world, list all retail, sales, administrative, and part-time work 
	experience. .</blockquote>


<b>LOCAL ADDRESS</b><blockquote>
	It is very important to have a local address for D.C.-area employees.  If you do not have 
	one, try to list a friend's or relative's address in the area who can easily reach you or relay 
	a message in a timely fashion.  Typically, employers are looking to fill a position within a 
	month and need to start the interview process immediately.  It is also important to list your 
	e-mail address if you have one. .</blockquote>


<b>WHAT TO LEAVE OFF</b><blockquote>
	   For an entry-level position, do not put an "objective" section on your resume. This will 
	immediately limit your employment opportunities. 	
	  Unless you are right out of school, it is not customary to put your high school on your 
	resume. 
	   Also, there is no need to put "References available upon request" on your resume.  	    
	It is understood that you will furnish references when asked. .</blockquote>

The author gratefully acknowledges the assistance and collaboration of Marc Wheat, a good friend and fellow Illinoisan, without whom this handbook would probably still be an outline. Marcs assistance to young conservative activists seeking public policy employment is given unselfishly to all who ask for it.
<P>
	Much credit goes to The Honorable Morton C. Blackwell, President of the <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">Leadership Institute,</a> whose article, Staffing the Conservative Movement [ Conservative Digest, April 1979], inspired this booklet.  Morton taught me and many others the importance of his rule: Go out of you way to help other conservatives.
<P>
	Thanks also goes to Ed Frankenberg and Dave Mason of <A HREF="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</A>, who are the  forces behind Washington Conservative Placement Network, the publishers of this handbook.
<P>
	Finally, personal gratitude is extended to the people who helped me learn first hand, through my own job searches, the information I have shared in this handbook:  Larry Herbolshelmer, Joe Duggan, Walt Longyear, David Barron, the late Lee Atwater, Helen Sanders, Dennis Kilcoyne, David Miner, Jim Lamb, Dave ONeal, Sandy Butler, Richard Viguerie, and many others.
<P>
	This handbook is affectionately dedicated to every young conservative job seeker who finds something useful here. Re-inventing the wheel can be fun, but I hope this booklet will help you some of the trouble.  Good luck!

<P>
		If youre coming to Washington to look for a job, dont be worried that you dont have high-level contacts at the White House or on Capitol Hill.  If youre a movement conservative who has fought the good fight on campus or in your community, you will find there are many people in Washington who will help you get your first job here.  You just need to ask them to help you.
<P>
	However, there are a number of things you can and should do before you come to town that will help speed things along.
<P>
	First, write and print out your resume at home (about 100 copies should be plenty).  A high-quality resume is important to making the right impression --  more about this in Section IV.
<P>
	Next, phone and write all conservative Job Banks through The Washington Conservative Placement Network (WCPN).  See the Appendix for a complete list.  The can hold you get all the proper forms you will need to complete.  Try to have these finished and mailed back at least two weeks before you come to Washington.
	If you already know of any prospective employers for whom youd like to work, contact them as well. Send them your resume.  In your letter, give them the date when youll be in town, and tell them youll call their office on a specific date to set up an appointment. Then call everyone you contacted, to set up appointments for the first week youll be in Washington.  Confirm all appointments with a written thank you letter on the same day the appointment is made. The more times a perspective employer sees your name cross his desk, the better your prospects will be.  More on this in Section V.
<P>

<P>
	Okay, so we would all like to live in a fashionable townhouse on Capitol Hill.  Put this idea out of your mind right now!  The job-seekers life is not a glamorous one-- you may have to sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor for a month or so.  Many job-seekers are lucky enough to have friends or relatives who already live in the Washington area. If you can stay with someone free of charge, you should do so--for as long as their hospitality will allow.
<P>
	For those who are blazing their own trail, there is another option.  Almost all the colleges in Washington rent rooms in their dormitories, during the summer only.  You should contact each of the universities before you leave home to compare rates and access to Metro and other amenities. (Q friendly hint: you may want to ask about air conditioning--not all of the dorms have it.)

<P>
*Phone numbers listed are for the university switchboards. Ask the university operator to connect you with the student Housing Office.
<P>
You may also want to check the bulletin boards near the cafeterias and carry outs in the House of Representatives and Senate office buildings.  Ask the security guards or stop any staffer for directions.  Hill staffers often advertise sub-lets, even for short periods mostly during the summer, which are very affordable.  Delis and carry-outs in the Capitol Hill neighborhood often have similar listings on their bulletin boards..  And you may want to check the Housings to Share listings in the Washington Post Classified Section.
<P>
	Finally, local churches sometimes have listings for people seeking roommates and sub-lets.  Phone numbers are available through Directory Assistance for area codes 202(Washington D.C.), 703(Virginia),and 301(Maryland).  Many Universities have Washington D.C. phone books in their libraries.

<P>
	You will find that the availability of jobs and the competition you face in getting these jobs varies widely with the season.   While jobs are available in Washington year round, the period of greatest movement in the public policy job market tends to be focused around three main times of year.
<P>
	Summer:  This is perhaps the most difficult time to find a permanent job.  One drawback to job-hunting in the summer is that many entry-level positions go unfilled because summer interns are doing the work at very little cost to the employer.  But, with lots of internships available, you can easily get one and use it as a great platform from which to look for and secure a permanent position when the interns leave.  Internships can also help you expand your network (more on this in section V).  An internship also can help you build your credentials and references for a permanent position(this is especially important for the person who is coming to Washington for the first time with very little experience in a public policy position).
<P>
	January:  This is when most December college graduates and people taking the Spring Semester off from school will be in town looking for jobs and internships.
<P>
	This time of year is usually very slow in Washington because of the holidays.  For that reason, it is most difficult at this time of year to simply show up in town with you resume and find a job.  Thats why its important that you lay the groundwork for you job search before you come to Washington, and have plenty of interviews set up and confirmed in advance.  Remember that this time of year is especially hard for the first time job-seeker just after a national election.  Thats because campaign workers and hill staffers are changing jobs.
<P>	
	September:  August college graduates and student seeking Fall internships will be your main competition for entry-level jobs at this time of year.  One of the good thing about job-hunting in Washington at this time of year is that its a very busy time, theres much work to be done, and there isnt the usual glut of free interns to fill the entry-level positions.
<P>

<P>	
	It is not the purpose of this handbook to teach you how to prepare a resume.  Hopefully, you have been instructed how to do this by your schools placement office.  If not, many fine books on this topic are available at your library.  However, as your resume relates to your ultimate success in finding a job in Washington, D.C., a few points are worth mentioning.
	Prepare you resume and have it printed in advance to coming to Washington.  Have it typeset and proofread it carefully  -- you must make a professional impression!  Keep it to one page.
	Highlight your grassroots political experience, even if its volunteer work, as this is the best way to demonstrate your conservative movement credentials.  Also highlight positions of responsibility you have held, including supervising other employees,  handling cash, etc., even if these positions are not in the public policy field.
<P>	
	Have a separate list of references, which includes addresses and phone numbers, which you can give to prospective employers if they request it.  Most employers will call your references, so clear this in advance with anyone you list.  Former supervisors are the best references.
<P>	
	Have a writing sample ready to give out at an interview.  Academic papers you wrote for college classes may look impressive, but they are usually not the best writing samples.  Use something you wrote which advocates a conservative position on a public policy issue, like a letter-to-the-editor, an op-ed piece, or an article for your school newspaper or a conservative publication.
<P>

<P>	
	This is the most important, most valuable section of this handbook.
<P>	
	Start by contacting all the conservative job banks.  You can use The Washington Conservative Placement Network to help you do this.  From there all you have to do is follow the bouncing ball and take the steps listed below in order.
	<UL>	
	1) Contact every prospective employer you learn about from the job banks or any other source and ask them for an interview to discuss your job search even if they say no position is available.<P>
	2)  At the conclusion of every interview, ask for the names and phone numbers of one to three other prospective employers you can contact as part of your job search.. Most of the people you meet with will be happy to make this referral.
	</UL>
<P>
	You should make a NETWORK CHART which shows the personal relationship between the contacts you develop.  This will not only chart your progress, but it will remind you to check back with your primary sources from time-to-time to see if theyve heard of any new openings.  In addition, your chart can remind you of which contacts may be helpful in trying to persuade a prospective employer to hire you.
<P>	
	You should also keep a set of note cards, or a Rolodex, which lists each contact you develop.  Make a careful note each time you speak to someone in your network.  This will help you remember what you discussed, referrals which were made, and action you should take in your job search.
	<UL>
	3)  Call all the people to whom you are referred and ask for an interview.  One way to get your foot in the door is to say, I was referred to you by.. -- however, be careful not to imply that they are recommending you for a particular position.  Rather, use the referral to let the person know youre not calling out of the blue, but  that  you were sent to them by a fellow conservative.  A referral is five times more valuable than a cold call.
	<P>
	4)  Prepare for each interview as if it is a job interview, even if your contact has told you no position is available.  Be sure to ask the new prospect for job referrals and continue to thus build your network exponentially.
	<P>
	5)  Send a typed thank you letter to each person who meets with you.  Send it on the day of the interview, and for hot job prospects, include another copy of your resume with your thank you letter.  Its good to include specific thanks for the referrals they gave you by name to again remind them of the contacts they gave you.
	<P>
	6) Attend conservative events where prospective employers and others who may become part of your network are gathered.  The most useful meetings for the conservative job seeker are listed here.  Call the numbers given below for more information.

<P>
	There are a number of organizations based in the Washington area which train young conservative for public policy positions.  If you attend one of these programs, it can make you a more desirable candidate for many Washington conservative positions, and it will introduce you to  more people which can become part of your referral network.
<P>
		
	One of the best programs for training young conservatives is conducted by:
<blockquote>

		<a href="/lead-inst/home.html">The Leadership Institute</a><BR>
		8001 Braddock Road, Suite 502<BR>
		Springfield, Virginia  22151<BR>
		Telephone: (703) 321-8580
		<P>
	
</blockquote>
	Their Youth Leadership School will teach you how to organize other young conservatives on behalf of a conservative candidate or organization.  The Capitol Hill Staff Training School (CHSTS) also sponsored by The Leadership Institute, is aimed at young conservatives seeking a job on the staff of a conservative Congressman or Senator.
	<P>
	
	Contact The Leadership Institute for details and a school schedule and application.

<P>	
	Budget carefully and be prepared for the fact that Washington, D.C., is a very expensive town to live in. Take a temporary job, if necessary, to earn money until you secure a full-time position.  Ideally, it should be something related to public policy and the conservative movement, but, as Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute likes to say, You cant save the world if you cant pay the rent.  Dont go bankrupt in pursuit of the perfect job.
<P>	
	You can take an unpaid public policy internship during the day to build your network and credentials, but work a part-time job at night, even if its non-political, to earn extra money.  For example, you can open mail and make xerox copies for a conservative Congressman for free by day, and work at a conservative phone bank operation for $6.00 an hour at night.  Many people have done exactly this.
<P>	
	Keep enough money in reserve to return home if things dont work out.  Some people keep a bought and paid for plane, train, or bus ticket in reserve to return home if needed, which can be cashed in if you decide to stay.  But by all means, make provisions to get yourself back home.
<P>

<P>	
	In all likelihood, you will not find a job overnight.  You will almost certainly spend several weeks working the phone, pounding the pavement, and flogging your resume.
<P>	Dont become discouraged, many others have followed this route including the author and (almost) all  his friends.  We havent lost anybody yet.
<P>	
	Nothing can take the place of persistence in a successful job search.
<P>	
	You can make a difference.  You can have an effect on public policy.  You can advance the conservative philosophy you believe in.  Just keep trying, keep smiling, and keep you chin up!

The Network includes three independent, non-partisan conservative Job Banks in the Washington, D.C. area, along with many informational organizations and volunteers. The three WCPN Job Banks are:

<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people. 
<p>

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<title>Gary Bauer's January, 1997 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

January 3, 1997

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

On January 22, our nation will mark the 24th anniversary of the
Supreme Court decisions that elevated a choice for death to the
level of national policy.  In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and its companion
case, <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, seven men dressed in black robes delivered
a cruel blow that continues to reverberate throughout our land.
Those seven Justices, arrogant and unelected, elevated abortion
on demand to a status of grand Constitutional privilege.  The
chilling effects of their ruling have not stopped even to this
day, as a culture of death continues to descend across this good
and decent land.

<p>

Just how deeply a nation can sink into a depraved indifference
to human life was vividly illustrated recently in Delaware.  There,
prosecutors charge, two unwed college students -- Brian Peterson,
Jr. and Amy Grossberg -- entered a hotel for the express purpose
of giving birth to their firstborn son.  What happened next, prosecutors
say, is horrible to contemplate.  On a cold November night, the
child was placed in a plastic bag and dropped outside in the hotel
dumpster, where maintenance workers later found his body.  The
dead baby had a fractured skull and other injuries that the coroner
attributes to blunt-force head trauma and shaking.

<p>

Reaction to this case has been extraordinary.  Many columnists
have noted the fact that Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are
among those society would call its &quot;fortunate souls.&quot;
They come from well-to-do families; they have had the best of
everything.  As the <I>New York Times</I> reported it, they &quot;grew
up where many teenagers have their own cars and secure futures,
where gardeners tend landscaped lawns and shrubs[.]&quot;[1] They
do not live in some remote, forsaken corner of the world, or in
a culture where out-of-wedlock childbearing is rare or scorned.
They come from prosperous families in a populous state (New Jersey),
at a time when unwed pregnancy is so common that, apparently,
no one at Amy Grossberg's college even discussed with her the
fact that she was clearly on the verge of childbirth.

<p>

These young people are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence,
of course, so we will withhold our judgment about what happened
in that hotel room.  But we don't have to wait to react to what
is being said about their case by the swarms of psychologists
and lawyers now descending on Delaware.  Getting at the truth
seems far down on the list of priorities for these apologists.
One commentator regretted that Peterson and Grossberg had not
gone to New Jersey's local Planned Parenthood, where their problem
could have been averted by the nation's largest abortion provider.
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has led the fight
to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform, talked
vaguely about the couple's failure to consider adoption and &quot;other
options.&quot;  Charles Oberly, Amy Grossberg's attorney, with
no hint that he was merely trying to shift the blame to Peterson,
told <I>The New York Times</I> that &quot;[t]here is a serious
question whether this woman did anything criminal.&quot;[2]

<p>

Now, it may be true that both of these privileged young adults
are &quot;all-American kids.&quot;  It may be, as their lawyer
claims, that they were panic-stricken and irrational to the point
of insanity in that hotel room.  But it might also be the case
that they engaged in an act of calculated rationality.  Columnist
George Will put his finger on this exactly when he pointed out
how, under only slightly different circumstances, Peterson and
Grossberg could have found themselves visiting the White House
for a veto ceremony instead of standing before a grand jury in
Delaware. &quot;Don't young people read newspapers?&quot; he
wrote. &quot;Don't they know that, thanks to President Clinton,
they could have <I>chosen</I> to have a doctor suck their baby's
brains out, and Delaware would not have <I>chosen</I> to charge
them with murder?&quot;[3]

<p>

In the world in which we now live, it is surely possible that
two 18-year-olds could not see the logical and rational difference
between dropping their baby boy into a dumpster and dropping by
the New Jersey clinic that has performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions
in a single year.  And if there is no rational difference between
these two actions, why then would society insist on punishment
for the one deed and presidential praise for the right to do the
other?

<p>

This is where the abortion culture has led us in January 1997.
On the 8th of this month, the Supreme Court of the United States
will hear a case that will determine whether or not there is an
individual constitutional right to commit suicide with the aid
of another.  Lawyers for our side, including FRC's own Cathy Cleaver,
have argued strenuously in legal briefs to the court not only
that no such right exists, but that to invent it would be to open
the floodgates to the wholesale &quot;termination&quot; of the
elderly and severely handicapped.  We have many allies on this
issue -- and compelling arguments -- but at this writing we are
keenly aware that the odds are against us: the Supreme Court is
radically liberal on social issues, and both federal appeals courts
in this case have held that the states may not restrict assisted
suicide.

<p>

In Michigan, Jack Kevorkian has claimed at least 45 victims. 
This pathological ex-pathologist, whose obsession with death includes
painting pictures that feature Nazi images and human cannibalism,
has so far evaded the condemnation of jurors.  The media depicts
him as a hero and trail-blazer.  He depicts himself as a latter-day
Thomas Jefferson, while conveniently forgetting all the while
the words of Jefferson, who said that &quot;[t]he care of human
life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the sole legitimate
object of good government.&quot;

<p>

How then can we restore respect for the sanctity of human life?
The Family Research Council is determined to do its part.  We
will continue to battle in the courts, as we have done in opposing
assisted suicide and defending the right of pro-life sidewalk
counselors to offer aid to those entering abortion clinics.[4] We
will continue to address our case to the Congress, urging the
adoption of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions and to
provide legal protection for human life from conception until
natural death.  And we will keep the pressure on Bill Clinton
and Al Gore to reverse their pro-abortion policies.  As long as
we have breath in us to speak, we will remind those in office
of their sacred duty to defend the weak and the helpless.

<p>

We will also continue to conduct research and to publish analysis,
both legal and social, of the key issues under debate.  This month,
we are releasing two more contributions to this effort.  Gracie
Hsu and Robert G. Morrison of my staff have joined with me in
preparing a comprehensive statement on the sanctity of human life.
We approached this task humbly, knowing that many great writers
and thinkers have addressed this subject more powerfully than
we ever could.  Still, we believe that Americans need a constant
recalling to the faith and vision of our founders and to the lessons
of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

<p>

It has been said over and over again that the abortion industry
is the most unregulated commercial enterprise in American history.
When a New Jersey newspaper revealed, as noted above, that a
clinic there had performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions in a
single year, it reported a startling fact that no power in state
government knew or wanted to know.  The information currently
being gathered about the number of abortions performed in America
and the harm these abortions do to women is woefully inadequate.
You can use the enclosed reply card to obtain a copy of FRC's
Special Report, <I>A Woman's Right (Not) to Know</I>, by Virginia
Delegate Robert G. Marshall.

<p>

January, of course, also marks the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr.  His speech at the Lincoln Memorial still resonates
throughout every corner of this land, too, because he invoked
the &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to life, liberty and happiness
that belong to all people not by virtue of their skin color or
utility, but by virtue of their humanity.  That humanity is holy
because it reflects the image and likeness of our Creator, a Creator
who loves us &quot;irrationally&quot; -- not according to our
merits or usefulness to Him -- but because he has <I>chosen</I>
to love us.

<p>

How like that love the noblest human love is.  I think of the
woman in our area of Virginia a few years back, who came home
to find her family's trailer ablaze.  Knowing that her two children
were inside, she rushed into the inferno to save them.  A firefighter
who tried to restrain her said that she was on fire the moment
she passed through the trailer door.  Her body was found outside
the room where the bodies of her two sons lay. <I>Irrational love.</I>

<p>

Or the heartrending footnote to that searing story of the young
boy in the Chicago housing project who was thrown to his death
from an upper floor by two 12-year-olds because he refused to
steal candy for them.  That act of gross disrespect for human
life was matched by the impossible act of love displayed by the
dead boy's 5-year-old brother, who raced down the stairs of the
high rise immediately after the incident.  Asked by a counselor
what was going through his mind, the little boy said he had hoped
to catch his brother before he hit the ground.  <I>Irrational
love.</I>

<p>

Or, finally, the young police officer in Tennessee, struck by
a bullet in the line of duty, who lay in a &quot;persistent vegetative
state.&quot;  (That's an awful term for a physical condition that
none of us can fully comprehend.)  One day, after several years
of this coma-like condition, the officer awoke for a brief time,
recognized his children, and spoke to them.  His brother rushed
to the hospital to be with him.  When the press asked the brother
what his reaction was to so many years of waiting and worrying,
he said that it was worth it all just to be able to tell his brother
that he loved him, and to be understood.

<p>

My friends, these are acts of irrational love -- performed out
of profound, reflexive respect for the sanctity of human life.
All around us in 1997, there are signs that affirm this kind
of love, but unfortunately there are also many other signs that
tell us we have lost our way -- a way of service and sacrifice
on behalf of those who desperately need us.

<p>

In the days to come, let us all pray that our Supreme Court, our
Congress and our President will recover their sense of direction
and help this nation, once again, become a beacon to the oppressed,
a Shining City on a Hill.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  As always, your partnership with us is essential to our
success.  We thank God for all you do to make our work possible.
Your generosity and your prayers, your friendship and notes of
encouragement -- these things mean more to me that you will ever
know. I pray that you and your family will enjoy all of God's blessings
in 1997.

THOUGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD ON DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT
<P>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee.  I was pleased to accept your invitation to discuss some corporate approaches to organization and downsizing and their possible relevance to the federal government.  I believe I do have a somewhat unusual perspective on this issue, having spent roughly 20 years in the corporate world.
<P>
I am pleased to be back in these chambers.  As a young member of the Congress during the 1960s, I had the opportunity to serve on this Committee when it was known as the Government Operations Committee.  At the beginning of my tenure, the government we oversaw was much smaller and simpler than the complex and overwhelming behemoth that so many of you in this Congress have pledged to reform.
<P>
With your permission, I thought what I would do this afternoon would be to merely summarize some of the concepts in my prepared text, which all of you have received in advance, and then allow the maximum amount of time for questions.
<P>
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the issues of my time in Congress was whether or not to close a dairy at the U.S. Naval Academy.  That example may be good for a laugh today, but those who tried to sell off the dairy were accused of not understanding the importance of a captive milk supply for the Midshipmen.  Heaven forbid that the Naval Academy would have to buy milk from the private sector like everyone else.
<P>
While that may seem like a trivial example compared with the sacred cows that must be challenged today if you are to balance the budget by 2002, the fact remains that the federal government is one of the few institutions that still thinks itself able to afford the luxury of sentimentality at taxpayers' expense.  Businesses eventually cannot afford to hold on to activities, people, practices, divisions or subsidiaries that have become not central to the core business, outmoded, inefficient or a financial drain on the rest of the company.  Rather, they have to figure out what they should and should not be doing and then take decisive action to get their financial affairs in order.  If they fail to do so, they die.
<P>
When taking over a troubled company, a knowledgeable CEO checks his or her "teeth to tail" ratio, as they say in the military.  It involves undertaking a thorough review of the company's assets and resources and then promptly divesting those that are not central to the future success of the institution.  This forces the company to focus on its "core" business and to avoid wasting manpower, time and money on ventures that are secondary to what is vital to the long-term health and success of the company.
<P>
A good example of a corporation recently undergoing such a top-to-bottom restructuring is Sears, Roebuck and Company.  Sears in recent years decided to move from a widely diversified company to a company focused on its core businesses.  During this restructuring it closed a hundred unprofitable stores, took Dean-Witter, Discover, Allstate Corporation, PMI, and S.P.S. public, sold off unneeded assets and even disposed of the famed Sear Tower in Chicago.  Some of the cash raised from these sales was used to buy out thousands of middle managers, and the rest was plowed back in to strengthen its basic businesses.
<P>
One of the most painful and visible aspects of their restructuring was the decision to close Sears' catalog division--the business on which Sears was built.  The truth is that the catalog division was unprofitable and a drain on the company's main businesses.  As difficult as it was, however, this break with the past told Sears stockholders that management was serious about fundamentally restructuring the company and putting it on a path for growth.
<P>
The experience at Sears, and the experiences at hundreds of other companies, including two I helped to downsize--G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corporation, an electronics company--can provide valuable lessons on how to and how not to downsize and overhaul the federal government.  There is no one formula for successfully reorganizing a major corporation or the federal government, beyond the fact that it requires making tough, serious decisions, and it is often easier for someone from outside the institution who understands that this is his or her assignment to do it than it is for an insider.  Also, not surprisingly, it is best done by someone who knows how to do it.
<P>

<B> Define The "Core" Business</B>
<P>
As overseers of the federal government, an institution which, for the sake of discussion, is arguably in Chapter XI, Members of Congress will need to treat the job of restructuring it in the same urgent, tough-minded manner so many corporations around the country are now doing.  The goal must be to earn back the confidence of the taxpayers, who are the real stockholders of the federal government.  This does not mean simply "patching," as management guru Peter Drucker has characterized Vice President Gore and his associates of doing.  The reason National Performance Review (NPR) efforts have received so little public attention, said Drucker, is that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway.  They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own--without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards."(1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Certainly the NPR is a worthwhile effort -- a good idea.  But, much more is needed.  Techniques such as Total Quality Management, procurement reforms, or streamlining middle management will improve government, but they will only affect the problems in government programs at the margins.  Well-intended corporate managers have used the same sort of techniques and still failed or suffered.  It is vital that many of these things be done, but only after one has decided and dealt with the more central issues of what businesses to be in.
<P>
The first task is to decide what the core business is.  Once this decision is made, then everything else is secondary.  For the federal government, the four basic departments -- State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury -- have a solid basis for existence.  The other departments were either more narrowly based, were an afterthought, or both.  Some had utility when they were established, but no longer do.  Others, in my view, probably did not have a need to be at the Cabinet level even when they were first established.  A number of them were recommended and created less for organizational reasons and more to gain favor with a particular interest group.  Once one has determined the core functions to be performed by the federal government, all other activities should be scrutinized for elimination, downsizing, reorganization, movement to state and local governments or privatization.
<P>
I begin with the conviction that the first place activities should be undertaken is with the individual citizens and private organizations; next, if government must be involved, by local governments, state governments, and only last by the federal government.  In the past, this was not a workable principle in some instances because of the issue of civil rights, even though in theory it was compelling and rational.  It was clear that if some activities were left to local or state government or to individuals there would not be appropriate protection against discrimination.  Given the many civil rights laws on the books today and the progress that has been made, it is no longer the problem it was in earlier periods.  Today government services are being delivered to minorities in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<P>
My conviction is that as overseers of the federal government, Congress ought to use federal solutions only as a last resort.  The question must be asked whether a problem is truly a federal responsibility, or can it better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, by local governments, or state governments.  I understand how difficult this is in Washington, DC, given the fact that all the institutional pressures seem to run the other direction.  But I'm reminded of a sage warning former Missouri Congressman Tom Curates once said, "Public money drives out private money."  And it does.

<P>
<B> Cut Sharply and Rapidly</B>
<P>
I read an article recently which set out some useful advice on downsizing from CEO Al Dunlap, who apparently did a skillful and swift job of restructuring Scott Paper Co.  On downsizing, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do it once, do it severely, and get it over with.  When a company says it is going to restructure over the next three years it won't happen . . . Don't do it!  You paralyze the company."(2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is sound advice for the Congress as it undertakes the massive task of balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.  Cut severely and rapidly.  Don't wait.  Whatever it is you do the odds are overwhelming that you should have done more, rather than less, and that you should have done it sooner, rather than later.  There are so many pressures in Washington, D.C., to keep the status quo, that the most frequent mistake is to make too few changes or to cut too little.  If in fact one cuts too much, which is very rare -- indeed probably unprecedented -- it is easy to add back.  But, once you cut and then find you have to go back and cut again, it is harmful to an organization.  Do it once.  Do it well.  Don't under do it.  And then let people get back to work.  Don't try to cut the dog's tail off one inch at a time, hoping it won't hurt as much.
<P>
And, a caution.  After the reductions have been accomplished, don't turn your head for a second or you will find the waste moving right back in.  It is inevitable that it will happen, and fast, unless the overseers are vigilant.  As the saying goes, "If you're coasting, you're going down hill."
<P>
Although the balanced budget plan drafted by the House Budget Committee is remarkable in its specificity and scope, in my view it ignores the principle of "cutting decisively and rapidly," in that it proposes phasing out some programs and agencies over a period of three to five years.  If a program or agency is outmoded and inefficient, phasing out its funding over a period of time will not make it less so.  For instance, I agree with those who propose to eliminate taxpayer funding for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and dozens of other programs that are not, or are at least no longer, appropriate federal responsibilities.  But why inflict on these programs the "death of a thousand cuts."
<P>
If Amtrak, for example, should be given the flexibility and the challenge to compete in the private sector, then why can't it be done sooner, say over the next 12 months, rather than over the next five years?  My advice is to sever public ties with much greater speed.
<P>
The Small Business Administration continues to dodge reform.  It was not even ten years old during my freshman term, yet, in a 1963 article on pork barrel spending, Life magazine exposed the SBA as a new "device for soaking up money and getting rid of it."  Based upon its early track record, we should have had the good judgment to close down the SBA decades ago.  I hope that this Congress will have the courage to act this year.  It is never to be desired, but given the current budget situation, good intentions and throwing money at problems hoping some of it will stick and do some good is unacceptable.

<P>
<B> Downsize</B>
<P>
I also recommend that Congress move swiftly to cut management and get personnel costs under control.  It is guaranteed that there are more managers and more staff in the federal government than are needed.  In less than seven months, Scott Paper eliminated 11,200 people, one-third of the work force.  The company cut 71 percent of the headquarters staff, 50 percent of management, and 20 percent of the hourly employees.  They discovered they really weren't needed.
<P>
Another example is G.D. Searle & Co., where I served from 1977 to 1985.  There we reduced the centralized corporate activities down to about 20 percent of their prior size, divested some 30 to 35 businesses, sold a variety of assets, downsized the company to close to 65 percent of its prior employee base, with the not surprising result that it worked better, earned more, and investors and owners moved the stock from about $12 a share to $50 to $60 a share.
<P>
So too at General Instrument Corporation where I served from 1990 to 1993.  There we divested five or six businesses, sold a number of assets, downsized and focused on the core business, and dramatically reduced the size of corporate headquarters, with the result that the investors and owners of the company moved the stock from below $15 a share to $50 a share.
<P>
There are hundreds of companies that are doing the same thing.  Some do it after they should have, others do it ahead of the curve.  Some wait too long, and they suffer and die.  Clearly the U.S. government is well behind the curve.
<P>
No doubt the federal government suffers even more waste on a percentage basis throughout the bureaucracy than even poorly run companies.  According to the NPR, the federal government has over 280,000 persons formally classified as "supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control functions, costing billions of dollars."  "At times," reports the NPR, "the federal government's management control system resembles a theater of the absurd."3    To make the point, if one used the Scott Paper model on downsizing as a guide, theoretically some 140,000 of these managers could be cut immediately, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.  For example, I see fewer and fewer companies where every manager has a special assistant or two.  But in government, it seems even special assistants have assistants.  Don't get me wrong.  I used to be one and I used to have one or two.  And I suspect many of you do.  Indeed, some are needed.  But, the revolution in information technology has changed the way work can be done so that excessive layering of organizations can be avoided.
<P>
<B> Reordering the Flow Chart</B>
<P>
There are a variety of ways to merge federal agencies and departments, and certainly no one way is perfect.  For example, over 20 years ago, Richard Nixon and the Ash Commission recommended that there be four basic areas:  defense, foreign policy, the economic, and domestic.  One can find powerful reasons for either merging or terminating many of the newer departments.  Some of their functions will, or course, need to continue, but certainly much of the overhead is not necessary.
<P>
While I have no special insight as to which is the preferred way to reorganize our government, I am persuaded that probably one-half to two-thirds of the non-central departments are no longer needed in their current form.  For example, the Republican proposal to close down the 93-year-old Department of Commerce seems reasonable to me.  It lacks a clear sense of mission and the fact that it duplicates the work of dozens of other departments and agencies is a sign that taxpayers could do without it in its present form.  The same could likely be said for others of the newer departments, such as Energy, HUD, Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Appalachian Regional Commission and EDA.  For example, the veterans were served before the VA was made a Cabinet rank department, as they should have been.  And they can be well-served, possibly better served, if it were to move out of the Cabinet and have some of its functions turned over to the private sector.

<P>
<B> Don't Micromanage</B>
<P>
There is no one perfect organizational arrangement.  The right people can make a poor organizational structure work well, and wrong people will assure that the best possible organizational arrangement will work poorly.  People are the key.  That is why the delays in the Presidential appointment process have been so damaging.  In many cases, cabinet and sub-cabinet posts have not been filled until after a non-trivial fraction of their entire term is over.
<P>
An important rule for a corporate board is to avoid trying to micromanage the CEO and the company.  Boards need to give management the direction to be sure, but also the freedom to run the company in the most effective and profitable way they see fit, and then hold them accountable.  One of the problems in government, and something that contributes to waste and mismanagement of the Executive branch.  My recollection from my days in the Executive branch is that Congress imposes so many restrictions, requirements, and requests on the Executive branch, no one of which is debilitating, but in the aggregate are like the threads the Lilliputians used to prevent Gulliver from moving.  This was certainly a problem at the Pentagon and I suspect still is, because of the blizzard of requests for studies and the directives and rules generated by the multiplicity of Congressional committees and subcommittees.  I want to commend you for taking steps to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees earlier this year.  It was a good start.
<P>
However, smaller government is an unachievable goal if Congress continues to try to tell the Executive branch when to turn right, turn left, speed up, or slow down.  What Congress needs to do is tell the Executive branch generally the direction to go, where the sides of the road are, and what the speed limit is.  Then Congress should stand back, oversee, and evaluate the administration on how well they do it, and if necessary calibrate the directions or change the drivers.  Too many hands on the steering wheel will put the truck in the ditch.

<P>
<B> Big Government and Big Business</B>
<P>
Anytime anyone proposes a change, there will be opposition and concern.  Change is not easy for people.  However, the fact that there is opposition and concern about proposed changes does not mean that the changes are undesirable.  Indeed change in both people and organizational assignment can bring in fresh thinking and approaches.  Certainly the entire country has seen the fresh breeze blowing through the Congress since the changes earlier this year.  It is refreshing, as even a number of my friends from the new Minority agree.
<P>
In Washington, D.C., change is a particular problem for several reasons.  Any change in the Executive branch tends to result in changes in people and organizational structure.  The effect is that it makes life less certain for people in the bureaucracy, which not surprisingly they resist.  It also makes life difficult for those they deal with -- Washington lawyers and lobbyists.  These folks have invested many, many years in the relationships and knowledge they have achieved, which, for them, is the coin of the realm.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that they often become the earliest and most effective opponents of change.  This is not because they think the change is unwise or unnecessary, but because they could lose their investment in the people and the structure as currently arranged.  They would have to start over again developing such relationships and knowledge.  This is certainly not a reason not to change.
<P>
Further, any change proposed in the Executive branch tends to result in difficulties for Congressional committees in that jurisdictions of committees can be affected.  There will be winners and losers.  Therefore, the predictable result of any proposed change tends to be that some Members of the Congress oppose it.  Here again, it is not a reason not to change.
<P>
It is important not to lose sight of the reality that Washington, D.C. is arranged in a way that only large companies are able to hire the lawyers, lobbyists, and representatives necessary to effectively interact with the Executive branch of the federal government and the Legislative branch to their advantage.  Only large companies have the resources to stay the course while the Executive departments and agencies study and delay decisions on matters that directly affect them.  Indeed, that is a competitive advantage large companies have -- they have the resources and they have the staying power.  Big businesses have the institutional capability to effectively interact with big government.  That is not true of small businesses.  Dealing with the federal government can suck the very life out of small companies that have to compete with big businesses in trying to avoid having government unintentionally take actions that are harmful to them.
<P>

<B> A Thought for Congress</B>
<P>
Thirty years ago, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.  One of my recommendations was to terminate the practice whereby Members of the House and Senate frequently announce federal grants, contracts and projects in their states and districts.  It didn't happen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I said then:
<P>
" . . . to encourage or assist Members (of Congress) in making initial announcements of Federal grants, projects, and particularly Federal contracts, leaves at least a shadow of a question as to whether or not the contract or project was awarded solely, as it should have been, on factors such as cost, performance, and national interest.  I would think that a procurement officer or Corps of Engineers' official, for example, who based his decisions on needs, cost, and performance, would not be pleased to see Members' announcements of these contracts or projects leaving the impression that they may have influenced his decision."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

I suggest that government likely would shrink if Members ended this policy and thereby eliminated the incentive to have the federal government become involved in so many activities that belong in the private sector or in state or local government.  In short, implementing that recommendation would help.  As long as this practice remains, the incentive will be upside down and more and more activities are likely to move toward Washington, D.C.

<P>
<B> Privatization Insures Accountability</B>
<P>
"Corporacy" is a term relating to the private sector, meaning corporate "bureaucrats running corporations for their own good and the shareholder be damned."  Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the competitive marketplace punishes companies that become "corporacies."  Indeed, the most valuable thing that exists in business and in the non-governmental sector is the opportunity to fail.  And fear of failure focuses the mind.  Government programs are effectively insulated from the rigors of the marketplace and therefore are denied the possibility of failure.  The task for government is to find some substitutes or proxies for the possibility of failure -- for the "bottom line" -- in business.  One approach would be to have more "sunset" provisions to force legislative review after a period of years.  While not always appropriate, one other essential way of bringing this  level of accountability to the delivering of services is privatization.
<P>
Some thirty years ago, Nobel Prize Economist Milton Friedman told me that the best way of curing the problems of waste and inefficiency in the U.S. Postal System, then the Post Office Department, was to amend the law so it would no longer be a monopoly, and thereby would be forced to compete.  He was correct.  I have questions about some of the so-called "government-owned" corporations.  One effect can be to insulate such an activity from being accountable to either the marketplace or to Congress.  And, everyone needs to be accountable to someone.  The U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak are two examples.  Still other so-called government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation, aren't really corporations.  All the word "corporation" in the their title does is befuddle and confuse.
<P>
Certainly a number of these activities should be cut loose from taxpayers' purse and allowed the privilege of competing in the marketplace.  Competition is what brings out the best in people and organizations.  As the saying goes, "it is your enemies who make you strong."  I am attracted to the idea of divestiture or privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as the Air Traffic Control System, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, the Government Printing Office, public housing, defense stockpiles, and unneeded federal buildings and real estate.  I have no view as to whether it might make sense to make some of these activities "corporatized" government agencies as an interim step toward full divestiture.  In some cases, such a step might be useful in getting the some enterprise's books in order, providing time to inventory their assets, and in preparation for selling them off to people who know how to run such activities.
<P>

<B> Asset Sales</B>
<P>
I have trouble understanding why the federal government should be borrowing over $200 billion per year to cover its deficit when it is sitting on billions worth of assets that could and should be sold to the private sector to raise cash and which would then be forced to operate on a more cost-effective basis.  As the Dunlap article points out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Inside every corporation is the biggest bank one is ever going to find -- its own assets.  My philosophy is, before you go looking for outside funding, look inside first at what you don't need.  We sold S.D. Warren, a paper subsidiary, for $1.6 billion.  It was a fine company but I believe you can't be in two capital intensive businesses and do well at both.  We sold other operations and have another $1 billion of assets on the block.  We are on track to be debt-free in 1995.  All this from a company that was heavily in debt, whose bonds weren't investment grade, when I arrived."
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some twenty years ago, I chaired the Property Review Board in the Nixon Administration, which supervised the review of literally hundreds of federal real properties for movement to their highest and best use outside of government.  The resistance in both the Executive and Legislative branches was enormous.  That opportunity is still there and, given the current budget situation, must be seized.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am told that for the past decade or so, asset sales have been seen as somewhat of a gimmick here in Washington, D.C.  It is not a gimmick in the business world and need not be seen as such in government.  The goal of such sales is to use unneeded or under-utilized assets to reduce liabilities and to free up funds to be focused on more important needs.  This is a business-like strategy I believe the U.S. Government could usefully adopt.  I understand that the Majority's balanced budget plan does target a number of assets for sale to the private sector such as the Power Marketing Administration, the Helium Program, and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation.
<P>
That would be a start, but there are billions of dollars in assets which could still be tapped to reduce government's borrowing.  For example, the Heritage Foundation, in its very useful study, has suggested selling the government's $150 billion portfolio of direct loans to the secondary market.  This is an idea that could generate as much as $100 billion in cash.  Such steps could save taxpayers billions in future interest payments as well as have the advantage of moving such assets out of the government and into the more productive private sector.
<P>

<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
As the Congress goes about the business of putting meat on the bones of the balanced budget plan passed last month, it will have to make tough decisions.  I recognize the difficulty of that task, having served here in the House.  But I've learned that the decisions that are made every day in the corporate world are sometimes even more difficult, because the very survival of a company can be at stake.  The choices you make affect people with real careers, mortgages, and families to raise, to be sure.  But since you oversee an enterprise facing bankruptcy, you can have confidence that the decisions you make, however tough, can help to restore the long-term health of the government, our economy, and our country.
<P>
I thank you for this opportunity to share these thoughts, and I would be happy to entertain questions.

<blockquote>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
<P>
It is a pleasure to address this Committee on a subject which
has wrought enormous devastation on large parts of American society.
It has been well documented that during the last 15 years, American
society has experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.
Almost every social pathology got worse, and many got much worse.
But during this pedod--specifically from 1979 to 1992--there
was one area where we made significant progress: curbing drug
use. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of
drugtaking which began in 1993 and continues to get worse.
<P>
The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural
shift. During the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was
widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun
or mere selfindulgence.  But by the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use became impossible
to deny, it became increasingly -- and far more accurately --
seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.
<P>
Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even
the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.
Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many
states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies. As a result,
overall drug use went down. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s,
casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty percent. Between
1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declilied by almost eighty
percent. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.
<P>
But last year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.
 Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise. According
to the latest study from the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, one in four students has used illegal drugs
before reaching high school; among 8th graders, 13 percent say
they have smoked marijuana in the last year ~ double the rate
of 1991; and over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50
percent of all 12th graders have used some illicit drug, induding
LSD, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack.
<P>
And hospital emergencyroom visits -- dominated by aging, inner
city drug addicts -- have increased to the highest number ever.
Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to
new levels.
<P>
In the words of the Michigan study's principal investigator, Lloyd
D. Johnston, the drug trend is &quot;a problem that is getting
worse at a fairly rapid pace,&quot; and is being abetted by a
dedine in peer disapproval and a general softening of teenagers'
attitudes towards drugs.
<P>
These findings are part of a disturbing pattern, in a series of
studies which have documented a sharp rise in drug use. This increase
in drug use<B> should</B> have mobilized the federal government
to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the
law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens. Instead,
the Clinton administration has abdicated its responsibility. The
Clinton administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs. It has
said or done little to encourage those fighting the good fight
and has proposed fundatientally misguided policies. Indeed, it
has shown much more interest in the baseball strike than in the
devastation of the young by drugs. Consider the record:
<UL>
<LI>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office
of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80 percent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Soon after assuming of fice, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking and related federal crimes. Her focus? She is
engaged in a neverending search for the &quot;root causes&quot;
of crime and drug use.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for
a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions
of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the PBI, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and other federal agencies. It is to the United States
Congress's credit that this proposal was largely rejected.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100
drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut
in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs
from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment
strategy that will do little to target hardcore users.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Last year, the Clinton Administration directed the US. Military
to stop providing radar tracking of cocaine trafficker aircraft
to Colombia and Peru.  Congress again had to reverse this senseless
policy directive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This week, for the first time in history, the nation's drug
control strategy was introduced without the participation of the
president.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>If present trends continue, by 1996 the Clinton Administration
will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern
American history.</I> And let me reiterate: this will have occurred
after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent
between <TT>1979 </TT>(the peak) and <TT>1992, </TT>and a reduction
of almost <TT>80 </TT>percent in cocaine use between <TT>1985
</TT>(the peak for cocaine) and <TT>1992.</TT>
<P>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.
The Clinton admir istration suffers from moral torpor on this
issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, when asked about his
past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never &quot;broken
any drug law.&quot; A year later, he admitted that when he was
in England, he had experimented with marijuana but &quot;I didn't
like it. I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again.&quot; Later,
when asked whether he would inhale if he had it to do over again,
he answered, to laughter: &quot;Sure, if I could. I tried before.&quot;
<P>
Keep in mind, too, that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
has been the administration's most prominent voice on drugs during
the last two years. Throughout her tenure, Dr. Elders had favorable
words to say about drug legalization. And apparently her dismissal
had nothing to do with her irresponsible and outspoken views on
drug policy.
<P>
These statements&#151;as well as massive policy failures&#151;are
significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals
they send. One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic
to occur in the first plate was the collapse of institutional
authority. Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it
stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who served as
President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that &quot;cocaine is
probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread
use.&quot; Today such institutional collapse is echoed in some
segments of the public Just yesterday a Baltimore grand jury recommended
that marijuana be &quot;decriminalized&quot; and that other drugs,
such as cocaine and heroin, be distributed to addicts by doctors.
It's time for all of us to reread <I>A Brave New World.</I>
<P>
Government officials, through legislation and public discourse,
can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts. In a free society,
few things matter more than speaking about the right things in
the right way&#151;and making moral common sense the touchstone
of social policy.
<P>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her &quot;Just
Say No&quot; campaign. But it turns out that &quot;Just Say No&quot;
is far more effective than &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first
two years of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless
poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations. But
today, on one of the issues that disproportionately harms the
poor&#151;that is wiping out many of the children of the poor&#151;he
and his administration have demonstrated indifference.
<P>
That being said, the question remains: where do we go from here?
During the question and answer time, I expect to get into some
spedfics of an effective drug strategy. But here, briefly, is
a framework for what I think would work based on my experience
in the Bush administration.
<P>
If we mean to renew our efforts in the fight against drugs, the
federal government needs to do a number of things. They include
allowing communities to choose their own antidrug priorities by
combining federal antidrug support with that from states and localities;
putting the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal
drugs from abroad, and giving the military control over the entire
interdiction process. We need to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocainesource countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine, and require the Attorney
General first to identify all major drug trafficking organizations
known to be operating in the U.S. and then to create a plan to
dismantle them. In short, there is a lot which the federal government
ought to be doing which it is not now doing.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by making an obvious but often
overlooked point: success in the drug war depends above all on
the efforts of parents and schools and churches and police chiefs
and judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush's
&quot;drug czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made
a point to go where the problem was the worst and to visit and
to learn from the people who made things better. I saw, as just
one example, Reuben Greenberg's heroic efforts in Charleston,
South Carolina, where he cut the crime rate to its lowest point
since the 1950s. I went to public housing projects and innercity
schools and drug treatment programs; I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies. The
people I visited and people all over the country are doing great
work. Ant that work will surely go on. But they deserve to have
the federal government meet its responsibilities, too. And right
now, that's not happening.  It's a disgrace.

Between 1980 and 1992, casual drug use in America declined sharply.  Strong presidential leadership helped cut casual drug use in half between 1977-1992, and reduced the number of cocaine users from almost 3 million in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.
<P>
Since 1992, however, a sustained, intelligent and integrated anti-drug effort has been largely abandoned.  The results are not surprising:  the last four years have brought the greatest increase in teen drug use ever measured.  Consider the facts:
<P>
Illicit drug use is soaring among Americas young people.  Overall use of drugs among 12-17 year olds rose 105 percent between 1992 and 1995.  Fully 2.42 million youths ages 12-17 use drugs on a monthly basis.

Marijuana use functions as the "gateway" to hard drugs.  According to the Center on Addiction and substance Abuse (CASA), teens who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to "graduate" to cocaine than those who abstain.  As CASA director, Joseph Califano noted, "The jump in marijuana use among Americas children from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime . . . Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular users and cocaine a ddicts.</blockquote></td></tr>

Statement by William J. Bennett<br>
on results of the<br>
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
</h3>
<p>
<I>August 20, 1996</I>
</center>
<p>
The huge increase in drug use reported today in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1995 is a national disgrace.  And the Clinton administration should be ashamed of its complete abdication in fighting illegal drug use.
<p>
Since 1992, we have watched the number of drug users go up -- way up -- year after year.  Today we learn that drug use among young people has surged again -- this time by 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Monthly use of marijuana use among the young is up by 37 percent between 1994 and 1995, and up 141 percent since 1992.  This has occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992 and a reduction of almost 80 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (peak for cocaine) and 1992. 
<p>
There has been a well-documented and complete failure of public policy.  But make no mistake: there is more involved here than merely a failure of public policy.  Public policy, after all, is a manifestation of attitude.  And the "root cause" of the Clinton administration's abdication in the battle against illegal drug use is moral confusion and moral weakness.   
<p>
The Clinton administration, for whatever reason, is cavalier, unengaged, and unconcerned about illegal drugs.  It is unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  Democratic congressman Charles Rangel expressed the opinion of many when he said, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."  The motto of the Clinton administration seems to be, "We Just Don't Care" -- and so they are unwilling to act in responsible and effective ways.  Unfortunately this nation is paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's diffidence, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.  
<p>
On the one issue that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many children of the poor -- Bill Clinton and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  The burning of black churches has caused justifiable outrage in the country.  President Clinton has taken it upon himself to speak out, time and again, against church burnings.  And he is right to do so.  But drugs have destroyed many, many, many more black families than church burnings.  Yet on the drug issue Bill Clinton is virtually silent -- in word and in deed.  Even before today's news, we knew that since Bill Clinton became president the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured.  The Clinton administration keeps adding to its infamy.  Fighting the drug epidemic requires courage, intelligence, determination, and above all, moral clarity.  Moral clarity is precisely what is missing at the top of this administration, as well as among the White House staff.

<p>
<H2>DRUGS IN AMERICA</h2>
</center>
<p>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<dd>	From 1980 to 1992, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the federal government mounted a strong offensive against drugs, with real results.  The combined effect of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough law enforcement and a morally firm attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in significant reductions in both the consumption and availability of drugs. <p>
<dd>	Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned the drug war.  Americans have witnessed a failure of public policy brought about by a moral torpor; policy follows attitude.  But, as recent polling suggests, the public's attitude is not one of indifference to the drug issue.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug control policy with the federal government rightfully leading the fight.
<p>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drug use is a major contributing factor to violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, and poverty.  Drugs -- particularly crack cocaine -- have made these and other social pathologies more acute and often unmanageable.
<li>Between 1970 (the peak) and 1992, overall drug use decreased by over 50 percent.   Between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992, overall cocaine use declined by almost 80 percent.  And between 1984 and 1992, annual illicit drug use trends among 12th graders declined by 41 percent.
<li>The latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug use beginning in 1993.  Annual use among 12th graders is up for 1994 by 33 percent.  Marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds nearly doubled from 1992 to 1994.  And high school use of cocaine and hallucinogens has risen precipitously from a low in 1988.
<li>Drug-related hospital emergency room cases have escalated to their highest numbers since 1978.   In 1994 a record high half-million Americans were treated for drug-related problems, with serious increases in those induced by cocaine. 
<li>In a  survey released in December, 1995 by the Gallup Organization, Americans ranked drugs as the second most important problem (behind crime) facing the nation.
<li>The public strongly supports anti-drug education, strict law enforcement and interdiction; and offers little support for increased treatment programs. 
<li>Legalization of drugs is overwhelmingly rejected by Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CURRENT POLICY</H3>
<ul>
<li>Shortly after taking office, President Clinton weakened the power and slashed the staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  He proposed cuts in other agencies that have been at the forefront in the war on drugs -- the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- cuts that were largely rejected by the  U.S. Congress.
<li>The Clinton policy abrogated interdiction, tough law enforcement and mandatory minimum sentences. 
<li>The strong moral message of "Just say no"  gave way to "I didn't inhale;" and to a surgeon general who advocated drug legalization. 
<li>The Clinton administration has concentrated its efforts on an unfocused treatment policy that is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  
</ul>
<p>
<H3> RENEWING THE WAR ON DRUGS</H3>
<ul>
<li>The government should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction process.
<li>America must establish trade and diplomatic sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail to reduce their production.
<li>The federal government must identify and dismantle all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating in the United States.
<li>Law enforcement, drug treatment and prevention education are state and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should be block granted without mandates.
<li>The President should send a clear and frequently-heard anti-drug message from his bully pulpit, making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>JUST SAY NO TO DRUG LEGALIZATION</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and threatening to American society because they are illegal.  They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to American society.
<li>Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
	
It is the first obligation of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Nothing poses a greater threat to both than the scourge of drugs and the violence associated with it.   It is time for the federal government to renew its war on drugs through moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.
