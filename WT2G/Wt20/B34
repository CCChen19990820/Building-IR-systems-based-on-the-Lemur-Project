<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment
rights.
<p>
<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

<p>
Overhauling our nation's tax system ... pessimists say it will never happen -- optimists
simply claim they are in economic nirvana as the debate continues
to swirl around them. Not only has the national debate commenced,
but real pro- posals have been advanced and committee hearings
are already taking place in the United States Congress.
<p>
Every American taxpayer is impacted by the broken tax code. Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit by our punishing,
complex system. The horde of taxes required of them from all levels
of government, com- pounded by the cost and burden of tax compliance,
and the fact that our perplex- ing system changes with the wind,
make the issue of taxation invariably the num- ber one concern
of small enterprises nationwide. 
<p>
Which of the leading tax overhaul proposals is the best system for America and small businesses
and entrepreneurs? The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS
Foundation) is attempting to answer this question, as we study,
examine, analyze and criticize the various proposals as they become
more spe- cific, then overlay those proposals on the small business,
entrepreneurial sector for closer scrutiny. 
<p>
Over the next couple of years, the U.S. Congress will continue to debate which tax
system is best for America. As the "race to the White House" heats up, tax overhaul will become a central issue. 
<p>
One principle has become more solidified as the debate continues -- the entrepreneur
must remain at the core of our economic model. How to stoke the
entrepreneurial spirit must remain at the forefront of developing
a new tax sys- tem. The current U.S. tax code is a catastrophic
failure in this regard -- it punishes risk taking and entrepreneurship,
thus damaging economic growth and opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
The great tax debate has indeed just begun. It is exciting to
watch long-time allies of tax overhaul debating the merits of
each of the proposed systems. I am thrilled that this debate is
taking place. And, I remain optimistic that small businesses
and entrepreneurs -- the backbone of the American economy -- will,
in the end, be the winners of this long overdue revolution in our tax system.

<p>
 We are about to begin one of the most exciting, important debates in our his- tory -- what
kind of tax system we will have as we enter the 21st Century
and the Third Millennium. 
<p>
Public disgust with the current code grows and grows. Americans deeply resent a system which defies understanding, smothers growth, and invites corruption and manipulation.
<p>
Raymond Keating's short, lucid booklet couldn't be better timed.
It will enable concerned citizens to understand the essentials
of this upcoming debate. Keating quickly captures the flaws of
our tax system and then simply and fairly summarizes the alternatives
-- the flat tax, the national sales tax, the value-added tax
and the so-called consumed-income tax. 
<p>
The author's easy-to-understand checklist of criteria enables readers to see why the VAT and the consumed-income tax should be quickly discarded. The flat tax
and a national retail sales tax would both benefit the economy
and be a vast improvement over what we have now. At the end of
this booklet, Keating provides the two utopian versions of these
alternatives. Even if you think them unrealistic, they will make
you realize how truly "low-rated" a tax system can be!
<p>
This booklet will be an essential tool in stoking the debate.
The'96 election is absolutely critical. Unless voters have an
opportunity to give an unmistakable mandate for a fundamental
overhaul, an overhaul will not happen. Too many forces will oppose
it and gut it. Be wary of candidates who refuse to firmly advocate a specific alternative. Timidity, generalities, good intentions will be insufficient to bring about a true tax revolution. <p>
Personally, I am an unabashed advocate of the Dick Armey flat tax. There may
be better alternatives, but I believe it has the best chance to
win political approval next year. But this gets to the virtue
of this booklet -- it succinctly gives you the information you
need to make up your own mind and, just as importantly, to get
involved!

<p>
Entrepreneurs drive the economy. By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations,
the entrepreneur ensures economic renewal and growth. While government
can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing
property rights, government unfortunately more often than not
cre- ates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth. Perhaps
the most for- midable of the many governmental obstacles thrown
in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the
U.S. federal income tax code. 
<p>
As constituted today, the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess. It is complicated,
inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship,
investment, economic growth, and job creation. 
<p>
In fact, only narrow
special interests, lobbyists, lawyers, and tax accountants can
derive any benefit from the current, complex income tax system.
Of course, the system can be largely attributed to their influence
peddling in our nation's organized interests, a complete overhaul
of our tax system has verged on fantasy for the past six to
seven decades - <i>until now</i>. 
<p>
"The Great Tax Debate" has arrived in Washington, D.C. A variety of tax overhaul proposals
are being given serious consideration not only in the many think
tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape but in
the Halls of Congress. 
<p>
In the following pages, we shall examine
criteria for a sound tax system, review the main problems of our
current tax system, analyze alternative proposals, and outline
an ideal tax plan that promotes entrepreneurship and economic
growth. Leading ideas for replacing the current income tax system
include a flat income tax, a national retail sales tax, a "consumed-income"
tax, or a value- added tax (VAT). 

Naturally, every form of taxation has a downside - our goal should be to minimize such distortions our current income tax system fails this test miserably, and the search is on for an imporved tax system.

<blockquote>
I would like to thank Ray Keating and the Small Business Survival Committee, and commend them for the 
hard work they have put into this important booklet.  I unfortunately have been very involved with 
Superfund for several years now.  I am glad, however, that we have this opportunity to address the 
problems with the program and fix it the way it should be fixed.  
<P>
Soon after being elected in 1990, I learned that I had 14 National Priority List (NPL) sites in my district.  
After hearing dozens of real-life horror stories of what these sites were doing to small businesses and 
municipalities, I formed the NH Superfund Task Force.
<P>
We worked for about a year to study the problems and make some suggested solutions.  We came up with a 
series of recommendations which I turned into H.R. 4161, the "Comprehensive Superfund Improvement 
Act," and introduced it in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
While that bill addressed many different areas, the most important part addressed liability.  Specifically, the 
elimination of retroactive liability and the replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share 
allocation system.
<P>
This year I've introduced H.R. 2256.  This is significant legislation because it presents a road map for what 
I believe is the best way to make Superfund work in the fairest and quickest way possible.  My legislation 
will repeal Superfund's unfair, unjust, and un-American retroactive and joint and several liability system 
for actions that were legal at the time.  They will be replaced with a fair share liability system that will only 
hold people responsible for what they actually contributed to a Superfund site.
<P>
Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been spent on Superfund, we now see that a mere 18 
percent of Superfund sites have been cleaned up.  This raises the obvious question of whether or not we are 
getting our money's worth?  These facts -- especially when combined with a GAO report released recently 
which says that only one-third of all Superfund sites pose an actual risk to human health -- make it obvious 
to me that we are not getting our money's worth.
<P>
So what is costing Americans so much money while causing these sites to sit idle for years with no clean 
up?  It is Superfund's misguided liability system.  We can make all the reforms and changes we want to the 
Superfund program, but if we do not fundamentally reform the liability system, we will be back here again 
having the same conversation in a few years.  Taxpayers are spending billions on lawyers while very few 
of these sites are getting cleaned up.
<P>
Recently the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on the impact of Superfund liability on small 
businesses.  What we heard were stories of small businessmen and women from all over the nation about 
how they have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by this program -- all brought about by the current 
liability system.
<P>
We also learned that the Department of Justice spends over $30 million  per year on Superfund 
enforcement.  That's more than they spend on Clean Water, Clean Air, and RCRA enforcement combined!
<P>
In addition to this feeding frenzy for lawyers, the Superfund liability system has created an atmosphere in 
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acts like prosecutor, judge, and jury.  They 
assume you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent, and threaten you with huge fines and criminal 
action if you do not do what they say.
<P>
Once you have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the EPA, your journey is just 
beginning.  You will have to withstand endless EPA inquiries, endure hours of tedious work looking for 
old records from decades ago which may no longer exist, and pay lawyers to represent you and help prove 
your innocence.  Even then you are faced with third-party suits or insurance litigation to recover some or 
all of your costs.  
<P>
EPA and the Department of Justice have taken a program designed to clean up the nation's most toxic sites 
and turned it into a program that feeds the legal system and creates an atmosphere of where they have 
complete and total control over the fate of thousands of small businesses.
<P>
There is such a thing as too much government control, as we all know too well.  Superfund's liability 
system -- in addition to all its other failures -- has led to an out-of-control federal bureaucracy at EPA and 
the Department of Justice at the expense of hard-working Americans.
<P>
Another gentleman who testified before the Small Business Committee told us about how he had been a 
PRP for 8 years, and spent over $10,000 defending himself against a false charge.  Then, moments before a 
Congressional hearing on Superfund reform earlier this year, he was told by EPA Administrator Browner 
that he was no longer a PRP at that site.
<P>
While he was happy to have been let off, the gentleman was livid at the fact that he had spent nearly a 
decade and thousands of dollars fighting, only to be told before a Congressional hearing that he was free -- 
just so Administrator Browner could use it for political points and say "see how cooperative we are?"  Why 
was this man put through the expense and years of personal terror by EPA?  Why are tens of thousands of 
others similarly persecuted by EPA?  It is the liability system -- that's why.
<P>
In summary, the retroactive liability system in current law costs us billions of dollars ... delays clean ups 
for over 10 years ... gives government entirely too much control ... and creates an atmosphere in which 
there is absolutely no effort made to cooperate and in which the constitutional right of "innocent until 
proven guilty" is thrown right out the window.
<P>
The people of the United States deserve nothing less than a full repeal -- they deserve a clean environment 
and they deserve to be assured that their hard-earned tax dollars are going to clean up these sites rather than 
pay for endless armies of lawyers.
<P>
I urge my colleagues to examine every possible method to repeal retroactive liability before they take the 
final vote on Superfund legislation.  Holding people responsible for things they did that were perfectly 
legal is un-American, unfair, unjust, and must be changed.  Superfund is the most flawed law on our books 
and it is unconscionable for us, as legislators, to ignore a process which has destroyed so many people and 
so many businesses.  I urge small businessmen and women around the nation to take action now -- we must 
do what's right.  Let's not use a band-aid for a problem that requires a tourniquet.  Write and call your 
Congressmen and Senators now, and tell them you want fundamental liability reform in any Superfund 
reform package.
<P>
Best wishes.

After years of watching billions of taxpayers dollars wasted, and thousands of small businesses legally and 
economically terrorized, the United States Congress has finally recognized that it is time to overhaul the 
federal law named "Superfund."
<P>
Since its inception fifteen years ago, Superfund has principally served not as a means to cleaning up 
hazardous materials, but rather as a feeding trough for lawyers and bureaucrats alike.  These individuals 
seem to care little about the environment, being more concerned with enriching themselves at the expense 
of innocent parties and unsuspecting taxpayers.  Through this booklet, "Highly Toxic: The Superfund 
Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee 
(SBSC) reveals Superfund's misguided beginnings and how it has turned into a surreal nightmare for those 
caught in its web.
<P>
Regardless of "good" intentions, Superfund has cleaned up only a fraction of the so-called waste sites 
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite the fact that the federal government 
and the private sector together have spent at least $90 billion on clean up costs.  With future expenditure 
estimates as high as $1.25 trillion, Superfund indeed should be closely scrutinized.
<P>
Practically every aspect of Superfund is a mess -- a prime candidate for the "dysfunctional-government 
poster program."  The EPA's criteria for selecting Superfund sites, its designation of "potentially 
responsible parties," and the allocation of clean up costs are all grossly misguided.
<P>
Over 17,000 pages of regulations have been issued in the Federal Register on Superfund.  Most 
disturbingly, the hand of Superfund extends retroactively -- unfairly dragging businesses, cities and other 
innocent parties into legal battles.  Estimates place up to half of the resources exhausted on clean up going 
to legal and administrative fees.  In particular, small businesses and entrepreneurs simply cannot absorb the 
large, inflated costs of clean up.  Nor can they afford to engage in legal squabbles that involve being 
targeted by the EPA as a "polluter."
<P>
Superfund certainly is more hazardous to small businesses, taxpayers and local governments than the waste 
materials it was supposed to clean up.  When the new Congress talks of reining in the unbridled regulatory 
monster, clearly Superfund must be at the top of the list.  "Highly Toxic" examines the history, costs and 
effects of Superfund in order to educate the public, media and lawmakers about a program careening out of 
control.  This booklet also offers common-sense reform measures to clean up a government program 
proven to be toxic for businesses and taxpayers alike.

Can you imagine the federal government getting involved in an issue for all the wrong reasons and 
eventually making matters worse rather than better?  Of course you can.  Indeed, many of us see this as the 
case with numerous federal government endeavors -- from various taxes, rules and regulations to welfare, 
education and health care.
<P>
In 1980, the federal government injected itself deeply into the process of cleaning up hazardous and not-so-
hazardous waste sites across the nation with the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act -- better known as "Superfund."  Undertaken for the wrong reasons, 
Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often 
unsuspecting individuals and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national 
woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many 
businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job 
growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.
<P>
Small businesses -- seeking out additional capital for growth or often just fighting to stay alive -- are 
particularly vulnerable to a Superfund gone awry.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which 
they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a 
thick fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring problem with Superfund, though, is its mechanism for assigning liability to 
perfectly innocent parties.  Under this perverse federal legislation, if you disposed of waste -- toxic or non-
toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, you 
could still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  
Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.
<P>
Despite massive amounts of both private and public expenditures, few of the waste sites targeted for clean 
up by the EPA under Superfund actually have been cleaned up.
<P>
Indeed, individuals from across the economic and political spectrums believe that Superfund has been an 
abysmal failure.  Differences arise, however, as to whether the program merely needs some fine tuning, a 
complete overhaul, or outright termination.
<P>
The following pages will provide an overview of Superfund's history, examine its impact on business,  
entrepreneurship and the economy, and offer much-needed reform measures.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">The Origin of Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
As children, many of us read comic books that told tales of our favorite superheros.  Seemingly without 
failure, our hero gained super powers due to the fallout -- usually of the radiation variety --  from some 
industrial accident or government experiment gone awry.  The fictional hero would then go on to a long 
career of fighting crime, righting wrongs,  and battling various evil-doers.
<P>
In similar fashion, Superfund gained its powers due to the political fallout from a particular waste site.  
Unfortunately, in this case, fiction became part of reality.  Love Canal gave birth to Superfund.
<P>
Most of us have heard, at least casually, the story of how a private company's waste dump created an 
environmental catastrophe affecting families and children in Love Canal, New York -- leading to an 
evacuation.  Thankfully, in a recent article, CATO Institute economist Jerry Taylor reminded us of the true 
story behind Love Canal.1  
<P>
The company in question -- the Hooker Electrochemical Company -- "legally disposed of 21,800 tons of its 
wastes in the abandoned canal trenches of the area from 1942 to 1953."  The company chose this particular 
area due to the impermeable clay soil, which would protect groundwater, and its rural nature, limiting 
potential exposure.  However, the expanding suburbs of Niagara Falls started to encroach on the site, and 
the local school board sought the land for an elementary school.  Hooker initially refused to sell, but the 
board threatened to use its power of eminent domain.  Hooker fully informed the school board of all the 
risks -- including having them present at on-site tests.  Nonetheless, the board "bought" the land from 
Hooker for $1.2  
<P>
Taylor explains the subsequent damage wrought by the school board:
<P>
  "Hooker Electrochemical's careful attempts to contain the waste and warn of the site's dangers were 
immediately undone by the school board.  Thousands of cubic yards of the clay cap [laid by Hooker] were 
scraped away in the course of constructing the school and later during the landscaping of a housing 
development that was built on the site.  The board's attempted sale of the land in 1957 for residential 
purposes was vigorously opposed by Hooker."3  
<P>
Alas, Hooker pleaded to no avail.  The land was sold to developers, and the construction of city sewer lines 
breached the site.  Taylor observes: "What we have, then, is not a parable of rapacious, shortsighted 
capitalists putting profit above public health, but the story of a conscientious company whose best efforts 
were undone by shortsighted public officials who put immediate political return above the general 
welfare."4  
<P>
By largely riding public outcry over this misunderstood incident, the federal government passed the 
Superfund legislation in 1980.  As the reader will quickly see, Superfund is no super program.  Heroes 
cannot be found in this story, only villains and victims.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">The Superfund Prescription</a></CENTER></H3>

Superfund was built on the dubious assumption that the federal government should trump states and 
localities in terms of dealing with waste sites across the nation.  
<P>
Initially, Superfund was intended to force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes and to deal with 
"orphan" sites -- sites abandoned where responsible parties could not be found.  Congress originally 
authorized a trust fund of $1.6 billion for orphan-site clean ups -- thought more than adequate at the time.  
With the 1990 budget deal, the fund ballooned to more than $15 billion.5   The EPA -- with no objection 
from our federal elected officials -- greatly expanded the scope of Superfund.
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the National Priority List (NPL).  The EPA then 
tracks down "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) and assigns responsibility and costs for waste site 
clean ups.  Increasingly, though, the EPA forces PRPs to undertake the clean up from the very start.  Non-
compliance without "sufficient cause" results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.6   
<P>
In determining liability, the EPA utilizes highly questionable criteria:<ul>

<li> Superfund allows for strict liability -- regardless of intent or negligence.

<li> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So 
even if firms were in full compliance of the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.

<li> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business 
pay for the clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without 
consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  
Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to 
the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

<li> Indeed, current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste 
problem can be held liable.

<li> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt 
under Superfund.</ul>
<P>
The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" 
-- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, 
sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with 
the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep 
pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of at a site by a firm is far too often not factored into this liability 
scheme.  So a firm depositing fairly innocuous materials may still be held liable.  Indeed, the actual degree 
of risk for damaging exposure to hazardous wastes hardly plays into the determination process for a 
Superfund site at all.  James Bovard notes, "A study by the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment concluded that half of all Superfund cleanups 'address hypothetical risks rather than actual 
ones.'"7 
<P>
Also, the degree of cleanliness required by the EPA often falls far beyond the realm of common sense.  For 
example, waste sites need to be cleaned to "background conditions," far in excess of human safety 
requirements and beyond prevailing conditions prior to contamination; groundwater under a site must be 
made clean enough to drink (often technologically impossible); and dirt is required to be so clean that a 
person could eat (!) half a teaspoon every month for 76 years and not get cancer.8  
<P>
If you think such a system possesses enormous potential to develop into a costly, legal quagmire, you are 
absolutely correct.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="six">Superfund's Toxic Effects -- 
Dismal Results at Staggering Costs</a></CENTER> </H3>

As is the case with so many federal government endeavors, Superfund has fallen far short of its original 
goals while generating a host of new ills.  And these ills are felt by individuals and enterprises caught in the 
Superfund web, taxpayers, entire industries, and the economy in general.  
<P>
The overall costs are weighty:
<ul><p>
<li> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the NPL, only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- 
according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.9  One should note that this is a most optimistic 
accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 
1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."

<li> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick 
in another $80 billion.10  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 
million, according to economist James Bovard.11  However, on September 29, 1995, The Washington 
Times reported it generally takes 8 years for clean up to actually begin, and then another 12 to 15 years to 
clean up the site.

<li> On average, transaction costs account for 32 percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with 
litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.12  As reported in a recent 
Investor's Business Daily article (September 29, 1995), U.S. Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and 
Sherwood Boelhert (R-NY) claim that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for legal fees alone.

<li> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract 
capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint 
and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away 
investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.
<P></ul>
Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over 
it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund 
liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even higher.
<P>
A survey of small businesses conducted by the American Council for Capital Formation confirmed these 
facts.  In a January 1994 report, it was noted that 39.1 percent of small business respondents reduced or 
delayed investment in plant and equipment due to being named a PRP.  Almost half of respondents with 0-
19 employees canceled or postponed investment.
<P>
The blow to the economy and job creation from this reduced investment are manifest.
<ul><p>
<li> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous 
liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing long-time or formerly industrialized areas.  
Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on 
the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and 
Superfund adds to these costs.

<li> Incentives are skewed for local governments and communities as well.  With the federal government and 
private parties picking up the tab for a Superfund site clean up, localities possess every incentive to push 
for clean ups to go well beyond reasonable levels.  They are not restrained by cost concerns, as someone 
else foots the bill. Economist Robert Hahn has noted that local communities often seek "gold-plated" clean 
ups as they reap nearly all the benefits while the costs are swallowed by a large number of taxpayers and 
consumers.13  Only when localities are named as PRPs does one witness restraint.

<li> Finally, according to a study by the Center for the Study of American Business, "Superfund imposes 
much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than 
these companies would be required to meet in other countries."14  Most notably, in nations like Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of 
their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.15  
<p></ul>
Individual Superfund horror stories abound, and the most horrific tend to pertain to small businesses -- 
those least able to afford or survive a governmental assault of the Superfund magnitude.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li> A small camera and film-developing store reportedly was held liable for the massive clean-up costs of a 
Superfund site in Glenwood Landing, New York.16 

<li> Hundreds of businesses and nonprofit groups, including a hospital, several public schools, and a pizza 
parlor, have been forced to pay large costs for cleaning up the Ludlow Sanitary Landfill in New York.17  
Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork over $11,000, originally destined for store 
improvements, because the glue from cardboard boxes he shipped to Ludlow was deemed hazardous.18  

<li> Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma was notified by the EPA that it would be held 
responsible for the clean up of a local Superfund site.  Why?  Apparently for nothing more than paying 
someone $14 in 1972 to haul trash to the site.19

<li> Robert M. Cox Jr. lost his business because the Superfund liability scheme forced him to pay for the 
neglect of others.  He had to sell his furniture coating business -- Gilbert Spruance Co. of Oreland, 
Pennsylvania -- due to excessive legal fees and liability costs.  His waste had been disposed of at 11 
different sites despite an agreement with a waste hauler for disposal in one landfill.20  

<li>Kaplan's Careful Cleaners of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania was held liable for waste deposited according to 
the "letter of the law" 10 years ago at a site now on the Superfund list.21  

<li> H. Petert Nerger, president of Marisol Inc. of Middlesex, New Jersey, reported recently that even though 
his solvent recycling operations have not generated any wastes since the 1984 land ban under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and despite the fact that previously the state told him where to deposit his 
waste, "our existence is threatened by retroactive liability."22  

<li> Automobile dealers in the Fresno, California area have become victims of what can be termed "drive by 
liability."  EPA bureaucrats reportedly put a former truck driver behind the wheel of a car and asked him to 
select establishments where he picked up used oil in the past and how much.23  

<li> In 1987, Eugene Ardelt bought the Mesa Fiberglass Products Company and soon after became a PRP at 
the Lowery Landfill Superfund site in Denver.  It did not matter that Ardelt had never dumped toxic waste 
at the landfill, nor that the previous owner's dumping was perfectly legal.  Ardelt spent $25,000 in legal 
fees and eventually settled with the EPA for $2,000.24  

<li> A small chemical company in Massachusetts -- Nyacol Products Inc. -- is being held as a PRP at the 
Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site because it currently owns the property.  This despite the 
fact that the EPA acknowledges that Nyacol had nothing at all to do with the site's contamination.25 
</ul><p>
These few examples fail to even scratch the surface.  Stories of Superfund atrocities seem endless.  And 
one should remember that while the costs are high for individuals and the economy, the safety benefits 
derived by individuals and improvements to the environment remain in question.  No one wins under the 
Superfund scenario of high costs and few clean ups.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="seven">Department of Justice Defends 
Superfund Injustice</a></CENTER>
</H3>
It is worth examining the arguments made by Superfund's supporters.  These were most recently 
encapsulated on October 19, 1995, when Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer from the 
Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice testified regarding 
Superfund before the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business.  In general, Ms. Schiffer 
found little fault with Superfund.  
<P>
Indeed, Schiffer declared: "We believe that the Superfund liability and enforcement scheme has been very 
effective in carrying out the 'polluter pays' principle. "  As with all supporters of Superfund, Schiffer 
throws around the term "polluter" in a reckless manner.  No consideration is given to the intent of 
individuals and the legality of their actions.  If a small business owner disposed of a small amount of waste 
in a completely legal and ethical manner, for example, he becomes a "polluter" when Superfund is invoked.
<P>
Later in her testimony, Ms. Schiffer paints a picture of a government agency working with the private 
sector in full cooperation: "During the 15 years of its existence, the enforcement program has evolved from 
a litigation focus into a program in which most responsible parties enter into settlements or voluntarily 
comply with administrative orders, rather than litigating with the government."  Of course, mention of 
harsh EPA fines and threats of holding particular parties responsible for the entire clean up of a waste site 
go unmentioned.
<P>
Schiffer also praised a 1986 change in Superfund legislation which according to the Assistant Attorney 
General "prevents responsible parties from delaying cleanups by seeking judicial review and stays of EPA's 
remedies or orders before the government seeks judicial enforcement."  Of course, if one is on the 
receiving end of such "remedies or orders" the story can be quite different.  In testimony also given on 
October 19, John B. DeVinck, a car dealer from Superior Wisconsin, offered a slightly different assessment 
of restrictions on PRPs:
<P>
"My dealership arranged to transport used oil to [the Arrowhead Refining Company site] during a single 
nine-month period in 1976 when my regular used oil company was on strike.  I did not send used oil to 
Arrowhead during any other period of time, and have witnesses and sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.  
Regrettably, EPA and the PRP group who sued me refused to accept my supporting evidence and the 
testimony of witnesses.  With no jury or other fact finding on the EPA's part and no documentary records 
or evidence, they calculated the maximum amount of oil each dealership generated and assumed it was sent 
to Arrowhead during its 1944-77 operating life, assessing liability based on that maximum amount."
<P>
It was decided that DeVinck sent 31,855 gallons over the period 1960 to 1976.  Based on his own samples 
from various years, DeVinck calculated that over the actual nine months he sent his used oil to Arrowhead, 
he was responsible for about 1,000 gallons.  He has been involved in the PRP process for over five years 
now.  His costs include more than $100,000 in attorney and consultant fees, liability finally set at $70,000 
(down from an original "guess-timate" of $460,000 and then $230,000), plus $8,000 in interest.
<P>
In closing his testimony, DeVinck noted: "In my case, the $78,000 of cleanup liability I was assessed is an 
absolute travesty of justice.  The problem was that I couldn't prove a negative.  It was impossible to prove 
that I didn't contribute the huge amounts of used oil alleged."
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Schiffer also praised the fact that the 1986 Superfund amendments directed the 
EPA to select more "permanent" clean up remedies.  Of course, in many instances, this increases the cost of 
clean ups.  Federal lawmakers and bureaucrats clearly should not be dictating how far a clean up must go; 
this should be left to localities and the states who have a better understanding of local communities.
<P>
Some Superfund proponents have argued that Superfund was needed to establish a liability structure for 
cleaning up waste sites.  In fact, in her testimony, Schiffer inadvertently shows that no such need existed: 
"Before 1980, there was liability for contamination caused by hazardous waste disposal under the common 
law of public nuisance" and even strict liability "for harm caused by ultrahazardous activities."  She 
asserted that Superfund "was needed to provide response authority and funding for cleaning up hazardous 
waste sites, and to make rules of liability consistent and clear on a national basis."  With common law 
precedence and state or local government action possible, however, the need for federal action did not, and 
does not, exist.
<P>
Ms. Schiffer justified each aspect of Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability scheme, 
as noted below.  Any true defender of justice should be disturbed by these justifications.  A response is 
supplied to each major justification for Superfund's liability regime offered by the Assistant Attorney 
General: 
<P><ul>
<li> Schiffer went so far as to justify strict liability under Superfund because, "Litigating 'fault,' as in tort 
cases, is extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive."  
Response.  According to the Assistant Attorney General's testimony, under strict and joint and several 
liabilities, justice seems to be sacrificed for governmental expediency.  This would be bad enough, 
however, in reality under Superfund, justice is sacrificed for absolutely no expediency whatsoever.  Clean 
ups take more than 10 years on average to be completed, while litigation costs skyrocket. 

<li> Retroactive liability rests, to say the least, on quite precarious grounds based on Schiffer's justifications: 
<p><ol><li> "it is perfectly fair to ask the parties who make a mess to clean it up;" <li> "the companies who created 
problems caused by Superfund sites benefitted economically from the manufacturing and other activities 
that generated these hazardous wastes;" and <li>"at least some of the companies who disposed of hazardous 
wastes were well aware of the dangers the wastes posed long before the public was."  <p></ol>
Response.  Schiffer's arguments supporting retroactive liability ignore the facts that entities not responsible, 
in any significant meaning of the word, are paying for cleaning up messes across the nation.  If economic 
benefit is a justification for retroactivity, then the retroactive liability net has to be cast much wider to 
capture consumers, various levels of government and taxpayers, other related businesses, etc.  And  if a 
handful of companies may have been aware of dangers the public was not, that is certainly no justification 
for punishing all businesses involved.  
<P>
<li> Finally, Schiffer argues that "joint and several liability is a longstanding common law rule that has been 
applied by the courts in CERCLA cases brought by the government, at sites where there is more than one 
responsible party and the harm is divisible."  She also asserted that joint and several liability is an efficient 
course of action, and if repealed would increase litigation costs.<P>
Response.  As for joint and several liability, Schiffer cites a supporting case -- Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 
80 (Sup. Ct. Cal. 1948).  However, she notes that the defendants in this case actually "acted wrongfully."  
To say that a small business disposing waste according to the letter of the law and in good conscience is in 
any way acting wrongfully is a clear perversion of the law.
<P></ul>
When these shaky arguments are the best that can be mustered in defense of Superfund, serious questions 
should arise in everyone's minds -- especially our federal elected officials.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eight">What To Do?</a></CENTER></H3>

As we have seen, Superfund's problems are numerous and substantial.  In this booklet's introduction, it was 
noted that disagreement exists as to whether Superfund was in need of merely some fine tuning, a complete 
overhaul, or outright termination.
<p>
The long and costly list of problems identified here safely rules out mere fine tuning.  Economics and 
common sense dictate termination of Superfund, but politics may require something short of that -- a 
complete overhaul.  The following reform measures are offered as a three-step process:<p><ol><li> short-term 
reforms, <li> a major overhaul of Superfund, and <li> Superfund's termination.</ol><p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="nine">1) Short-term Superfund Reform Measures</a></CENTER>
</H3>
In order to get the Superfund reform process moving, several steps can be taken immediately that create a 
somewhat saner environment.  These include repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 
1987 -- eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 on, basing liability 
on the proportion of waste a party contributed to a site; using science-based risk assessment and cost-
benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies; and capping the number of Superfund NPL sites 
to gain some control over potential costs.

<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="ten">2) Completely Overhauling Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
The following reforms would go far in overhauling the Superfund program:<ul>

<li> Completely repeal strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  Fairness and common sense 
dictate that no one should be held liable for exercising good judgment and following the law, and certainly 
not for actions taken before a law was passed.

<li> Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were 
negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  To reiterate, parties 
that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have 
absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  So even proportional liability 
reforms -- where liability is determined by the amount and type of waste an enterprise contributed to the 
site -- while improvements over the current system, still remain fundamentally unfair and must eventually 
give way.
</ul>
If the federal government insists on operating a Superfund program, based on the dubious belief that 
individual waste sites amount to a federal issue, then funding should be attained from true polluters, and 
where no real polluters can be found, unfortunately, through federal taxes.  However, in the end, more 
needs to be done than a complete overhaul of Superfund.  Federal taxpayers should not have to pay for 
local waste sites.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eleven">3. The Case for Terminating Superfund</a></CENTER></H3>

In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or 
undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  
Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better 
position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary 
clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    
<P>
In fact, state and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local 
individuals possess a better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA 
bureaucrats.
<P>
Indeed, the proper order of responsibility -- again,  barring federal operation, mandates or laws --  should 
be:
<P><ol>
<li>Private parties guilty of breaking the law, negligence, fraud, etc.;
<li>Local government action;
<li>State government action.
</ol><p>
The case for terminating the federal Superfund program is strong, especially at a time when Congress is 
seeking to re-establish a proper relationship between federal, state, and local governments.  True federalism 
dictates that those issues that can be dealt with at the state or local level should be left at the state or local 
level.  Not that these particular governmental layers are necessarily any more efficient than the federal 
government, but state or local officials should possess some better understanding of a community's needs, 
including the area of a waste-site clean up.
<p>
In the end, Superfund should be discontinued and the several taxes supporting it terminated.  This is the 
most responsible step the federal government can take when it comes to waste sites across the nation.

The Predictable Perversities of Bureaucratic Behavior

<p>
There is a strong tendency for such organizations to be run for the benefit
of those in charge. This has profound implications for those in the agency
and for those they are to serve.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial
portion of its budget from transfers. When the bureaucracy is a government
agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent. I do
not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize
clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest. It impairs my viewshed, silts
my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities,
and lowers the value of my property. Unfortunately, we have no choice but
to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of
what is right.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt. Its programs pay off
too many politicians and special interests to prevent this economically
rational and environmentally preferable outcome. Unlike Apple Computer,
the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist. So long as
their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can
mix good deeds with genuine plunder.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization. Most
corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers within the
company, e.g. public affairs departments. These units, however, are rarely
if ever dominant. Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that
generate income by selling products to willing buyers. While research and
public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies
are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's
mission than that of government agencies. Deviations are constrained by
those who watch the bottom line.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however
noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the
benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.
There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.
Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced
sense of purpose. Few organizations have it.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies'
self-serving tendencies to become more pronounced. For instance, although
both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be
more corrupt than the BIA. Fortunately for their leaders, we will never
know.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university
parking with that of shopping malls. In malls, employees, including
managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way,
inconvenient location. The decision-makers who determine parking rules find
it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government
agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots
marked with titles if not names. Even a former university president, driven
from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his
preferential parking privileges. The perfidious president preserved his
privileges.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and
control over resources. This logic trumps the purpose justifying their
creation. What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual
teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the
dark and slog through seven months of Montana slush if those who
make the rules are spared these costs? A mall based on such privilege would
soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such
pressures.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
None of this is surprising. And it would be as naive to rail against as to
protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by
politicians. That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale
and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate. By
then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix. Ration the
parking spaces by price. People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in
a cheap or free area. Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or
dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to
preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries. Truly
handicapped individuals can have reserved parking. I've yet to hear a
reasonable objection to this.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land? Such a
reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little
cost to pay for their privilege. It was indeed an aberration when Congress
made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live. This
too will erode. For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that
bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.
To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of Montana State
University in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner
party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus
parking.

<h2>
Fostering a new west that respects old values
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/baden.html">     
John Baden     
</a>     
<p>
New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.
Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives.
They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and
bring with them an utterly different value system for the land. A value
system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that
matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation. They
demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values. Many
locals are resentful.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation
and cooperation. Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard
labor that traditional Western jobs require. And long-time residents need
to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers. Both must
recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and
values that have long defined the West. Here's a story from a recent trip
to Oregon State University, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames
the debate for me. I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new
West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I used to work in the woods. Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and
Idaho. I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific
Northwest, and in 1977, I finally got the chance. On sabbatical leave from
my regular university post, I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State
University. This left plenty of time to work in the woods.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly 20 years later I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a
few days of meetings. Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks
and other signs of fundamental change. While Ramona worked with her fellow
academics, I rode my bike. One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to
Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber. I
wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and
maintained. In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner. Also, I
needed a new saw.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.
I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop. It spent its declining years on
our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood. That's an easy
life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront
more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy. It's hard-core, a good
place to find recipes for spotted owl. My Lycra was on trespass in
corked-boot territory. Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust
was the same. The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking
old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter. He looked
up from his work as I entered.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hi, Ken," I said. "Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around
1977? Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days
a week? You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd
known he was professor." I took off my Bolles.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Damn! Hi, John." He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand. We exchanged
news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong
reasons. "With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every
farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees," he
said. "Less wood more saws. Not many pros in the woods anymore." He is
looking towards the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut
his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years. The changing values of the
new West aren't for Ken.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out. Will you send me a new
one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me," I said,
"but I have a Visa card."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hell, don't bother. Just send me a check when you get home."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an
extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:
<br>
<center>LEBANON
<center>Saw Shop Lebanon,
<center>Oregon
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I put it on to finish writing this essay. And I thought about trust-about
how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust. Twenty years and
a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work

I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old. Trust
that comes from working together is high on my list. Its presence in my own
life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of
stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.

<center><h2>William F. Buckley Jr.</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Editor-at-Large, National Review</b>
<p>
<p>
William Buckley, the founder of National Review and its 
editor-in-chief until 1990, covers a wide range of political, 
cultural, and economic issues in his syndicated columns, 
which appear in NR, and in articles and reviews written 
specifically for the magazine.  Although he has handed over 
the editorial reins to John OSullivan, he continues as the 
magazines president and editor-at-large, and he produces 
his "Notes & Asides" column each issue.
<p>
Buckley served in the Army during World War II before 
matriculating at Yale University, from which he graduated 
in 1950.  He had published his first two books, "God and 
Man at Yale" and (with L. Brent Bozell) "McCarthy and 
His Enemies," before founding National Review in 1955.  
He began his syndicated column, "On the Right," in 1962, 
and launched his weekly television show, Firing Line, in 
1966; in between, he ran for mayor of New York City in 
1965, and received 13.4% of the vote on the Conservative 
Party ticket.  He has served on the Advisory Commission of 
the United States Information Agency (1969-72), and as 
Public Member of the U.S. Delegation to the UN General 
Assembly (1973).  His 31 books include political analyses, 
sailing books, and the Blackford Oakes spy novels.  He is 
the recipient of numerous awards, including Best Columnist 
of the Year (1967), a Television Emmy for Program 
Achievement (1969), the American Book Award for Best 
Mystery (paperback) for Stained Glass (1980), and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom (1991).<p>

<h2>
You Figure It Out
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The most recent objection to the Communications Decency Act was filed 
on Monday by Microsoft, the American Library Association, and the 
Society for Professional Journalists. Their arguments are much the 
same as those of the American Civil Liberties Union filed about eight 
minutes after the bill was signed by President Clinton. And days after 
that, the District Court in Philadelphia estopped enforcement of the 
Act on the grounds that the word &quot;decency&quot; was insufficiently defined. 
Argument will proceed. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here are points to consider in this rerun of the People v. Obscenity, 
in which Obscenity regularly wins.
<ol>
<li>The vote in the House was 414 to 16 in favor of the Act. In the 
Senate, 91 to 5. And of course, President Clinton signed it. That's 
506 out of 527 human beings all of whom swore to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States. Yet learned and experienced men and 
women who oppose the Act merely laugh at any suggestion that they 
actually did believe the Act to be constitutional. Specifically, Ira 
Glasser, the Executive Director of the ACLU, and Susan Estrich, 
Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, who eight 
years ago managed the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. What's 
going on here?

<li>By way of background, what sometimes is lumped in under obscenity 
is three categories of material. One is erotica: Literature or art 
intended to arouse sexual desire (American Heritage Dictionary). A 
second is pornography: Pictures, writing, or other material that is 
sexually explicit (AHD). A third is perversity. This is the stuff of 
the Marquis de Sade. 

<li>Perversity is every now and then stopped. A few weeks ago, the 
felony conviction of Robert and Carleen Thomas was upheld. Their gig 
was something called Amateur Action, a computer bulletin board that 
advertised itself as The Nastiest Place on Earth, and featured graphic 
images of children raped by their parents, and other stuff the fingers 
balk at even typing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the ACLU takes the position that the First Amendment protects any 
&quot;speech.&quot; And indeed it does, but the great swindle of the century has 
been the transmutation of obscenity into &quot;speech.&quot; The absolutists go 
a long way: burning the American flag is a form of speech, they tell 
you. This would be understandable if the person protesting American 
policy were blind and dumb and had available to him to express himself 
on Capitol Hill only a box of matches and a few American flags. This 
is not to say that the lines between erotica and pornography or 
pornography and perversion are clearly drawn, but neither is the line 
clearly drawn that demands &quot;reasonable&quot; compliance with various 
provisions of the law. 

<li>Perspectives change, and they have changed during the past fifty 
years in the direction of promiscuity. In the early Sixties reasonable 
people differed on whether Fanny Hill was obscene (Answer: Of course 
it's obscene, and it's a delight). During the Sixties, Simone de 
Beauvoir was pleading the &quot;right&quot; to read the Marquis de Sade (&quot;Must 
We Burn de Sade?&quot;). So that the question became muddled: Ought works 
of obscenity and even perversion be permitted to exist (i.e., should 
they not be burned?); or, as was the case in France for 175 years, is 
the work of de Sade something that should be kept in the libraries for 
the edification of those whose business it is to probe the forlorn 
atolls of twisted minds?

<li>Leaving us with the Internet. There are obscenity laws that apply 
to television broadcasting, though they are lax; and to radio; and, as 
a matter of fact, to telephone lines. The philosophical postulate here 
is that the air is public property and government has custodial 
responsibilities over that which belongs to the people, who can 
through their representatives define toxicity as more merely than 
particulates emitted by asbestos, or whatever. The Communications 
Decency Act is aimed at protecting children, and prosecutions under it 
are supposed to bear the burden of proving that the smut-merchants had 
every reason to believe that children would be tapping in on their 
product. The lawyers call this scienter, knowingly. But the ACLU is 
correct here that whatever one's hopes for Internet-style V-chips that 
would block out noxious web sites, there can't be any assurance that 
the horny 16-year-old isn't going to succeed in tapping in on that 
stuff.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In which event you may have a law that is unenforceable, but does that 
make it unconstitutional?

<BR>
<B>His political art appears artless</B>. He is a partisan truly loved by
colleagues in the opposition party, as well as in his own. Fellow politicians
appreciate his unusual habit of giving credit rather than taking it. In
four elected offices over a cumulative 32 years, he remains one of the few
candidates who promised a voluntary limit on the terms he would serve, and
then followed through.<BR>
<BR>
	Lt. Governor Joel Pritchard is retiring from elective politics in January.
He recently conquered another bout with cancer, and &quot;Physically, he
could beat two thirds of the legislators in a foot race,&quot; says long
time aide Maury Hauser. &quot;And,&quot; he quips,  &quot;Joel has always
had excellent mental health, especially for a politician.&quot; But, at
71, Pritchard decided not to see re-election.<BR>
<BR>
	Friends think that if he had run, he would have enjoyed a third term victory
election night. So nearly 600 of them planned a &quot;Victory Party&quot;
for him anyway. Leading officials, including former Speaker Tom Foley, were
set to attend on Wednesday, as were ordinary citizens whose lives Pritchard
has touched in politics, tutoring or civic affairs. But then came the big
snow. The party was postponed.<BR>
<BR>
	Thirty two years ago he already was a standout new state representative
from the Queen Anne-Magnolia area when I first met and interviewed him.
Along with some other young legislators, including Dan Evans and Slade Gorton,
he was the subject of  an article for a magazine back in Washington, D.C.
on &quot;The New Breed in Washington State.&quot; Pritchard told me, and
the article foretold, the strategy that this New Breed--young, label free,
steeped in community work and practical ideas--was following to gain a GOP
majority in the legislature and then the governorship. It all came true.
Dan Evans became governor, elected in '64, and then Slade Gorton became
Attorney General. But what about Joel?<BR>
<BR>
	The logical step up was Congress. Joel and his brother Frank, &quot;The
Pritchard Boys,&quot; were seasoned businessmen at the Griffin Envelope
Company, but in politics they were only successful amateurs. They mainly
had aided older men such as Gov. Art Langley and a string of non-partisan
Seattle mayors. One candidate they had helped was Congressmen Thomas Pelly,
who served the north Seattle and suburban First District  ably, but long.
Joel Pritchard hankered to succeed him. In a daring bid, he confronted Pelly
in the primary election of 1970, failing, but coming too close for Pelly's
comfort. The incumbent moved his retirement plans forward, and Pritchard
was the easy winner of the nomination in 1972.<BR>
<BR>
	Trouble was, in the final election, the upbeat Pritchard faced attacks
from a vigorous Democratic opponent. He never answered the attacks and on
election night his opponent, John Hempelman, finished ahead by 1900 votes
in the regular count. But, in a story whose example echoes down to the belated
1996 victories of Reps. Jack Metcalf and Linda Smith,  Pritchard's manager,
Bob Davidson, had  hopes that a letter sent earlier to each voter who had
applied for an absentee ballot would rescue Pritchard. He needed  a whopping
58 percent of the absentees to overcome Hempelman's lead. He got 60 percent,
and finally emerged victorious, with 2622 votes to spare. <BR>
<BR>
	Back in the capitol, the dean of the state Congressional delegation, Democratic
Sen. Warren Magnuson, invited Pritchard into his office. &quot;Joey,&quot;
he said, &quot;now that you're part of the team we don't intend to take
you on again.&quot; And he--and the rest of the nearly solid Democratic
delegation--did not.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard in Congress got a lot done, quietly. Everybody's favorite tennis
companion, his self-effacing statecraft was shrewd as well as virtuous.
It enabled him to get far more done than might be expected of a relatively
junior member of a minority party. He still doesn't brag, but former staffers
are pleased to note that he wrote the first drafts of such significant legislation
as the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Park and the Klondike Gold Rush International
Park. As a one man crusader, he overcame the Democratic leadership's plan
to convert the new Library of Congress building, now known as The Madison
Library, into Congressional offices. In foreign policy, he was an ardent
promoter of free trade and a greater foreign policy emphasis on Asia.<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard had promised to leave Congress after 12 years, and in 1984, he
did so. But back in Seattle he began to recall his happy days in the state
senate. In 1988 he was easily elected Lt. Governor, in another of his low
cost, friendly campaigns. In Olympia, too, he was a force for civility and
quiet persuasion. He worked effectively against legalized gambling and for
campaign finance reform. With Frank Schronz, Chairman of Boeing, he became
a major player in the Partnership for Learning project that is trying to
assure that the state's law on education reform is implemented thoroughly.
It would not be a surprise to see Pritchard continuing in that crucial effort
after January.<BR>
<BR>
	But on the last day of the recent session, presiding peacefully over the
Senate for the final time, he received a shock. A new and supposedly routine
resolution was working the senators into an uproar. The Republican and Democratic
staff attorneys upon whose advice Pritchard--in typical bi-partisan fashion--relied
jointly for technical advice, suddenly were nowhere to be found. Conservative
Sen. Jim West of Spokane was shouting that liberal Sen. Dwight Pelz of Seattle
was a &quot;commie pinko!&quot; A horrified Pritchard demanded order. Then
Pelz called West &quot;a right wing nut,&quot; and Pritchard was beside
himself, watching his record of fostering good will fall into ruin. Eventually,
out of the corner of his eye he saw Secretary of State Munro and Governor
Lowry in the chamber and heading toward him. The place was in a strange
agitation. Lowry took the gavel away, quite illegally, from the astonished
Lt. Governor and called for a vote. He was answered by a sea of  laughing
&quot;ayes&quot;. It turned out that the mock donnybrook was staged on behalf
of a heartfelt resolution expressing respect and affection for Pritchard.<BR>
<BR>
	Wednesday night Joel was down at the Port's International Conference Center,
along with brother Frank, &quot;just in case&quot; any of the people expected
at the party his friends were giving hadn't received word of the postponement.
Some hadn't, and after refreshments and schmoozing with Joel, a number said
they thought they would come right back again on December 6. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Never have so many politicians </B>worked so hard and spent
so much to achieve so little change. With the White House still in Democratic
hands, Congress still Republican and exactly the same partisan division
of governors, the nation's politics are roughly where they were a year and
a half ago when history's longest presidential campaign began. What was
achieved? Altogether, marathon fundraising and organizing and advertising
achieved a great record <B><I>low</I></B> turnout, 49 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the voters' collective mixed message was, give us more of
the same. What each voter was saying was more complex, of course. But surely
there is one point on which we each might agree: This thing went on far
too long. <BR>
<BR>
Fourteen months ago I wrote in this space that bunching the presidential
primaries together and &quot;front loading&quot; them in the winter and
early spring of 1996 would prolong the campaign agony for citizens as well
as candidates. No wonder the mood by election day was one of embarrassment
approaching nausea in many voters, and stunned apathy in the rest. By the
end my neighbors were muttering that they wished they had gone away on vacation.
Friends said they were tempted to lock themselves in their houses, disconnect
the television and take up meditation--or worse. Some may have been driven
mad; they haven't been seen in weeks, and certainly didn't show up at the
polls. <BR>
<BR>
It customarily is said that the voters don't start paying attention to campaigns
until Labor Day. This year they worked hard to avert their eyes through
the whole show. Thus the paradox: The longer the campaign, the less the
public pays attention. To be charitable, it wasn't so much a lack of interest
as the gagging lack of oxygen one encounters in the air of unreality around
a campaign. You can take the atmospheric depression for a couple months,
but then you start to pass out. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the national mental health the only loss. A President was distracted
from his duties for over one fourth of his first term. Not that he minded,
of course. But those days of fundraising and leading rallies were days when
he did not attend to normal business. The same goes for the voters. The
months spent learning--falsely--that Medicare was threatened were months
when long term solutions to the looming entitlement crisis were not addressed
at all. Indeed, it could be said that by avoiding the real issues facing
the country, or exploiting them for demagogic ends, the national campaign
served to decrease the sum of popular knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. In September, while our campaign ground
on, the Japanese called a national election, and six weeks later, held it.
All the action was concentrated, and therefore bearable. <BR>
<BR>
We have come to the stage of our history where elections no longer provide
political catharsis. Nor do they produce anger or division, necessarily.
They produce exhaustion. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are no panaceas in public life, but there are some things
that could help prevent a repeat of the Long Campaign of 1996. First, the
President and Congress could agree to prohibit any dispersal of federal
campaign matching funds to abet funds raised by presidential candidates,
unless they were raised after December, 1999. That would tend to dry up
about four to six months of early campaigning, or at least to slow it. <BR>
<BR>
The second contribution to sanity would be to change the election date from
November to October and move the inauguration forward from late January
to early December. In the Information Age we don&iacute;t need several months
to communicate with voters. &quot;The first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&quot; is a date set in law in 1872; it&iacute;s not the Constitution,
and there is nothing sacred about it. The inauguration date also can be
changed. The third week in January is typically the worst week of winter
in Washington, D.C., while early December is usually cold, but endurable,
and sometimes quite pleasant. <BR>
<BR>
Knocking out a month of campaigning at the end would concentrate people&iacute;s
interest while weakening the present demand for money for television ads.
There&iacute;s only so much air time for sale, and after a campaign starts
buying it during the midnight wrestling matches, you know they are over-spending.
If the First Amendment cannot limit spending, let the calendar do it. <BR>
<BR>
Another reform would be to persuade the political parties to pass a rule
refusing to seat delegates to the national nominating conventions who were
selected in primaries held before mid-March. This apparently is the only
way to force states to repeal the front-loaded schedule and thereby to shorten
the campaign. Unfortunately, this reform needed approval at this year&iacute;s
conventions in order to apply in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, all of this was known by the parties over a year ago and ignored.
Now that the campaign is over, the lesson also will be ignored by the public
until it is taught once more in 2000. Then it will be too late, again, to
change before 2004. There does not seem to be enough sustained public annoyance
to force Washington, D.C. to fix the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow voters, am I wrong about that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Character Is Not an Issue (No, Of Course Not!)</CENTER>

<P>	 Let's not hear any more about &quot;character', okay? This country
is moving to a values neutral, non-judgmental consciousness in which such
outdated concepts are irrelevant. &quot;Character&quot; is just another
device by which the power elite seek to instill guilt in the masses and
bring everyone under the control of old fogies and their retrograde values
system.<BR>
	Character is not an issue. Character is not an issue. Character is not
an issue. Got it?<BR>
	What's with these politicians, anyway, trying to inject a concept like
character into a straightforward contest for votes? It's very negative.
Next, they'll be quoting a bunch of dead Greeks, like Heraclitus (&quot;Character
is destiny.&quot;) or Plutarch (&quot;Character is simply habit long continued.&quot;)
We're getting tired of it, burned out. It really brings people down. Talking
about character has become a character flaw itself, when you think about
it. Especially when candidates come right out and say that's what they're
doing. Give us a candidate who has good vibes and sympathetic body language.
If he's going to attack his opponent's character, he can do it on the sly
or get a surrogate.<BR>
	Besides, character doesn't matter.<BR>
	All right, maybe it matters a little bit. But, it has to take its place
at the end of a long line of considerations used to evaluate a candidate.
First, you need someone who is smart. And a riveting speaker. Good looks
help--a lot. No Abe Lincolns need apply. And then you want someone who says
things you agree with.<BR>
	Character? A poor runner up in any relationship. Maybe you are deciding
on a home remodeling contractor, or a banker, or a teacher (if you get a
choice), or a doctor (if you get a choice much longer), or a lawyer. Do
you want a good talker or character? Right: if it doesn't feel good, don't
do it! It's not how you play the game, but whether or not you win that counts.
If someone does something wrong, better to get past it, unless of course
we can sue.<BR>
	Character! Whose character, we want to know? The graybeards that prattle
about &quot;consequences,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;honor,&quot;
&quot;keeping your word&quot;? Talk about quaint; the other day one of them
used the word &quot;duty&quot;! Next, it will be &quot;honesty is the best
policy!&quot; Well, they have their values, we have ours. Haven't they ever
heard about the value of a good story? Or the value of getting away with
it? Their values are yesterday's, the old Eurocentric behavior control that
runs all the way back to Aristotle and the Bible. Well, isn't it time someone
had a kind word for Nicolo Machiavelli?<BR>
	Our hierarchy of character is just different. It is headed by &quot;compassion,&quot;
which is best expressed, for example, by helping  the less fortunate with
other people's money. Next comes &quot;tolerance,&quot; sometimes recognized
as indifference with a wan smile.<BR>
	The old guard are bogged down in particulars--this poor person, that family,
the town over there--while we expand our &quot;concern&quot; to include
whole groups and abstract categories of people; indeed, &quot;The People&quot;
as a whole. So who has the larger view? Their boring politicians talk about
this bill and that amendment; our sprightly leaders talk about  the symbolic
legislation that shows how they feel. The old guard say they care about
results. Well, we are more idealistic; we care about intentions.<BR>
	That's why, as I think I said, character is not an issue.<BR>
	&quot;Right? Wrong?&quot; Very good words, useful words; we use them all
the time, in fact. But let's be serious. Right and wrong depend on the situation--and
who they are used against. What's right and wrong also depends on public
opinion, or, more particularly, on the polls. And, lately, on focus groups
and on approval meters that people can hold in their lap to record their
instantaneous reactions to a speaker's every word. <BR>
	&quot;Leadership?&quot; That's very important, too. It involves finding
out what the folks in the focus group or studio audience believe (or say
they believe) and then advocating it.<BR>
	The old timers prefer principles to values, because they are more permanent,
and they think that human nature really doesn't change over time. We moderns
hope human nature does change because we are trying constantly to change
it. And we ignore principles and prefer values, because values can be anything
you want. They are merely an appendage of a constantly evolving  social
order, a reflection of the power structure at any given moment. As time
goes by, it is smart to abandon some values as they become  inconvenient.
Other values we just give others new meanings; for example, &quot;creative.&quot;
And other values we invent; for example, &quot;energetic.&quot;<BR>
	So character is not an issue.<BR>
	One candidate is a human weathervane? So? His opponent has changed his
mind on several occasions; who is he to talk?<BR>
	One candidate routinely breaks his word? So? His opponent failed to achieve
his whole agenda.<BR>
	They're all the same. It's all relative. Character is not an issue. Really,
it's not.<BR>
	Feel better now? Good. Feelings are what it's all about.<BR>

The Reality of Drugs Belies a Cartoon-style Answer</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Garry B. Trudeau, creator of the comic-strip Doonesbury, is
one of your star Boomer celebrities, a self-appointed guru of perpetual
'60s cool. It was Trudeau who invented the jaunty Mr. Butts character that
mocks the tobacco companies and the politicians who take their contributions.
Today Mr. Butts figures haunt only Republican rallies, despite the annoying
fact from the National Library on Money and Politics that more than half
of the tobacco support of congressional candidates from 1980 to 1994 went
to Democrats.<BR>
<BR>
Real history, in contrast to cartoon history, has that way of interfering
with a good story. In Mr. Trudeau's case, this crusader against the legal
vice of tobacco recently felt obliged to write an essay in Time magazine
regarding his own past use of illegal narcotics. Were RJR Nabisco sleuths
about to expose him? Regardless, his confession is not the mea culpa of
a Newt Gingrich or even the denial of a Bill &quot;I didn't inhale&quot;
Clinton. Instead, Trudeau manages to say only briefly that he no longer
advocates drugs, while telling us at length how much he once enjoyed them
and even sold them. He implies that he only quit once he became a parent,
not so many years ago. &quot;To summarize,&quot; he writes, &quot;at one
time I possessed, consumed and probably distributed marijuana--activities
for which I may feel embarrassment but not guilt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These &quot;memories of TOKING UP are fondly held,&quot; he coos in capitals.
&quot;Finally, I admit that this has not caused me to lose a moment of sleep,
except as it has pertained to my career.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How&Igrave;s that as a didactic tale for the kids? Tobacco's bad for you,
but dope's a bit of a kick. Cartoonist, draw thyself!<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration also did not take drugs very seriously for over
three years; indeed, until a political attack appeared on the horizon. Then
the Administration, too, came up with the preposterous attempt to switch
the subject to cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
In the first three years of the Clinton presidency, Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders proposed looking into legalizing drugs and the Justice Department
recommended reducing mandatory sentences for drug crimes. The President
slashed the staff of his drug office by 80 percent and reduced interdiction
of drugs at the border and eradication efforts overseas. Coast Guard seizures
of cocaine fell 45 percent and marijuana, 90 percent. Supply reduction was
deemed a waste of time and money. <BR>
<BR>
When a report was produced for the Pentagon by the Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA) suggesting the contrary--that interdiction is a &quot;cost
effective operational strategy for increasing cocaine prices and thereby
reducing cocaine use in the United States&quot;--the Administration held
up dissemination. Only insistence by the Republican dominated House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee brought the report to public awareness last
week. The full contents still have not been released.<BR>
<BR>
It apparently was the Administration's expectation that increased funds
for drug treatment would bring about demand reduction. Indeed, <I>The Man
From Hope</I>  told a group of Miami middle-schoolers last spring that drug
use had gone down &quot;every year for the last three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the hard facts showed the hope was false. The National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse for 1995 revealed that drug use among teens rocketed upward
105% since 1992. Cocaine use among teens soared 166%. Compared to the past,
the drugs themselves have become cheap, &quot;pure&quot; and dangerous.
This would tend to validate the IDA study. Greater drug supply produces
lower prices and wider availability. Lessened drug education, meanwhile,
lowers the threshold for initial usage. Drug treatment for addicts, a Clinton
priority, is a valuable and humane service, but not much of an answer to
expanded drug supply and usage.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration tried to wriggle off the bad publicity--and escape the
merciless Dole ad showing candidate Clinton in 1992 laughing on MTV that
he wished he had inhaled--by pinning the problem on the Bush years. The
numbers in that period, however, don&Igrave;t show anything more than anti-drug
efforts and drug usage reaching a plateau. So another spin was tried, that
Republicans in Congress are responsible because they have not supported
all the treatment funds the president sought. But again, even if true, that
argument begs the question.<BR>
<BR>
That question is, what works? The best answer, so far, is an all-fronts
struggle of the kind launched in the Reagan years, when drug use was cut
in half.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is elected president, let&Igrave;s increase drug interdiction
and drug eradication, overseas as well as at home. From my own service as
U.S. representative to the U.N. narcotics agencies in Vienna in the '80s,
I would argue that we should solicit more international cooperation and
financial support for these tasks. Let&Igrave;s also expand assistance for
crop substitution in countries like Colombia, and thereby promote the domestic
stability that gives politicians the courage to stand up to narco-traffickers.<BR>
<BR>
Let&Igrave;s revise the once useful, but now stale, &quot;Just Say No&quot;
educational campaign among youth. Yes, we also should continue to improve
drug treatment for addicts and we should decriminalize medicinal use. And
let&Igrave;s do more to rebut Hollywood and media figures who glamorize
drugs, or, like Trudeau, laugh them off.<BR>
<BR>
As for politicians (or cartoonists), nobody cares what they did as youths.
What matters is whether they set an example as adults who have taken the
drug issue seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ted Van Dyk is a former Washington State resident</B> and
a Democrat of national pedigree, who once served as an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, later ran a Democratic policy center and advised Sen. Paul
Tsongas in his 1992  presidential bid. These days he gazes balefully over
developments in the Whitewater scandal as described in the newspapers that
arrive daily in his Washington, D.C. office; and he asks rhetorically, what
is the likely outcome of this seemingly endless mess? <BR>
<BR>
Consider this scenario, he suggests: Bill Clinton, like Richard Nixon in
1972, wins big in November, and next February independent counsel Kenneth
Starr announces an indictment. The country and the Congress are thrown into
an uproar. It's Watergate all over again and the people demand to know why
the facts had not been presented to them when they could have exercised
their own judgment at the polls. <BR>
<BR>
Now picture a second scenario: Clinton wins, but narrowly. Then the independent
counsel announces that he has found, in the familiar term of art, &quot;insufficient
grounds to prosecute.&quot; The White House and Democrats are outraged that
they have had to put up with the character issue hanging over their heads,
when an earlier resolution could have spared the President and maybe Democrats
in Congress a lot of anxiety, and maybe given them a larger mandate. <BR>
<BR>
In scenario three, the current steady erosion of news stories--Mrs. Clinton
cited for failure to report her role in the Castle Grande real estate deal,
talk of pardoning the McDougals, and what have you--take their silent toll.
Dole wins narrowly. Then, the independent counsel reports around inaugural
time that he is indicting the soon-to-be-retired Clintons. More distress,
including Republican indignation that this information was not available
at a time when it could have led to a more substantial GOP victory. <BR>
<BR>
Or, four, a narrow Dole victory is followed by a decision by the independent
counsel not to indict. Outgoing President Clinton is relieved, but angry.
This decision earlier could have saved the election for him and helped the
Democrats in Congress. The process has triumphed over justice once again.
(Van Dyk thinks the chances of indictment overall are 50-50.) <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Whitewater scandal and the investigation attending it have
dragged on so long now that it is hard to conceive of an outcome that truly
serves the nation&iacute;s interest. In 1992 the scandal was new, poorly
reported and had no effect on the election. Later, as Travelgate and other
mini-scandals developed, it was assumed that appointment of an independent
counsel (two, as it turned out) would get to the bottom of the matter and
clear it up, one way or another. Yet here we are, going through yet another
election where Whitewater and related matters whistle around the campaign
like a nasty ditty voters hate but can't get out of their heads. <BR>
<BR>
The assumption has been that because people are fatigued with Whitewater
and related matters, they also are unaware and unaffected. In fact, voters
know that questions of tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury are
serious, but they don't know how to assess them. In surveys, the results
are strange, and Charles E. Cook in the Capitol Hill newspaper, <I>Roll
Call,</I> is not alone in saying that he has never seen such volatility.
Consider this exotic syllogism: a) a majority of people believe &quot;character&quot;
is important in a president; b) a majority thinks Dole is far superior to
Clinton on this count, and c) a majority plans to vote for Clinton. <BR>
<BR>
If that kind of survey is accurate, does it suggest, as some say, that the
American people have lost their moral bearings? Not necessarily. It may
suggest that people have other things on their minds, and, in any case,
prefer to give the Clintons the benefit of the doubt until hard evidence
of wrongdoing is presented. Who can blame them? Theirs actually seems like
a very sensible attitude. <BR>
<BR>
For one thing, who can remember all the chapters in the Whitewater saga
as it courses through Arkansas and Washington, D.C., let alone the details?
Few Democratic leaders in Congress or elsewhere are visibly defending the
Clintons on Whitewater, yet the Dole campaign is staying away from the subject,
too. Maybe no one can follow it all. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are many other, on-the-record reasons for a vote against
Clinton and for Dole (and vice versa), but they are the old, standard liberal
versus conservative arguments that have divided the parties for sixty odd
years. You don't have to have Whitewater splashed in your face. Not on the
evidence so far. <BR>
<BR>
Van Dyk, who over the past few years became a public critic of Bill Clinton's
character (&quot;I believe he is badly flawed.&quot;), is now frustrated
with the failure of the independent counsel to come to a conclusion in a
timely fashion that would allow a political resolution rather than risk
a constitutional crisis. A partisan Democrat, he is foremost concerned for
the country. <BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors, he notes, always think of building as strong a case as possible
before he takes action. Let justice takes its course. But there comes a
point where more is at stake than a trial--like the future of the nation.
Thus, Van Dyk now concludes that if Ken Starr is going to bring charges,
he has an obligation to do it before election day. Otherwise, he should
drop it.<BR>
<BR>
Think about the grave implications of either course. Someone should.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Scott Klug, clean cut and earnest, used to be a reporter
for KING-TV in Seattle. </B>He liked to investigate politicians. You would
not have suspected that he would wind up in Congress himself one day, but
that is what happened. Having returned home to Madison ,Wisconsin, Klug
got elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives. Now in Washington,
D.C.--still clean cut and earnest--he focuses a lot on cutting costs and
privatizing government programs. And he is making some progress. <BR>
<BR>
The Republican House majority, including Klug and his Washington State colleagues,
deserves credit for reducing spending growth and making a balanced budget
by 2002 a realistic goal. It wouldn't have been possible without the Republicans'
sometimes stormy insistence, and if they lose power this fall, that goal
surely will erode. But they got in political trouble when their cuts hit
some highly visible services with broad constituencies. Everybody wants
Congress to combat &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; but one voter's idea
of waste is another's idea of a vital service. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, almost everybody would like a tax cut, as Republicans propose.
It is, or ought to be, common knowledge that when federal, state and local
taxes are combined, the American family is more heavily taxed than ever
before. But, how do you pay for a broad cut? There will be a supply side
boost to revenues when marginal tax rates are cut, but it will cover only
about a quarter of the tab. <BR>
<BR>
We clearly need greater efficiencies in government. Klug believes that government
monopolies, lacking the discipline of the free market, raise costs directly
and--by not paying taxes--indirectly, too. Privatization, while not a panacea,
can lower government costs and still improve services. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization was a subject of fashionable discussion in the 1980s, but
few actual conversions were undertaken. Selling off Conrail, the government-subsidized
freight railroad that had been picked up when Penn Central, New York Central
and several other lines failed, was one of the stellar successes. That privatization
was led by Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole,
and turned a multi-billion dollar public revenue eater into a multi-billion
dollar tax contributor. (The Dole campaign should make more of this story.)
Klug is now among those promoting the current proposal to privatize Amtrak
passenger service. <BR>
<BR>
Klug's efforts led Speaker Gringrich last year to appoint him head of a
House privatization task force that includes, among others, Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Bellevue, Washington. An initial effort was the abolition, privatization
or partial privatization of some nine programs within the House of Representatives
itself--from beauty and barber shops to food services and recording studios.
As Gingrich recently noted on Meet the Press, the old House still had ice
delivered twice daily to each Member&iacute;s office--80 years after invention
of the refrigerator. Most of these in-House reforms are now completed, with
expected ultimate savings to taxpayers of $44 million, a good example for
the rest of government. <BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has made a few modest moves toward privatization,
of course, such as agreeing with Congress to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves
(at an anticipated price of $1.6 billion). But Klug is skeptical of any
serious or long term Clinton commitment. Dole is much more interested. Whoever
is president, however, Klug has a long list of privatization targets. They
involve sale or lease of assets, contracting out of services, functional
conversion to the private sector and lifting legal barriers to privatization.
For example: <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Klug and his task force want to contract out the debt collection
activities of the IRS. Citing a General Accounting Office report and a survey
by the American Collectors Association, Klug foresees savings of over $10
billion. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$80 million could be saved by privatizing many activities of the Government
Printing Office. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Money to build badly needed new prisons could be found by turning
some operations over to private companies, which experience shows can construct
and manage prisons for 20 % less than the government. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Contracting out government commercial-style services could save &quot;as
much as $9 billion a year.&quot; Klug cites as examples the Department of
Defense and the Veteran&iacute;s Administration, which compete with the
private sector in grocery distribution. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Privatizing management of federal loan programs could save $2 billion
annually. 
</UL>
<BR>
Some of the GOP proposals Klug is introducing will require more study and
debate. For instance, he wants to move, though slowly, to sell off the electric
power projects built in the '30s and 40s. This would have been politically
unimaginable several decades ago, but, as shown in a report this month by
a bi-partisan task force of governors from the four Northwest states, even
the huge and venerable Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is coming under
increased consideration for privatization, at least for its power transmission
system. The power industry is moving into greater competition these days
and a co-existent government monopoly makes less and less sense. Klug wisely
suggests privatization &igrave;from least to most complex&icirc;power marketing
administrations, starting with Southeastern Power Administration, and reviewing
Western Area Power Administration and BPA last. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is remarkable that anyone is even able to talk about such matters
these days. Barry Goldwater's proposal in 1964 to sell the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) helped defeat him. But few attack Klug in 1996 for wanting
to bring at least the non-power programs of TVA into the private, tax-paying
sector, at a savings of $140 million a year, and he bravely asks why regulated
private ownership of TVA power would not also make sense for citizen rate-payers
in today&iacute;s environment--as well as earning $28 billion for the federal
treasury. <BR>
<BR>
There, indeed, are few sacred cows in the Wisconsin representative's budget
pasture. He even dares to mention the Postal Service. Barry Goldwater himself
didn't raise such an issue. If he had, it would have been thought a joke.
But that was before private overnight mail delivery, faxes and e-mail. Now
Klug's suggestion that the Post Office evolve into an employee-owned corporation
doesn't strike most people as either ridiculous or extreme. More and more,
it sounds like common sense.<BR>

in the race in the first place if he hadn&iacute;t been rich, is not owed
a position in the televised presidential debates. And he shouldn&iacute;t
get one.<BR>
<BR>
2. If Perot is invited to the debates, anyway, so should Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. At least the show
would be more entertaining.<BR>
<BR>
3. Broad tax relief that allows people to spend more of their money according
to their own priorities is better than &igrave;targeted&icirc; tax breaks
that assume the government knows best how people should spend their money.
Thus, Dole is right in his approach and Clinton is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
4. Regardless, Dole, if elected, is more likely to follow through on his
tax cuts than Clinton is with his. <BR>
<BR>
5. In domestic affairs, the number one issue facing America is entitlement
spending. Both parties know that the rate of growth in Medicare must be
reduced if the integrity of the system is to be preserved, and that little
or no damage will be done to seniors if modest steps are taken now. The
actual legislation that the Republicans tried to pass was responsible and
fair, despite the demagogic spin put on it by the current crop of Democratic
and AFL-CIO ads.<BR>
<BR>
6. Social Security takes roughly 12 and a half percent of people&iacute;s
payroll income. For the next few years, while the government takes in more
from Social Security taxes than it pays out, it is possible to a) assure
present recipients of exactly the Social Security payments they expect and
b) allow young people to turn their future payments into a mutual fund savings
instrument tied to the private economy and thereby save significantly more
for their future. The proposal has wide support in think tanks and among
economists.That this idea is not even being discussed so far by either Mr.Clinton
or Mr. Dole is testimony to the threat of demagogy on this subject. <BR>
<BR>
7. Mr. Clinton has a new spending proposal each campaign day. For example,
he wants to fund more Americorps community volunteers, even though taxpayers
pay $27,000 per &igrave;volunteer,&icirc; about twice what comparable volunteers
cost private charities. If he is re-elected, Mr. Clinton&iacute;s statement
that &igrave;The era of big government is over&icirc; will become one of
the most ironic political pronouncements of all time, along with Herbert
Hoover&iacute;s &igrave;Prosperity is just around the corner.&icirc; <BR>
<BR>
8. Under the new federal so-called &igrave;reform&icirc; laws a lobbyist
may not pay for a dinner for a senator anywhere within 35 miles of the Capitol.
But he can take the senator on an &igrave;inspection trip&icirc; to Paris
and have his corporation or oganization pay for the whole thing. The rule
should be the opposite. No politician is going to be bought for the price
of a dinner, while a glamorous, all-expenses paid trip may raise &szlig;real
questions. Congress--and the professional &igrave;reformers&icirc; that
live off controversy--should get real.<BR>
<BR>
9. Under the same new &igrave;reform&icirc; laws, members of Congress who
may not receive a free meal from a lobbyist, constituents or almost anyone
else, are quite free, however, to provide free meals for the lobbyist, constituents,
or whomever. Later, the Congressmen also are free to ask the lobbyists for
campaign contributions, and from those campaign contriibutions--pooled in
their campaign funds-- pay off all their meal chits. This is considered
part of the expense of doing business, and since it can&iacute;t be charged
to the taxpayers, it can be charged to campaign funds. This shows again
a) that petty reform laws can almost always be circumvented, and b) that
there&iacute;s no such thing as a free lunch.<BR>
<BR>
10. It is wrong for the media to refer to Sherry Rowlands, the prostitute
hired by Presidential &igrave;family values&icirc; adviser Dick Morris,
as a &igrave;call girl.&icirc; The proper term should be &igrave;call person.&icirc;<BR>
<BR>
Results: The correct answer for each question is &igrave;True,&icirc; except
for the last, number 10, which is definitely false (Tsk, tsk. Common sense
must hold to standard English, even in vernacular speech--just as in standard
morality.) Give yourself 10 points for each correct answer. If you scored
under 50, you seriously need to re-examine your prejudices, although the
same is true for many of your fellow citizens and most of the media. A score
of 60 to 90 shows that you have a common sense understanding of the American
political scene. Congratulations! A perfect score puts you in perfect harmony
with the author and cannot be admired too highly. <BR>

To Succeed, Seattle Should Share the Olympics </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>

<BR>

<BR>
The Seattle Bid Committe that is spearheading the drive to bring the Olympics
to Seattle and the Northwest in 2008 has entered a new, post-Atlanta phase.
First, the organizational effort is about to be intensified. Entrepreneur
Clark Kokich will operate as chairman of the committee, and internationally
known events impressario Bob Walsh will lead planning, as before. But to
provide day-to-day continuity, Dave Syferd, a noted public relations and
marketing executive, is expected to be named soon as president. The Seattle
Sports and Events Council is loaning staff to the project.<BR>
<BR>
The second post-Atlanta development is a growing recognition among supporters
that the early inspiration to seek the games on as broad a regional basis
as possible was wise and should be re-enforced. Indeed, the regional approach
would seem to have been vindicated both by the over-crowding in Atlanta
and the results of a recent Western Washington poll on the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
Public backing in the poll actually grows when the idea is broached to make
the games a regional affair centered in Seattle, but with events staged
throughout &quot;<A HREF="cascadia.html">Cascadia</A>.&quot; This would
seem to reflect wholly legitimate concerns about traffic congestion and
about cost. If the Olympics are held on a regional basis, both traffic and
overhead expenses can be spread from Victoria and Vancouver to Portland,
though primary emphasis will remain on the Central Puget Sound area and
the official host city, Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
In Atlanta, though a few events were staged outside the metropolitan area,
regionalism was an afterthought. Central Atlanta was closed down and the
focus of non-event activity was on the new, 21 acre Centennial Park--less
than a third the size of Seattle Center. Yet, it was also Atlanta's ambition
to host the largest spectator audience ever for the Olympics. Nine million
tickets were printed. <BR>
<BR>
The solution for Seattle is 1) regionalize to the full extent feasible,
and 2) prune the spectator ticket sales back to the four million figure
typical of earlier Olympic Games, or at least to the five million number
Sydney will print for 2000. There is good reason to think that the International
Olympics Committee (IOC) will like this approach. It was Atlanta&iacute;s
idea, not the IOC&iacute;s, that bigger necessarily was better.<BR>
<BR>
It is probable that the IOC, with Atlanta&iacute;s experience to remind
it, also will approve of Seattle&iacute;s plan to share many Olympic events
with its neighbors. The IOC requires a single city to take the lead, or
else the organizing commitee already would be moving forward with a multi-city
or regional bid. Oregonians and British Columbians already serve on the
bid committee and Seattle area participants all want bi-national regional
cooperation to develop as one of the identifiable achievements of the games.
Victoria hosted the Commonwealth Games recently and Vancouver has splendid
new facilities, as does Portland. It would be a mistake not to share many
of the Olympics&iacute; 271 events with these neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
Closer to home, Tacoma and Everett are logical hubs for various events.
A new equestrian facility already contemplated for Ellensburg will help
pull events over the mountains into Eastern Washington. And what about the
state capital, Olympia? How could we pass up holding some of the classic
&quot;Olympic&quot; competitions in the city with the same name as Olympia,
Greece, the games' birthplace almost 2800 years ago?<BR>
<BR>
In further response to the traffic issue, Seattle itself would not anticipate
closing off the downtown or concentrating recreation and cultural events
in one small area. We already have a large and lively urban core with far
more attractions to disperse crowds than Atlanta had. Also, the Seattle
sponsors would integrate local government and citizen planning on both security
and transportation early on, as Atlantans, unfortunately, failed to do.<BR>
<BR>
But what about local costs, even with sharing? Didn't Atlanta's businesses,
individuals and government wind up paying nearly $2 billion for the games?
Yes, but they brought in over $4 billion. The metropolitan area was beautified,
its infrastructure--from road surfaces to new recreation, housing and park
facilities--was immensely improved. Thousands of young people gained news
skills and work experience, representing an untold increase in &quot;human
capital.&quot; Community groups pulled together and made regional alliances.<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the games, as Atlanta found out, is no panacea for poor planning
or other urban ills, but the games--the world's biggest event, and a positive
one--do represent a useful forward strategy. In Barcelona, host to the 1992
Olympics, the games (according to the mayor, quoted in the Wall Street Journal)
&quot;were fantastic, but it was only a 15 day dream.&icirc; Thanks to his
city&iacute;s revitalization, &igrave;The best moment in Barcelona is now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there remains perhaps the biggest question: Could Seattle win
the games in the first place? Consider, for example, the image problem.
A Seattleite who was in Atlanta found himself marooned at a restaurant during
one of the frequent downpours that were common this past sticky summer --and
every summer. Sitting there, he mentioned to a local citizen Seattle's interest
in hosting the games in 2008.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seattle?&quot; replied the Atlantan incredulously. &quot;But it rains
all the time in Seattle!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
News flash to the IOC: Late July and early August in Seattle are golden.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues in Discovery Institute's Cascadia project are conducting a
feasibility study to examine a range of other real and imaginary obstacles
to Seattle's hosting the Olympics. If the whole region, working together,
cannot master those difficulties, then, by all means, the Olympic games
effort should be abandoned.<BR>
<BR>
But what a mistake it would be not to find out!<BR>

They're Attacking Dale Foreman to Defeat His Ideas</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	State House Majority Leader Dale Foreman is a logical candidate for
governor.  He's smart, personable, and experienced. At 48, he's still a
fresh voice in politics, having been elected first only four years ago.
He's the easily-met, thoroughly decent kind of person you'd like to have
as a neighbor.  An attorney, orchardist and author, the well-rounded Wenatchee
representative has the political advantages of an earnest speaking style
and a natural bloc of support in Eastern Washington, which has long wanted
a home-based governor. He  has many friends, as well, in Puget Sound country,
where he grew up. Former King Country Prosecutor Chris Bayley chairs his
campaign.<BR>
<BR>
	 Like Jack Kemp, Foreman is a serious social as well as a fiscal conservative.
His several legal books include one describing the trial of Jesus. He also
has Kemp's redeeming grace for seeking an inclusive, welcoming Republican
party.<BR>
<BR>
	Most of all, the scholarly Foreman, better than anyone running, understands
the state budget. And he knows he wants to cut that budget.  He specifically
and courageously announced his intention to trim 10,000 jobs, and in the
campaign he has been laying out a plan for doing so. He believes efficiencies
also can be achieved through improved technology, where the state lags behind
the private sector. It is not a radical program, but a prudent, business-like
one that he realistically acknowledges will take several years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, Foreman's &quot;Comprehensive Change and Reform Plan&quot; reads
as if he had pulled together the best ideas that such reform governors as
Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan and Christine Todd
Whitman in New Jersey have enacted in their states. <BR>
<BR>
	Selective pruning, notes Foreman, the orchardist, is especially overdue
in Washington State.  He points out that state government employment has
gone up more than 50 percent in the past dozen years--from approximately
60,000 to 97,000, rising at a rate twice that of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
	Unfortunately, the media has shown little interest in Foreman's proposal.
But that doesn't mean that word of Foreman's program hasn't gotten around.
His pledge to reduce the state payroll is exactly the kind of provocation
that excites active animosity from those who feel their jobs might be jeopardized.
And, sadly, some in the media, while mainly ignoring Foreman's policy ideas,
are quick to air personal attacks on him.<BR>
<BR>
	The charges began with allegations of infractions of the Public Disclosure
law, including largely technical matters, but also a remarkable claim that
Foreman, as Majority Leader raising funds to promote the GOP agenda in the
Legislature and only considering a run for governor, should have filed papers
then as if he already were a candidate. <BR>
<BR>
	This is new ground, a free speech limiting power grab by the staff of the
Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that almost surely will lose in the courts
if the commissioners themselves pursues it. Once again the PDC will have
strayed far from its original mandate. But meanwhile, the issue assails
Foreman during the final weeks of the primary campaign--which undoubtedly
is just what the complainant intended.<BR>
<BR>
	Then there was the hot news tip--breathlessly reported--that Foreman had
been &quot;excused&quot; from some lawsuit ten years ago. Nothing illegal
or damaging there, mind you, just an &quot;appearance&quot; of an implication
of a suggestion, you might say. What mattered was not the empty story, but
the reporting of it. Where did the story come from and why didn't the media
tell us what the motivation might be?<BR>
 <BR>
	More recently, there was yet another story: that Foreman used irrigation
&quot;water-spreading&quot; on his farm in a way that had caused a dispute
with the Department of Ecology (DOE). It is one of those penny-ante accounts
that leaves the knowledgeable observer asking, &quot;So, what?&quot; But
it leaves--and is meant to leave--the casual observer musing, &quot;I don't
understand what this is about, but it must be really serious or the media
wouldn't be covering it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Where's there's smoke, there's fire, people say.<BR>
<BR>
	Except in politics, I would say, where's there's sometimes only a smoke
machine.<BR>
<BR>
	In this case, it definitely was a smoke machine. But it wasn't necessarily
operated from within the DOE. Carol Fleskes, director of shorelands and
water resources at DOE, states that &quot;We're not the ones generating
this story.&quot; DOE and Foreman--who added five acres of land to his orchard
and is using the same amount of water as before to irrigate it--do differ
on whether he now needs a new legal claim or the old one remains suficient
under the law. &quot;Until that claim is verified by the courts it is hard
for us to take any kind of action to clarify the dispute,&quot; says Fleskes.
<BR>
<BR>
	It boils down to a minor jurisdictional issue. But somebody did want to
make a big deal out of the little claim. Why?<BR>
<BR>
	Because Dale Foreman's fiscal program, even with scant media attention,
is close to hitting a popular nerve. His talent and his ideas endanger entrenched
powers as well as some rivals. Therefore, the strategy: If you don't want
to confront a candidate's ideas, attack him personally. Or see that someone
else does.<BR>

The Networks May Boycott the Conventions? Good!</CENTER>

<P>	We are all supposed to be concerned that television's Ted Koppel left
the Republican convention early and is not even going to appear in Chicago
for the Democrats' show. At San Diego, the big three networks saw their
ratings plummet and they ascribe this failure to Republicans scripting their
extravaganza so tightly that no &quot;story&quot; (also known as &quot;bad
news&quot;) broke loose. Next week, the Democrats' shindig may be just as
impervious to negative media spin--as it should be, if the Democrats have
any sense. In this contrived atmosphere, the networks are warning us that
they will consider not covering the conventions at all in the year 2000.
They're going to take their cameras and go home.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I call that really good news! It will be an excellent improvement in
politics for the next millennium.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, if the networks do show up at future conventions, the parties
should allow them in only if they agree to reduce the number of their cloying
&quot;analyses,&quot;  floor interviews and other speech-usurping, distracting
and tendentious pelf. In San Diego, half of each network hour was taken
up by the commentators and, of course, the ads.  For example, instead of
being allowed to watch a newly discovered political gem like J.C. Watts,
the eloquent black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, network viewers
were left with synthetic pearls from TV's shopworn celebrities. What matters
to the networks is not airing the conventions, but re-airing conventional
wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, network convention coverage probably subtracts more from a voter's
understanding than it adds, just as self-absorbed network coverage of last
spring's primaries represented a net loss of popular deliberation in that
process (average sound bite per candidate: 7 seconds!). We can count on
similar coverage of the serious public business at hand this fall. Perhaps,
therefore, it would be just as well if the networks decided to stop covering
the final election, too. We mustn't keep them from the important fires and
hurricanes and two-headed giraffes that increasingly interest them.<BR>
<BR>
	The best advice to both parties is to stop trying so hard to please the
networks and their celebrity minions. Especially when it comes to live coverage
of political conventions, you don't need them anymore. Since the rise of
cable TV, voters have much better options, ranging from CNN, which is at
least somewhat less intrusive than the broadcast networks, to the totally
unobtrusive C-Span--the best innovation in the cause of  good government
since punch-card voting. And there's always PBS, not to mention radio and
even the comedy channel, where the humor's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
	The parties increasingly will find it advantageous to buy their own time
on TV and put their message across the way they want it, which is just what
the GOP did this year. By 2000 we'll have some version of a &quot;teleputer&quot;
(in George Gilder's phrase), computers with interactive TV capabilities
controlled by the user.  The viewer will be able to do his own editing,
as it were, listening to a convention speech in full or cutting away to
interviews or analyses as he or she--and not some network producer--desires.
When that happens, network TV convention coverage will become largely unprofitable,
anyhow. No high ratings, no big ads.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, parties have every right--and maybe a duty-- to run their conventions
to suit their own purposes, not those of the TV networks. Party conventions
are the great gatherings of the political tribes, a unique chance to showcase
familiar political favorites and emerging lights, and, for that matter,
for the party workers and leaders to mingle with counterparts from around
the country. Simply getting the party's act together is a service to the
voters; it makes each party prepare early for the possibility of governing.<BR>
<BR>
	If these communal rites are less spontaneous now than in days of yore,
it bears remembering that the scripting of conventions to look like TV shows
is directly the fault of TV itself.  Television first covered a political
convention in 1948.  By 1952, the parties were beginning to change their
procedures to accommodate the demanding new medium. In early 1956 a novel
called The Golden Kazoo accurately forecast the parties' growing obeisance
to TV and the techniques of &quot;Madison Avenue,&quot; a satiric vision
that became reality by 1960.<BR>
<BR>
	Parties and voters accepted the likes of Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley
as &quot;moderators,&quot; sitting in Olympian judgment on mere mortal candidates.
Presidential aspirants trembled at the thought that such worthies might
criticize them, even implicitly, though the media code of the time usually
prevented the networks' power from being so exercised. And if it was exercised
sometimes, the politicians, and of course the public, were too unsophisticated
to figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
	Today, the bias--usually left wing, occasionally right wing,  but almost
always skeptical and demeaning to the people in politics--is much more common,
and also more commonly understood and resented. In respect to conventions,
in any event, the parties finally learned that what made for good network
TV was not necessarily  what made for good politics. Hence, the scripting.<BR>
<BR>
	By 2000, however, it may not matter. If the networks follow through on
their threat to boycott the conventions, the only question by then will
be, who cares?<BR>

Black Conservatives</CENTER>

<BR>
	Question : What do Anthony Lowe, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of King
County, Washington who is running for State Insurance Commissioner, Teresa
Doggett, the international banker running for Congress from Austin, Texas
and Danny Covington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, another Congressional hopeful,
have in common?<BR>
<BR>
	 Answer: they all are  conservative black Republicans who are likely to
seek support from BAMPAC--&quot;Black America's Political Action Committee.&quot;
 Expecting to raise over $1 million this year from a membership list of
37,000, BAMPAC is cited by Hill Magazine in Washington, D.C. as the fastest
growing new political action committee in the country. Its founder was the
principled and charismatic former Reagan Administration Ambassador, Alan
Keyes, who ran for president in the GOP primaries last spring.<BR>
<BR>
	A few years ago, black Republican candidates were  rarities, especially
in predominantly white districts. They did run in black districts, but were
considered little more than sacrificial lambs. Therefore, when 11 blacks
ran for Congress on the GOP line in 1990, most observers considered the
development significant. Six years later there are at least 24 black GOP
Congressional candidates--now including two incumbents, Gary A.Franks of
Connecticut and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. As happened to blacks on the Democratic
ticket in the '70's, there suddenly are black Republicans showing up in
state offices, such as Secretary of State Victoria Buckley of Colorado and
Ohio State Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell. <BR>
<BR>
	Moreover, more Republican blacks are contesting Democrats in predominately
black areas. Mississippi's Danny Covington, a former parole officer and
Congressional aide with a  conservative social message, is the first black
to win a Republican primary in that state since Reconstruction days, over
a century ago. The state's US Senators, both Republicans, strongly supported
Covington against a white primary challenger.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, the Repbublican party could only go up in terms of  black support.
Just 10 percent identify today with the party of Lincoln. But there are
ocassional races where GOP candidates receive up to 40 percent black support,
and that edge often proves decisive.<BR>
<BR>
	The first black US Senator since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts
in the 1970's, was a Repbublican--one of the rarities. But Brooke was a
liberal Republican, as were many of the appointed officials advanced by
Republican presidents until Reagan. They not only backed the civil rights
gains of the '60's--as did most Republican then, and almost all by the next
decade--but also the more controversial programs, such as racial set-asides
and quotas. Their closest prominent counterpart today would be Gen. Colin
Powell, who supports &quot;affirmative action,&quot; while opposing &quot;preferences,&quot;
a fine distinction.<BR>
<BR>
	In any case, most newer black Republican elective officials are more conservative.
In this they are closest to the top black legal official in the land, Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They like to point out that while the Republican
party, as such, is not popular among blacks, there are strong conservative
currents running in the overall black electorate.<BR>
<BR>
	A 1992 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
generally liberal think tank, confirms that more blacks call themselves
conservative than liberal (33 percent to 29 percent). A more recent poll
by the center provides a fascinating breakdown of these averages, showing
that younger black voters, 18-25, were nearly twice as likely to identify
with the Republicans as were older ones (18 percent versus 8 percent) and
to call themselves conservatives (34 percent versus 22 percent). <BR>
<BR>
	Overall, black voters supported the death penalty 58 percent to 42 percent,
backed a two year limit on welfare by 58 percent also, by nearly 75 percent
backed mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and by 61 percent agreed that
black leaders were too quick to cite racism as an excuse for black crime.<BR>
<BR>
	The Gallup survey, similarly, found 53 percent disapproval of mandatory
busing among black voters, 48 percent pro-life sentiment and 77 percent
opposition to preferential treatment to make up for past discrimination.
Some 92 percent of blacks believe in God, a figure higher than for the population
as a whole (about 85 percent).<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, these surveys do not predict voter behavior and, moreover, wording
(for example, &quot;affirmative action&quot; versus &quot;preferential treatment&quot;)
can change poll outcomes for all groups in society. Just as Southern whites
agreed with Republicans in such polls for many years and still voted overwhelmingly
Democratic, there is little sign yet of political reallignment among black
voters nationally.<BR>
<BR>
	Yet it could come; and even a rise to 20  or 30 percent Republican support
would  transform the political landscape. Likewise, an increase of black
Republicans in Congress from two to, say, six, effectively would end the
monolithic Democratic support the media and other observers expect of black
Americans. It also might end the recent tendency of the Democratic party
to take black voters for granted. <BR>
<BR>
	However, white Republicans, too, should pay close attention to what black
members of their party are telling them. The old government solutions to
social and economic problems have failed, but, as General Powell stated
at the GOP convention, there is still a demand for solutions of some kind.
Economic opportunity is crucial. Within the party, personal or political
slights are as unwelcome as ever. Unconscious white discrimination burns
the hearts of  conservative as well as liberal blacks.<BR>
<BR>
	It's just that black conservatives, stressing family, entrepreneurism and
community self-help, believe they have found a better way of moving forward.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Bob Dole's &quot;Vision&quot; May Soon Clear Up</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The campaign of 1996 will get out of the summer Doledrums when the prospective
GOP standard-bearer announces his economic program. If that program is ambitious
in scope, joining a growth package of and tax reductions and spending controls
with a long term rescue of Social Security through private sector investments,
Bob Dole's supposed lack of a &quot;vision&quot; suddenly will disappear
as a political concern. A program simple in concept and profound in social
and economic implications, it would unite in common interest otherwise contending
generations and economic groups.<BR>
<BR>
The young, the working poor and much of the middle class, for whom high
payroll taxes and today's low-growth prosperity make saving exceedingly
difficult, would see the bulk of their Social Security tax finally put to
work as a genuine instrument for investment. Simultaneously, the effect
upon the nation's overall savings rate would give the United States the
higher growth rates that encourage real national and personal financial
progress.<BR>
<BR>
The risk in the package, of course, is raising the Social Security issue
in a politically charged atmosphere. The Clinton White House will be tempted
irresistibly to rouse the elderly against any change. Never mind that in
almost any reform plan Dole might endorse, protection of the elderly will
be guaranteed. The politics of misinformation that worked so well with Medicare
reform--where millions of dollars of Democratic and labor union TV ads persuaded
voters that a proposed reduction in the rate of growth of this entitlement
constituted a &quot;cut&quot;--will be used again to stigmatize reform of
Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
But several developments are pushing a cautious Dole to take up the challenge,
anyhow.<BR>
First, he desperately needs some new ideas. As is, his campaign is running
like a Kansas creek in a July drought. But something more than old-time
Republican deficit reductions is indicated. An economic plan that offers
ordinary workers a way to gain a share in national wealth-creation will
have broad and deep appeal. Without a forward-looking national agenda, on
the other hand, Dole's only hope is that the Clinton presidency self-destructs
in scandal. But even if it did, a victorious Dole would go into office without
a mandate for any particular program. <BR>
<BR>
Second, former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm's entry into the suddenly real
&quot;race&quot; for the Reform Party nomination puts the Social Security
issue on the table, in any case. He has met with key backers of the idea,
including Jose Pinera, the Chilean who successfully introduced it in his
country, and the proposal is now part of Lamm's avowed program. So the issue
will be debated nationally, regardless of what Dole or Clinton want or fear,
or, of course, how the more likely Reform Party nominee, Ross Perot, chooses
to characterize it. <BR>
<BR>
Lamm knows he is on to something. Young voters are especially excited about
the idea. When Steve Forbes proposed it in a debate at the University of
Arizona last spring he got a standing ovation from the largely youthful
audience and won that state's primary.<BR>
<BR>
The third development promoting a Dole decision to adopt broad reform as
an issue is the imminence of a report by the Clinton Administration's own
bi-partisan Social Security advisory commission. Having labored in obscurity
for two years, the panel is about to conclude that the best solution to
the Social Security system's problems is reform that takes advantage of
the power of the free market. (The worst solution, of course, is to raise
the already high payroll taxes and to cut benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
The 13 member commission is divided as to which of several specific approaches
is desirable. The main issues are whether all or only part of a worker's
12.4 percent Social Security tax should be invested in a savings and investment
account for him personally and how best to handle the transition from the
present system to an entirely new one.<BR>
<BR>
These are not minor questions. Without some of a taxpayers' payment going
to fund the transition costs of a new system, that transition becomes problematical.
On the other hand, unless a worker gets something close to full personal
advantage from the investment of his savings, the bright potential for him
and for the economy is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
These differences can be composed, but they need not be resolved in this
fall's campaign. Even if Dole (or Clinton, for that matter) were to embrace
a specific detailed plan, Congress would want to hold hearings and make
changes next spring. In fact, there are so many variations of the private
sector plan around now that endorsing one completely would assure criticism
from backers of other approaches. The same goes for a flat tax proposal
and a spending control plan.<BR>
<BR>
What matters is a general outline that combines the benefits of a flat or
flatter income tax with the conversion of Social Security from a fund whose
current (and temporary) surplus is used to subsidize the general budget
to one that helps individual workers invest. A flat tax without Social Security
reform could be seen as tilting toward the upper middle class and wealthy,
while Social Security reform by itself will not maximize economic growth.
The two together, along with spending controls, would help every worker
and family in the country. If Dole advocates such a package he will have
a central and unifying theme for his campaign. No more Bob Dull.<BR>
<BR>
As it happens, the last Kansan to be nominated for President, Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952, also was criticized in late summer for a campaign that was &quot;running
like a dry creek.&quot; But he managed to turn that campaign around with
a breakthrough international policy idea---&quot;I will go to Korea.&quot;
Economic reform to help average Americans could do the same for Bob Dole.

How do you Play Cards with China?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
	Washington Sen. Slade Gorton received headline attention recently  when
he announced that he would not oppose extension of &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot;
(MFN) trading status for China this year. He thereby helped avoid an embarrassing
vote in the Senate at a time when Boeing has major Chinese contracts pending
and Microsoft has just reached a new agreement  on intellectual property
rights.<BR>
 <BR>
	Less noticed, however, was the angry nature of the criticism Gorton heaped
on the Chinese and their apologists here in the United States.  Throwing
down a marker on trade complaints, the Republican senior senator declared
that unless significantly fairer treatment of American companies takes place
in the next year,  he will &quot;lead the fight&quot; against awarding China
MFN status next year.  Coming from a representative of the nation's most
trade dependent state, the pledge is considered reckless swagger by some
observers and political courage by others. Regardless, Gorton, when aroused
by a large principle, is a resourceful legislative foe.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Gorton's Democratic colleague, Sen. Patty Murray, is heading
in what seems to be the opposite direction, arguing at a recent conference
of the Washington Council for International Trade that the US should make
MFN status permanent for all nations with whom we have relations (which
is all but the likes of Iraq, Cuba and North Korea). This, she believes
would avoid the annual pain and embarrassment of the MFN debate. Many China-hands
in business and academia agree.<BR>
<BR>
	It seems unlikely that under present circumstances either option will prevail,
however. On one hand, America is too entangled with the China trade and
too smitten with the future of an economy growing by 9% a year to lift anchor
and sail away. Before long, there will be a wholesale turnover in Chinese
leadership as the aged Long Marchers finally retire or die, so US traders
are reluctant to surrender their position now to the Japanese and Europeans.
Slade Gorton is articulate as well as indignant in his cataloguing of Chinese
trade perfidies, but the very businesses he might be expected to have on
his side--software, wheat and fruit growers, for example--are unwilling
to sign up against MFN.<BR>
<BR>
	On the other hand, Sen. Murray's dream of a permanent MFN will make a easy
target for political opponents of the present annual endorsement. This year
the human rights and consumer groups who normally get involved in the MFN
fight decided to stand aside, but they certainly would not do so if a permanent
grant was being considered. Until China-US trade and other relations are
substantially improved, MFN will be retained as a handy weapon.<BR>
<BR>
	Better relations are by no means impossible, of course. Whoever wins the
Presidency in November will want to organize a US/China summit, and maybe
Bill Clinton will attempt one before then, if some attractive agreement
can be sculpted. In recent weeks, the Chinese reversed the hostile rhetoric
of the late winter and promised yet again to crack down on factories that
pirate software and other intellectual property. There are pledges also
to stop trading missile technology with Pakistan and there even are soothing
words from Beijing about the future of Hong Kong, which China will absorb
in one year.<BR>
<BR>
	But there also are trouble signs ahead. American officials, including even
 such critics as Sen. Gorton, agree that trade issues should be separated
from human rights and military issues. But, as a practical matter, China's
human rights abuses in Tibet, the military pressures on Taiwan, government-directed
abortions, prison labor camps, secret shipments of guns into the US, and
threats to democracy in Hong Kong all play as discordant background music
that cannot be ignored and could disrupt the trade dance. <BR>
<BR>
	Hong Kong is an especially tense subject, since the Chinese takeover next
July will occur just after MFN arrives once again before Congress. If the
new Chinese authorities end up arresting Hong Kong's elected political leaders,
censoring the press and exposing the economy to the corruption that too
often characterizes the Chinese version of &quot;free markets,&quot; the
resulting turmoil will not be ignored by either public or official opinion
in the West. The chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Martin Lee,
in a whirlwind North American tour two months ago (60 speeches in 13 days)
was an effective proponent of MFN for China as well as a critic of Chinese
threats against Hong Kong. Lee in jail, however, would be a powerful symbol
against an attempt to adopt MFN, let alone make it permanent.<BR>
<BR>
	This confusion on the horizon of 1997 actually makes Sen. Gorton's Cassandra-like
warnings potentially very useful. Forgoing sentimentality, he demands that
Americans look with realism at the trade picture, not as it might be, but
as experience has shown it.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Five years ago our trade deficit with China,&quot; he reports, &quot;was
$12.7 billion. Now it is $33.8 billion....Will we never learn?...What has
the 'engagement' of the past five years accomplished to cause us to parrot
today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the past?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Will his fellow members of Congress and the Clinton Administration simply
ignore this warning? Perhaps. But if they do so, the present opposition
to China, which is found only in minorities of the two political parties,
some human rights groups and a fraction of the business community, will
grow. Under that pressure, our relations with China may muddle through,
as they have, but they will not flourish. Already the US is less evident
in investment in China than are our western trade rivals and Japan.<BR>
<BR>
	The constructive alternative is for Congress and the White House to use
the months ahead to examine and update the full range of trade and foreign
policy tools--other than denying MFN--that can be used to influence China.
Expanding current agreements on intellectual property offers one example.
Finding ways to get China to adhere to international trade standards as
a price for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is another.
Yet another is helping the Chinese to see that their current rapid economic
growth cannot be sustained much longer without large private investment
from the west, and that such loans absolutely require a more predictable
legal system. <BR>
<BR>
	In time, it may indeed become possible to abandon the demeaning annual
MFN drill. Meanwhile, the challenge of China policy fairly cries out for
more consultation and creative diplomacy in the councils of the West. The
year ahead is crucial to that purpose.<BR>

The Issues Behind Filegate; It's Not Just a &quot;Bureaucratic Snafu&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="21" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER>
</H3>
If illegal use of confidential FBI files is proven, Filegate will most resemble
that part of Watergate wherein White House zeal to dig up dirt on others
led to dirty practices--and genuine scandal.<BR>
<BR>
No one familiar with the White House pass system could believe that &quot;Project
Update&quot; was merely concerned with reviewing 407 FBI files of former
presidents' aides to see if they still merited passes. That transparently
false explanation is even more suggestive of a cover-up than the reluctance
of the White House to provide Congress with evidence of the affair. <BR>
<BR>
Who among former employees ordinarily would be entitled to a White House
pass? The answer is simple: no one. As a Deputy Assistant to President Reagan
in the mid-'80's I knew very well that the day after I left the payroll
I would merit clearance only on a visit-by-visit basis, and only then with
a current pass holding staffer to vouch for me. It did not matter if I still
knew the Secret Service guards or they remembered me. It didn't matter if
I was still in the same Administration, serving in a departmental position.
I had no right to a White House pass. If there were a few exceptions to
this rule, they were close family members and personal advisers of the incumbent
president.<BR>
<BR>
So how could Craig Livingstone, director of security for President Clinton,
pretend that he wanted to check the FBI files of employees of former Administrations
to see which ones should be given passes? Again the answer is simple, he
couldn't. His explanation is bogus. (Can't you just see old Reagan and Bush
aides given free rein to roam the West Wing, parking their wingtips in the
Roosevelt Room and schmoozing George Stephanopolous in the Mess?) Coming
from a security chief who at the time had given passes to many of his own
White House colleagues without ever putting them through an FBI clearance--a
record of delay and laxity unmatched by any previous Administration--the
whole story is offensive as well as ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
It is far more plausible that the former employees whose private files were
ordered from the FBI were improper targets of White House opposition research.
Out of curiosity, I sent for a copy of the list to see if I was on it. I
wasn't. But there was the name of my deputy in the White House, Tony Blankley.
Why would the file of the deputy director of the Office of Planning and
Evaluation be sought and not his superior's? Could it possibly be because
Mr. Blankley had become Press Secretary to Newt Gingrich, an Administration
critic? Other people on the list are now leaders of Congressional staffs
with direct oversight on White House activities. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the names on the list, it is true, are hard to assign any obvious
purpose. Former Chief of Staff (and later Secretary of State) Jim Baker
is often cited as such a case. Yet, think: in 1993, when the list was first
collected, Baker's name was a lot more interesting, for at that time he
was talking about running for President in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
So the White House assertion that the file acquisitions was just a &quot;bureaucratic
snafu&quot; does not meet the laugh test. <BR>
<BR>
The next line of defense for Administration apologists is, &quot;So what?&quot;
After all, why should former officials worry about their past being known
unless they have something to hide?<BR>
<BR>
In truth, they have a lot to worry about, starting with the danger of anonymous
and false accusations being promoted by people in official positions. In
most arenas of life, malicious rumors can be confronted in the public forum.
We see it all the time in lawsuits and political campaigns. But compilation
of an FBI file does not take place in the open. <BR>
<BR>
An FBI background security check routinely is ordered for people under consideration
for service in the White House or for appointment to a department post that
requires confirmation by the Senate. Some lesser positions also require
FBI checks. By law, the information collected in the resulting FBI file
is confidential and meant only for review by the President, his personnel
staff and, in the case of a Senate confirmation, a few relevant senators
and their top committee aides.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is a popular misconception that FBI files necessarily are objective
and represent the FBI's own considered judgment. FBI agents seek out opinions
as well as facts, and often more from one's critics than from one's friends.
If someone accuses you of something, you don't have the right to know his
name, or, as a practical matter, the nature of the accusation. The agents
roll the whole pile--fact and possible fiction--into something that is meant
to be evaluated by the authorities making (or confirming) the appointment.
These authorities almost always behave with responsibility and common sense.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, misuse of FBI files occurs. From 1959, when President Eisenhower's
nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Admiral Lewis Strauss, was defeated on
trumped up charges, through every administration since, we have seen instances
where something that sounds like a conclusive evaluation, but isn't--&quot;an
FBI file&quot;--is leaked, and a nominee or office-holder is smeared.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you were under consideration for a presidential appointment
and you knew that your views might incite foes to say false or distorted
things about you to the FBI, and that you ran at least a small risk that
your file might be misued by persons unknown to prevent your appointment.
It would be a disincentive to serve, wouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Grim as that prospect looms, now imagine you also learned that years later,
staffers in some future White House could get a hold of your unprocessed
FBI file and make whatever public or private use of it they wanted--without
your approval or knowledge and without connection to any legitimate official
purpose. That suggests why so-called &quot;Project Update&quot; was such
a stark perversion of security procedures. <BR>
<BR>
There are, indeed, &quot;bureaucratic snafus&quot; that mitigate government
&quot;mistakes.&quot; This doesn't seem to be one of them. It looks more
like an assault on privacy and due process, and more broadly, on the trust
that supports representative democracy. It fully warrants the investigation
it is getting.<BR>

Congress Should Seek Out Sources of Worsening Military Morale</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>	Turf  battles and budget cuts always stir anxieties in the military,
 but recent signs of damaged morale in the officer corps  suggest worrisome
trouble from more unusual sources. At some point the fighting ability of
the military--its reason for existence--may be impaired. Before that happens,
Congress should investigate the causes of the recent spate of  firings,
resignations, lawsuits, charges of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and top officer
suicides that are afflicting the armed services.<BR>
<BR>
	A Congressional investigation almost surely would cast a light on the results
of President Clinton's political correctness policies and micro management,
 but it also would call into question the attitudes of some members of Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	For several years now the military has been treated as some kind of social
laboratory. A Tailhook Convention of Navy aviators five years ago included
a notorious party that provided the pretext for the puritanical reaction
that followed. Somehow, few of the guilty parties at  that event were found
and punished, but people who merely attended the same convention and were
involved in no misconduct have been permanently tarnished. So were superiors
and people tagged by remarks or actions in other situations that would have
had little or no consequences in a less hysterical atmosphere.  In all,
14 admirals have been relieved or retired. Literally dozens of other officers'
promotions have been held up by the Senate. This week, Secretary of Defense
William Perry himself finally called for an end to the Tailhook witch hunt.
<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, the Navy, and the services generally, are pinned down
by an arch-feminist fusillade of charges and policy demands. For example,
we now have reached a point, literally, where even unattributed and unsubstantiated
accusations of political incorrectness can wreck officers' careers, and
where failure of superiors to punish those so accused can bring them down,
too. This truly is McCarthyism.<BR>
<BR>
	According to the Center for Military Readiness, a Defense Department Instruction
(DoDI 1320.4) was issued last year that allows &quot;alleged adverse information&quot;
and &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot; to be placed in the files of
officers after they have been selected for promotion and before their confirmation.
Without the officers being informed, the possibly false charges can be circulated
to Pentagon brass, the White House and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	If something similar happens to short-term political appointees, they,
at least, can use publicity and political connections to fight back. Military
officers, sworn to serve civilian leadership, are nearly immobilized. They
may  be subjected to unwarranted and devastating shame.<BR>
<BR>
	The recent suicide of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda,
is almost by itself worthy of a Congressional investigation. Far more apparently
was involved than an approaching Newsweek article examining his right to
wear two &quot;V&quot; (for valor) devices on his  Vietnam campaign ribbons.
Boorda had been under pressure on one hand to push the Clinton political
correctness policies, while on the other he was incurring increasing  criticism
for failing to defend the honor of his officers and the effectiveness of
the service.<BR>
<BR>
	Among the critics was combat hero, author and former Navy Secretary Jim
Webb, who, in a speech at Annapolis revealed the &quot;disturbing statistic&quot;
that in the past year &quot;53 percent of the post-command Commanders in
naval aviation left the Navy rather than continue their careers...These
were the cream, the very future of the Navy, officers who had performed
for two decades in a manner that marked them as potential Admirals.&quot;
Rather than continue on a nominally  successful track, they are quitting,
Webb noted. <BR>
<BR>
	It's not just the Navy. A Coast Guard Captain, Ernie Blanchard, made a
speech at the Coast Guard Academy that included some weak humor that offended
some female cadets. Example: he said that his friend, the Commandant, was
so unsexy that on his wedding night, when he told his wife they could do
anything she wanted, she said she'd like to go to sleep. Was it funny? No.
Was it offensive? Well, it seemingly was so offensive that Capt. Blanchard
was forced to make a public apology. But that didn't end it. Feminists demanded
a court-martial, and the top brass went along. Blanchard, a life-time veteran
with a wife and two teen-aged daughters, was led to believe that he might
well be found guilty, and lose not only his job, but also his pension. Ruined--by
a joke--he, too, committed suicide. <BR>
<BR>
	In the Army, a recent  critical internal report on morale has not been
released to the media, but it has been described in the journal Military
Review as an assessment of &quot;anecdotal accounts&quot; indicating a growing
culture of mistrust and stifled initiative.<BR>
<BR>
	The Army report echoes a former Air Force pilot who  quit because of the
backbiting and division. &quot;It's a one-mistake military now,&quot; he
says, &quot;and the mistake doesn't even have to amount to anything much
or even be true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	It cannot help morale, in this context, that the very President who has
visited many of the new rules upon the military is the same one who has
used his  status as Commander-in-Chief as a claim against prosecution in
a lawsuit for, of all things,  sexual harassment in the Paula Jones case.<BR>
<BR>
	Some service tension, as noted, would be expected anyway in an era of military
downsizing. The armed forces are now 1.4 million, compared to 13 million
at the height of World War II; yet we have just as many generals and admirals
as then. We are top-heavy. But demoralizing your officer class so that many
of your best people quit and many of the others live in quiet fear is  a
strange way to address the leadership issue. <BR>
<BR>
	Are these problems as serious as the news stories and &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;
suggest? Why doesn't the Congress find out?<BR>

    <TITLE>A Clear US Foreign Policy</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3><I>From the Friday, May 31 Seattle Post Intelligencer</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
Converging Trends Demand a Clear US Foreign Policy</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Incrreasingly, it appears that the United States of America lacks a coherent
foreign policy.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are exceptions. We do have a clear (and bi-partisan) policy on
foreign trade, consisting primarily of promotion of free trade agreements
and pursuit of violators of those agreements. But what is American policy
on preventing nuclear non-proliferation? A recently published Defense Department
report on the topic is long on analysis, but blurred on policy ideas.<BR>
<BR>
What about international narcotics trafficking? The U.S. has been de-emphasizing
eradication and interdiction of drug supplies, without expressing any rationale
for this change beyond a desire to concentrate on domestic use, as if the
two concerns were mutually exclusive.<BR>
<BR>
What, in the current U.S. view, is the proper role of the United Nations?
Our policy is completely reactive, with the U.S. failing either to lead
reform or to pay our $1.5 billion bill. We cannot even come up with a candidate
for Secretary General.<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the massive issue of economic development in the less advanced
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia, a key to peace and stability
in the 21st century. Are we for more government to government aid, or something
else, and if something else, what? <BR>
<BR>
Seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one still must ask, what
kind of life do we see for the former communist states--and what role do
we see ourselves playing in helping them to achieve it? <BR>
<BR>
Not for six decades--since 1936--has a presidential election year played
out with so little attention to international affairs. Regrettably, the
national Administration takes its leadership cues from polls and focus groups,
which, like the weather before a hurricane, give no sign of disturbance.
For the Clinton White House the significance of foreign policy pertains
mainly to domestic voter groups. If there is an American strategy anymore
it is a well-kept secret.<BR>
<BR>
In 1936, history shows, the United States courted disaster by ignoring war
threats in Europe and Asia. In 1996 we tempt fate again by not supporting
development of an anti-missile weapons system and by turning our military
into a social agency instead of a fighting force. On the day that an adversary
shows a capacity to infiltrate our defensive perimeter or to intimidate
one of our overseas bases--in Korea, for example--or simply starts a regional
nuclear war, it no longer will count for much here at home that the U.S.
military has been vigorous in implementing sensitivity training.<BR>
<BR>
But even if we could assume a benign world for American interests and the
cause of peace--and who will own up to such naivet&eacute;?--we still could
not avoid the reality that global opportunities, if not necessities, are
being slighted.<BR>
<BR>
Luck and past foreign policy successes have combined to bring the world
to a point of converging trends that Richard Judy, of the Hudson Institute,
identifies and which offer great potential benefits to this generation of
Americans. The most obvious is the globalization of the world's markets
for goods and services, a trend in which the U.S. is both an actor and acted
upon. To put this trend in perspective, exported goods and services in 1960
amounted to only 4.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. But last year
they came to 11 percent of GDP; and by 2010, they are expected to reach
35 percent. This trend alone is transforming our relative stake in international
relations.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more important is the globalization of capital markets, a trend
seemingly still unappreciated by many governments. &quot;Investors worldwide
are increasingly determined and able to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns
on their investments,&quot; Judy observes, and this freedom is coupled with
a staggering growth of private investments--through pension funds and other
sources--into economies world wide. Public investments in developing countries
now represent only a third of the total, having been surpassed in recent
years by private investments. Among the likely results are a closing range
of interest rates worldwide, international funding of more innovations in
products and services and a growing inability of national governments to
thwart the discipline of the free market.<BR>
<BR>
Coincident with these primarily economic trends are four others, according
to Judy:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of institutions,&quot; including law, representative
democracy as a normative goal and acceptance in principle that &quot;private
property (will prevail) as the basic form of asset ownership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of technologies,&quot; whether in transportation,
materials science, medicine, or such softer fields as marketing and management.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of information,&quot; which proceeds in part
from the technological trend. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of culture.&quot; To a staggering degree, the
other trends of convergence support a long term change in value systems,
permitting gratified expectations of common commercial practices, language
(English), and even food availability and environmental standards. This
is also the trend with the most dangerous and explosive potential downside,
for most of the world--including even the USA--does not want to be homogenized
into some one-world culture-glob. In revolt against this trend come myriad
forms of paranoia and rebellion.<BR>
<BR>
These global trends, therefore, may be inevitable, but our success in shaping
them is not. It is folly for American officials to let public ignorance
of these developments determine government policy toward them. Whether from
peril or opportunity, foreign affairs is unavoidably domestic policy these
days and must be recognized as a higher priority in the national debate.
Where, we should be asking, do our political candidates stand?<BR>

<P><BR>
	This summer the Congress is expected, finally, to take up the subject of
campaign finance reform. If you believe the interpretation put upon this
issue by most of the media and the permanent, self-designated &quot;reform&quot;
lobby, the only reason to oppose the proposals being made is the self-interest
of politicians and their major backers. But this simplistic view increasingly
is contradicted by the actual results of the reform measures we already
have adopted in the past 25 years.  In few other areas does the &quot;law
of unintended consequences&quot; operate so fiercely. <BR>
<BR>
	Most, though not all, campaign reform proposals in Washington, D.C., would
result in just the opposite of what reformers claim. They would reduce accountability
of politicians, increase the power of rich candidates and special interests,
decrease electoral competition and stifle the very free political speech
that the American Founders cared about most when they enshrined it  in the
First Amendment.<BR>
<BR>
	Arguably, we need more money in politics, not less, and more people giving,
not fewer, and that to protect free political speech, we need less government
regulation, not more.<BR>
<BR>
	Look at the Alice in Wonderland situation that has developed recently in
this year's presidential race. For the past couple of months, Bob Dole,
his poll numbers sagging, must have wondered why he ever agreed to accept
public matching money for his  presidential campaign. Under the law, a &quot;reform&quot;
measure of its time, Dole received federal matching grants from revenue
raised by the check-off account to which about 20 percent of the taxpayers
contribute on their income tax forms; but in return, he had to agree to
limit his campaign spending during the primary season. Now,  effectively
having secured the Republican nomination, he is only about $150,000 away
from his legal limit and the GOP convention is still months away. He cannot
legally raise and spend campaign dollars until after the Republican convention.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, who had no primary opposition, was able to husband
most of his millions in federal matching money and can campaign to his heart's
delight. In fact, as an incumbent president he already enjoys enormous advantages,
garnering campaign-like publicity while simply performing as president.
At the same time, his allies in the AFL-CIO, who are able to operate outside
the campaign laws, are spending $35 million to defeat Dole and the Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been similarly focused all spring, placing TV ads
in crucial election states. The cumulative effect on Dole's numbers could
not have been good.<BR>
<BR>
	Dole is left now with the option of using the resources of the Republican
party, but even there he has to be careful. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $20 million to boost its cause before the party convention,
but the White House and the Democratic party's lawyers are watching to see
if, for example, Dole or other Republicans at party-sponsored events target
Bill Clinton by name in a way that will allow a campaign ethics charge to
be lodged with the Federal Elections Commission. Both parties at this point
can talk about &quot;issues,&quot; the law appears to say, but cannot explicitly
support their candidate's election. On either this ground or the likelihood
of &quot;overspending,&quot; Dole could find himself in another of our country's
synthetic &quot;scandals,&quot; and a defendant before the Federal Elections
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	Thus we see in this one situation, the potential for absurdity in modern
campaign &quot;reform&quot; legislation. One of the major party candidates
is nearly incapacitated and tempted to technical error by the rigidity of
federal law--in a dilemma not anticipated years ago by reformers. The parties
themselves can campaign, but only if they pretend otherwise. The special
interests, however, including besides the AFL-CIO,  a host of powers, such
as the National Rifle Association, the National Chamber of Commerce, the
trial lawyers and the pro-and anti-abortion groups, can spend unlimited
funds free of public scrutiny--so long as they don't use explicit words
urging a vote for their preferred candidates. And billionaire Ross Perot
(who claims to be a reformer, of all things) can spend as much as he likes,
and say whatever he likes, so long as he spends his own money.  Ralph Nader,
another potential third party presidential candidate who  claims &quot;reform&quot;
credentials, indicates that he may not release his income tax return, since
where he gets his money  is nobody's business.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Reform,&quot; you see, is for other people. For oneself it increasingly
is mostly a dandy way to get the tactical upper hand over one's ideological
foes. Specifically, it is a means to handicap accountable political parties
to the benefit of unaccountable special interests, to handicap challengers
to the benefit of incumbents, and to enable personally rich candidates to
place their competition at a disadvantage. At least, that is the way it
is working out.<BR>
<BR>
	Twenty five years ago, when the post-Watergate Federal Elections Campaign
Act was adopted, the Supreme Court  (in Buckley v. Valeo) allowed the law's
limits on contributions (a $1000 amount in federal elections that has never
been adjusted for inflation), but cited First Amendment free speech objections
to permit limits on spending for wealthy candidates, special interest groups
or candidates who decline to accept federal matching money in presidential
races. <BR>
<BR>
	On their own terms, therefore, the reformers wound up with  a lopsided
system that is shot through with unfair exceptions and contradictions. And
the results show it. Though reformers sought lower cost campaigns, campaign
spending levels, in constant dollars, have gone up threefold. The incumbency
advantage actually increased after the post-Watergate reforms were enacted;
even in 1994, 91.4 percent of incumbents who sought re-election were successful.
Where reformers wanted to reduce the influence of special interests, they
failed spectacularly. The best example is the creation of political action
committees (PACs) that collect voluntary contributions in a given industry
or civic organization. This was originally a  reform meant to replace straightforward
corporate support of candidates. Now the PACs themselves are under attack.
<BR>
<BR>
	Even if the Supreme Court had accepted the full dose of reform medicine
first advanced in law--controlling expenditures as well as contributions--we
probably would have been disappointed by the consequences. As Larry J. Sabato,
a campaign finance expert at the University of Virginia, has written, &quot;One
cannot dam the flow of political money in a society as free as ours. If
it's blocked in one area, it will simply find other channels...These alternative
means of influence are often obscured and unaccountable, eliminating visible
disclosure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, Sabato's reality check runs directly contrary to what reformers
and much of the public believe to be the case. They always imagine that
good clean election campaigns are right around the corner, if only we pass
a few more regulations. What we forget is the &quot;law of unintended consequences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Take the &quot;Bi-partisan Clean Congress Act&quot; introduced in the U.S.
House by Republican Rep. Linda Smith of southwest Washington,  and several
other legislators--Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Shays, (R-Conn.)--with
strong support from the permanent reform lobby, including Common Cause,
the League of Women Voters, Ross Perot and most of the liberal media (the
latter have lionized Rep. Smith, though they oppose nearly every other political
view she holds). This bill would ban PACs, curb out-of-state contributions
to Congressional candidates, and further limit spending by the political
parties. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn.), would seek to
convince candidates to limit spending voluntarily by offering them free
or reduced TV advertising time and government-financed mailings, and penalizing
those who do not go along by giving their opponents even more government
campaign support. The Senate bill also would expand further the regulatory
powers of the Federal Elections Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	You can't blame them for trying. But how would it work out? Linda Smith
ran last time against an incumbent, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, who received a
lot of out-of-state money and outspent Mrs. Smith, then the challenger,
two to one. But Linda Smith, a leading power among segments of the religious
right, had a well-organized power base that raised enough money to enable
her to get her message out. It would make political sense for her now, as
an incumbent, to entrench this advantage by limiting out-of-state contributions
and providing overall spending caps.<BR>
<BR>
	But consider the case of Rep. George Nethercutt of Spokane. As a challenger
in 1994 and facing mighty Speaker of the House Tom Foley, he found initial
fundraising very difficult. Even local Republicans were afraid of offending
a powerful incumbent Democrat. Nethercutt was a challenger who required
out-of-state support to get enough traction to make his race credible. <BR>
<BR>
	Thus, whether out-of-state contributions hurt or help incumbents depends
a great deal on the circumstances of a particular race. And the same goes
for efforts to keep a lid on personal spending. A challenger's only hope
against a well-known incumbent, especially if that officeholder enjoys media
 support, is to raise a large enough war chest to get his message out on
his own.  Says Bradley A. Smith, who teaches election law at Capital University
in Ohio, &quot;What is important is not who outspends whom, but that the
challenger spends enough to stimulate voter interest in the race...Efforts
to cap spending help entrench incumbents and so foster public frustration
with the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
	The same also is true of contribution limits.  Little-known challengers
need to  raise large sums early if they  hope to win, and they usually cannot
raise such sums without getting large contributions from a few family members
and close friends. Contribution limits like those in the Smith and McCain
bills mainly help incumbents, people (like Smith) with an already organized
donor base, and the personally wealthy, who can contribute all they want.
One person's &quot;reform&quot; is thus another's restraint on fair competition
and voter choice.<BR>
<BR>
	A major flaw with the thinking of most reformers is the idea that there
is too much money in political campaigns now.  As Bradley Smith points out,
the total spent on all Congressional races in 1994, including primaries,
was $600 million, less than half the annual advertising budget of General
Motors, or about $3 per eligible voter--the amount of a video rental. It
is also false to think that the amount of money spent on campaigns is responsible
for  &quot;negative&quot; campaigning and attack ads on TV. There is no
evidence for this, nor for the conventional impression that expensive campaigns
always prevail. If the complaint is based on false assumptions, therefore,
it is not surprising that that it has bad consequences.<BR>
<BR>
	If we can all agree that we want ample political competition to assure
the voters choices, adequate airing of issues to provide voter's information
for making those choices and prevention of hidden influences, then a better
kind of reform might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
	First, raise the limit on personal contributions. In truth, there probably
should be no limit, so long as the money is disclosed. Personal donations
are far more disinterested than those of PACs, let alone the soft money
spending of special interests, that goes unreported.  Contribution limits
for individual donors have tilted the playing field to millionaires and
billionaires, who by court ruling, are burdened with no such restrictions.
As a compromise, at least raise the present contribution limit enough to
take account of 25 years of inflation; i.e., to $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
	Second, don't weaken the political parties, strengthen them. It is ridiculous
to try to limit or curtail their spending . They are the proper and historical
home of politics and the institutions of democracy that are most regulated
by political disclosure laws--in contrast to the court-protected  unions,
industry associations and special interest advocacy groups. Fortunately,
a Colorado case is about to be decided which could determine that money
parties spend on their candidates constitute an &quot;expenditure&quot;
under the law, not a &quot;contribution,&quot; and therefore, they, too,
are covered by the First Amendment's free speech clause. <BR>
<BR>
	Indeed, in Washington State, as a result of Initiative 134, we already
have reached a similar conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
	Third, if we are going to have strict disclosure laws, they should be applied
to special interest groups--including the reformer's own organizations--that
lobby the public on political issues.<BR>
<BR>
	Fourth, instead of trying to shrink spending on politics, which is wrongheaded,
and futile in any case, stimulate the ordinary citizen to participate more.
Nothing would go farther to liberate citizen politicians than expanded support
in the form of citizen campaign contributions. We can do this by offering
a tax deduction for all contributions up to the legal limit and a tax credit
for all those below a set figure; say, $50. Parties should be included,
as well as candidates.<BR>
<BR>
	Fifth, if the above is accomplished, it then would not hurt to limit PACs
further, and it will not be necessary to turn eventually to direct public
finance of political reform.<BR>
<BR>
	This kind of program suggestion is not unique. Variations of it recently
have been embraced by groups and individuals as diverse as the libertarian
CATO Institute and the liberal Center for the Study of the American Electorate,
Speaker Newt Gingrich and liberal columnist David Broder, the conservative
Wall Street Journal and the liberal Roll Call. They all have seen that what
we need now is not another round of reform, but, if you will, a reform of
the reforms already in place.<BR>
<BR>
	 Political freedom, after all,  is really an analog to economic freedom,
as well as its natural companion. Just as over-regulation can stifle the
economy and lead to government control, so too can over-regulation of politics.
Our object, therefore, should be to increase competition and free speech
in the political process.<BR>

A Cheaper, Surer Way to Fund and Build Public Projects</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="7" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>How are we going to pay for it all?</B> Isn't there any way to lower
the costs? These are the plaintive cries of taxpayers around the country
as their local and state elected officials try to cajole them into supporting
a growing list of infrastructure projects.<BR>
<BR>
But even as the list grows, taxpayer tolerance for big ticket public works
is declining. In Seattle, for example, where voters this week passed (turned
down) a $50 million bond measure to help build the &quot;Commons&quot;park
near the downtown, wary but resolute city officials are expected to ask
soon for a new central library, expansion of the waterfront aquarium, improvements
to parks and roads, new courts and police stations. With previously approved
bond issues and City Council votes, Seattle expects to lay out $660 million
for capital projects in the next six years, a figure that doesn't include
projects by school districts, the separately financed, and largely self-supporting
water and light departments, or the port authority. The Port of Seattle
alone, for example, has $1.6 billion of projects scheduled for the next
six years.<BR>
<BR>
King County and its neighboring counties in Puget Sound, and the State of
Washington, meanwhile, have even bigger capital plans--some slated for action,
some just a fond wish-- including a convention center expansion, two sports
stadia, a several billion dollar rapid transit system (headed for a vote
in the fall), an environmental greenway between Seattle and the Cascade
mountains to the East, and literally untold billions in freeway and bridge
construction. Statewide, transportation infrastructure needs alone have
been estimated at $20.8 billion in the next quarter century.<BR>
<BR>
It would be an exaggeration to say that voters are either fed up or exhausted
by the large construction agenda ahead, perhaps because they are only dimly
aware of how big it is. But, if voters have not shown themselves angry,
they clearly are impatient and highly selective. Part of their reluctance
is probably based on a sense that taxes at all levels are too high. Another
part is surely due to a concern that they can see no strategy or priority
evident in all this capital planning, and too little coordination among
governmental units.<BR>
<BR>
But there also could well be some frustration that the costs of these projects
are simply too high--that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
Past legislation meant to prevent corruption and to assure environmental
protection has contributed to delays and higher overhead costs. However,
also contributing has been the very nature of government, where typically
the group that spends the money is different from that which plans how to
spend it and is always different from those whose money is spent.<BR>
<BR>
The usual pattern (to oversimplify for the sake of brevity) is that government
decides to build, say, a prison, then hires a design team to plan it, and
then lets it out for competitive construction bids. Once the low bidder
is selected, the construction project gets underway. Soon enough, it seems,
cost over-runs are noted. More money must be found. Even some projects that
come in nominally under budget were unnecessarily expensive in the first
place. The design team, having no responsibility for balancing all elements,
including likely operating and maintenance costs, may &quot;gold plate,&quot;
or over-engineer, the design and make high price tags inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
At least, that is the charge laid against the present system by advocates
of various alternative approaches. Some are promoting privatization of construction,
wherein, say, a jail or prison will be built and managed by a private company.
Nationally, there were 88 of these secure adult facilities under construction
by the end of 1994, according the National Center for Policy Analysis. A
1991 study in Texas that found that costs for four prisons were reduced
14.4 percent by private building and management. An Australian report in
1994 found a 20 percent saving in a similar situation.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;design/build&quot; is used for some such projects, and &quot;design/build/operate&quot;
for ones that take the private theme still further. In the latter category
is a new project by the City of Seattle to develop a water filtration plant
along the Tolt River. But the money is still the public's and so is the
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
This brings us to a visionary approach to public projects that has been
pioneered in England, the so-called Private Initiative Project (PFI). The
PFI has changed the very concept of government's role from providing services
as an owner to procuring them as a customer. An entire project--say, a prison,
to go back to the example used before--is designed, financed, built, operated
and owned by a private concern which then, per agreement, sells its services--correctional
services, per inmate, in this case--to the government. The private concern
technically owns the project and sells services to the government, which
is spared any cash expenditure up front and pays fixed operating expenses
over a long period, such as 30 years. The government's short term role is
to decide what correctional services it wants in the first place--technically,
the values and performance standards it expects of a well-run prison, and
the risks it wants to insure against--and then to ask for worldwide bids
to design the project on that basis.<BR>
<BR>
It is in the design process that the English have found that the most money
can be saved; not because that process represents much expense itself, but
because the quality of the design determines the ultimate costs of the project
as a whole. With the full range of private sector expertise available to
companies -- and consortia of companies -- involved in bidding the project,
various cost controls, revenue streams and financing are offered to a public
authority. Then the winning team bids out the construction, also worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The result in Britain over the past few years has been a steep increase
in Public Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which now amount to $28 billion,
for roads, transit, prisons, hospitals, schools, libraries, government offices,
and much else. Thanks to the wide expertise available to private consortia,
their ability to integrate their work, and the freedom they enjoy as owners
to create innovative solutions, they are able to bring in projects at an
expense 20 to 30 percent lower than those of comparable public projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the past couple of months, Douglas Hogg, who heads the PFI, and Jonathan
Hugget, an associate from Vancouver, B.C. where this idea presently is being
aired, have visited Seattle to meet with a few local business and governmental
leaders who have expressed interest in the concept. The hope on all sides
is that we might be able to learn from their experiences. Britain, Canada
and the US all have differences in the way public development is governed
today. In particular, we enjoy the benefits of tax exempt bonds for public
works, which gives our public approach an advantage over almost any private
one. Nonetheless, the advantage may not be conclusive and, in any event,
the PFI concept may be adaptable to our particular circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
When a half dozen Seattle bond attorneys and public finance analysts vetted
the Public Finance Initiative idea last week, they concluded that potential
benefits definitely warrant further investigation. <BR>
<BR>
They noted that the English also might have something to teach us about
handling the politics of this form of privatization. In the UK, the Conservative
Party initiated the Public Finance Initiative and are especially pleased
that it saves money, while the Labor Party backs it because its savings
in overhead costs result in more money available for construction jobs.
The tough job initially was persuading the bureaucracy. The Brits were courageous
enough to take on that daunting challenge. Are we?<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A New Social Contract for America</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
	We probably all know that costs  of entitlements are the main source of
federal budget deficits, and the problem is destined to get dangerously
worse as the Baby Boom generation ages. We all know, too, that ordinary
families--especially the young--are having a hard time saving independently
for their old age. And, we all know that elderly voters, as a group, are
easily convinced that any perceived reductions in these programs are unfair.
Less widely recognized is that younger voters are waking up to this issue;
witness recent university student council resolutions protesting the grim
future of Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
	The solutions we hear from government usually involve little more than
reduced benefits and raised taxes. But the futility of this approach, especially
for Social Security,  is evident from just one statistic. In 1945 there
were 20 American workers to support each Social Security recipient. Today
the figure is 3.1 workers per recipient. By 2030, as today's children reach
middle age, there will be fewer than two workers for each beneficiary. <BR>
<BR>
	Sharp benefit cutbacks of roughly 40 percent and payroll tax hikes from
15.3 percent to 15.7 percent will be needed in a few years to maintain the
solvency of Social Security, but they will devastate workers and retirees
alike. The entitlement programs themselves are thus becoming a source of
poverty and social insecurity  in this country.<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately,  there is an exciting, win/win strategy for solving the Social
Security problem, at least, and it is beginning to attract broad, bi-partisan
support. The most responsible thing the two presidential candidates can
do about it this political campaign year is to agree to consider it seriously
next January, when there will be less temptation to demagogue.<BR>
<BR>
	But the public needs to start discussing the idea right away, because this
solution--using the private sector to rescue Social Security--no longer
will  be possible in a few years, once the Baby Boomers themselves have
retired. Action is needed in the next couple of years.<BR>
<BR>
	There are now several plans out to use capitalism and the &quot;miracle
of compound interest&quot; to provide a brighter future for American workers.
The libertarian Cato Institute has one, and so does Martin Feldstein, Harvard
professor and former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers. Republicans, naturally, tend to like the idea.  Steve Forbes elicited
cheers when he embraced the idea at the University of Arizona debate during
the presidential primary season. A similar program, many point out, already
works spectacularly in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
	But one of the first and most carefully researched American plans is that
of a former Democratic candidate for Senate from Delaware, Sam Beard, founder
of the National Development Council that has helped create inner-city jobs
under four presidents of both parties, organizer of the Jefferson Awards
for community service, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle--and,
most importantly, author of a new book, &quot;Restoring Hope in America:
The Social Security Solution&quot; (ICS Press, San Francisco).  Beard's
first post-publication address will be  in Seattle next Tuesday, May 14,
at 7 p.m. in the University of Washington's Kane Hall Room 220, co-sponsored
by Discovery Institute, The Seattle P.I. and the UW Graduate School of Public
Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
	I was introduced to Sam Beard about a year and a half ago by the P.I's
publisher, J.D. Alexander, and immediately saw in him the classic example
of the enterprising generalist seized with a life-changing big idea.<BR>
<BR>
	Under Beard's plan, present Social Security recipients would receive exactly
what they have been promised, and those approaching retirement also would
stay part of the plan we have now--guaranteed. But young people just starting
out in the workforce would be given the opportunity to put their Social
Security taxes to work in investment funds in the private market, much as
regular mutual funds and annuity programs operate. The government's role
would be to allocate each taxpayer's money to the fund he or she selected
and to make certain that the funds are organized in a sound manner. Workers
in the middle-age brackets (such as Baby Boomers) could mix their forms
of participation, partially paying into the present system and partially
investing in the new Social Security investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
	The plan works because the private sector is so much more productive than
the public sector, which, in any case, does not invest its Social Security
funds, but spends them as they come in on other government priorities. (What
we have today is a great chain letter scheme that would be illegal in the
private sector.) The Beard plan also will work because the huge Baby Boom
generation presently--and for the next few years--is pumping into the government
far more than the older generation of recipients is taking out. Under the
&quot;Restoring Hope&quot; plan, that surplus will be invested rather than
squandered on other programs. A one-time, long term and, of course, voluntary,
bond program for better-off taxpayers will cover the budgetary shortfall
caused by the government's shift of Social Security money that it is &quot;borrowing&quot;
now back into the Social Security program for which it was intended.<BR>
<BR>
	What this plan offers the elderly is just what they have, without danger
of later cutbacks. What it offers the young is hope for a secure old age:
roughly 50 percent more money annually than from the present system, or
twice as much if they choose to treat the program as an annuity. For a $30,000
a year wage-earner,  after 45 years, this would come to $18, 424 a year,
versus $13,710 under Social Security (all of this is in constant dollars).
Capital of roughly $368,486 could be passed along to heirs. Alternatively,
the recipient could use his accumulation as an annuity, raising his annual
receipt to $29,256. <BR>
<BR>
	Knowing that they are accumulating real savings and that these funds are
working away in the private sector will give all wage earners an investment
in the future of the overall economy, a stake most presently lack.  What
it offers the country as a whole is a huge increase in the savings rate
and a brake on inflation and interest rates. No wonder it has won praise
from  sources as varied as William F. Buckley and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
and from both Democratic Sen. Robert Kerry of Nebraska and Republican Sen.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, co-chairmen of the Social Security Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Restoring Hope in America&quot; is nothing less than a new social
contract, a chance to unite rather than divide us, to heal generational
and class differences rather than increase them. It is the program of shared
economic growth and security that we badly need.<BR>

	When you get a copy of the Seattle Arts Commission's Directory of Public
Art, you will see listings of statues to Christopher Columbus, Leif Erikson
and Dr. Jose Rizal, the hero of the Philippines. But we barely manage one
statue and a copper bust of Chief Seattle and a mere artistic &quot;silhouette&quot;
for the local pioneers Arthur Denny and David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (at
the Pioneer Square Metro stop).  And even as we prepare for next year's
100th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, you will see no mention of
a statue--neither silhouette nor bas relief  --to honor the person who did
the most to establish Seattle as a world class city, Erastus Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	He is not in school history books (how would they know what to make of
him?), but he surely was one of the world's greatest public relations men,
and the first of a long line of such conjurers in Seattle. The very fact
that Seattle has reason to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush at all, and
enjoys the excellent gold rush museum operated by the U. S. Park Service
across from Occidental Park, is due largely to the talents and gall of Erastus
Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd, above all, who saw what the arrival in Seattle of a &quot;ton
of gold&quot; on the S.S. Portland in the summer of 1897 could mean for
its happenstance destination. The newly discovered gold fields in Dawson
City were some 1600 miles away in the Yukon Territory of Canada, but you
had to get there from somewhere on the West Coast. Vancouver and Victoria
were actually closer than Seattle. Tacoma and Portland were nearly as handy,
and San Francisco was bigger and better known. But Brainerd and his committee
 at the Chamber of Commerce persuaded the world that Seattle was the gateway
to the Yukon, and later Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
	The miners came here, it was said, and we mined the miners. Outfitting
stores were built, the ancestors of today's recreation equipment businesses,
shipping lines were founded, food distributors set up. A federal Assay Office
was established so that gold could be turned into U.S. currency. By 1911
Seattle had grown from a population of 65,000 to over 250,000 and was organizing
another public relations success, the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Brainerd's
public relations engineered a self-fulfilling boom and truly put Seattle
on the world map.<BR>
<BR>
	It would be nice to imagine that Brainerd achieved all this simply by sending
out a few new-fangled telegrams. But the campaign was far more extensive,
aggressive, and wily, if not deceitful. The historian Murray Morgan describes
how Brainerd &quot;wrote articles for national magazines, planted quotes
from the articles with the wire services, then used extracts from the wire
stories in advertisements which proclaimed Seattle the Emporium to the Klondike.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Other northwest cities tried to use the wire services, too, but Brainerd
sent corrections to the papers, which got printed, and provided form letters
for newcomers to Seattle to write  letters to the editors of their former
hometown papers. He used State of Washington stationery to write to mayors
and governors around the country, and to foreigners, asking how many prospectors
they expected to be heading to Seattle en route to the gold fields. Ostensibly,
Seattle wanted to prepare for all the visitors, but the effort was just
another way of leaving  the impression that Seattle was, indeed, the gateway
to the Klondike.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd took out ads in The New York Journal, Cosmopolitan, Century, McClure's
and other magazines of the day, had the state Secretary of State print a
guide to Klondike prospectors that, naturally, routed them through Seattle,
and sent the folders to libraries all over the world. It also was Brainerd
who went around the Director of the U.S. Mint to get the assay office opened;
he did it by  enlisting a Pennsylvania Congressman--the brother of a Seattle
businessman--in getting a special law passed.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd himself deserves, but lacks, a biography. We know he was born
in Connecticut in 1855, graduated from Harvard College, married and had
two children,  and was a practicing journalist in the East until 1890. At
the start of the gold rush he was, of all thing, Paraguayan Consul in Seattle.
For a while after his successful gold rush publicity campaign he tried his
own luck in the Klondike, as a mining consultant--a mistake. Returning to
Seattle in 1904 he became editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  He
was active in the Republican Party and later wrote a five volume history
of great artists, and another book on &quot;Alaska and the Klondyke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Over the decades, Brainerd has been followed by a fabulous string of civic
leaders and PR promoters--from the people who organized the early civic
&quot;Potlatch&quot; events to those who started Seafair, from the creators
of the Century 21 World's Fair to those trying now to bring the  Olympic
Games to Seattle in 2008. <BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd who made Seattle big and rich and confident, but he himself
never cashed in. The final years of his life were spent in a mental hospital,
where he died Christmas Day, 1922, at age 67. <BR>
	We ought to put up a statue to Erastus Brainerd.<BR>

<title>Linda Chavez: Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway -- December 11, 1996</title>

<i>December 11, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd><I>BETHESDA, Md.</I> - Maybe California voters ought to stay home next election. In some quarters their votes don't count anyway. 
<P>
<dd>Two years ago, a federal judge stopped the state from enforcing a measure which denied welfare to illegal aliens approved by 60% of California's electorate.  This year on election night, the television networks declared the victor in the presidential election before the polls closed on the West Coast.  And last week, a federal judge overruled a majority of California voters who voted Nov. 5 to end race- and sex-based preferences in state programs. 
<P>
<dd>This latest affront is the most galling, however, because it so grossly insults the intelligence and the decency of the voters. At issue is a ballot measure adopted by 54.5% of the electorate, Proposition 209, which banned both discrimination and preference on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or ethnicity in state employment, education and contracting.  The initiative was modeled on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination. Proponents of race- and sex-based preferences filed suit the morning after the election, alleging that the measure placed an unfair burden on minorities and women and thus violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that all persons receive equal protection of the laws. 
<P>
<dd>How could a measure that explicitly prohibits discrimination be discriminatory? 
<P>
<dd>How could language that explicitly forbids giving any group preference on the basis of race or sex unfairly disadvantage minorities and women?  Easy, according to the judge who issued a temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing Proposition 209.  "Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment," Judge Thelton E. Henderson declared.  But if we can't trust that the words of our laws mean what they actually say, the whole basis of the rule of law falls apart. Suddenly we are in a world in which a judge can say, like Humpty Dumpty in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, "When I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean, nothing more or less."  All that matters, as Humpty tartly informed Alice, is "(who) is to be master." And lately in our democracy, judges have become masters of us all. 
<P>
<dd>In this case, the judge's own background casts doubt about his impartiality. Before he was appointed by President Carter in 1980, Judge Henderson practiced civil rights law in California and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, Equal Rights Advocates and
other liberal advocacy organizations. These groups have long argued that it is not discrimination to give preference to some groups so long as they are minorities or women. 
<P>
<dd>By this logic it is not discrimination when Asian and white students must have higher test scores and grades than blacks or Hispanics in order to be admitted to a top university. Discrimination is just what affirmative action proponents say, no more or less. Judge Henderson claims that Proposition 209 places an unfair burden on minorities and women by denying them the right "to petition their state and local officials for race- and gender-conscious programs aimed at remedying discrimination." In fact, most such programs are the result of executive and court orders, not legislative action, anyway. Supporters of affirmative action have been unwilling even to admit that they want preferential, not equal, treatment, much less to put a proposal for those programs to a vote. 
<P>
<dd>Nothing prevents supporters of racial preferences from doing what opponents did: putting their own initiative on the ballot and letting the people decide. They are unlikely to do so, however, because most voters believe that racial preferences are wrong, period. Unlike liberal judges and civil rights groups, most people don't imagine you can end discrimination against one group of people by practicing discrimination against another. Judge Henderson may have trouble interpreting the plain meaning of the Constitution's guarantee that "no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
<P>
<dd>But most of the rest of us, including a majority of California voters, understand that to mean no discrimination and no preferences, just as Proposition 209 promises.

<h2>Clinton should skip GOP, Arkansans and diversity</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>Administration officials are departing their jobs so rapidly since the election that you'd think the Republicans had won. 

Stepping down so far are the White House chief of staff and secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, plus the heads of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and the civil rights division in the Justice Department, to name only the most prominent. 
<dd>Second terms always produce turnover, often because the president wants it, but this mad rush for the door barely two weeks after the president won re-election is a bit unseemly. 
<dd>Whether motivated by fear that the administration will be bogged down in Whitewater and related investigations over the next couple of years or hamstrung in directing policy by the Republican Congress, the Clinton team started to bolt as soon as the ballots were counted. 
<dd>Now the president must spend the next few months trying to reassemble his players. 
<dd>Here are some tips for the president as he makes his picks: 
<ul>
<li>Forget bipartisanship. President Clinton has already announced he'd like to appoint a Republican to his Cabinet, but it's a bad idea for the president and any Republican who might be chosen.<p>Giving a post to a Republican would only further alienate congressional Democrats, and unless the president is thinking of switching parties himself, he'll need to hold his Democratic votes in the next Congress.<p>Besides, the public isn't really fooled when a president of one party picks political appointees of the other. Look at Ronald Reagan's most famous Democratic appointees: U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Education Secretary William Bennett.<p>Neither remained in the Democratic Party, and Kirkpatrick became most famous in political circles for referring to Democrats as the "blame-America-first" crowd. (I lasted almost two years as a Reagan Democrat while director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but switched parties when I moved to the White House.)<p>
<li>Stop bean-counting. The president's obsession in 1993 with choosing a Cabinet that "looks like America" produced a series of embarrassing nominations that he had to abandon. Nonetheless, he's likely to repeat his mistakes if he listens to groups representing women and blacks, who have already been whining that the announced departures will leave the administration less diverse.<p>A coalition of women's organizations complained to Vice President Gore last week that although women gave the Clinton-Gore team a 17-point advantage in their votes, few women were being mentioned for top posts in the next term.<p>They were particularly exercised over remarks attributed to an "unnamed administration source" discounting Clinton U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as a likely contender for Secretary of State.<p>But Albright probably isn't a good choice for State - and it has nothing to do with her sex. She's been a chief proponent of making U.N. peacekeeping/ peacemaking operations a priority for the Pentagon, as well as of expanding our efforts to include nation-building in places like Somalia and Haiti. With U.S. troops staying in Bosnia for at least another 18 months to promote more political stability, despite Clinton's original promises to have them out before the end of this year, the president would be well advised to avoid promoting to a senior foreign policy post someone who will focus attention on the mission creep in Bosnia. <p>
<li>Avoid naming anyone from Arkansas. Some of the president's most disastrous choices in his first term were political cronies and friends from Arkansas. Several of these left the administration in disgrace, including Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell (now serving time in federal prison for bilking clients) and William Kennedy. 
</ul>
<p>
The president can't afford any more scrutiny of his past dealings and relationships in Arkansas. He already has to worry about the likelihood of more indictments being handed down by the independent counsel investigating Whitewater, the pending Supreme Court hearing on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit from his time as Arkansas governor, and new investigations into his Arkansas buddy John Huang, whose fund-raising efforts for the president may result in the appointment of yet another independent counsel. 
<dd>Good luck, Mr. President. You'll need it. So may the fools who rush into an administration where angels fear to tread.

<h2>Editors, reporters should disclose votes</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>BETHESDA, Md. - Whether Tuesday's election results make you mad or glad, there's one thing that should make you worry. 
<dd>One small but immensely powerful group of Americans influenced this election more than all the contributors to all political parties and candidates combined, but they don't have to disclose their influence or make public their political preferences. 
<dd>They are the linchpin of every election, the very source of nearly all the public's information. 
<dd>They are the newspaper, magazine, TV and radio reporters, editors and producers who bring you "the news." They are also arguably the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. 
<dd>If past behavior is any indication, 9 out of 10 reporters and editors probably cast their votes for Bill Clinton and other Democratic candidates Tuesday. 
<dd>At least that's what most studies of voting behavior among the national media suggest, including one by the Freedom Forum last year that showed 89% of national correspondents, editors and writers voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. 
<dd>But voting bias doesn't necessarily prove reporting bias. It's at least theoretically possible that liberal reporters and editors were scrupulous in preventing their own personal bias from affecting their coverage of political issues and candidates during the election. 
<dd>Unfortunately, recent content analysis of TV news coverage indicates otherwise. 
<dd>A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this election season. 
<dd>In September, Clinton received 54% positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30% for Bob Dole. 
<dd>The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81% of the time, his social policies 78%, and his conduct as a candidate 81%, according to the center. 
<dd>Ironically, Clinton's worst press in the early fall came when he signed the overwhelmingly popular welfare-reform bill, which the newscasts criticized in 90% of their stories, demonstrating that the media's liberal slant is even worse than their partisan prejudice. 
<dd>Perhaps that is one reason why, although voters think of the media as more liberal than conservative, they don't think the media are partisan Democrats. 
<dd>Can anything be done to curb such bias? 
<dd>Why not insist on full disclosure of the media's voting behavior? 
<dd>The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets. 
<dd>It's possible to protect reporters' privacy while still informing the public by gathering the information and publishing it anonymously, much the way all survey data are reported. 
<dd>It could work like this: After each election, news organizations would voluntarily distribute surveys to their own staff asking them to identify their party affiliation and if and how they voted in the election. (Measures to protect individual privacy would be necessary, much as they are in mail-ballot elections.) The information then would be published or aired, allowing the public to make up its own mind about whether journalists' views may have influenced their coverage. 
<dd>Some voters might even clip and save the information, the better to judge the media's coverage during subsequent elections. 
<dd>Of course, some journalists would choose not to reveal party affiliation or voter preference, but that, too, could be measured and reported along with the overall results. Readers and viewers would be left to conclude for themselves why some news media staff did not want their political views known. 
<dd>I suspect some editors and producers might even be embarrassed by the political imbalance on their own staffs. A few might even try harder for more balanced coverage as a result. 
<dd>Who knows, a handful of editors and producers might be inspired to hire a conservative or two other than as commentators, the role to which most conservatives are now consigned. 
<dd>Is it really too much to expect members of the press to live up to the same standards of full disclosure they insist on for everyone else? 
<dd>Disclosure wouldn't necessarily eliminate media bias, but at least it would expose it so the public could be more discerning news consumers.

<h2>The clueless voter ought to stay home</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Next week's election is predicted to have one
of the lowest voter turnouts in modern history, which is good news for democracy in America. Oh,
I know it's my civic duty to bemoan voter apathy and urge everyone to vote. But many nonvoters
don't know or care enough about the democratic process to cast intelligent - that is, informed
- votes. Sadly, even some actual voters probably don't know enough about
the candidates or issues to be casting their votes astutely, either. And uninformed voters going
to the polls is even more dangerous than apathetic nonvoters staying home. 
<p>
Who are these uninformed Americans? Nearly half of all adults
can't answer basic questions about U.S. government, much less specifics about issues and officeholders
or candidates, according to a recent study conducted for The Washington Post by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation. The survey, taken about a year ago, found that 40%
of adults couldn't name the vice president, and almost half failed to identify the speaker of the
House. I suspect fewer Americans would flunk these basic questions at the height of a national
election, but ignorance about government itself and policy issues no doubt is just as high.
<p>
For example, nearly half of those surveyed didn't know the U.S. Supreme Court can decide whether
a law is constitutional, and nearly 60% believe that the government spends more on foreign aid than
on Medicare. Although foreign aid is less than 2% of the budget, most Americans believe it accounts
for fully one-quarter of all federal spending. According to the survey, Republicans are better informed than
Democrats, but no group is exempt from ignorance. Traveling around the country, I've certainly encountered
my share of clueless citizens, including one likely Dole voter who probably shouldn't
be voting at all. Although the woman was pleasant, hard working and college educated, she literally
had no idea why she was voting. She told me she really &quot;liked&quot; President Bush and had voted
for him in '92, but she didn't have much of an opinion about either Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. She didn't seem
to know about Dole's tax proposals or where Clinton stood on anything. &quot;I'll probably
vote for Dole because Clinton beat Bush. And I really liked George Bush,&quot; she gushed. 
I've heard other would-be voters say they support Clinton because they like his looks, or the way he
hugs Chelsea, or because it's his generation's turn to govern.
<p>
And they are quite serious. Women seem more disposed to such nonsense than men in my own informal
surveys. And the Harvard/Kaiser study confirms that women - including college-educated
young women - know less about politics than men, but they are more likely to vote. Is
it really healthy for a democracy to encourage poorly informed persons to vote? I don't think so, but
mine seems to be a minority opinion - or at least so impolitic a view that few in public life
are willing to own up to it. Everywhere the next few days we will see and hear indiscriminate
pleas from politicians, the media and civic groups to &quot;get out and vote.&quot; These high-minded
folks would do a greater service by insisting that citizens not vote unless they learn something about
the issues. Democracy entails more than a willing electorate.
<p>
Those who do vote have a responsibility to understand the political process and know something about the issues and candidates before they enter the polling booth. Those who can't be bothered to educate themselves jeopardize democracy with
their ignorance. All of us would be better off if the ill-informed stayed home on Election Day.

<h2>Belgian outrage, our silence</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - What would happen in this country if the next
time a child were starved to death or raped or murdered, we decided we weren't ever again going
to allow such a thing to occur without punishing every person who bore some responsibility? 
What if we were to stop working and take to the streets the next time a repeat offender snuffed out
some innocent life? What if hundreds of us were to descend on our local police stations, thousands
of us were to surround our courthouses, hundreds of thousands of us to march to our state capitols
demanding justice? It's hard to imagine, I know. But no harder than envisioning what's happened in
Belgium the past two weeks. 
<P>
In a population less than 5% our own, hundreds of thousands have
filled the streets of cities throughout the country to protest the handling of an investigation
into a child pornography ring that kidnapped, tortured and murdered young Belgian girls. 
In Liege, local firefighters turned their hoses on the courthouse when the Belgian Supreme Court removed the chief investigative magistrate in the case because he attended a dinner for the victims' families. 
Unions staged wildcat strikes throughout the tiny nation. Students occupied the Palace of Justice in Brussels, unfurling signs reading &quot;Justice for Sale.&quot; Even 2,000 rough-looking bikers blocked traffic with their motorcycles, demanding a reinstatement of the death penalty.  And this weekend, 300,000 Belgians gathered in peaceful protest of a justice system gone terribly wrong.  
<p>
What happened in Belgium to spark this massive civil disobedience was the murder of four young girls, two of whom were barely 8 years old, and the disappearance of at least seven more children. 
The man charged with the murders, Marc Dutroux, is a convicted child rapist who served only half
his previous 13-year sentence. He was let go in 1992 when prison social workers and psychiatrists
determined he was no longer a danger. Within one year, little girls started disappearing. Even Dutroux's own mother twice tried to turn him into the police, but he was not arrested until August when police rescued two young women who were being held in his cellar. Now, a dozen others have been arrested for their involvement in the child pornography ring, suspected of videotaping the girls' sexual abuse and torture. 
<p>
These revelations have been enough to bring Belgium to a standstill.
But can we Americans imagine any crime so heinous that we would respond similarly, with genuine
moral indignation at the failure of the U.S. justice system to punish criminals and protect the innocent?
Each year it seems some sadistic lunatic out on parole slaughters a child somewhere in
the United States. 
<p>
The list of recent atrocities is long; still, a few stand out: Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
kidnapped, raped and murdered by an already convicted rapist. A 6-year-old boy in Washington
state kidnapped, sodomized and sexually mutilated by another demon let loose days earlier. Seven-year-old
Megan Kanka murdered by a convicted child molester who lived on her street. 
<p>
We have become inured to the kinds of horrors that have rallied
the Belgians. But who is to say whether we might put an end to such outrages here if we were to
follow the Belgians' example? Belgium's King Albert II said in a rare public speech last week
that the tragedy of the young girls' murders &quot;must become an occasion for moral renewal and for
profound change in the country.&quot; If only we would do the same. Yet we sit passively by as each new abomination unfolds. In New York, one child is starved, another beaten to death - both by their own mothers' hands. Social workers, obliged to visit these welfare mothers once a year, had failed in their duty, and twice
in barely one year babies died. Still others are murdered by their mothers' boyfriends, sometimes after years of sexual and physical abuse. 
<p>
The best we can muster by way of national examination is a Nightline episode. Most of the
time it's just an afternoon talk show.  
<p>
If tiny Belgium can turn out 300,000 people to mourn the deaths
of a dozen innocent children, why aren't there an equivalent 6 million Americans who would do the
same for the hundreds of children who die in similar circumstances here?

   BETHESDA, Md. -- A year ago, it looked like affirmative action
would be the hot topic of the '96 campaign. Today the issue has
disappeared from the radar screen, except in California where
voters will decide whether to ban state-sponsored preferences
in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 209. The pro-quota
side is nervous enough about the outcome to be running one of
the most dishonest campaigns in recent history, employing a bag
of dirty tricks more suited to an old Soviet KGB disinformation
operation than a democratic election.

<p>
In the most recent outrage, the anti-209 forces invited Klansman
David Duke to argue for the measure in a public debate today at
California State University in Northridge. The organizers said
they couldn't find anyone else to take the pro-209 position. The
real story is that once organizers had secured Duke's participation,
no reputable person would appear with him.
<p>
   Inviting Duke was a clever ploy meant to intimidate Proposition
209 supporters. Debate organizers want voters to believe anyone
who opposes race-based preferences must be a KKK sympathizer.
That's a lie, and they know it.
<p>
   But lies appear to be the stock in trade of the anti-209 campaign.
On Friday someone sent a fake "letter of appreciation" supposedly
from Duke to Ward Connerly, a businessman who chairs the group
that put Proposition 209 on the ballot. The letter thanks Connerly
for his "financial contribution" to Duke's losing Senate race
(he came in fifth in Saturday's primary in Louisiana). No doubt
the creeps who forged the phony Duke letter thought it was particularly
clever to send it to Connerly, who is black. Of course Connerly,
who abhors everything Duke stands for, has never made any political
contribution to Duke. In fact, the real money going to Duke comes
from Cal State Northridge, which is paying him $ 4,000 to participate
in today's debate.
<p>
   Another highlight of the anti-209 campaign is a graphic appearing
in fliers and some publications showing a burning cross with the
caption "Unidentified CCRI supporters celebrate the recent advances
in their struggle for civil rights."
<p>
   Why are the anti-209 groups using such dirty tactics? Because
they are desperate to deflect attention from the real issue of
preferences, which are overwhelmingly unpopular. Most polls show
more than two-thirds of Americans oppose racial quotas, set-asides
and preferences. Even with the nasty and well-funded campaign
against Proposition 209, the measure still holds a 17-point lead
among likely California voters.
<P>
   It's no wonder Proposition 209 remains popular. The measure bans
both discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex
or national origin in state employment, education and contracting.
What could be more fair?
<p>
It's too bad Republicans abandoned efforts to make race and gender
preferences a campaign issue nationwide. Barely more than a year
ago, Bob Dole was leading the fight to ban preferences in federal
programs, and even President Clinton was promising to "mend"
affirmative action. But Republicans got cold feet and have since
dropped their legislative efforts to ban preferences. And Clinton
has actually extended affirmative action programs, not "mended"
them as he pledged.
<P>
But perhaps politicians' reticence to take on preferences is understandable, 
given the tenor of the debate in California.
<p>
It's more difficult to intimidate millions of voters, however.
I'm betting that when Californians go to the polls Nov. 5, they
will remember the David Duke incident. We'll see then why such
chicanery rarely pays off in an election.<P><P>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - The Spanish have a phrase for it: sin verguenza. It means without shame, and
it's no compliment. It could become the motto of our age, exemplified most recently by Dick Morris,
the president's strategist who resigned after a tabloid published pictures of him at a hotel with a
prostitute. <P>

Instead of retreating from the media spotlight when his antics with a $200-an-hour call girl became
public, Morris is actually looking for new ways to expose himself. And he's snared a breathless
media eager to help. Time magazine has already turned over its cover (for the second week in a
row) to a shameless Morris, pictured with his betrayed wife hovering grim-faced behind him. Inside,
Morris exploits the opportunity to take credit for Bill Clinton's political comeback. And Random
House has given Morris a $2.5 million book deal for more of the same. 
<P>
Expect no apology from Dick Morris. But then, why should he bother? Not even his wife seems to
expect one. After the story broke, the president called Morris to commiserate with his friend and
image maker, as did Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. A little moral outrage would have been more
appropriate - if not for Morris' indecent conduct, then for jeopardizing the Clinton campaign by
entertaining a prostitute in a hotel room paid for by campaign funds. 
<P>
But moral outrage is unfashionable today, reserved only for those who commit the last universally
recognized sin in our culture: hypocrisy. And Morris is no hypocrite, which requires at least a
semblance of adherence to some moral or ethical code. The lesson is you can get away with
anything, becoming richer and more famous in the process, so long as you are completely amoral to
begin with. 
<P>
It wasn't always so. There was a time when anyone in Morris' position would have been deeply
mortified at being caught in such a sordid liaison. And even if the miscreant felt no inward remorse,
he would still have been shunned by his peers. 
<P>
No such punishment awaits Morris, whose hubris reflects more than his own arrogance. As a
society, we've become inured to shame. Nothing shocks us. Millions tune in to an endless parade of
vice and weirdness on daytime television. The more salacious the details, the greater the celebrity.
We glorify violence in music and films. We idolize foul-mouthed entertainers and transvestite sports
figures. We re-elect public officials caught smoking crack cocaine and seducing boys. 
<P>
Is it any wonder so many social institutions are disintegrating and our streets are unsafe? Without a
sense of what is shameful in our own lives and others', we deny ourselves the capacity to make
social judgments. Deviancy has no meaning unless we can measure behavior against some common
standard. 
<P>
A few years ago, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote a brilliant essay in The Public
Interest which described the social deterioration occurring, from rising out-of-wedlock births to
skyrocketing crime. Much of the problem stemmed, he said, from a phenomenon he dubbed
"defining deviancy down." In other words, so lowering our standards about what is proper that what
once would have been considered deviant behavior has become merely individual choice. 
<P>
In fact, the situation is worse than Moynihan described. We've not only done away with concepts of
right and wrong, but we've also begun to heap huge rewards on those whose actions would once
have made them pariahs. Why should Dick Morris be ashamed of himself when so many of us are
eager to shower him with fame and fortune?<P><P>

<title>Linda Chavez: Promises Don't Help Kids Read -- September 5, 1996</title>

<h2>Promises Don't Help Kids Read</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Four years ago when running for president the first 
time, Bill Clinton promised to overhaul the nation's education system 
from kindergarten through 12th grade in his campaign manifesto, 
Putting People First. Given his disastrous attempt at overhauling the 
country's health-care system, perhaps we can be thankful he didn't 
manage to come up with an education plan once he assumed office. But 
it's re-election time, and once again candidate Clinton is an 
education reformer. <p>

Last week, the president promised an assault on illiteracy, pledging 
$1.75 billion for new programs to ensure that every American child can 
read by third grade. Sounds great, but aren't public schools supposed 
to teach kids to read already? The United States spends more on public 
education than almost any other nation - more than $240 billion a year 
for elementary and secondary schools in 1994. That's $5,300 per 
student. If schools have failed to teach kids how to read by third 
grade, how will adding less than 1% more money solve the problem? <p>

By the president's own admission, 40% of fourth-grade students fail to 
meet basic reading standards. And money isn't the problem. In 1980, 
the U.S. was spending less than $3,900 per student. Yet the reading 
proficiency of average 9-year-olds was actually higher than it is now, 
according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. <p>

What happened? Bob Dole blames the teachers unions, and they certainly 
share a good deal of blame. The 2.2 million-member National Education 
Association has supported every education fad that has come down the 
pike, so long as it was sufficiently multicultural and politically 
correct. The much smaller American Federation of Teachers, with only 
about 900,000 members, has a far better record on education issues, 
and its president, Albert Shanker, has been a thoughtful exponent of 
education reform. <p>

Nonetheless, both the NEA and the AFT have become well-financed 
political lobbies for liberal causes. The NEA alone raised $6.5 
million in 1992 and spent $2.3 million on congressional candidates, 
almost all Democrats. The only thing that really matters to the 
teachers unions is whether candidates support increased spending on 
education. <p>

Much of that money doesn't even go to teachers' salaries, much less 
directly into the classroom. American public education has become a 
giant, bloated bureaucracy, with school systems top-heavy with 
administrative staff who never set foot in a classroom. <p>

By contrast, Catholic schools, which educate 2.6 million students a 
year, produce better results with a fraction of the money. Catholic 
schools spend about $2,800 per pupil, around half what public schools 
do, but Catholic students outperform their public school peers, 
especially in comparisons between poor minority students from both 
groups. <p>

If Clinton were really interested in improving reading levels of 
America's poor children, he'd give them the same opportunity he gives 
his own: the chance to go to the school of her choice, in Chelsea's 
case the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. The 
Clintons can afford Sidwell Friends' pricey tuition, but most middle-
class, much less poor, parents can't pay private-school tuition and 
pay taxes for public school, too. <p>

During the last election, Peter Brimelow reported in Forbes, candidate 
Clinton told the NEA, "If I become president, you'll be my partners. I 
won't forget who brought me to the White House." That's one promise 
President Clinton has kept, but it won't help kids learn how to read. <p>

<h2>Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces</h2>

BETHESDA, Md. - The Democrats are using the "e-word" a lot this week, 
trying to paint Bob Dole and the Republican Congress as extremists. 
But a close look at the Democrats' platform and the delegates 
themselves suggests it's the Democratic Party that represents some 
political extremes. From a balanced-budget amendment to welfare 
reform, the Democrats in Chicago are out of step with the American 
public. <p>

According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, 82% of registered voters 
favor a balanced-budget amendment, but only 32% of Democratic 
delegates agree. Perhaps that's why the Democratic platform is silent 
on the issue. After all, it might be embarrassing to mention a measure 
that 162 Democrats in Congress voted against in 1995, dooming the 
amendment in the 104th Congress. <p>

The survey also showed that 82% of Democratic delegates favor 
affirmative action programs that give preferences to minorities and 
women. But most other Americans oppose race or gender preferences. The 
Washington Post/ABC poll showed registered voters as a whole oppose 
race and gender preferences by a margin of 52% to 45%, but polls of 
the general public show even greater opposition. A 1995 poll by the 
Los Angeles Times showed 73% of Americans favor legislation to outlaw 
preferential hiring by race or sex. <p>

But it's not surprising the Democratic delegates favor preferences and 
quotas, since they were chosen under party rules that set strict 
racial and gender quotas. Each state delegation must reflect the 
racial and ethnic breakdown of Democratic voters in the last election 
and include equal numbers of men and women. <p>

President Clinton just signed the Republican welfare-reform bill last 
week, but his own delegates don't think much of "ending welfare as we 
know it." The Washington Post/ABC poll shows only 38% of delegates 
support a five-year limit on welfare benefits, something 73% of all 
registered voters favor. The Democratic platform doesn't mention 
specific time limits, except to say who should be exempted from them. <p>

Speaking of exemptions, apparently the Clinton administration has a 
lot of welfare-reform exemptions up its sleeve if Clinton is re-
elected. Vice President Gore suggested Sunday on This Week with David 
Brinkley that the president doesn't really intend to implement the 
bill he just signed. Gore said the president will use whatever means 
available - including the line-item veto - to excise parts of the 
welfare-reform bill he doesn't like. So much for democratic process. <p>

Even on abortion, an issue that seems to plague Republicans every four 
years, the Democrats are hardly in the mainstream of public opinion - 
though you won't hear the media talk much about it this week. Democrat 
delegates are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and the party platform spells 
out an unrestricted "right of every woman to choose, consistent with 
Roe vs. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay." <p>

But Americans favor a much more limited right to choose abortion than 
the Democrats' position. Most Americans favor some legal restrictions 
on abortion: 74% favor mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, and 74% 
support parental consent and 70% spousal notification laws. Although 
the president recently vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions 
except to save a mother's life, 71% of Americans oppose the procedure, 
which involves partially delivering a 20- to 26-week fetus feet first 
and inserting a surgical scissors into the skull to remove the brain. 
One of the most comprehensive surveys of American opinion on abortion 
and moral beliefs, done by the Gallup organization in 1991, showed 
that 73% of Americans support a prohibition of abortion after the 
first three months of pregnancy for any reason except to save the life 
of the mother. And more than 80% oppose government funding of 
abortion. <p>

The Democrats will continue to try to paint themselves as moderates 
and the Republicans as extremists through the election. They think if 
they say it often enough, maybe the country will believe them. I'm 
betting Americans are a lot smarter than that.<p>

<h2>Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>


BETHESDA, Md. - Despite his quirkiness, Ross Perot has done some 
pretty impressive things in his lifetime, not the least winning nearly 
20 million votes in the 1992 presidential election. But if he persists 
in his quixotic quest for the White House this year, he may well be 
remembered only as the man responsible for twice electing Bill Clinton 
president. <p>

Polls suggest Perot won't garner nearly as many votes this time 
around. But if Perot pulls even 2% or 3% of the vote, his role could 
be decisive in a close election, as this one promises to be. White 
House aides claim they believe Perot hurts President Clinton as much 
as he does Bob Dole. (And if you believe that one, they have some land 
parcels on the Whitewater River they'd like to sell you.) <p>

In fact, Perot draws his support mostly from independent and 
Republican voters. In 1992, Perot won only 13% of Democrats' votes but 
30% of independents' and 17% of Republicans' votes. And 20% of his 
1992 voters had voted for George Bush in 1988. Maybe it's time Ross 
Perot - and his remaining supporters - rethink what they want to 
accomplish in 1996. <p>

Here are a few questions they should ask themselves. <p>

Do you really want to balance the budget? Republicans have already 
proved they can balance the budget - they passed a five-year balanced 
budget last December. But President Clinton vetoed it. And Clinton 
still can't decide when he'll produce a balanced budget. One day it's 
nine years, another day it's seven, and still another he says maybe he 
can do it in five. <p>

Do you believe the country needs to rein in entitlements? The 
Republicans offered genuine entitlement reform last year, but the 
Democrats did their best to nix it. First, Democrats - including the 
president - demagogued Medicare reform, needlessly and recklessly 
trying to scare the elderly. Then the president twice vetoed welfare 
reform despite having promised "to end welfare as we know it." The 
president is expected to sign a Republican-passed welfare-reform bill 
this week, but only because he knows he can't possibly be re-elected 
if he doesn't. <p>

lDo you still care about reforming government? Republicans in the 
104th Congress passed the most sweeping government-reform legislation 
since the civil service reforms 100 years ago. For the first time, 
laws that apply to ordinary citizens and employers now apply to 
members of Congress. The Democrats controlled Congress for more than 
40 years, exempting themselves from all the employment laws they were 
happy to inflict on others. The Republicans quickly ended that 
practice once they gained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. <p>

Which is the real reform party in America? The Democrats have said 
"no" to Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, lawsuit 
reform, and term limits. Meanwhile, the Reform Party can't even get 
its own members to participate in choosing the party's presidential 
nominee. Fewer than 5% cast ballots either in the nominating process 
or in selecting the candidate. Perhaps the Reform Party ought to get 
its own house in order before it tries tackling the whole government. <p>

That leaves one party and one presidential nominee for reform-minded 
voters: Republican Bob Dole. If Ross Perot and his supporters truly 
want change this year, they'll stop playing spoilers. Last time 
around, Perot spent $60 million on his campaign. This time he's not 
even willing to risk his own money, asking his supporters to pony up 
so he can receive $30 million in federal campaign funds instead. <p>

Re-electing Bill Clinton won't change politics as usual, won't end 
gridlock, won't make government work more efficiently - all reasons 
Perot says he's running. But the numbers just aren't there. Perot 
can't win, and surely even he knows it this time. It's hard to believe 
Perot wants his legacy to be a second term for Bill Clinton. But if he 
insists on staying in the race until November, he may succeed in 
ensuring just that.<p>

<title>Chavez: GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"  -- 8/14/96 </title>

<h2>
GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
SAN DIEGO - Here's a political quiz: Which political party has 
suffered from a "gender gap" in voting during the last several 
presidential elections? If you answered "the Republicans," you get an 
"A" for reading the newspapers and watching the evening news -- but 
you flunk the test.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, in three out of the last four elections, it has been the 
Democrats who have actually been hurt by the gender gap. Democrats 
lost those elections because they did so poorly among male voters. In 
1984, Democrat Walter Mondale trailed Republican President Ronald 
Reagan by 25 points among men. And in 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis 
got 16% fewer male votes than Republican George Bush. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Their losses had little to do with female voters. But the media have 
been relatively uninterested over the years in why men are less likely 
to vote Democratic, while they've been obsessed with the supposed GOP 
gender gap among women.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year is no different. Expect to read countless stories and hear 
endless explanations this election season why Bob Dole can't win 
women's votes. And most of it will be hogwash -- or wishful thinking 
on the part of reporters and pundits, most of whom w ill probably be 
voting Democratic themselves in November. (In 1992, 89% of Washington-
based reporters and editors voted for Bill Clinton, according to a 
poll by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank.)
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the favorite explanations of why women won't vote Republican 
this year is the party's position on abortion. The Republican Party's 
strong anti-abortion stance is supposed to be a huge barrier to 
winning women's votes. But, in fact, polls show that  abortion has 
little to do with how women cast their votes.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll showed only 1 in 5 female voters 
say the candidate they support must share exactly their own position 
on abortion. And of these women, slightly more than half are actually 
pro-life, so at best it's a wash. Abortion ranke d 10th out of the top 
12 most important issues to women in this poll, and about one-third 
said abortion was not at all important in determining how they would 
vote.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like men, women care most about the economy when it comes time to pick 
a president. Which is good news for Bob Dole. He has certainly shown 
this past week that he intends to make the economy his No. 1 issue -- 
first with his tax-cut proposal and then with  his selection of Jack 
Kemp to be his running mate.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both actions should have real appeal for female voters. Kemp's brand 
of compassionate conservatism and his exuberant political style will 
resonate with women who may be turned off by doom-and-gloom talk of 
budget deficits and harsh rhetoric about slashing government spending.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most importantly, Dole's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, 
coupled with an extra $500 tax deduction for each child under 18, will 
mean real savings to families. Many middle-income voters with young 
children would see their federal income-tax bill red uced by half if 
Dole has his way. Most opinion polls show that working mothers would 
prefer to work fewer hours outside the home. Allowing families to keep 
more of their earnings could give many mothers the option to work less 
or to use their tax savings  to buy a home, put toward their 
children's college education, or save for their own retirement. Dole 
is proposing real choice for women -- the choice to determine their 
own economic futures. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the Democrats who want to limit women's choices. The Democrats 
would rather let government decide how to spend working women's money 
than allow women to choose how to spend it themselves.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time Americans got a tax break -- when President Reagan twice 
reduced tax rates, in 1981 and 1986 -- the economy boomed. Growth 
averaged about 4% a year during Reagan's tenure, resulting in the 
longest period of economic expansion since World War  II. What's more, 
women's earnings grew faster during the 1980s than at any time in 
recent history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't expect the media to remind voters of these economic facts 
between now and Election Day. They'll be too busy reporting the so-
called GOP gender gap.

<h2>
We're Becoming A Nation Of Crybabies
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- Working for the federal government, which has never 
been a barrel of laughs, is about to get even less humorous. Last 
month, a Social Security Administration official told a sexist joke at 
an agency conference, and now charges are flying that the agency is 
riddled with sex discrimination. The only twist in this increasingly 
familiar charge is that the joke-teller was a woman and the butt of 
the joke was men. Now several men at the agency are claiming that a 
"hostile work environment" exists -- code words for sexual harassment 
-- which could signal discrimination complaints, lawsuits and wasted 
taxpayer dollars ahead.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many charges involving sexual harassment, the facts of this 
case aren't in dispute. Ruth Pierce, deputy commissioner for human 
resources and director of equal employment opportunity at the Social 
Security Administration, told the joke to participants in a diversity 
workshop in Miami.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to The Washington Post, which reported the story on its 
front page, the joke involved a mermaid and a fisherman whose wish was 
to become five times smarter. The mermaid granted the fisherman's wish 
by turning him into a woman. Not exactly a knee slapper as jokes go, 
but it elicited enough laughs from the mostly female listeners to send 
audience member John Boyer into quite a snit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer heads an informal group called Government Men for Equality Now 
(GMEN) and alleges the Social Security Administration is dominated by 
women and rife with anti-male prejudice. Now he's hoping to turn 
Pierce's joke into a federal case, demanding that Pierce apologize to 
all 65,000 agency employees and be demoted from her current post.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer's complaint itself might be laughable if the federal government 
weren't such a bastion of the double standard. If Pierce were a man 
telling a predominantly male audience a joke poking fun at women's 
intelligence, the government's political-correctness squad would 
already be on the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar circumstances at a Coast Guard dinner in 1995 led not only to 
months of investigation, but also to enormous human suffering. Capt. 
Ernie Blanchard, a career veteran of the Coast Guard with an 
impeccable record, told a few barely off-color jokes at a dinner 
honoring cadets and became the focus of an official investigation that 
ultimately resulted in an 800-page report. Informed that his career 
was in jeopardy and that he might lose his pension, spelling financial 
ruin for his family, Blanchard killed himself before the investigation 
was complete.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the Coast Guard incident had not ended so tragically with 
Blanchard's death, it would still be a travesty. No government career 
should be extinguished for a one-time lapse in taste before an adult 
audience.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But ever since the courts started interpreting a "hostile work 
environment" to constitute sexual harassment, bad taste has become a 
federal offense. With men so often the targets of such witch hunts, 
it's no surprise a few, like John Boyer, strike back.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the answer to this nonsense is not for more men to claim that 
they, too, are victims of sexual harassment because someone tells a 
meaningless joke. We are becoming a nation of crybabies who can 
respond to others' ridiculous behavior only by engaging in more of the 
same.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the last year for which figures are available, federal 
workers filed nearly 12,000 harassment complaints -- more than in any 
other single category of alleged discrimination.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With warm-up jokes and after-dinner entertainment now fair game for 
such charges, that number will no doubt climb. American taxpayers, who 
foot the bill for such silliness, surely aren't laughing.

SAPELLO, N.M. -- The night is cool atop Star Hill, east of the Sangre 
de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. Nearby a herd of longhorn 
cattle and a few scattered buffalo have settled in for the night. 
Earlier in the day, I observed a coyote stalking the cattle from the 
crest of a hill, and a Swainson's hawk perched on the barbed-wire 
fence.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the thrill of seeing these creatures will soon pale as Phil Mahon, 
our host at Star Hill resort, introduces my husband and me to his 
celestial delights.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until now, neither of us has anything but a passing interest in 
astronomy. As lifelong city residents, we rarely enjoy star-studded 
nights apart from an occasional country get-away where we can escape 
both the city lights that obscure the stars from view and the 
preoccupations that cause us not to look. Now, on an impulse we're 
here at this amateur astronomers' retreat, hoping to expand our 
horizons.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mahon, a somewhat taciturn guide, types instructions into a laptop 
computer attached to a 14-inch Compustar telescope, and the machine 
whirs into action, rotating on its pedestal until it comes to rest 
pointed at the Southern sky. Through the lens we see not only Jupiter 
and its red bands, but also four of its 16 moons. For the next hour, 
Mahon treats us to stars, pulsars, nebulae and galaxies, objects as 
close as 21/2 or as distant as 150 million light years away.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly all of the dozen sites we view have been familiar territory to 
astronomers for more than 200 years, since the French astronomer 
Charles Messier (1730-1817) first cataloged 68 celestial objects, 
including our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. Still, the experience is 
awe-inspiring, putting daily obsessions into perspective. For a while 
at least, public policy, the culture wars, the federal deficit and 
politics fade.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not for long. As I look through the telescope, I wonder whether as 
a nation we will continue to explore this vast universe. Even as our 
knowledge increases at almost exponential rates, it seems our national 
desire and will to learn more are on the wane. NASA's budget is $ 14 
billion this year but will drop to a projected $ 11 billion by 2000.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1990s have seen dramatic swings in our space commitments. The 
decade was ushered in with great fanfare in 1991 with the announcement 
of Project Columbus, a $ 100 million joint venture between NASA and a 
private astronomy institute to search for intelligent life in the 
universe. One year later, the Senate canceled funding with derisive 
comments about little green men.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or 
SETI as it is known, has been fickle throughout the history of the 
program. Since 1960, SETI has involved some 50 separate programs, 
initially with federal backing but more recently privately funded.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year, interest is up again with the discovery in January by 
astronomers Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the first two planets 
outside our solar system. Announced earlier this year, NASA's new 
Origins project will build powerful new telescopes over the next 30 
years capable of actually seeing planets such as those discovered by 
Butler and Marcy. They could only infer the planets' existence from 
complex measurements of light emissions of the stars 47 Ursae and 70 
Virginis, around which the planets orbit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least that's NASA's hope, if the project receives full federal 
backing. It's a big if. With so many earthly demands on the federal 
budget, the exploration of our universe sometimes seems a luxury we 
can't afford.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This starry night, from my vantage point in New Mexico's hills, the 
investment is worth it.

<h2>
New Citizens Getting Off Too Easily
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- This July Fourth, 1.2 million more new citizens will 
be celebrating Independence Day than last year. Naturalization was way 
up in 1995, more than double the 1994 rate and five times the rate 
experienced throughout the 1980s.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As an unabashed admirer of immigrants' initiative and grit, I'd 
normally welcome this surge in new citizenship. But unfortunately, 
politics -- not patriotism -- may explain this sudden spurt in 
naturalization. The Clinton administration has been quietly moving to 
water down citizenship requirements in ways that could ultimately 
damage the Americanization process.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many nations that jealously guard access to citizenship, the 
United States makes it relatively easy. Permanent residents must wait 
five years before they apply for naturalization. By law, they must 
demonstrate they can speak, read and write simple words and phrases in 
English and that they know basics about American history and 
government. They must also be law-abiding and of good character.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the modest commitments are hardly onerous, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is considering exempting whole classes of 
immigrants from them. Among the proposals the INS is reportedly 
weighing is one to exempt immigrants who've completed high school in 
the U.S. from being tested on American history and government or from 
having to demonstrate knowledge of English.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, a high school degree today is no guarantee that a 
student knows much U.S. history or government. It isn't even an 
assurance that a student knows English. Foreign-born high school 
students in New York, for example, can take state graduation exams in 
their native language if they entered American public school after 
eighth grade. And many public school systems across the country seem 
more concerned about preserving immigrants' native language and 
culture than about helping them learn English or American history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's behind the administration's efforts to weaken naturalization 
requirements? Some critics suspect politics. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., 
has pointedly asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner whether the 
administration is trying to increase the number of potential 
Democratic voters before the November presidential election.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But partisan politics isn't the most serious concern. The real threat 
is weakening national identity. As John J. Miller points out in a 
recent article in Policy Review, "Naturalization is the only legal 
instrument that allows the United States -- a 'nation of immigrants' -
- to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the 
cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers understood the potential for mischief if 
citizenship were obtained too easily, Miller notes. Alexander Hamilton 
urged that immigrants be drawn gradually into American civil society 
"to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American 
attachments." Indeed, the oath of citizenship pledges the naturalized 
citizen to "renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any 
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and to "support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws o
f the United States of America."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Miller suggests what's needed now is a modern-day Americanization 
Movement. During the last great wave of immigration, from 1900 to 
1924, both public schools and private philanthropic organizations, 
such as Jane Addams' famous settlement houses, helped acculturate 
millions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This commitment is sorely lacking today. Immigrant advocacy groups 
focus almost exclusively on immigrant rights, with little attention to 
immigrant responsibilities. If America is to continue to be an 
immigrant nation, there must be a covenant between America and its 
newcomers. Learning the national language and the nation's history and 
form of government are the least we should require from those who wish 
to become Americans.

FBI Files: Look What I Found in Mine

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Wonder what all the fuss over the Clinton White House 
requisitioning FBI files on former Republican officials is about? As 
someone who has seen my own FBI file, I can tell you there's plenty of 
cause for alarm. FBI files contain not only private and sometimes 
embarrassing information, but also some things that are downright 
false.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1983, President Reagan appointed me staff director of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, a post that required what's called a full-
field investigation in preparation for Senate confirmation. The 
investigation took many weeks to complete and included interviews with 
my employers, colleagues, friends, neighbors, schoolmates and 
virtually anyone else who might have known me over the years. Most of 
the information the FBI obtained was innocuous and accurate. But not 
everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Years later, when I obtained my file through a Freedom of Information 
request, I was surprised to learn the document contained not only an 
occasional unflattering description but also outright misinformation 
about me and my family. In one case, a former neighbor said she 
couldn't say whether I might be a national security risk, an answer 
bound to provoke greater scrutiny. The FBI had no way of knowing I had 
reported this woman for leaving her young child locked out of the 
house alone and unfed until 1 a.m., which no doubt accounted for her 
opinion of my trustworthiness.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another interview, a former supervisor claimed to have fired me 
from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) job I held in my early 20s. 
Being fired from the DNC could be considered a badge of honor for a 
Republican nominee, but the charge was untrue. My supervisor, a 
political rival, may have wanted to fire me, but she actually left her 
job slightly before I quit mine.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most outrageous material in my file, however, had nothing to do 
with me.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the name itself was blacked out to protect the person's 
identity, one series of entries contained information that appeared 
from their context to be about my father. I nearly fainted when I read 
the entry, which referred to an arrest for a violent crime. Then I 
noticed the date of arrest was after my father's death, and shock 
turned into anger. Derogatory information about someone who happened 
to share my father's name found its way into my FBI file, violating 
that person's privacy and besmirching my father's reputation.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As far as I know, my file was not among those the Clinton White House 
requested. Nonetheless, I'm outraged to learn that friends, colleagues 
and at least one person who worked for me in the Reagan White House 
are among those whose files were obtained.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton operatives -- no one yet knows exactly how many - procured and 
read at least 408 Republican appointees' files. How many of these 
files had egregious errors in them? How many more had malicious 
gossip? How many simply contained embarrassing private
 information that should remain secret? And what did these Clinton 
appointees do with that information?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton has dismissed this incredible invasion of privacy as 
a "bureaucratic snafu" and has declined to punish the known 
perpetrators. Craig Livingstone, the former director of White House 
security under whose direction the FBI files were obtained, remains on 
the White House payroll. Anthony Marceca, whom Livingstone recruited 
to read the files, is on paid leave from the Pentagon. Marceca may be 
protected from immediate firing by civil service laws -- but 
Livingstone, a presidential appointee, is not. Even Democrats have 
asked Clinton to fire Livingstone, but the president refuses.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such total arrogance of power should give Americans pause.
<BR>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Want proof we've abandoned all pretense of a civil 
society? Forget name-calling politicians and rancorous talk radio -- 
take a look inside sports arenas and in the city streets after 
championship games. It's not just boorish megalomaniacs like Bulls 
forward Dennis Rodman turning games into a Roman spectacle. Some fans 
are worse. Chicago police and the National Guard are bracing for 
widespread lawlessness during the Bulls' victory celebration.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And the crowd can be a real factor in the final score. Bulls star 
Michael Jordan acknowledged as much. "We wanted to come out and take 
their crowd out of the game," Jordan told reporters, describing his 
team's aggressive start in Sunday night's game with the Seattle 
Supersonics. By racking up a big lead early, the Bulls hoped to 
depress the Seattle fans' notorious fervor.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not content to cheer their team to victory, fans everywhere shout 
insults, throw things and do their best to distract opposing players. 
During the Sonics' own victory game over the Utah Jazz for the Western 
Conference Finals, Seattle spectators showed just how nasty they could 
be. With seconds left and the Jazz down by three points, power forward 
Karl Malone endured a deafening countdown before he took his foul 
shots. Between the verbal taunts and the sea of undulating white 
balloons, Malone -- who makes 70% of his free throws -- missed both, 
ending any chance for a Jazz win.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those annoying white balloons wielded by fans are deployed to throw 
off a player's aim in the free throw. The balloons wiggle like maggots 
behind the basket. But some fans have gotten even more creative. 
Boosters at Florida Panther hockey games throw rubber rats on the ice 
after their team scores a goal. Detroit Red Wings fans throw 
octopuses. The ice is beginning to look like a bouillabaisse of 
rubbery critters.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the action is more than offensive -- it's downright 
dangerous. Last year, fans pelted the field at Dodger Stadium with so 
many baseballs that the game had to be halted, and the Dodgers 
forfeited a game they were winning.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was a time when sportsmanship was synonymous with gentlemanly 
behavior. Being called "unsportsmanlike" used to be a real insult, and 
unsportsmanlike conduct actually carried penalties on the field and 
off.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
My most vivid memory of a high school game is not of some last-second 
victory but of Sister Jean Patrice, my high school principal, down on 
the basketball court scolding those of us in the stands for booing our 
opponents. "Another outburst like that and we'll forfeit the game," 
she warned -- no idle threat. She was an enthusiastic team supporter 
and a tough competitor, but she believed winning wasn't everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In today's billion-dollar sports business, winning is the only thing. 
If players act like freaks or worse on the court or off, no one seems 
to care. Least of all those in the stands whose own behavior emulates 
their idols'. Fans are supposed to boost the morale of the players, 
not become sideline guerrillas.

<h2> 
Get Political, GOP
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Democratic threats have thrown Republicans into a panic. A
plan to add an amendment increasing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15, has now derailed a second major bill in the Senate. Fifteen
moderate Republicans promptly followed and introduced their own
even higher minimum wage increase bill in the House, leading the
GOP leadership to predict 40 eventual disaffections from their
ranks and passage of a minimum wage bill this year. So far have
things deteriorated in the bastion of the 1994 revolution that the
House will pass a New Deal law that Bill Clinton was afraid even to
introduce before the Republican took control of Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Happened? A cynic might note that the news of the AFL-CIO
ad campaign supporting a minimum wage increase broke just before
the Democrats hit the floor of the Senate with their plan. The fact
that big labor was willing to spend $35 million above its normal
$42 million to target vulnerable Republicans got the attention of
Republicans in districts with high union membership and among the
vulnerable, especially the freshmen. This is about politics, not
economics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, every economist knows that minimum wage laws cost
jobs. It is not necessary to repeat the facts because they are not
at issue. As reported here by Bruce Bartlett, as recently as
January 14, 1987, the New York Times ran an editorial headed, "The
Right Minimum Wage: $0.00."  Two years later they still were
correctly saying minimum wages help middle income families because
most people who get the increase are second or third income
earners, not the poor, and because employers hire fewer low wage
workers when their wage costs go up. Somehow, in a Democratic
Administration, the Times decided it was fine to increase the
minimum wage; but that does not repeal the law of supply and
demand. Fewer jobs will exist at an artificially higher wage, even
if it is only a small number--and even economists with President
Clinton know it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On "This Week With David Brinkley" columnist George Will asked
Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich why, if an increase in the
minimum to $5.15 was good, why not raise it to $10? Reich admitted
$10 would have a "negative effect" but $5.15 would have only a
"negligible effect on jobs." A "negligible effect" is an effect. It
is critical to note that even the minimum wage's number one
supporter admits a higher minimum wage will cost some people their
jobs. Only he does not care. Too bad for them. It's only
politics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why cannot the Republicans learn to play politics? It has been
the constant, sad refrain of this space for a year of bungled
activity, trying to rule from Congress when the President holds the
veto. It is not too late to begin learning. The Democrats are
clearly playing politics on the minimum wage legislation. The
Republicans should accept the challenge and offer an amendment to
increase the minimum wage to $100 per hour. If increasing rates by
law works, why be pikers? Ten dollars is too little. Increase it to
100 an hour and make everyone rich. Get on record supporting a
minimum higher than the Democrats would approve.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If that is too high, how about $66.66 an hour. That would make
all Americans as rich as Congressmen. But that brings up a sore
subject, so $100 is better. At that rate, all workers would be at
a high enough income to be under President Clinton's surtax. That
is the right message. It would also be possible to balance the
Budget if everyone could earn that rate. Of course, they will not
because supply and demand work. But that is the point the GOP
should want to make. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am serious. All Republicans should vote to support "a real
increase in the minimum wage" and let the President and the
Democrats sort it all out (or clean it up in a conference committee
after the point is made). Politics must be played by two or it just
is not fair, nor even interesting. There is nothing wrong with
playing politics in government, certainly not when the other side
is having all of the fun.

<title>Devine: Real  Campaign Reform -- 5/9/96 - ACU
</title>

<h2> 
Real  Campaign Reform
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Common Cause has spent a quarter-century of campaign reform  
zeal on the passion that money is evil; and the job of reform is to  
chase its specter out of politics. Yet, the fruit of their reform  
fetish has been ever greater dominance of campaigns by  
millionaires, business sharpies and union bosses, and ever less  
public confidence in the political process. Still, their only  
answer is, more laws to wipe out filthy lucre.  
  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Finally, someone is saying stop. Curtis Gans of the Committee  
for the Study of the American Electorate has organized 30  
organizations from across the ideological and political spectrum  
under the "unifying principle" that the "approaches that have been  
pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are wrong." Finally. From  
the American Conservative Union to the National Women's Political  
Caucus, the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Business  
Political Action Committees, the other side is stirring. Although  
ACU and former liberal senator Gene McCarthy did fight the original  
court test, the field has generally been conceded since the "get  
money out" school prevailed in the Supreme Court.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
A Republican Congressional "reformer" welcomed the debate by  
calling the response "a deceitful campaign to protect their raw  
power and personal profit, garnered in a corrupt system of money."  
The unions and business are hardly altruistic but the inclusion of  
think tanks suggests name-calling will not be enough. The counter  
argument begins with the unfortunate fact that everything costs  
money and, without it, there can be no free speech or right to  
association. The only other goo-goo idea is to have the government  
fund the whole process. Yet--partially as a result of reform--the  
people simply do not trust government to do it.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Because the whole idea of reform was to eliminate the  
corrupting effects of filthy lucre, the Supreme Court reasonably  
ruled that one could not corrupt oneself--so it is an  
unconstitutional limit of speech to limit what a candidate can  
spend on his own election. Voila, we have Ross Perot, Steve Forbes,  
the rise of the multi-millionaire Senate, and even the Michael  
Huffingtons buying House seats with their small change in the  
millions. The one certainty in the uncertain future of Common Cause  
political "reform," is more Richy Rich candidates. After the yacht,  
the airplane, the football club and the young spouse, what else is  
there to do?  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
All the $1,000 individual contribution limit has done is  
replace the sometimes-altruistic, big contributor Henry Salvatori's  
and Stuart Mott's with the always-investing sharpies who bundle  
$1,000 contributions into large batches. As the value of a thousand  
declines from inflation, the number of payers needed multiplies.  
Today, the only people who can round-up big sums are those with  
wide contacts among likeminded self-interested fellow seekers of  
influence. All of the onerous reporting only hides who is the real  
influence peddler among the scores and more of thousand dollar  
givers. Meanwhile, the Congressman is constantly on the phone  
"dialing for dollars" to call the larger number of contributors now  
needed, leaving little time for average citizens or simple  
reflection on issues or even reading about issues.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It took great courage for Speaker Newt Gingrich to question  
the central Common Cause assumption by arguing that we do not spend  
enough on politics--we actually spend less debating than on soap  
advertising. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman John Doolittle  
have spoken out too. The fact is, if all money comes from the  
government bureaucrats who run it, the lawyers who write the laws,  
the media who sensationalize it and the sharpies who hustle it, the  
people will be frozen out. Not everyone can participate equally,  
but there must be some citizen participation. In the real world,  
that means relying upon the political parties and citizen groups  
that allow people indirect participation and influence.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
David Broder is correct that the Ralph Nader-Common Cause plan  
to limit so-called soft money for party-building and volunteer  
activities would further erode the role of parties to represent  
citizens and control interests. But Broder does not go far enough.  
If political parties are the only means for effective influence,  
they will multiply. In a free society, groups always multiply.  
Either political action groups will proliferate or parties will. As  
political action committees become more hedged by law, it is no  
coincidence that Ross Perot organizes a third party.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Real reform would: (1) eliminate limits on contributions to  
citizen-ideological political action committees (PACs) and extend  
the third-class mailing rates now granted to political parties to  
them, so they can compete in representing citizens within a two-  
party system; (2) end individual or corporate limits on  
contributions to a political party as a limit upon free speech; (3)  
continue the current $5,000 limit on contributions to candidates by  
corporate or union PACs, so they do not dominate the field; (4)  
void the $25,000 yearly total and $1,000 per candidate contribution  
limit for individuals, to allow a Steve Forbes to contribute to a  
Jack Kemp rather than force the rich to run themselves, placing  
others on a more equal footing with the Richys; (5) continue record  
keeping and reporting requirements but, to save average people from  
paperwork, only require reporting of significant amounts; (6), if  
one cannot corrupt oneself, immediately remove all limits and  
restrictions for contributions by spouses, parents, children, and  
first degree blood relatives and in-laws of candidates; (7) index  
for inflation any dollar limits; and, (9) increase the penalty for  
failing to source any unidentified campaign communication (such as  
in so-called push polls defaming opposing candidates).  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It may be pie-in-the-sky to wish for real reform with  
demagogues like Perot and Nader exploiting public anxiety; but it  
should not be an impossible case to make. If Mr. Perot gets rid of  
all other money, he will be the only person who can compete for  
President.

<h2> 
The Right's Confused But the Left is Dead
</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the media are busting with pleasure that Pat Buchanan is
sundering conservatism, the leading intellectual of the left is
forced to publish a book on progressives titled, "They Only Look
Dead." In fact, he proves they are moribund. Still, a book by the
man who invented the New Democrat and called forth Bill Clinton
obviously is an expert on levitation.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post follows his award-
winning <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> by shedding his earlier cover
of ideological neutrality to brag that he is a progressive
dedicated to its restoration as the ruling philosophy in the United
States. In the earlier volume, Dionne granted that liberalism had
failed and that conservatives were the ones providing answers.
Traditionalists had answers on value questions and libertarians had
them on economic ones. He even recognized the "fusionist" attempt
to harmonize both, although he ultimately said the contradictions
between the two wings would lead to failure. He proposed a vaguely-
defined New Democrat alternative to liberalism that would fill the
void, and Bill Clinton appeared to claim its mantle.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the disappearance of the New Democrat, the world has
changed for Dionne. Now he calls the conservative formula that
places liberty as the highest value in the political sphere and
virtue as the highest in the social realm, "ingenious"--making one
wonder whether he understood conservatism as well as it seemed in
the earlier book. In any case, he ignores it and invents a New
Conservatism this time. Both "new's" are misleading. We now
discover that a New Democrat really is an old progressive, both
from Bill Clinton's performance--with constant cheering from Dionne
in the Post--and from the author's present forthrightness. New
Conservatism is more mischievous. It is a caricature. Since the
thesis of his book is that the new progressivism will arise from
opposition to the New Conservatism, it would seem to follow that
the later cannot rise from what does not exist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given Newt Gingrich's present standing in the polls, it should
not surprise that New Conservatism is identified with him. But this
is not a Gingrichism that the Speaker would recognize. It "harks
back not to Ronald Reagan but to the Gilded Age of the 1890's." It
is created by collecting some ideas Gingrich does have about the
future and the communications revolution and transforming them to
his entire philosophy. New Conservatism simply means "accelerating
the economic transition" and embracing the dog-eats-dog social
Darwinism of William Graham Sumner and the Gilded Age.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not only is this an outrageous simplification but it borders
on the dishonest. This is most easily seen in the author's
treatment of Marvin Olasky. He is pictured both as part of the
"ingenious" (but failed) new fusionism and as part of the Gilded
Age because he says 1890's volunteer charity should be the model
for modern reform. Now reflect on that for a moment. A man who
advocates more reliance upon private charity is deemed a social
Darwinist, a philosophy that disapproves of social work because it
helps the less fit to survive--quite a slight-of-hand!
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne even has the gaul to resurrect old Robert McCloskey's
xenophobic simplification of the period as objective proof. He
admits that Gingrich does "bow" to traditional values, institutions
and to Olasky but shrugs it off. He will not make the obvious
conclusion that Gingrich is following the traditional formula, if
in somewhat idiosyncratic terms. Rather, Dionne needs a strawman to
demonstrate that where there is a Gilded Age, there must follow a
Progressive one. After all, that is how it all progressed once
before. So has historical determinism degenerated for the modern
liberal.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The contortion of progressivism is just as bizarre. After
doting on John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and the rest of
the progressive pantheon, he does admit that "Progressivism's
critics have identified critical flaws in Progressive thought that
have haunted the liberal project through to the Great Society and
the present day," especially the problem that its elitist-experts
manipulate central bureaucracies rather than trust ordinary people.
The solution to Dionne is a more reasonable progressive power that
will be more sensitive to the needs of private organizations. Yet,
of his seventeen proposals, only one is not straight old-time
centralized government bureaucracy. Two of Dionne's major proposals
are a national health system and improved pensions. He ignores that
the existing national health programs of Medicare and Medicaid and
the Social Security pension programs are at the center of the
crisis even he must admit now is facing liberalism. After all,
these were the ultimate progressive creations and now they are in
absolute bankruptcy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne admits that conservatives have been correct to
emphasize private mediating institutions like family, church and
associations as superior to expert bureaucrats for many social
tasks. But he still requires that the experts must direct them.
Besides, he says, they do not operate under the "logic" of the
market. But it is Dionne who identifies the market with social
Darwinism, not understanding that the real logic of both business
and private welfare institutions is freedom to operate without too
many restrictions from experts wielding government power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No, the only way to give the private, voluntary organizations
vitality is to get the centralized bureaucracy's experts off their
backs. Send the programs back to the states and the people, which
is the real new and old conservative program. Dionne cannot
resurrect progressivism on these grounds. He contrasts a strawman
conservatism to what progressivism would be if everything worked
perfectly, as if there were no fruits of its ideals. But the show
is over as the progressive programs fall one-by-one, recognized
bankruptcies one and all. Conservatism may have its Buchanan schism
but, if Dionne is the best and the brightest, progressivism not
"only looks dead;" it is.<p><br><p>

<center><h2>Pete Du Pont</h2></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Pete du Pont has served as a state legislator, U.S. Congressman, Governor, and in l988 was a 
Republican candidate for President of the United States.  He writes a weekly column and is a featured 
columnist for CEO Magazine.  He hosts a weekly television program entitled FocusPoint for National 
Empowerment Television (NET) and various broadcast stations.
<p>
	Pete du Pont chairs the Strategic Advisory Committee, which advises Speaker Newt Gingrich on 
key strategic issues, and was appointed to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, 
known as the Kemp Commission.  du Pont is currently Policy Chairman of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis and Chairman of the National Review Institute, public policy analysis organizations 
promoting free enterprise and conservative governmental policies.   He has served as Chairman of the 
Hudson Institute and was the founder of GOPAC, the Republican political action committee.
<p>
	Pete du Pont began his political career in l968 with his election to the Delaware General 
Assembly.  In l970, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for six years.
<p>
	In l976, Pete du Pont won the race for Delaware Governor against the Democratic incumbent 
and was re-elected in l980 to a second term, winning a record 7l% of the vote.  During his tenure as 
Delaware's Governor, du Pont restored financial integrity to the state government.  Known for his fiscal 
conservatism, he signed into law two income tax reduction measures and a constitutional amendment that 
restrained future tax increases and limited government spending.  He balanced his state budget eight out of 
eight years.
<p>
	Throughout his public policy career, Pete du Pont has addressed a wide range of critical issues 
and has developed a reputation for taking on the toughest challenges and successfully meeting them.  In his 
campaign for the Presidency, his focus upon the central issues facing our country -- drugs, education, 
retirement income, poverty, defense and our relationship with the Soviet Union -- earned him a reputation 
as a man with a long-range vision and the courage to speak the truth about tomorrow.
<p>
	Columnist George Will said about du Pont's l988 campaign:<p>  "du Pont has the highest 
substance-to-blather ratio among candidates, even on subjects as sensitive as agriculture policy and Social 
Security."
<p>
	Upon his withdrawal from the 1988 race, Scripps Howard News Service noted, "More than any 
rival in either party, du Pont had the courage to tell specific interest groups what they least wanted to hear.
<p>
	Rush Limbaugh recently stated Pete du Pont...[is one of the] people who have paved the way 
for me to succeed.<p>

<title>Pete Du Pont--GOP CONVENTION--08/08/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Thursday, August 8, 1996</i><p>


<h2>GOP Convention</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

For the past year, the Republicans have been a fractious lot.  The 
Gingrich conservatives have argued with the liberal Senate 
Republicans.  The presidential primaries were nasty.  Abortion is an 
issue that splits the party into warring factions on a weekly basis.<p>

So it is none too soon that Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has centered his campaign on an issue nearly all Republicans can agree 
on - tax cuts.<p>

Given the continuing debate between the party's supply-siders and 
deficit hawks, that may seem a strange statement.  But who better to 
preside over a tax-cutting administration than Bob Dole, the deficit 
hawk?  <p>

Supply-siders can be pleased with the prospect of new economic growth 
stimulated by the Dole tax cuts.  The deficit hawks can be pleased 
because Dole's own credentials offer them assurance that he will give 
equal attention to curbing government spending.  <p>

And the entire Republican party - supply-siders and deficit hawks 
alike - can stand on a plan for running government in the years ahead 
that combines the two most important elements of a stronger economy, 
lower taxes and the reduced growth of government spending.<p>

Both of those elements are also vital to another Republican goal:  a 
balanced budget by the year 2002.<p>

The Dole plan includes a 15% across-the-board personal income tax rate 
cut over three years, halving the capital gains tax rate, repealing 
the 1993 Social Security benefits tax increase, expanding the 
availability of Individual Retirement Accounts and giving families a 
$500 per child tax credit.  Altogether the cuts are projected to 
reduce government tax revenue by $548 billion over six years.<p>

Tax cuts are more than simply politically popular.  Dole doesn't have 
to be a supply-sider to be aware of what scholarly studies conclude 
and recent history confirms - that the right kinds of tax cuts 
stimulate economic growth.  The longest periods of sustained economic 
growth in the United States have followed tax cuts.  After the Kennedy 
tax cuts in the 1960s, the economy grew by 42% over seven years.  
After the Reagan cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by 33% over seven 
years.<p>

Economist Gerald Scully, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for 
Policy Analysis who has done extensive analysis of taxes, has 
concluded that maximum economic growth occurs when government at all 
levels takes between 21.5% and 22.9 % of the nation's output of goods 
and services in taxes.  Currently, the federal government alone takes 
20.5 % - and the Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to 
grow by only 2.2% this year.  Real gross domestic product grew only 
1.3 % last year.<p>

President Clinton may see that kind of economy as "the soundest it's 
been in a generation," but it is not growing rapidly enough to provide 
Americans with economic opportunity.  <p>

Dole projects that the stimulation of enacting his tax cuts will push 
annual  economic growth to 3.5%, generating millions of jobs, a 
lasting expansion and more opportunities.  But the Dole proposal needs 
only a third of that increase to succeed.<p>

Clinton officials will likely jump on the bandwagon, arguing that they 
will now enact the middle class tax cut they promised four years ago.  
But for the moment, they are pushing the familiar theme of economic 
class-warfare.  Those who pay the most taxes will benefit the most 
from the tax cuts, they say.  True, of course, but that argument may 
not resonate so well with taxpayers who conclude that everybody is 
getting a fair share of the reductions.  Dole will touch some 
responsive chords with the theme he sounded last weekend when he said, 
"I was thinking of the husband and wife who both work, who have little 
money to save for their children's education after they pay their 
bills."<p>

Maybe Dole decided on tax cuts simply as a political tactic.  If so, 
this is one time when good politics is also good policy.  And a 
President Dole would be unlikely to lose sight for a moment of his 
goal of a balanced budget by 2002.  Given the tax cuts, this deficit 
hawk would of necessity have to go after government spending with a 
zeal that hasn't been seen in the White House since ... well, ever.<p>

The Information Warriors

<P>
The American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage 
Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute, and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis.  Who are they?  Some of America's 
"think tanks."  What are they?  In the battle of public policy ideas, 
they are the information warriors, and they are changing the way 
America thinks.
<P>
In times past legislators often relied on academics and industry-
supported researchers to supply them with information and answers 
about some of the leading public policy questions.  But increasingly 
both liberal and conservative legislators are turning to private, non-
profit research institutes, commonly known as think tanks, for the 
information they need to carry on the public policy debates.
<P>
Most of the public policy debates in Congress and in the state 
legislatures begin as ideas about what the "good society" should be 
like.  For example, should the government ensure that everyone has a 
right to health care, free education, and a good job?  Or should we be 
a society of limited government?  Should the government, through its 
economic policies, try to create an egalitarian society?  Or should it 
be indifferent as to who the winners and losers are, and just ensure 
that everyone plays by the rules?
<P>
The founders of most think tanks had some vision of that good society 
when they formed their organizations, and that vision usually pervades 
the institutes' policy recommendations.  So the analyses they produce 
have been well thought through.
<P>
As a result, the ideas behind public policy proposals and the debate 
over the social or economic impact of those proposals are increasingly 
being fought between these new centers of influence.
<P>
For example, the Clinton health care plan.  The legislative defeat of 
the Clinton health care plan came in September and October of 1994, 
but the ideological battle was fought for the two preceding years 
between liberal think tanks that supported the plan and free-market 
think tanks that opposed socializing the American health care system. 
<P>
On this issue, the free-market think tanks won a clear and decisive 
victory.  But for the longest time, they were the only troops in the 
field.  The media were absolutely convinced that some version of the 
Clinton plan would pass, and even some conservative Republicans 
thought they saw the handwriting on the wall.  National organizations 
such as the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which should have vehemently opposed the plan, cozied up to 
the administration in order to get a "seat at the table."
<P>
By contrast, the National Center for Policy Analysis (with which I am 
associated), the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and several 
other research institutes immediately raised questions about the plan 
and began to provide in-depth analysis of the economic problems that 
would arise if the Clinton plan were implemented.  Those educational 
efforts laid the groundwork for the American people's utter rejection 
of the Clinton plan.
<P>
Currently, Medical Savings Accounts are the most controversial  health 
care  issue before Congress.  MSAs are tax-free personal savings 
accounts used to pay for small and routine medical care, while a 
catastrophic health care policy pays for major expenses.  
<P>
While the battle rages today, the idea is not new.  As far back as 
1984, the National Center for Policy Analysis was promoting a 
variation of this idea, which was eventually endorsed by a number of 
think tanks across the country and passed into law by nearly 20 
states.  
<P>
In addition, the educational efforts about MSAs has resulted in 
perhaps 2,000 businesses adopting some version of an MSA plan.  As a 
result, a whole new market for health insurance has arisen, spurring 
the industry, especially the small-and medium-size insurance 
companies, to consider innovative ways to meet the demand. 
<P>
But these battles were small compared to what is coming.  Both 
liberal- and conservative-oriented think tanks are gearing up for two 
of the biggest public policy battles yet - privatizing Social Security 
before it becomes insolvent and reforming the income tax system to 
make it fairer, less complex, and more conducive to economic growth.
<P>
Both battles will make the past debates look mild by comparison.  It 
may be years before we are able to reform either system, but the 
debate is beginning now as the think tanks prepare their arguments.
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the liberal think tanks were winning the public 
policy battles.  In the '80s and '90s, the conservative institutes 
have had the upper hand.
<P>
Now, more than ever, think tanks matter.  They are influencing our 
economy and our society as they develop the ideas behind the policies 
<P>
that drive the politics of America.

<h2>
Good Intentions and Bad Policy
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No matter what your sixth grade teacher or My Weekly Reader said, 
America is not running out of space to put its garbage, recycling is 
not always good, and the world is not running out of resources.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The well-financed cultural mantra that recycling is both desirable and 
environmentally necessary has nearly become as much a truth beyond 
critical examination as that murder is wrong and that the earth is 
round.  Our schools have been full of it.  Mothers didn't even want 
juice boxes in school lunches because of fears that they couldn't be 
recycled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, it has become harder over the years to ignore the fact that 
sometimes simply throwing garbage away is more environmentally 
friendly, financially prudent - and safer for human health.  Now comes 
confirmation from an unlikely source - the New York Times Magazine.  
"Recycling is Garbage," writes John Tierney of the Times.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among other failings of recycling, it is frequently uneconomical. 
Tierney calculates that it costs more than $3,000 to recycle a ton of 
scrap metal, glass and plastic in New York City.  "For that price," he 
writes, "you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a 
used-car lot - a Toyota Tercel, for instance - and drive home in it."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And, all things considered, you would need to use your ceramic coffee 
cup 1,000 times before it would be less environmentally expensive than 
a throw-away polystyrene cup.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For some materials, recycling is good, and businesses have long known 
this.  For instance, recycling aluminum cans requires 10% less energy 
than making them from virgin materials.   And more than 10 million 
automobile tires are recycled for retreads each year, reducing the 
energy used to produce tires by 30%.  But such success stories are not 
usually transferable to other forms of waste.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now, it would not matter if the true believers in recycling recycled 
away to their heart's content - except that they have been able all 
too often to make their beliefs public policy.  In 1986, about 10% of 
solid waste was recycled at little cost to consumers or taxpayers.  
Today, with  statutory mandates  in many  communities, about 25% is 
recycled.  But achieving that level has been costly and the programs 
lose money.  Most states  initially  set even  higher  goals, such as  
50%  in  New York  and California,  60% in New Jersey, and 70% in 
Rhode Island - but none achieved them.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
recently declared New York's legislated goals "absurd" and 
"impossible."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At today's prices, curbside recycling programs typically add 15% to 
the cost of waste disposal.  One should remember that every dollar 
spent on inefficient recycling and waste reduction efforts is 
unavailable for other important social programs, including other 
environmental protection efforts.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the zeal to mandate recycling and the use of recycled 
products has created worse environmental and health hazards than the 
problems they were meant to solve.  For instance, government mandated 
recycling of newsprint requires de-inking - involving the use of 
toxics that create worse disposal problems.   In February, the 
Associated Press reported that a county road in Washington state was 
closed because smoke and fire kept bursting through its surface.  The 
roadway had been built with recycled tires that began to rust as rain 
seeped beneath the road's surface, causing heat, impenetrable clouds 
of steam and eventually fire.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By anointing recycling as the preferred method of disposal, 
environmentalists ignored technological, geographic, economic, and 
social limits to its usefulness.  In Wyoming, where transportation 
costs are high and land is cheap, it may make less sense to buy and 
use recycled paper than it does in New York.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Legislated mandates for the use and purchase of recycled products have 
wasted taxpayers' money, cost consumers both at the point of purchase 
and by limiting product options, dampened the development of resource-
saving technological innovations, and on occasion harmed the 
environment.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't we need to recycle because we're running out of scarce 
resources?  Hardly.  Technology makes it possible to use resources 
without exhausting them, which is why the prices of most natural 
resources, as well as food, have been falling for decades.  One 
example:  A fiberglass cable made with 25 kilograms of sand (about 55 
pounds) can carry 1,000 times as many messages today as a wire made 
with a ton of copper.  So copper prices are down, and its supply in no 
danger of depletion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And if throwing something away is the best choice, there is room to do 
that, too.  If we keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 
years, how big would a landfill 100 yards deep need to be to hold it?  
Just 35 miles square.

<h2>
The Best Campaign Finance Law: Repeal Spending and Contribution Limits
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Memo to true believers in campaign finance reform:  The only way to 
ensure fairer, freer elections is to get rid of the campaign spending 
laws.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Completely.  Require full disclosure of all contributors, but nothing 
else.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our present campaign finance laws are ridiculous.  As a case in point, 
Ross Perot, who spent $60 million of his own money running for 
president in 1992, can get $32 million of taxpayers' money for a race 
this year if he'll hold his personal spending to less than $50,000.  
But if Perot's Reform Party picks somebody else to run, that candidate 
may not get any taxpayers' money.  Or maybe he or she will get $32 
million after all.  The Federal Election Commission hasn't decided.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or look at publisher Steve Forbes.  He can spend a million dollars of 
his own money to run himself, but is not allowed to contribute it to a 
candidate he believes in - like Jack Kemp.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Barbra Streisand or Whoopi Goldberg can make appearances worth tens of 
thousands of dollars to candidates, but a successful CEO cannot give 
the same amount to candidates of his or her choice.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The AFL-CIO can spend $35 million on advertising against incumbent 
Congressmen, but to defend themselves those candidates must raise 
money in $1,000 or $5,000 bites.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our current campaign laws are a failed idea; complex, ineffective, and 
manipulated by a political bureaucracy called the Federal Elections 
Commission.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The reforms currently being touted include banning political action 
committees (PACs), restricting "bundling" (where individuals have one 
person deliver their contribution checks on behalf of a group), 
requiring Senatorial candidates to raise 60% of their funds inside 
their state, and outlawing "soft money."  Proponents recognize that 
banning PACs almost certainly is unconstitutional, so there's a 
fallback provision limiting their contribution to a candidate to 
$1,000.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The goal of all these proposals is to limit the influence of people 
and groups with money on the electoral process.  It might work if 
campaigns were conducted in a vacuum.  But they aren't.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Limiting the size of contributions works to the benefit of incumbents, 
or organization or party candidates, who already have in place the 
database and the organization for mass solicitation.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As Bradley A. Smith wrote in the January issue of the Yale Law 
Journal, "Reform proposals inherently favor certain political elites, 
support the status quo, and discourage grassroots political activity.  
Even if these proposals worked as intended, they would have an 
undemocratic effect on American elections."  To put it differently, 
campaign spending laws protect incumbents and special interests.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Besides, there really is no evidence that small contributions from 
large numbers lead to more representative government with less 
corruption, or that the numbers of small donors are an indication of 
the sentiment of the general electorate.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Eugene McCarthy would have found it difficult at best to conduct his 
antiwar campaign in 1968 without the six-figure individual 
contributions from backers Jack Dreyfus Jr. and Stewart Mott.  The two 
presidential candidates who have been most successful at raising money 
from small contributors were Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George 
McGovern in 1972.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Abolishing PACs may win cheers from reformers, but Francis Wilkinson, 
communications director for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 
Senate campaign, noted in a New York Times op-ed article "the impact 
on the 28,000 nurses who contribute an average of $46 a year to the 
American Nurses Association PAC to have a voice on issues like health 
care. ...For them, a PAC affords a convenient avenue of participation 
and a chance to exercise power they could not wield as individuals."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Campaign finance restrictions are a relatively recent development in 
American politics.  Is it coincidental that their growth parallels a 
decline in public confidence in government?  Maybe not, but certainly 
the campaign finance laws haven't done anything to raise confidence.  
And there is no evidence that we are better off because of them.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead of trying to fix campaign spending limitations, let's get rid 
of them.  Let people know how much money a candidate has received and 
who the big contributors are, and let them make up their  own minds 
about whether the candidate should get their vote.  One thing for 
sure, that approach would be an improvement over what we have now.

Chicken Little Lives
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Chicken Littles who had the last word on the International Panel 
on Climate Change tell us that the sky is falling again.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The panel of scientists comprising the IPCC recently reported on the 
state of, and potential outlook for, earth's climate.  Doubts, 
disagreements and contradictory data can be found in the body of the 
report.  But the group who wrote the executive summary, the only part 
that will be widely read, pretty flatly assert that humans are causing 
global warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the executive summary and the policy options presented in it, 
environmentalists say the world's governments must take drastic action 
now to halt the cataclysmic consequences of such a change.  Analysts 
at the World Watch Institute, for example, call for an overhaul of our 
energy and transportation systems, ending the fossil fuel economy.  
Such policies would cost our nation billions of dollars.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before we head for cover, let's consider whether the sky really is 
falling, or whether some Chicken Littles in the ranks of scientists 
have been led down the garden path by a figurative acorn, in the form 
of computer climate model data, falling on their heads.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proponents of the theory of global warming, or, as is now fashionable, 
"global climate change," depend on two bits of evidence and computer 
models.  First,  ground-level measurements of global mean temperature 
indicate that earth has warmed between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celsius in 
the last century.  Second, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary 
greenhouse gas (those gases without which most animal and plant life 
would not exist), has increased by approximately 25 percent in the 
last century and a half.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you put these facts in the computer models, global climate change 
theory says that the earth's current warming is due to the increase of 
CO2 in the atmosphere, caused primarily by the use of fossil fuel.  
According to the models, absent a severe and immediate reduction in 
the level of CO2 put into the atmosphere, the earth will warm further, 
causing all manner of calamities from melting polar ice caps which 
would raise ocean levels, flooding small islands and coastal regions, 
to increased hurricane activity and severe droughts, which would cause 
massive crop failure.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IPCC report's executive summary predicts that if no further action 
is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect an increase 
in temperature somewhere  between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees Celsius over 
the next 100 years.  Interestingly, this figure is well below the amount 
of warming forecast just four years ago.  In fact, with every new report, 
the range of warming falls.  At this pace, in a few years scientific 
doomsayers will be talking about the next ice age again.  (We haven't 
forgotten that that was this same group's doom and gloom scenario in 
the 1970s.)
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the current figure is correct, the increase is well within the 
natural range of known temperature variation over the last 15,000 
years.  Most of the earth's plant life evolved in a much warmer, CO2-
filled atmosphere.  In fact, the predicted warming would affect 
primarily night-time temperatures, lessening the number of frosty 
nights and extending the growing season.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, there is little evidence that increased CO2 has had more than 
a small part to play in this century's temperature increase.  Most of 
the warming occurred before the 1940s, before the widespread use of 
automobiles.  In fact, from 1938 to the present, we have actually 
experienced a cooling trend.  Indeed, satellite data, the most 
reliable climate evidence that we have, show no evidence of warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why do scientists agree that we must take drastic action now?  
Well, they don't.  Some scientists are proclaiming impending disaster, 
but others of at least equal repute say the evidence of global warming 
is questionable at best.  So this is not a question of proven science 
versus a bunch of know-nothings.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And why do they agree, as the executive summary says, that we should 
take drastic action now to curb fossil fuel use, limit economic growth 
in established countries, and condemn less-developed countries to 
continue in their less-developed circumstances, and increase 
unemployment and misery all around?  They don't agree with that 
either. Even some of climate change theory's foremost scientific 
advocates acknowledge that there is nothing we can do now to prevent 
global climate change that we won't be able to do 10 years from now.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A far better course of action is to keep studying, keep learning, and 
keep improving our data until we understand what, if anything, is 
really happening.  Then we can take action that will allow economic 
growth and a higher standard of living and keep our planet livable.  
Both must be accomplished together; we must not sacrifice one to 
achieve the other.

Cut Taxes, Help the Economy, Win the Presidency

National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
As Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.  And sometimes 
very quickly.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Barely a month ago, on April 29th, Bruce Bartlett, formerly at the 
Treasury Department and now a Senior Fellow with the National Center 
for Policy Analysis,  put forth a simple idea:  cut personal income 
taxes 15% across the board.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Why a 15% cut?  Because that would bring the government's share of the 
nation's gross domestic product back to about what it was in 1992, 
before President Clinton took office.  In Bartlett's words, "In the 
first three years of the Clinton administration, Americans have paid 
$151.1 billion more in taxes than if federal receipts had remained at 
their 1992 level as a share of gross domestic product."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett had the inspiration after he saw recent Commerce Department 
figures that showed that more than one out of every three dollars 
produced by the American economy last year went to government.  At the 
federal, state and local levels combined, government consumed 31.3% of 
all national output - the largest share of GDP ever taken by 
government.  Even in 1945, with the country fighting and paying for 
World War II, total taxes only amounted to 30% of GDP.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett calculated that since Bill Clinton took office, personal 
income taxes have increased 1.6 times faster than the country's 
economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate taxes have 
increased 3.5 times faster.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Three weeks later, on May 20th, Bartlett could report that Bob Dole, 
soon to be the Republican nominee for president, was giving his idea 
serious consideration.  Dole has been a deficit hawk during his 
career, but history, politics and economic theory are all on the side 
of a tax cut - and that may be enough to sway him.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is historical justification for a tax cut now.  The increasing 
government share of output caused by bracket creep during the high 
inflation 1970s led to the Reagan tax cut.  For that matter, the high 
percentage of state output that was being taken by taxes in California 
was what prompted Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and the 
beginning of a nationwide revolt against state and local tax levels.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Political justification?   Well, there's the Reagan proposal in 1980 
for a 30% across-the-board reduction that helped him beat Jimmy 
Carter.   More recently, Christie Whitman came from behind to win 
election as governor of New Jersey in 1993 after she too pledged a 30% 
tax cut.  Further, that 15% figure represents a repeal of President 
Clinton's tax increases, so it should have some symbolic importance to 
Dole and the Republican Party.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The magic of a tax cut pledge is that it gives a campaign a focal 
point.  (After 1988, it's pretty safe to say that just pledging "no 
new taxes" is not going to be a vote-getter.)  For Republicans, whose 
agenda is less regulation, smaller government, and increased personal 
responsibility, a tax reduction proposal provides philosophical 
underpinning for all their policies.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Perhaps the most compelling justification, however, is economics.  
Because personal and corporate income taxes are graduated - the more 
money one makes, the higher tax percentage one pays - the tax burden 
increases as the economy grows.  To hold it steady as a percentage of 
the national economy requires periodic tax cuts.  Further, reducing 
marginal tax rates provides an incentive to earn more money, freeing 
up more dollars for saving and investment and stimulating economic 
growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"But," as the liberals (and moderate Republicans) are fond of saying, 
"what about the deficit?"  That argument was dealt a body blow  by 
Democrat Felix Rohatyn in the April 11th Wall Street Journal:  After 
listing our most serious economic and social problems, Rohatyn wrote:  
"Even though all of these require different approaches, the single 
most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and 
revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth.  John Kennedy 
was right:  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Although it may not lift 
all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth 
we are simply redistributing the same pie." 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So how can Dole, as a deficit hawk, rationalize a tax cut? A 
successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing the 
growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic growth 
is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases take home 
pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax receipts. 
There aren't many problems that a 15% tax cut can cause that a 3.5% 
economic growth rate can't solve if you keep a handle on spending.  
Ideas do have consequences.  And Bob Dole's election could be the 
consequence of a proposal to cut taxes 15% across-the-board.

<h2>
Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform?
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The new Republican Congress roared into Washington and set out to 
change the rules of environmental policy.  Environmental reforms were 
going to be based on risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, less 
business regulation and smaller environmental agencies.  Congress was 
going to prune back the oppressive bureaucracy and get the government 
off our backs.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Two years later, what has happened?  Not much.  The budgets of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are little 
changed from previous years.  The EPA's 1996 budget is only 1.5% less 
than its 1995 budget.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The flawed Endangered Species Act continues in force unchanged even 
though authorization for it has long since lapsed.  The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, among the least controversial of the nation's environmental 
laws, has not been re-authorized.  Wetlands reforms are still nothing 
but a promise.  Commitments to improve individual property rights 
protections and to give more control over environmental matters to the 
states have largely gone unfulfilled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has even been unable to reform the one law widely cited by 
both Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most flawed 
environmental program:  Superfund.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So why have the reformers failed? First, there was an image problem.  
Republicans focused on the cost to business of environmental 
regulation.  They talked about dollars and cents, efficiency, and 
decreased regulation, thus providing Democrats the opportunity to 
seize the moral high ground.  Defenders of the status quo frightened 
the public by painting reforms as the abandonment of basic 
environmental protection.  Talk about decreased business costs was no 
match for talk about threats to "children's health."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then there were election year politics. The President and 
Congressional Democrats calculated that it would be better for their 
election prospects to bash Republicans for their lack of compassion 
than to support positive bipartisan environmental reforms.  Democrats 
even refused to vote for environmental policies that they themselves 
had proposed and supported when they controlled the Congress.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then came the pollsters.  Republican pollsters found that the vast 
majority of voters consider themselves to be environmentalists. They 
also found that even Republican voters trust Democrats more than their 
own party on environmental issues. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But people who vote based on environmental issues generally think 
either that environmental laws need basic reforms that balance human 
needs with environmental protection, or that we must protect the 
environment regardless of the costs.  The former group has largely 
supported reform efforts.  Backing off environmental reforms threatens 
to alienate them.  Voters in the latter group don't trust Republican 
efforts and attempting to gain their support is a losing proposition.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But the main reason for the failure of Republican environmental reform 
goes much deeper.  It rests on the first rule of successful politics:  
you must present a positive vision for the outcome of your policies. 
While the reformers correctly pointed out the excesses associated with 
current environmental laws, they neither discussed environmentally 
appropriate goals nor provided a blueprint for attaining a better 
environment.  Simply put, they ignored the "vision thing."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
A positive environmental vision for the future is centered upon the 
solution to the tragedy of the Commons.  You remember the tale:  all 
the village cattle graze upon a jointly owned common.  It is in the 
interest of each villager to add more cattle to his herd, since he 
pays no price to use the common. Soon there is no grass left on the 
common, the cattle die, and the village economy fails.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The solution?  Give each villager an ownership stake in his portion of 
the common and he will graze only so many cattle as it will support.  
The village economy then prospers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Instead of the government regulating the trout stream, let the trout 
fisherman manage the lands and trout will flourish.  Let nature 
conservancies manage the bird sanctuaries and reap the profits of 
drilling for oil beneath them, and oil and fowl will peacefully co-
exist.  When the government bans the killing of elephants, poachers 
take them and the herds dwindle.  Let the natives own the elephants, 
and hunters are permitted a share, but the herds will grow under the 
watchful eye of people who have a stake in their growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Free markets produce more wealth, and free people are the best 
environmental stewards.  Wealthier societies have healthier 
populations and commit more resources to environmental protection than 
do poorer nations.  Freedom of people and markets is not only 
compatible with environmental health, it is essential to it. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
What the Republicans forgot is that beating up on regulators - no 
matter how well deserved - is no substitute for an environmental 
vision for the future.

Eastern Europe and the Western Alliance
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil," Edmund Burke 
observed, "is for good men to do nothing."  While what has happened in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is hardly evil - 
communism was the evil - the fact is that good men have done very 
little to nourish the seeds of Western values in the freed nations of 
Eastern Europe.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
At a recent gathering of several hundred pro-democracy ministers and 
MPs from western and central European nations in Prague, Czech 
Republic President Vaclev Havel put it more bluntly:  "Six years have 
passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain.  It seems to me that little 
has happened during those six years and time is working against the 
Democrats.  Against those who want peace and peaceful cooperation.  
Unless Democrats proceed with greater vigor to build the European 
order, others will start to do so and we know who the 'others' 
are....The story of the former Yugoslavia should be a clear warning 
for  Europe and for the whole wor as to what can happen if there is 
too much hesitation."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The Congress of Prague, as the meeting was called, stressed the 
urgency of bringing Eastern European nations into the western 
alliance.  Its mission was "to reunite the family of western 
civilization, and so to ensure its future."  Lest this seem too 
pessimistic, consider that for 50 years, from 1939 to 1989, Central 
Europe was the battleground of our century's epic battle of freedom 
against tyranny.  With the flush of the victory of the west over 
communism, all seemed possible, and the integration of Russia's former 
satellites into the European community and its commerce seemed 
probable.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But it has not come to pass.  Instead, "Market reforms in the former 
communist countries are being slowed down or reversed.  Post-
communists now govern in all the former satellites except the  Czech 
Republic.  A former communist has replaced Lech Walesa as president of 
Poland.  The communists won 45 percent of the Russian Duma in the 
recent elections.  And Central Europe has seen its membership of both 
NATO and the EU postponed."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So what to do?  First, the economic base of western Europe must be 
expanded eastward.  The current strategy of European Union (EU) 
advocates - principally the French and Germans - is flawed.  A single, 
common-currency, Brussels-regulated European monolith, hard to join 
and with limited economic growth potential once admitted (the EU 
annual growth targets are the same anemic 2.5% as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's), offers less hope for the future than a tariff-free trading 
group with harmonized procedures.  All the former European Soviet 
satellites should quickly become a part of such a group.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Second, NATO must be expanded eastward as well.  The Czech Republic 
and Hungary should be admitted now; Poland and the Baltic nations 
should follow.  The Russians, of course, are opposed, and have been 
saber-rattling against it ("Moscow plans pact with Belorussia if NATO 
expands" - May 15, 1996).  But as the London Times editorialized on 
May 14th, "The case for enlargement is one of principle:  that 
independent nations have the right to choose their own foreign and 
defense policies and allies."  Especially independent nations once 
enslaved by the very nation now objecting to their increased freedoms.  
Or in President Havel's words, we cannot allow "someone else [to] 
decide which countries should be allowed to join the Alliance and 
which should not."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Third, the United States and the newly enlarged memberships of the EU 
must move promptly to increase trade across the Atlantic.  A Trans-
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) must be put on the agenda of the 
World Trading Organization.  If it does not receive favorable 
attention, the EU and NAFTA should begin direct discussions to further 
liberalize trade agreements.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
For seven years there has been a window of opportunity to bring 
stability to an area of the world that has spawned a century of wars.  
But it is closing rapidly; in fact, there is a chance that it may be  
slammed shut by the June elections in Russia.  The fears of central 
European nations of instability to the East are not groundless.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Lady Thatcher's address to the Congress of Prague provided a practical 
program:  "...to merge the North American Free Trade Area with the 
European community, including the countries of Central and perhaps in 
time Eastern Europe."  And a corresponding vision:  "We in the West 
won a great victory  the Cold War.  Let us not now forget why we 
fought.  The mission of this Congress is to recapture that sense of 
purpose and clothe it with practical action."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is an opportunity to bring the victims of this century the 
opportunities of the next one.  It must be seized before it slips 
away.

</i>  <h2>  Unfunded Mandates:<br>
 Congress Is Targeting Business Instead of Governments 
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has made it illegal for the federal government to impose 
unfunded mandates - requirements to take certain actions or provide 
certain services without providing the federal funds to pay for those 
mandates - on state and local governments.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfunded mandates have been a real burden in the past, forcing state 
and local governments to spend millions and even billions of dollars 
while members of Congress took the political credit for good deeds.  
For example, Columbus, Ohio, complained in 1991 that Congress was 
forcing it to spend $62 million to fulfill environmental mandates.  
The National Association of Towns and Townships estimated that 
unfunded federal mandates cost local taxpayers about $6.5 billion in 
fiscal year 1993.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The new Republican Congress with great fanfare put a stop to it.  Or 
so it claimed.  But the fact is that Congress hasn't really repented 
of its past sins, it has just changed its focus - from local 
governments to private businesses.  Congress' new mandate addiction 
can best be seen with regard to the issue of health care reform.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; People without health insurance sometimes develop a medical condition 
and then have difficulty finding an insurer to provide health 
coverage.  Although this is a relatively small problem for the U.S. 
health care system - surveys show that less than 1 percent of the 
population has been denied health insurance because of an preexisting 
medical condition - it is nevertheless real.  And its solution - 
Congressional mandates to help the poor and the ill - has irresistible 
political appeal.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But Congress does not have the money to solve the problem of the 
uninsurable, and under its new rule against unfunded mandates, it 
cannot tell the states to handle it.   So it has decided, through the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act,  to tell health 
insurance companies - primarily those that write health insurance 
policies for individuals - that they must accept and pay the costs of 
medical care for the uninsurable.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While everyone agrees this bill will increase the cost of health 
insurance - the difference of opinion is only how much - Congress is 
not required to provide the funds to businesses.  It just tells health 
insurers what to do, takes the credit for solving the problem of the 
uninsurable, and passes the costs of the unfunded mandate on to 
business, and ultimately consumers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A second example concerns mental health.  Health insurance companies 
often treat mental health problems differently than they do physical 
health care problems, primarily because mental health science is much 
more complex and less understood than physical health science, and 
mental health illnesses less specific.  It can also be much more 
difficult to tell when a patient is "cured" of a mental health problem 
than of a physical ailment.  A broken limb can be seen to mend.  
Mental uneasiness has no obvious limits and can linger indefinitely.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, insurers have been reluctant to give mental health care 
the blank check it has provided for traditional health care and 
insurance coverage for mental health services is much more limited.  
Some in Congress would like to solve that problem by telling insurers 
that their policies must cover mental health care needs to the same 
extent their  policies  cover other medical conditions. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once again, Congress praises itself for its compassion and passes the 
unfunded mandate - the costs along with the economic chaos  - on to 
private-sector businesses.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfortunately, health insurance isn't the only place Congress is 
considering imposing unfunded mandates on business.  Consider the 
recent struggle over increasing the minimum wage.  Congress wants to 
raise the cost of labor to both state and local governments and 
private employers, requiring them to pay the cost.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a perfect example of members of Congress appealing to the 
American public, explaining how concerned and compassionate they are 
about the plight of the low-income employee, and how Congress is going 
to solve the problem by raising their wages.  What they don't make so 
clear is that they intend to require business to pay for their 
compassion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Worse, the 23 Republican Congressmen pressing the Republican 
leadership to increase the minimum wage all voted for the unfunded 
mandates prohibition.  Most of them even voted against an amendment 
exempting the minimum wage from the unfunded mandate prohibition.  So 
much for candor in government. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perhaps what we need is a Contract With America II, with a provision 
that would protect private companies from unfunded mandates the way 
the first Contract protected state and local governments.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simply put, if Congress isn't willing to pay for something, it ought 
not require someone else to buy it.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Constitutional law expert Richard Morgan predicts that the era of judicial activism is almost over -- and that, when the end comes, it will come rapidly. He likens this imminent, swift demise of an outworn orthodoxy to the sudden fall of the Soviet empire. "Just as political and social institutions that appear as durable as the mountains can collapse almost overnight," Morgan explains, "so, too, seemingly impregnable intellectual orthodoxies can suddenly stand revealed as so flawed that we're abashed at having accepted them for so long." Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, the Bowdoin College professor contends that "America is on the edge of such a collapse of orthodoxy in our thinking about the proper role of judges and judge-made law in our governmental process. Central to this change," he says, "is the demythologizing of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education."<p>

Before we can lay judicial activism to rest, we must first acknowledge the flawed nature of the Brown decision. "The collapse of Brown as a model for judicial behavior will resonate through many of the most contentious areas of American public policy," says Morgan, "from criminal justice and affirmative action to education and welfare reform: for Brown is the mother of contemporary judicial activism -- policy making by judges acting essentially as legislators, without any real justification from such ordinary legal authorities as statutory and constitutional texts, history, and precedent." Morgan charges that the Supreme Court decision that "overruled the people of Colorado in May with respect to homosexual rights, without any serious attempt to offer a constitutional reason for doing so, is only the latest example of the Brown style of judging."<p>

Morgan notes that "arguments undermining the authority of Brown as a model for judging have long been piling up. Right from the beginning, some of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers criticized Brown -and especially Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, which relied on essentially sociological reasoning to brush aside 70 years of precedent and settled understanding as to the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Chief Justice relied "neither on text, nor history, nor precedent," says Morgan, and "was, in effect, claiming for the Court the authority to revise the meaning of the Constitution."<p>

Richard Morgan maintains that the Court "attempted to dismantle segregation (a profoundly important end) by means that were profoundly wrong. Not only did this judicial fiat traduce democracy, substituting the will of the judges for decision by the people and their representatives; it disregarded fundamental constitutional forms (federalism, separation of powers, and the procedures for amending the Constitution prescribed by Article V)." The Brown decision "launched the modern era of judicial 'reform,' in which purportedly noble ends can justify even the most constitutionally suspect means." It's time, says Morgan, to admit the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Duplantier: NAFTA & Narcotics  -- 9/02/96</title>

 <i>September 2, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NAFTA & Narcotics </h2><p>

<i>"The impact of NAFTA on the sale and distribution of narcotics within the U.S. was felt immediately. In the very first month after the treaty took effect in January l 994, there was a sharp rise in marijuana, cocaine, and crack in the streets and schoolyards of our towns and cities. "</i><p>

Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas "joined Bill Clinton in bulldozing NAFTA through," recalls William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade. NAFTA made perfect sense to Salinas, who with his family was "deeply involved in the drug trade and other criminal activities. Salinas is now hiding in exile," reports Gill; "his brother, Raul Salinas, is in prison, and Raul's wife was arrested in Switzerland for attempting to withdraw some of their laundered money from a Swiss bank." In addition, "several of Mexico's most prominent businessmen were linked to the Salinas family's crime ring."<p>

Gill charges that "the lucrative narcotics industry" has corrupted public officials south -- and north -- of the border. "Three former high U.S. Justice Department lawyers were indicted last year for helping the Cali drug cartel ship literally tons of cocaine into our country, most of it via Mexico," he reports. High officials in both the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were "allegedly involved in drug and immigrant smuggling from Mexico." Drug trafficking generates an estimated "$30 billion in income for our neighbors to the south," says Gill. "Drug money is financing all kinds of businesses in Mexico and, no doubt, in the United States as well."<p>

The crime explosion NAFTA caused in Mexico is spilling over into the U.S. "Last year, there were 1000 slayings in the larger cities on the Mexican side of the border, most of them drug-related and unsolved," says Gill. "No one could possibly know how many murders in the United States are caused by the NAFTA-spurred increase in the drug trade. But they are bound to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, by now. Indeed, there is deep and growing interaction between the drug gangs in Los Angeles and other American cities and the drug lords and gangs in Mexico and Central America."<p>

Gill argues that "free trade is the primary driving force behind the crime wave that is sweeping the globe." Calling this crime wave "a crisis that threatens the very foundations of all civilization," he predicts that "the chaos emanating from Mexico now will sweep in stronger from China tomorrow. Already we are getting a foretaste of what Communist China and others in the East have in store for the U.S.A.," says Gill. "In May, Customs officers seized 2000 AK-47 assault rifles in California." Chinese agents had sought to sell these weapons to L.A. street gangs.<p>

"China is also exporting thousands of illegal aliens to this country," Williarn Gill reports. "Many come into Central American mini-states and are smuggled into the U.S. via Mexico." Gill warns that "the invasion from China could easily surpass the present 1 million or so Mexican illegals entering each year."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Special Ed: Kids go in, Don't come out -- 8/28/96</title>

 <i>August 28, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> SPECIAL ED: KIDS GO IN, DON'T COME OUT</h2><p>                           


     The budget for special education in New York City schools exceeds
     $2 billion, for just 135,000 students!<p>

     There's a lesson to be learned when "a school system that has
     made a fetish out of testing, counting, and record-keeping
     ignores the most important tests and statistics of them all: the
     ordinary measures of whether children are learning anything." So
     observes Kay Hymowitz in a distressing article entitled "Special
     Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," in the Summer issue of
     the Manhattan Institute's City Journal. "Two-thirds of special-ed
     students officially exiting in 1995," she observes, "dropped out
     instead of graduating."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that "only 5 percent of special-ed kids are ever
     'decertified' into general education." In other words, from the
     perspective of the students, the program is a colossal failure.
     It has, however, created enormous opportunity for the bureaucrats
     and attorneys responsible for complying with "a mammoth federal
     mandate and a 17-year-old consent decree." It has succeeded in
     "providing employment for members of the United Federation of
     Teachers." It has given poor parents an incentive for having
     their children misdiagnosed in order to obtain Supplemental
     Security Income. It has furnished a way for conniving
     middle-class parents to provide their children with "a private
     education at public expense." It's also proven to be a boon for
     those private agencies that "evaluate potential special-ed
     preschool students, and then, in 75 to 80 percent of cases . . .
     refer them to their own schools."<p>

     Hymowitz argues that "both the federal law and the apparatus
     dedicated to its enforcement rest on a largely worthless
     scientific model. The federal law asserts that such great
     progress in 'diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods'
     has taken place that, given enough money, all handicapped
     children can be educated effectively. Like a team of doctors,
     experts are supposed to 'diagnose' a child's malady and then
     recommend the proper course of treatment." Hymowitz reports that
     "the criteria for referrals and placement in New York City
     schools were far from uniform." There is no telling how many
     students have been misclassified. "A child might be called
     learning disabled in one school, emotionally disturbed in
     another, or not be referred at all in a third."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that learning-disabled, or L.D., kids "are
     overwhelmingly minority, poor achievers, and often behaviorally
     disruptive. Many have moved and changed schools often; many are
     chronically late for school. All this suggests chaotic home lives
     that clash with the ordered processes of learning," says
     Hymowitz. "Though both state and federal law clearly specify that
     the category 'learning disabled' should 'not include children who
     have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . .
     environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage,' those are
     precisely the children who are included."<p>

     Kay Hymowitz concedes that "we must do something for these
     children," but insists that special education "does almost no
     noticeable good for perhaps half the pupils it serves . . . and
     is forbidden by law to include them in the first place."<p>

<title>Duplantier: FDA is Stifling Medical Innovation -- 8/27/96</title>

<h2> FDA IS STIFLING MEDICAL INNOVATION</h2><p>                    





     Society offers numerous safeguards against unsafe medical
     devices, including: consumer awareness, free competition, private
     testing laboratories, and tort law.<P>

     "Today, in what used to be the Land of the Free, someone with an
     idea for a new medical device that might help alleviate a human
     health problem can't just test the device and market it (and
     accept responsibility for any adverse effects)," observes Dr.
     Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American
     Physicians and Surgeons. "First the people with the idea have to
     invest tens of millions of dollars . . . in government paperwork.
     Then they have to submit their idea to a Czar. A few years later
     their dream may lie in ruins because of the Czar's arbitrary
     decision. If they complain, the Czar might also impound other
     products they happen to have on the market."<p>

     Why isn't there more of a public outcry over this tragic abuse of
     government power? "The people who might benefit from the proposed
     new device will never hear about it," explains Dr. Orient. "The
     public might learn about an FDA error in approving something, but
     it's almost always safe for a bureaucrat to disapprove
     something."?<p>

     Writing in a recent issue of Priorities, a publication of the
     American Council on Science and Health, Dr. Orient notes that
     "devices subjected to this maddening approval system could save
     lives . . . or could mitigate serious disability." Nevertheless,
     the FDA denies access to them "for months, for years, or
     forever." There were roughly 5,000 such devices waiting to be
     approved in 1994, and there's no telling how many ideas were
     never even submitted "because their inventors were deterred,
     perhaps for lack of money, from even trying for approval. Often
     inventors just take their ideas abroad," says Dr. Orient. "The
     American lead in medicine," she concludes from this ominous
     trend, "may soon be a distant memory."<p>

     The FDA was originally established "to assure that drugs were
     properly labeled and not adulterated," recalls Dr. Orient. "Then
     its role expanded into proving the safety, and then the efficacy,
     of drugs. Now the FDA is into medical devices. Soon it will be
     dictating the practice of medicine."<p>

     The U.S. Constitution, needless to say, makes no provision for
     the FDA. "As with most of the ever-expanding powers of the
     federal leviathan, the pretext lies in the constitutionally
     mandated power of Congress to 'regulate commerce,'" observes Dr.
     Jane Orient. "This is surely not what the Founders had in mind.
     They thought of government as a necessary evil, a system needed
     to restrain evildoers; they definitely did not envision
     government as a do-gooder." Well-intentioned or not, governmental
     intervention has inevitable consequences. "As the power of
     government agencies grows, other protections wither or are choked
     off," Dr. Orient explains. "Consumers don't bother to think for
     themselves; they just trust the government to look out for them."<p><br>

<title>Duplantier: Treaty Threatens American Security -- 8/26/96</title>

<h2> TREATY THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY</h2><p>                    

                  




     Why would anyone object to the banning of chemical weapons? Good
     question! Here's the answer.<p>

     The United States Senate is scheduled to vote soon on
     ratification of a treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.
     This Treaty purports to ban the production and stockpiling of
     chemical weapons, which would seem to be a laudable goal. A good
     case can be made, however, that the Treaty will not achieve its
     expressed objective and that certain unintended effects could
     undermine our nation's security and threaten the personal liberty
     of American citizens. Analyst Baker Spring of the Heritage
     Foundation charges that the Treaty "contains serious
     shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable.
     But the potential damage," says Spring, "is not limited merely to
     national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden
     on American businesses and thus harm America's economy."<p>

     The Treaty would require American businesses to "prove to the
     U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not
     producing or stockpiling chemical weapons," Spring explains.
     "Failure to comply with these regulations could result in
     companies being fined as much as $50,000 per incident." But
     following the rules isn't cheap either. Complying with the terms
     of the Treaty could cost American businesses as much as $200
     million a year, says Spring. That doesn't include "potential
     indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the
     loss of confidential information." Spring stresses that the
     Treaty would apply not just to chemical companies, but to almost
     any business that uses chemicals, including "food processors,
     brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies,
     petroleum companies, and rubber companies."<p>

     "If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security
     interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American
     businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the
     inspection regime," concedes Baker Spring. "But to ask American
     businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by
     implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security
     makes neither economic nor security sense."<p>

     Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy agrees that the
     Chemical Weapons Convention will "seriously damage United States
     national security interests and impose a massive, new regulatory
     burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses." The Treaty, he says,
     "will do nothing to reduce the arsenals of terrorist countries
     and other nations hostile to the United States." Several such
     countries "have neither signed nor ratified" the treaty, observes
     Gaffney, citing Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea as examples.
     China has not yet ratified the Treaty; nor has Russia, "the
     country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world."<p>

     Gaffney also consider the Treaty unverifiable. He worries that it
     "will forbid United States commanders from using tear gas and
     other riot-control agents to protect our soldiers in the field
     and minimize civilian casualties." And he argues that it "will
     create yet another international bureaucracy costing millions of
     U.S. taxpayer dollars every year to impose costly new regulatory
     burdens on thousands of U.S. companies."<p>

<title>Duplantier: SCHOOL ABUSE -- 8/16/96</title>

 <i>August 16, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>SCHOOL ABUSE</h2><p> 

[On March 19th of this year, 59 sixth-grade girls at a middle school in  
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania were subjected to gynecological exams  
against their will and without the permission of their parents.]<p> 
 
"This whole unsavory incident provides us with one more reason why  
parents ought not to put their children in public schools, and another  
reason why the government ought to be kicked out of the education  
business," concludes education expert Samuel Blumenfeld in the June  
issue of his Blumenfeld Education Letter. "This is probably the worst  
case of public educators violating the privacy rights of students and  
parents that we have seen to date."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld warns that "the totalitarians among the education  
establishment are becoming bolder and bolder in their assertion that they  
own the children." Heretofore, it was "unheard of in this country for  
perfectly healthy individuals to be forcibly herded into a nurse's room,  
and told to strip and lie down on a table for an examination." Blurnenfeld  
associates such practices with Nazi Germany. "During World War II,  
when the Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps," he  
recalls, "the first thing their captors forced them to do was strip. The  
purpose of the stripping was to deprive these captives of any notion of  
privacy or personal dignity. The stripping meant that they were now the  
property of their captors, who could do anything they wanted to them."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that the 59 grade-school girls in East Stroudsberg  
were similarly dehumanized. "The psychological damage done to these  
girls by the government of Pennsylvania cannot be undone," he contends.  
"They shall have to live with the traumatic consequences for the rest of  
their lives." Some good may come of the incident, however, if parents  
learn "that the educators cannot be trusted and that they will continue to  
deceive the public. The cavalier manner in which the school authorities  
say that parents were supposedly 'informed' of the planned exam, and the  
fact that the school cannot provide any evidence that such prior  
notification was indeed given, is an example of the contempt that school  
authorities now have for parents," says Blumenfeld. "It's as if they were  
telling them, 'We own your kids and we don't need your approval for  
anything we want to do with them."'<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that "this trend toward totalitarian enslavement will  
continue until such time as the American people put a stop to it. They can  
do so tomorrow by simply withdrawing their children from the  
government's national socialist schools and educating them at home or in  
private schools they can trust." He warns that public school officials now  
"feel so confident of their power to impose their will" on schoolchildren  
that they think they no longer have to obtain parental permission for  
anything. Samuel Blumenfeld urges all Americans to assert their parental  
rights before they lose their children entirely to the totalitarian state.<p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br>
 <i>August 15, 1996</i><p>

<h2>FREON</h2><p>
 
[Twenty million American drivers will pay four times as much for air  
conditioning repairs this summer, and it won't make any difference to the  
ozone layer.]<p> 
 
"Federal law has banned production of Freon, the refrigerant used in  
more than 100 million automotive air-conditioners, in response to  
concerns about depletion of the ozone layer," says Ben Lieberman of the  
Competitive Enterprise Institute in a recent Washington Times  
commentary. "America's first post-phaseout summer is now upon us,"  
notes Lieberman, "and the news for consumers is not good. The price of  
existing Freon stocks is rising, and with it the cost of auto A/C repairs.  
Millions of car owners who will need A/C service are going to get very  
angry, especially when they realize that the excessive costs are both  
unnecessary and unfair."<p> 
 
The wholesale price of Freon was less than a dollar a pound five years  
ago, Lieberman recalls. Nowadays, that same pound of refreshing Freon  
costs upwards of $20. That's wholesale, too. The retail price is roughly  
double, and you'll probably need three pounds to fill your car's A/C.  
"Nearly all pre-1994 vehicles use Freon," Lieberman observes. "In  
addition to higher Freon costs, EPA regulations on the handling of  
refrigerants are time-consuming and require expensive equipment, adding  
to labor costs. In total, the bill for a typical automobile A/C repair has  
gone up by $100 or more."<p> 
 
Ironically, none of this extra cost or effort will have any real impact on  
the ozone layer. Most scientists have concluded that "ozone depletion is  
not nearly as serious nor immediate a threat as once predicted," observes  
Lieberman. "In fact, virtually every scary sounding prediction about the  
consequences of ozone depletion . . . has been qualified or abandoned by  
scientists." According to Lieberman, "The abrupt phaseout does not make  
sense. A few more years of limited Freon production to meet the needs of  
the existing fleet of Freon-using vehicles would have made little  
difference to the ozone layer, but a big difference to consumers."<p> 
 
Banning an efficient coolant may be a mania in America, but very few  
foreign countries are suffering from Freon phobia. "Although more than  
100 nations have signed an international treaty banning the production of  
Freon and other compounds," observes Lieberman, "developing nations  
have been given a 10-year extension, and few other developed countries  
are taking the phaseout as seriously as the United States. For example,  
illegal Freon is readily available throughout much of Europe, at a fraction  
of the U.S. price. Further, most countries have nothing like our  
Environmental Protection Agency's costly Freon-handling regulations."<p> 
 
But facts won't phase the phaseout. "Rather than trying to reduce the  
ban's costs, the EPA is loudly denying their existence," says Lieberman.  
"Most car owners have no idea how expensive their next A/C breakdown  
will be -- until it happens," he adds. The Freon phaseout is an  
unnecessary and unfair tax on everyone with a car made before 1994.<p>

<title>Duplantier: Corporate Welfare -- 08/13/96</title>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br>
 <i>August 13, 1996</i><p>

<h2> CORPORATE WELFARE</h2><p>

<i>"Business research and development should be paid for by stockholders, 
not U.S. taxpayers."</i><p>

"When it comes to attacking the federal deficit," says Stephen Moore of 
the Cato Institute, "there is one area of the budget that both parties have 
come to regard as politically untouchable: corporate welfare." Moore 
reports that a recent Cato study "shows that Uncle Sam currently spends 
$75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Eliminating those 
subsidies would cut the budget deficit in half," he contends. "If Congress 
were willing to stop the giveaways, the feds would save enough money to 
make up for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax and the 
estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating the anti-growth taxes 
would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global 
competitiveness than asking Congress to pick industrial winners and 
losers."<p>

Moore tells us who the lucky "winners" are. "About $10 billion to $15 
billion a year is spent on agriculture subsidies -- not to small family 
farmers, but to large agribusinesses, such as Archer Daniels Midland. The 
federal sugar program provides the owners ofthe 33 largest sugar 
plantations in America more than $1 million each per year and doubles 
the price of sugar to U.S. consumers." Who else is on the gravy train? 
"Another $8 billion to $10 billion a year subsidizes U.S. exporters," says 
Moore, "including such impoverished companies as Boeing, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse." And that's just a sampling.<p>

Moore chides the Congress for failing to make any significant reductions 
in corporate welfare, then takes the executive branch to task. "With few 
exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest 
corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress," he observes. "In fact, 
the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in 
spending on business subsidies." Noting that "Republicans made a valiant 
effort to close down the Commerce Department, but the Clinton 
administration allied itself with lobbyists to fend off the budget cutters," 
Moore concludes that "the Clinton administration has proved itself to be 
corporate welfare's best friend."<p>

Moore contends that corporate welfare "corrupts both our free market 
system and our representative form of government. Corporate welfare 
converts the industrialist into a statist businessman, whose market is the 
political arena in DC, not consumers." Corporate welfare also "creates a 
bidding war for preferential treatment among businesses and industries," 
a process not conducive to high ethical standards among lawmakers. 
Corporate welfare appears to be counterproductive no matter how you 
look at it. "There is no evidence that business subsidies and industrial 
policy programs are at all successful in creating jobs or wealth," says 
Moore. "Even if they did, those benefits would almost never offset the 
efficiency loss from large tax burdens imposed on workers and 
businesses to fund the programs."<p>

Successful businesses do not require the financial assistance of American 
taxpayers. One of these days we're going to have to dismantle the welfare 
system, and we might as well start with the least needy.<p>

<h2>
Trade Revolution 1996
</h2>

<i>"Most Americans are still living and laboring under the illusion of 
freedom. But more and more of us know that our freedom has been sold 
out from under us by a totally corrupt government. "</i>
<P>
"America is frittering away the last shreds of its once inviolable and 
cherished sovereignty," says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. The mechanisms for ceding our nation's sovereignty 
to a global authority were established in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as 
NAFTA and GATT) "and a host of subsidiary actions via the UN and 
other international agencies," says Gill. "The list of actual and potential 
infringements -- and worse -- upon U.S. laws and the rights of our 
citizens ," he warns, "is literally endless."
<P>
Gill laments the ease with which a foreign country can "invade the United 
States with its exports and agents, with its products and services -- even 
with its own plants and equipment -- and skim off American capital and 
technology with the help of its American wage slaves." Under the 
circumstances, the United States can no longer "call itself a free and 
independent nation," he concludes. "Any nation that permits foreign 
interests to take over its plants and production, its farmland, and even its 
banks is no longer truly independent. Any nation that sacrifices the jobs 
and livelihood of millions of its citizens in order to absorb billions upon 
billions of dollars in imported goods from Third World countries . . . has 
already surrendered its claim to nationhood. Any nation that has already 
openly acknowledged that its own laws are subject to interpretation -- and 
even cancellation -- by an international tribunal such as the World Trade 
Organization or the United Nations . . . is no longer free."
<P>
Gill points out that our Founding Fathers did not labor under illusions as 
we do today. "In 1776 all Americans knew that King George III and his 
Parliament were the rulers of this country," he observes. "Today we are 
not even permitted to know who the real rulers of the supposedly 
independent USA are, let alone what they are up to in leading us toward 
world government. Along the way toward this goal, they have already 
surrendered our sovereignty in the unholy name of 'free trade.' They have 
also surrendered millions of our best-paying and most secure jobs -no 
less than nine million in the downsizings since 1990." Gill charges that 
our nation's self-destructive trade policy "has been fostered by such 
esoteric groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateralists, and 
the super-secret Bilderbergers."
<P>
If we want to save our country, William Gill advises, we must "stop the 
New World Order now -- before the Bilderbergers and other plotters have 
transferred the last vestiges of our sovereignty and independence to the 
United Nations via its subsidiary World Trade Organization." To protect 
American sovereignty, Gill's group, the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade, will soon file lawsuits seeking to nullify NAFTA and 
GATT.

<h2>
Good Business
</h2>

<i>The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the 
everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely 
recognized.</i>
<p>
"Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or 
social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even . . . to 
employ people," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic 
mission -- such as their employment practices, their participation in 
community or cultural life, or their waste management -- distracts us 
from the benefits that businesses confer on society." Writing in the 
August issue of Policy Review, Hood explains that businesses benefit 
society by inventing "new products, new services, new ways of doing 
business more efficiently. This they do better than other social 
institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such 
innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of 
governmental or charitable action."
<p>
Why do so many Americans fail to recognize the enormous contribution 
that businesses make to our individual and general welfare? The 
prejudice of the press and the demagoguery of Democrats deserve much 
of the blame. Hood argues that "journalists and politicians thrive on bad 
news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and 
women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring 
and compensation practices." In doing so, says Hood, they consciously or 
unconsciously ignore the fact that "business innovation historically has 
helped liberate American women. Technological advances have 
promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength 
and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are 
distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, 
labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more 
freedom to pursue education and employment."
<p>
Technological advances have also made the workplace safer, for both 
sexes. Hood notes that "automation and computers have improved 
workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union 
activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and 
devise solutions to systemic problems."
<p>
For reasons of their own, professional agitators "spend a lot of time 
talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive 
properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to 
consumers," Hood charges. He cites one of the more telling examples of 
anti-business bias. "Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being 
nonbiodegradable and polluting," he observes. "Yet, plastic is the 
essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our 
standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, 
wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers."
<p>
John Hood laments the fact that, "with few exceptions, those who create 
the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, 
healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity." He argues that "the real 
heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and 
overcome the fundamental problems of humanity."

August 1, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Positives Of Pesticides
</h2>

<i>As usual, the mass media have gotten the story completely backwards. 
Far from threatening our health, the pesticides that control bugs, rodents, 
and plant disease have proven to be a boon to mankind.</i>
<p>
"Pesticides are not scary; they're wonderful. They rank equal to 
pharmaceuticals in saving and extending life. They save the environment, 
they save wildlife, they give the American housewife a roach- and rat-
free home," contends Pat Tigges of the Pacific Northwest Aerial 
Application Education Foundation. Tigges says she is "sick and tired of 
agriculture being on the defensive. We don't have to defend; we should 
be on the offensive," she insists. "Crop production technology has made 
our quality of life the envy of the world."
<p>
Radical environmentalists are winning the propaganda war, however, 
primarily because they've been the only ones waging battle. "The focused 
concerns of a few will take precedence over the unfocused concerns of 
the majority," Tigges warns, unless farmers -- and the American 
consumers whose larders they fill with inexpensive, unspoiled food -- 
fight back. Of particular concern, she says, is "new EPA-recommended 
legislation that would phase out consideration of benefits when 
establishing food-use pesticide tolerances." The net effect would be to 
raise the cost of the food we eat, while lowering its quality.
<p>
"The 'pesticide scare' is not about pesticides," Tigges insists, "it's about 
fear and control." She charges that radical environmentalists "use 
pesticide misinformation to create fear, from which they create a crisis, 
and a crisis generates funds. These funds are not spent saving anything. 
They are spent furthering a political and social agenda. The pseudo-
environmentalist leaders don't want to solve problems. They love 
problems. Problems give them more press, create more fear, and gain 
them credibility and money."
<p>
Fear mongers capitalize on the agricultural ignorance of the average 
American, but that ignorance can be overcome. "We can fight fear in 
children with education," says Tigges. "Children are afraid of the 
unknown. Farm pesticides are an unknown," she observes, "but 
household pesticides are not." Tigges fights fear in children by showing 
them that farm chemicals are similar to "things they touch and use every 
day in their homes. They aren't afraid of mom's shower cleaner; they just 
don't know it's a fungicide. They aren't afraid of pool chlorine; they just 
don't know it's a bactericide."
<p>
It's not just children who are afraid, but their teachers too. That's where 
Pat Tigges and the Pacific Northwest Aerial Application Education 
Foundation come in. "We teach teachers the truth," she explains. "We 
refute all the lies and misinformation that, for the past 30 years, have 
been repeated so often they are taken as truth." The foundation offers 
"continuing education classes, teacher conferences, in-service workshops, 
and structured farm fairs." Tigges and her colleagues come prepared to 
discuss "the history of the environmental movement, man-made vs. 
'natural' biochemistry, organic farming, Alar, and anything else a class 
wants to talk about." They know that minds, like farmland, need to be 
cultivated.

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<font size=7>Conservatism can close<BR>
Dole's gender gap</font><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach.

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater
with an Aristotelian catharsis: There but for the grace of God and television
producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of
view, the children placed in front of that camera are abused children. We should
worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

<BODY>

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>

</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

<title>Fumento: New Gun Law Penalizes Cops - 1/8/97</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 8, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Cops Pay the Price for New Gun Law</h2><p>
<P>  
	Lt. Dale Barsness was truly one of Minneapolis's finest. A 28-year veteran of the police
force, he had just been promoted to head the homicide department. But now he may lose
everything, courtesy of our national lawmakers.
<P>
	A month before the election, Congress approved and President Clinton signed a law
proposed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D.-N.J.) forbidding anyone who has committed a misdemeanor 
act of domestic abuse from possessing a handgun.
<P>     
	In Barsness's case, the act in question (details are unknown) occurred back in 1991. He
pleaded guilty and served his punishment. Yet he is now on a six-month administrative leave
while the department decides whether it has any choice but to fire him.
<P>     
	If he loses his job, his ex-wife told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, "it hurts the people
who were hurt in the first place: his children and his ex-wife."  
<P>     
	Lautenberg and Clinton championed the bill as necessary to protect women, children, and
other living things, but it was essentially a ball of fluff--99.9 percent substance free. 
Already persons who commit domestic felonies are forced to turn in their guns, so by
definition the bill only targeted lesser offenders.
<P>     
	In support of the proposal, the White House cited a Justice Department figure that of 
the 1.7 million incidents of domestic violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  But
that comes out to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot or even
that bullets were fired. Considering that almost half of all Americans own guns, guns and
domestic violence hardly go hand in hand.
<P>
	But nobody in Congress had the guts to point this out, the law passed, and now it's 
time to pay the piper.  Officers across the country like Dale Barsness are doing the 
paying--as are the citizens that such police serve and protect.
<P>     
	Police departments are now scouring their files to see if any of their officers were
ever convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse--10 years ago, 20, 30, it doesn't matter. Once a
conviction is found, the officer may be fired or reassigned to a permanent desk job.
<P>     
	It hardly seems fair to take away a cop's livelihood because of something he did a
decade ago, even as the average time served for murder in this country is about six years. It is
even more unfair to slap him or her with penalties that were unforeseeable when the officer
pleaded guilty.
<P>      
	How would you feel if a new law mandated that the speeding ticket you pleaded guilty
to 15 years ago now results in your license being revoked, your car impounded, or your
first-born sold into slavery?  You might wish you'd gone to court and fought that ticket,
huh? Picture Bill Clinton saying: "Ah feel your pain--but it's too late, sucker!"    
<P>     
	The Constitution clearly forbids laws which make something a crime after the act has
already been committed.  But for some reason, penalties slapped on after a crime has been
committed is a shadier area. Thus, while the gun law may still be legal.
<P>     
	Further, though the law was billed as a crime-fighting measure, in practice it may
impact only crimefighters themselves. (It might also be applied to soldiers.)
<P>     
	"It's being unfairly applied to our people since we're the only ones with the capacity
to check our people and take our guns away," said Sgt. Bill Clayton, a Denver cop and head of
the Denver County Police Protection Association. "For us, it's the tools of the trade, like
taking a hammer away from a carpenter," he told me.   For other persons who have committed
past acts of misdemeanor abuse, he says, "There's just no way to enforce it."
<P>     
	Exactly. The new law can be used to take away guns from all persons convicted from now
on.  But even the most ardent gun-control advocates wouldn't dare call for making lists of
domestic abuse violators and systematically ransacking their homes looking for firearms--not
that the idea of it doesn't make them feel warm and tingly all over.
<P>     
	In Denver, two cops with 37 years' experience between them are in danger of losing
their jobs because of the new law. Meanwhile, Clayton points out, "In the state of Colorado, a
convicted felon can get a gun after ten years but if convicted of a misdemeanor domestic
abuse, you get a life sentence [preventing your from] carrying a gun."
<P>     
	"I don't know how they got this [law] through," said Barsness's ex-wife.  "I think
there were a million people sleeping."
<P>     
	Maybe, but the lawmakers were wide awake.  Clinton fervently backed the bill, and the
Senate twice voted for it by a margin of 97-2. House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave it his
explicit support.
<P>     
	This truly was a bipartisan act of cowardice and foolishness.</P>

<title>Fumento: Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation - 12/18/96</title>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 18, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation</h2><p>     
<P>
     They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.  For almost seven years
environmentalists have had to put up with people (like me) crying, "Remember Alar!" as
shorthand for bogus science and health scares. But now, they're striking back.
<P>
     For those who don't recall, the Alar scare began in February, 1989 when reporter Ed
Bradley began a 60 Minutes segment by calling Alar "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food
supply." Alar, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co., was sprayed on apples to keep them on
trees longer so that fewer would fall to the ground and rot before they could be picked.
<P>
     It was this substance that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) decided to
scapegoat to illustrate the horrors of man-made chemicals. The 60 Minutes segment was part
of a campaign by a PR firm the NRDC had hired, called Fenton Communications.  The rest of
the campaign consisted of helping reporters write scary articles, enlisting the support of
actress Meryl Streep, and creating an NRDC front group called Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits.
<P>
     In short order, terrified people were dumping their applesauce into the trash, apple
juice down the sink, and swearing off apples entirely for "healthier" foods.  (You know, like Hostess
Twinkies.) Soon Uniroyal felt it had no choice but to stop selling its product to apple
growers, some of whom then went bankrupt.
<P>
     In the ensuing months, though, articles, monographs, and even whole books by myself and
many others revealed that the NRDC-Fention effort was, as I put it, "one of the slickest,
most cynical fear campaigns in recent American history."  Few people dispute this nowadays,
and it drives the environmentalists bonkers.
<P>
          Thus author and long-time environmental doomsayer Paul Ehrlich, in his new book
<U>Betrayal of Science and Reason</U>, calls the Alar debunking a "fable." A recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review (CJR), published at the nation's most prestigious journalism school, was
entitled: "Myths," with the subtitle informing us "The Alar `Scare' Was Real."
<P>
     Their evidence, however, is embarrasingly flimsy and often downright false.  For one,
the NRDC and other environmental groups claim the EPA banned the chemical. CJR writer Elliot
Negin gives a date for the ban, saying the decision was "in late 1989." Ehrlich informs us
that three years late, "the EPA issued a statement reaffirming the sound scientific basis
for banning Alar."
<P>
     Sorry Charlies, but the EPA never banned it in the first place, much less reaffirming
any ban. Once Uniroyal withdrew the product for use by fruit growers, the EPA considered the issue
moot. Further, to this day Alar continues to be used on plants which don't produce food.
<P>
     A simple phone call to the EPA would have revealed this.  But apparently
environmentalist crusaders have better things to do with their time.
<P>
     Any other evidence?  Well, Negin makes much of the fact that Washington State apple
growers lost their suit against 60 Minutes alleging their products were wrongly disparaged.
<P>
     In the wake of the decision in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, such utter confidence
in the court system is truly touching.  But in any case, the courts didn't rule that Alar is
carcinogenic or evil or anything like that. They simply said the apple growers had failed to
meet the extremely high standards needed to win a suit against a media outlet.
<P>
     Finally, both Negin and Ehrlich and other revisionists remind us that both the EPA and
the International Agency for Research on Cancer had labeled Alar "a probable human carcinogen."
Neither writer points out that the studies these agencies had relied upon to make this
classification later proved to have been terribly sloppy. That's why the EPA had
commissioned several new ones. But the NRDC, rather than await the outcome, decided to
launch its scare campaign instead.
<P>
     Neither writer points out--nor do any other environmentalists--that all the evidence
against Alar was always based on the findings of tumors in mice, while the same doses of chemical
caused no tumors in rats. The EPA had simply arbitrarily decided that mice in this case were
a better surrogate for humans. Had the rats developed the tumors and not the mice, they
could well have decided that mice were the better surrogates.
<P>
     All of this is explained in detail in my book Science Under Siege.  Ehrlich, for one,
quotes from that book repeatedly, in an attempt to refute it.  But rather than meet its arguments
head on, he simply ignores them.
<P>
     This, alas, is all too typical of environmentalists.  Evidence that challenges their
world view is inadmissable to them. All that matters is that their myths live on forever. 
Alar-as-deadly-poison was a myth in the making that was cut off at the knees--and deservedly so.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:
<ul>
<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

<h2>
 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<title>Fumento: Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study - 8/15/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 15, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

<title>Fumento: The Great Black Church-burning Hoax - 7/11/96</title>

<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<title>Fumento: Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer - 7/5/96</title>

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

<title>Fumento: Bill Clinton Again Betrays the Vets - 6/6/96

<h2>
               Bill Clinton Again Betrays the Vets
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<h2>Men & Abortion</h2><p>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">
<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

<title>Howley:  The Catholic Church(es) in China</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<hr>
<h2>The Catholic Church(es) in China</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
 
Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<title>Old TV Makes A Comeback</title>

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqu scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<h3>Karen Kerrigan</h3>
<hr width="35%" size="3">
</center>
<blockquote>Karen Kerrigan is president of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC), a nationwide nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization fighting against unchecked government regulation and taxation on America's small business and entrepreneurial sector.  SBSC also works on efforts to reduce the size and scope of government, while promoting policies and reforms which foster economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan also serves as president of the Small Business Survival Foundation, a research and education organization that studies the impact of government policy on entrepreneurship and economic growth.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan is a nationally recognized spokesperson on tax and budget issues, government waste, regulation, grassroots organizing, political activism, coalition building and other political and policy issues relating to reforming government at the local, state and federal levels.  She is an experienced and sought after speaker for business, political and community functions, and has led scores of seminars and programs on effective grassroots organizing.
<P>
Under Ms. Kerrigan's leadership, SBSC is looked to by the media for unique and bottom-line commentary and analysis on a wide range of political and economic issues.  SBSC's work and commentary has been cited by <i>Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, The New York Times, National Journal, Business Week, Entrepreneur, Fortune Magazine, Bloomberg Business New, The Boston Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Michael Reagan Show</i> and hundreds of local newspapers and television news and radio programs nationwide.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan has gained increased prominence in the 104th Congress through her stewardship of SBSC.  She has taken the organization from a small regional organization to a dynamic national group impacting the policy debates inside the nation's capitol.  The organization's unwavering principled stand on tax, budget and other issues has set it above the traditional business lobby in Washington.  
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan was formerly national field director of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) and <a href="/govt-waste/">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> (CAGW).  She directed the Taxpayer's Action Network (TAN) -- one of the most powerful and effective grassroots projects in America dedicated to making elected officials and government more accountable to taxpayers.  Ms. Kerrigan has provided consultation to hundreds of national, state and local organization on effective organizing, including United We Stand America during their formation.
<P>
Prior to joining CCAGW, Ms. Kerrigan was director of state projects and director of development for Citizens for a Sound Economy and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation.  As national director of development for consultation and training for the National Easter Seal Society, she directed the national fundraising programs and affiliate training.  Prior to joining the national headquarters, she served in key development positions within the states of New York and Georgia. 
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan is a native of New York.  She holds a B.A. degree in Politcal Science from the State University of New York College at Cortland.

<TITLE>Kerrigan:  Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses -- SBSC</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<i>December 1995</i>

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<title>Kerrigan:  Balanced budget means bottom-line gains -- SBSC

<hr>
<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<title>Kerrigan:  Are union leader's tactics too divisive? -- SBSC
</title>

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan:  Why state health-care reforms are failing -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<h2>Why state health-care reforms are failing</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center><hr><P>
 While President and Mrs. Clinton appear to have
put aside their interest in the nation's so-called &quot;health-care
crisis&quot; for now, the issue has not gone away - especially
for small businesses and entrepreneurs struggling to purchase
insurance for themselves and their employees.
<P>
Washington terms such as &quot;employer mandates&quot; &quot;community
rating&quot; and &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; have suddenly become
staple household vocabulary due to television commercials and
radio talk show hosts.  Ad ideological clashes still exist on
how to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
<P>
The Clinton plan modeled previously enacted state-based reforms
to achieve universal coverage.  Opposing sides of the debate have
each provided their own analysis of what would occur upon implementation
of the state reforms on a national scale.
<P>
According to Clinton plan advocates, health-care heaven-on-earth
would ensue, while critics have claimed a massive case of the
health-care horrors.
<P>
With the passing of another year, though, the results of these
state reforms have become much clearer.  The reforms included
in the Clinton plan have produced distorted consequences for both
policy holders and insurance companies.
<P>
Experts point to two very specific reforms that have caused headaches
for state legislators and governors who believed making everyone
pay the same insurance rates, and letting consumers get insurance
whenever they needed, was sound public policy.
<P>
Community rating and guaranteed issue became the foundation of
these now-failing reforms.  Pure community rating requires that
everyone pay the same premiums for health insurance regardless
of their age or health risks.  So a healthy 28-year-old pays the
same rate as a 58-year-old smoker.
<P>
For most younger people, who have fewer health risks, logical
economic decision-making forces them to drop coverage.  The massive
decrease in policy holders, especially healthy ones, has driven
companies to jack their rates even higher, causing additional
budget-wary consumers to drop insurance.
<P>
Guaranteed issue essentially requires insurance companies to supply
health insurance to all individuals no matter what their medical
disposition at the time.  Under this scenario, the incentive for
individuals to avoid paying for health insurance until they are
confronted with a serious medical problem are clear.
<P>
The increased costs for insurers are substantial and obviously
passed along to consumers in terms of either higher insurance
rates of fewer insurance choices.
<P>
States have not found the promised utopian effect from these reforms.
 Instead, thousands are dropping their health-care plans altogether
because of skyrocketing premium rates.  In effect, fewer people
have health-care insurance and fewer are in the market to purchase
policies because of high rates as well as the incentive to buy
insurance only when needed.
<P>
States now find that health-care accessibility and affordability
problems have become far worse, not better.  For example:
<UL>
<LI> New York imposed community rating on the small and individual
insurance market in 1993.  Since then, several major insurers
simply stopped serving the market altogether, and by some estimates
more than 500,000 New Yorkers dropped their coverage due to skyrocketing
costs.    
</UL>

<P>
The New York Department of Insurance reported that in some cases,
rates for a single, 30-year-old male increased by 170 percent.
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, New Jersey passed guaranteed issue and a phase-in
to pure community rating by 1997.  This summer, more than 100,000
New Jersey also mandates that anyone who wants insurance must
buy one of five state-designated plans.
<LI>In Vermont, The Burlington Free Press is calling for the repeal
of health-care reform enacted several years ago, which included
community rating and guaranteed issue, and prohibited individual
insurers from charging healthy people low rates.
</UL>


<P>
Now, these 7,500 healthy Vermonters who thought they were part
of a safety net are getting hit with a 60 percent rate increase
from Blue Cross.  The result?  They can't afford their health-care
plans so they are hoping state taxpayers will pick up the tab.
<P>
Not all groups appear to be sold on the negative consequences
of such mandates.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
for example, is crafting model state legislation that advances
the implementation of these failed reforms.  According to a recent
draft of the legislation (called the Small Employer and Individual
Health Insurance Availability Act), community rating and guaranteed
issue will be a part of the model act that is supposed to provide
guidance to states.
<P>
Interestingly, the NAIC's draft bill notes that &quot;this act
is not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem
of affordability of health care or health insurance.&quot;
<P>
In the state of Washington, the legislature repealed an entire
health-care reform act due to the market perversions and impact
it had on state policy holders and taxpayers.
<P>
In other states, market-based reforms such as medical savings
accounts - which allow smaller enterprises to pool for insurance
purchases - and state risk pools to capture those who may be uninsured
are the wave of the future.  To date, 30 states have adopted state
risk pools, and 15 have enacted medical savings account legislation.
<P>
Even Washington, D.C., has gotten the message - no heavy-handed
reform bills coming from this Congress.  The primary reform measures
coming from the new Congress are medical savings accounts, purchasing
pools for small employers and the self-employed, the move toward
tax equity for entrepreneurs to allow laid-off employees to keep
their insurance.
<P>
Elected officials at both the state and national level appear
to be listening to their constituents and those who favor market-based
solutions in health-care reform.  But one wonders, will the NAIC
actually have an audience when it comes to presenting its solutions
- after it's finalized the model bill for making health-care more
&quot;available?&quot;

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.

<title>SBB:  Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</title>

<h2>Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</h2>
                                                     </center>
<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

some very old advice</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Ooooooooohh, does Bob Dole -- the real Bob Dole, not the prettied-up Bob Dole -- make the bimbos mad.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's too soon to know which Bob Dole we'll get by November, because some of his handlers, in the Nice Republican tradition, yearn for the applause of the aging liberals in the media.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Some others, on the other hand, understand that the ground across America has shifted. Some of the Nice Republicans think this is because they've got something on the bottom of their shoes, and the others understand the earthquake rumbling beneath their feet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Nice Republicans take their cues from The Washington Post, which they, like a lot of Washington, despise for its deceit and arrogance but nevertheless take their cues from it. Ignoring The Post is as difficult as ignoring the stink of a dead skunk under your bedroom window. It takes a stronger stomach than a lot of people were born with.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So these Nice Republicans trembled on cue because Mr. Dole rebuked NBC-TV's Katie Couric for her adversarial scolding of Mr. Dole for his not joining the crusade against tobacco.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Instead," reported The Post July 4 on Page One, "the former Kansas senator, who volunteered his doubts about the addictiveness of cigarette smoking during a tour of tobacco-producing Kentucky almost three weeks ago, has continued to wage war with the news media on the issue" (italics mine).<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Wage war with the news media?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why, you might ask, would the news media -- news media being journalogical jargon for "reporters" -- be waging a war against a candidate for president of the United States in the first place? Don't the "news media" advertise themselves as neutral in these disputes? Odd that you should ask.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Post's description of the parties in the dispute tells you even more about media neutrality: The candidate is "old Dole," who is the "picture of frustration," picking on Miss Couric, "a popular anchorwoman known for her perky image and big smile." <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The description of Miss Couric is accurate enough as far as it goes, and fairly daring for the politically correct Post, because this is the shorthand of aging white guys, their lechery showing, for "the perky boobs, blond hair and empty head that are the requisites for network-news pinups."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But it's not that Mr. Dole, treating Miss Couric with the respect that feminists say they despair of getting from old white guys like Mr. Dole, was picking on a little lady who merely parrots in a silkier voice what she hears the boys say. This is exactly how George Bush gobbled up Dan Rather for breakfast in a famous interview in 1988, which was grudgingly applauded even by the media notabilities who didn't like him, and the only difference between Mr. Rather and Miss Couric is that Katie is prettier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole, too bad for him, challenges a doctrine of media theology. Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

morning</FONT></center><BR><DD>Suppose you're Bob Dole and you wake up on a Monday morning in
August, pick up The Washington Post (the quickest way to ruin your day), and there on the front
page is more bad news:<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has just been indicted for mopery, Hillary is a
fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"><BR><font size=7>A familiar odor from<BR>
the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<p><font size=7>Trying to beat nothing<BR>
with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>The limited hangout at the White House</FONT></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing makes Bill Clinton and Miss Hillary and their friends jump quite like barking the words "Nixon" and "Watergate" at them, in the manner of thrusting a cross in the face of Count Dracula.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Like the count, they quail.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>You can almost see the beads of perspiration breaking out in the hollow of Miss Hillary's pretty throat, and the president reddens like a schoolboy caught with a hot book hidden between the covers of his geography text.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's no sign yet of the ghost of Richard Nixon, but he can't be pleased by the comparison, either. Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Learning lessons,<BR>all of them wrong
</FONT></center>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>When Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the president of the
Confederacy on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery, he and the occasion were
acclaimed as the time and place where "the man and the hour have met."<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We may be on the scene of
another occasion when the planets align themselves with reckless abandon and
God throws down the stars in a fit of divine disgust. Bill Clinton, the man, and
the nation, in an hour of disarray, have met.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Disaster followed Davis, and disaster is no doubt
stalking us, too. Billy Graham said it best the other day when he came to
Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom: "... the greatest nation in history
stands on the brink of self-destruction."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The signs of unraveling are certainly all about. The chief of
the Navy, having presided over the emasculation of the greatest sea service in
the history of man (presuming Atlantis had nothing better), shoots himself in the
chest, which almost anyone's elderly aunts, armed with their modest knowledge
of firearms, could have told him was not the way to do it. He was afraid someone
might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"

senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""

good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim

the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""

lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>

<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<title>Rockwell: The Republican Mixed Economy -- 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<h2>The Republican Mixed Economy</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<title>Rockwell: Conservatives and Vouchers -- 7/22/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<title>Rockwell:  The Politics of Church Fires -- 6/17/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<title>Rockwell: "Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry -- 5/08/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>
</head>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.
<P>

<title>Schatz:  Finders Keepers -- 12/21/95</title>

<h2>Finders Keepers</h2>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 

  
  
Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<title>Schatz:  No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</title>

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<title>Schlafly: Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention  -- 8/1/96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<i>August 1, 1996</i>
<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Phonics Boom  -- 6/20/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 20, 1996</i><h2>                        
Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.

These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2>

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized  
classes, and university teaching positions. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is  
reflected and taught in academia through relativism, positivism, and humanism. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).

deducted from the  worker's wages. In this case, the median income for  a family

taxes brings the gross family income to $56,608.

<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.

<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>	The Administration's $300perchild 
credit begins phasing out for families with  incomes above $60,000 and reaches
zero at $75,000  in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per
child after 1998.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="9">9</A></B></TT>	For taxpayers filing jointly with 
incomes above $110,000, the credit phases out at a  rate of $25 for each $1,000
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out  at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS WON THE BUDGET WAR </h3>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Comparing this Congress with Clinton's and Reagan's Selected Spending Cuts
<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<P>
<DD>
The Clinton Administration claims that a declining foreign affairs budget is threatening the ability of the United States to conduct foreign policy. Referring to Congress's attempts to curb wasteful government spending, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his successor, Madeleine Albright, have stated that budget cuts have forced the closure of overseas embassies and other diplomatic offices.<SUP>1</SUP>  To deal with this alleged threat to U.S. diplomacy, the Clinton Administration is calling for increased spending in the foreign affairs budget, which includes funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, foreign aid programs, and international institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations.

<P>
<DD>
Secretaries Christopher and Albright are right to want a robust overseas diplomatic presence. Indeed, ensuring that the ability of the United States to conduct foreign affairs is unhindered should be a concern of every Administration. Christopher and Albright are raising a false alarm, however, about cuts in the foreign affairs budget. Funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic programs is higher in real terms today than it was during most of the 1980s, in the time of the Cold War. In fact, current funding has remained fairly stable for the past few years and is greater than levels in 1991 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
If more funding for embassies is needed because of pressing demands -- like the need to open and operate new embassies in the early 1990s in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union -- then there is plenty of money in wasteful and ineffective economic development aid and other non-essential accounts to cover the cost of these new operations. In short, there is no need for an increase in the overall foreign affairs budget.

<P>
<B>THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUDGET</B>

<P>
<DD>
Secretary Christopher claims that "spending on international affairs has been slashed by 50 percent [since 1985]."  He also insists that these "budget cuts have forced us to close over two dozen consulates and several embassies."<SUP>2</SUP>  The solution he advocates is the Administration's proposal to increase the overall foreign affairs budget to $19.3 billion in FY 1998, an increase of $1.2 billion.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Real increases.</B> Christopher's assessment that the overall foreign affairs budget has decreased in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985 is accurate. Close examination of the programs within the foreign affairs budget, however, reveals that embassies and consulates have not borne the brunt of reductions in the foreign affairs budget. In fact, funding for embassies and consulates has increased by 13 percent in real terms since 1985.<SUP>3</SUP>  Other diplomatic activities, such as student exchanges and public diplomacy, have seen only minor fluctuations in funding since 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).<SUP>4</SUP> 

<P>
<DD>
In addition, the State Department also has seen a sharp increase in its budget. For example, current funding for the State Department, once it is adjusted for inflation, is over 25 percent higher than it was in 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c2.gif">Chart 2</A>). In fact, spending in real terms for the State Department has risen steadily since 1987, peaking in 1994 and experiencing only a slight decline since then. Despite this drop, current funding for the State Department remains well above Cold War levels in the 1980s. This situation is a far cry from the budget "hemorrhaging" described by Christopher.<SUP>5</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Where are the cuts?</B> The foreign affairs budget includes funding for many diplomatic activities and programs. In addition to spending for U.S. embassies and consulates, it supports numerous international organizations, development aid, security assistance, and export financing. In fact, non-embassy spending accounts for approximately 70 percent of the entire foreign affairs budget. Although expenditures on diplomatic programs within the State Department have risen steadily, spending on international financial programs and foreign aid has dropped.<SUP>6</SUP>  Reductions in development aid, security aid, and international financial programs -- not cuts in direct diplomatic funding -- are primarily responsible for the overall reduction in the foreign affairs budget (see <A HREF="bg1102c3.gif">Chart 3</A>).

<P>
<DD>
It is true that increasing demands were placed on the State Department immediately at the end of the Cold War. The dissolution of the Soviet Union required the establishment of a number of new embassies and consulates. The startup costs for these offices, such as purchasing or constructing buildings, mandated increased funding. Congress recognized this need and increased funding appropriately. This spending increase is apparent in the Conduct of Foreign Affairs budget from 1992 to 1994 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
The initial costs of establishing these embassies and consulates passed long ago, however. It is unlikely that expenses for embassies and consulates should far outstrip the funding requirements in 1991, which were higher than during most of the 1980s. Funding for embassies and consulates has remained stable for the past three budgets. No cries of critical funding shortages were heard until recently. Therefore, the claim that the relatively modest reductions in funding since 1994 have caused the closure of embassies and consulates is disingenuous.
<P>

<B>THE FAILED LEGACY OF FOREIGN AID PROGRAMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
Instead of seeking to increase funding for the foreign affairs budget, the Clinton Administration should look to eliminate the numerous programs within the foreign affairs budget that are wasteful. The most likely candidate for elimination is economic development aid. Policymakers long have recognized that foreign aid programs are among the most inefficient and wasteful funded by the federal government. The Hamilton-Gilman Task Force Report of 1989, the <I>State 2000: A New Model for Managing Foreign Affairs</I> State Department report of 1992, and even Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" initiative concluded that U.S. foreign aid programs are in dire need of reform. These conclusions led Secretary Christopher to recommend in 1995 that the Agency for International Development (AID) be abolished and its activities merged with those of the State Department.

<P>
<DD>
Why eliminate economic development assistance?  The answer is clear: It does more harm than good to fragile, less-developed economies. For example, of the 66 less-developed countries that have received loans from the World Bank for longer than 25 years, 37 are no better off today than they were before they received those loans. Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are poorer than they were before receiving the loans.<SUP>7</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Neither does foreign aid necessarily advance U.S. interests abroad. In fact, most U.S. foreign aid goes to countries that frequently oppose U.S. interests. For example, two of every three recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote against the United States in the U.N. a majority of the time.<SUP>8</SUP>  If the Clinton Administration and Congress need to find foreign affairs items to cut, AID and economic development aid programs clearly are the best candidates.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>The United States needs to have a strong diplomatic overseas presence. Congress and the Clinton Administration should work to ensure that U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic activities are fully funded. But there is no need to increase the foreign affairs budget to keep these embassies open. More than enough funding would be available if the Agency for International Development were abolished and economic development aid ended. Savings from these cuts could be applied to embassy activities, if needed. Secretaries Christopher and Albright were correct to be concerned about funding U.S. diplomatic activities. But they were wrong in thinking that increasing the foreign affairs budget is the only way to achieve this goal.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within the next few weeks, the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to achieve genuine reform of transportation policy. But <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.00729:">S. 729</a>, a bill that would remove the transportation trust funds from the budget and from meaningful congressional oversight, is flawed and would not lead to needed reform. A preferable alternative would be legislative proposals now being prepared in the Senate that would return the highway programs to the states and allow them to collect the existing fuel tax and use it to finance transportation projects of their choosing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsored by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Max Baucus (D-MT), the Trust Fund Restoration Act of 1995 (S. 729) would give federal highway spending budgetary exemptions and protections that even Social Security does not now have.<sup>1</sup>  Thus enactment of S. 729 would be a missed opportunity for the Senate to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy. At a time when transportation problems increasingly are local in nature, today's centrally directed Eisenhower-era program offers no solutions. S. 729 would do nothing to alter that deficiency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House version of the bill (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.00842:">H.R. 842</a> -- surprisingly entitled the Truth in Budgeting Act) passed the House this April. But many of those who voted for it did so in the belief that the bill would die, or at least be purged of its worst excesses, in the Senate. Unfortunately, they and the taxpayers may be very disappointed, because the process in the Senate is beginning to look like a scramble by special interests to obtain additional budgetary privileges. Already legislation has been introduced in the Senate (S.1395), sponsored by Senator William Roth (R-DE), to turn Amtrak into an entitlement by creating for it the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. The Fund would be financed by diverting 0.5 cents of the 18.4 cents now collected by the federal fuel tax for the other transportation trust funds. That such a tax could be proposed to finance one of the government's more questionable activities reflects the growing aggressiveness of taxpayer-dependent industries as they try to place a lock on the public's money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The enactment of S. 729 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Budget Committee, the governors, and reformers in the House and Senate to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.
<P>
<b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH S. 729</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Trust Fund Restoration Act (S. 729) would exempt all of the transportation trust funds from all of the key control provisions of the congressional budget process. These include budget caps that limit discretionary budget authority and outlays, pay-as-you-go rules, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration, and any other statutory budget limitations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsors contend that the special budgetary privileges S. 729 would grant are essential to protect federal highway and other transportation spending from congressional budget cutters who might want to divert the $20 billion-plus in revenues raised by the federal fuel tax to deficit reduction or to other programs. But insulating the trust fund from budget scrutiny would make it more difficult for Congress to set clear budget priorities. Moreover, experience demonstrates that the risk of a congressional diversion of trust fund money to other purposes is overstated. In fact, federal highway programs have benefited from federal spending well in excess of the dedicated fuel tax receipts allocated to the trust fund. Since 1957, total federal spending on highways has exceeded highway trust fund receipts by more than $37 billion, making the diversion of highway revenues to other programs unlikely. <a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a year-by-year analysis of highway receipts and spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enactment of the bill would set back the prospects for transportation reform, regional equity, and honest budgeting. With the highway trust fund moved off budget, highway spending would be given preferential treatment and, unlike other programs, would be absolved from making any sacrifices in order to achieve fiscal restraint and a robust economy. Specifically:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would make it more difficult to achieve sound public finance decisions because it would allow lawmakers to avoid hard budget choices. Lawmakers should have to decide whether pork-barrel highway spending should be more important than spending for national security or programs targeted to the needy and disabled. The legislation would allow them to avoid making such choices in the case of highway spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is left of the federal budget would understate federal spending and taxes. By essentially removing highway funding from the normal presentation of the budget, the legislation would understate the size of the federal government. In FY 1996, some $302 billion, or 19.2 percent of spending, was already off-budget. S. 729 would add another $30 billion-$35 billion to that figure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Highway programs would be removed from ongoing congressional oversight, and the outdated and inequitable allocation of pay-in and pay-out by the states would be preserved. In the current allocation scheme, the 27 donor states that subsidize the 23 recipient states (and the District of Columbia) would remain unchanged. <a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a> presents the states by gain or loss, with several states such as Florida, Georgia, and Kentucky receiving from the trust fund less than three-quarters of the share paid in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The highway program would be exempted from the budget's discretionary spending caps. This would reduce the annual appropriations process for transportation programs to an empty exercise because any actions taken would not count for purposes of budget scorekeeping or deficit reduction. Furthermore, this diminished congressional oversight would take away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s, and would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant, or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve it, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to effect needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This final point is critical. Enactment of S. 729 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed, and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
<b>AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rather than weaken the oversight of highway programs and insulate them from budget review, the Senate should be seeking ways to devolve those programs to the states, where local taxpayers and elected officials can better determine how to get full value for the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states). The Coalition plan would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. But more comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or politically influentialspecial interests.<sup>2</sup>  The Mack plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system and would limit the federal fuel tax to the revenues needed to meet this specific objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Devolution of highway funding to the states is long overdue. Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The federal mandates that accompany money from Washington mean that narrow yet influential constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit enormously at huge cost to taxpayers.<sup>3</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a threat to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget. The Senate should not bow to this pressure. Instead, it should craft legislation that continues oversight and budget control, and begins the transfer to the states of responsibility for highways and the finances to pay for them.

This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apples-and-oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues but that it received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold type are donor states.

Within the next few days, the 104th Congress will decide whether it will attempt to reform transportation policy or whether it will permanently preserve the status quo. The mistitled <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?c104:./temp/~c10421OA::">Truth in Budgeting Act (H.R. 842)</a>, which would move the highway trust fund off budget, would be a missed opportunity for Congress to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy.

Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Senate, the states, the House Budget Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Energy -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1061<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> was created as a Cabinet-level department in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter as part of the federal effort to address the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Fearing that international energy shortages were the wave of the future, the President felt a highly visible national agency was necessary to promote energy conservation, control federal supplies of power, and develop alternative sources of energy. However, the OPEC oil embargo then collapsed -- without any assistance from the DOE -- and international oil supplies stabilized. 
<p>
And yet, the department remains. In fact, DOE has grown in tax dollars spent and functions performed -- the result of 15 years of searching for something to do. As Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office has testified, "DOE's mission and priorities have changed dramatically over time so that the Department is now very different from what it was in 1977. While energy research, conservation and policy-making dominated early DOE priorities, weapons production and now environmental cleanup overshadow its budget."<sup>1</sup>  Thanks to this continual empire-building, the department's budget has increased by 235 percent, and 85 percent today is spent on activities other than energy resources. For instance, nearly $12 billion is budgeted annually for environmental quality and nuclear waste disposal, with close to another $3 billion earmarked for fundamental science research.
<p>
The Department of Energy not only has strayed from its original mission of energy oversight, but also has failed to conduct efficiently the services it now provides. Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review reported that due to inefficiencies as high as 40 percent within DOE's Environmental Management program, more than $70 billion could be lost over the next 30 years.<sup>2</sup>  Victor Rezendes testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management... to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight.... "<sup>3</sup>. These management problems and the inefficiencies that flow from them have been caused largely by DOE's continual efforts to re-align itself and justify its existence.<p>It is time to close the Department of Energy. Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) have developed legislation that would dismantle the department.<sup>4</sup>  Title I of both bills redesignates the Department of Energy as the "Energy Programs Resolution Agency," modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. Both bills would establish a three-year limit for closing DOE, privatize Energy's valuable oil reserves and other assets, establish a commission to recommend DOE laboratory privatizations, set new guidelines for toxic waste disposal, and transfer control over the nuclear weapons stockpile to the Department of Defense.
<p>
Under a plan developed by analysts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, DOE's defense-related programs would be transferred to an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and its primary research functions would be transferred to universities or the National Science Foundation.<sup>5</sup>  Federal funding for commercially oriented energy supply, research, and development projects would be terminated, and the research responsibility would be transferred to the private sector. All commercial energy functions, including the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), Petroleum Reserves, and Uranium Enrichment activities, would be denationalized and sold to the private sector.
<p>
Specifically, under the Heritage Plan, Congress would:
<p><ul>
<li> Transfer all defense-related nuclear weapons functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. This new agency would have primary management and oversight responsibility for environmental cleanup activities.
<p>
<li> Decrease the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.em.doe.gov">environmental management</a> budget by 30 percent and adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
<p>
<li> Establish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as a federal corporation with the ultimate goal of full privatization.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Supply Research and Development programs and privatize the government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Conservation funding, including state grants and research programs.
<p>
<li> Phase out federal funding for General Science and Basic Research and transfer the laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them.
<p>
<li> Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the five Power Marketing Administrations to the private sector, using a variety of stock sale approaches.

<li> Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency.
<p>
<li> Close down or privatize the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a>.
</ul><p>
Closing the department and making the related reforms would save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five years, including $16 billion in asset sales. By contrast, Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "re-invention" plan would save only $14.1 billion over five years, including $5.7 billion in asset sales. The proposals to close the department developed by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would save more than $17 billion over five years.
<p>
There are two ways to close down a federal department. The first is simply to shift the department's responsibilities to other agencies and throw the old letterhead into the trash. The alternative is to eliminate, devolve, or privatize responsibilities whenever possible, and transfer only essential responsibilities to other departments. This latter approach is the one that should be used with the Department of Energy. DOE's history of failure and ineffectiveness demands nothing less.

<p>
<b>CHANGING MISSIONS AND BUREAUCRATIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
Created in 1977, the Department of Energy has changed missions numerous times over its almost two decades. Its original mission -- administering the complex set of regulations, price controls, and allocation laws established in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 -- was a dismal failure that actually resulted in higher energy costs and increased dependence on foreign oil.<sup>6</sup><p>Ronald Reagan promised during his 1980 campaign to eliminate the Department of Energy. Instead, he changed its mission from energy conservation, imposed through a centralized structure of regulations, to energy promotion by means of market mechanisms. The department also gained responsibility for the production of nuclear weapons during the 1980s because of a belief that production and stockpile management should be controlled by a civilian agency.
<p>
DOE's central mission changed once again with the end of the Cold War. The high level of weapons production was no longer necessary, and world energy supplies remained constant. Ever vigilant about finding a purpose, DOE began to concentrate on environmental remediation of past actions, including cleaning up its own contaminated weapons facilities. DOE's fiscal 1996 budget request makes this change in mission clear. Thirty-nine percent of the $17.8 billion budget request is earmarked for "Environmental Quality," while only 15 percent is for "Energy Resources."<sup>7</sup>  Another large portion of Energy's budget is dedicated to research and development of alternative-source energy supply, including solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power generation (see <a href="bg1061c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Despite this massive effort, petroleum and coal remain the dominant sources of power in America.
<p>
DOE's newest initiative, the fourth change in mission, is the creation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). These "agreements" are contracts whereby the Department of Energy allows individual companies to use federal laboratories, and even conducts research and development, all at taxpayer expense. CRADAs are meant to increase the competitiveness of American companies and support quality jobs at a time when much of the defense-related work completed at DOE's laboratories in the past is no longer seen as necessary. CRADAs thus offer the dual advantage of providing private companies with free research while preventing the closing of federal facilities -- or so proponents argue.
<p>
The Department of Energy's CRADA initiatives are among the most egregious examples of corporate welfare that benefits individual companies at tremendous expense to American taxpayers. According to a recent series on "High-Tech Handouts" in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, researchers who once worked for a private company are now employed by DOE but continue to do the same work. The only thing that has changed is that taxpayers are picking up the tab.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, when this research is successful, individual companies can earn protected trade secrets or patents that often are not available even to the federal government. Millions of American taxpayers thus may be underwriting a single company's market position. <p> The results of most efforts are both disappointing and expensive. For example, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> notes that DOE has spent some $792 million on CRADAs between 1992 and 1995. The result has been 46 new companies at a cost of $17 million per company.<sup>9</sup>  Even more disappointing, many recipients of DOE assistance are reducing their research and development budgets and trimming their workforces. General Electric, which earned $4.7 billion in profits in 1994, received $25.4 million in federal assistance between 1990 and 1994. Over the same period, GE cut 80,000 positions from its payroll. Clearly, DOE's CRADA program is not meeting its stated goal of job creation.
<p>

<b>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<p>
There is no legitimate rationale for a Department of Energy. Centralized planning of energy production and distribution, including operation of the Power Marketing Administrations, has proven ineffective and expensive. Mass-scale nuclear weapons production is no longer needed with the end of the Cold War. Environmental remediation efforts have been inefficient and often impractical. And efforts to bolster private industry through CRADAs are expensive, ineffective, and fast becoming a primary source of congressional earmarking and corporate welfare. All defense-related functions now being administered by DOE, including environmental remediation, should be transferred to the Department of Defense. All assets that are commercially viable should be privatized. Whatever remains should be terminated (see Table 1).
<p>
<b>Environmental Cleanup</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy was responsible for the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and the pressure of competing with the Soviet Union prevented environmental protection from being a top priority at weapons production facilities. Today, although production has ceased, the environmental remediation of DOE's facilities remains. The vast majority of contamination problems at the department's nuclear weapons plants involve some level of radioactivity. Since 1989, the department has managed, stored, and cleaned up hazardous wastes produced at the plants under the Environmental Management (EM) program, which has three basic components:  Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, and Facility Transition and Management (created in 1992).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Move the Department of Energy's environmental management responsibilities to a new independent agency within the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li>Adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Since its inception in 1989, DOE's Environmental Management program has almost quadrupled its budget to a fiscal 1996 request of $6.6 billion. The General Accounting Office estimates that the total cost of remediation at federal nuclear waste disposal sites will run as high as $200 billion.<sup>10</sup>  However, given DOE's poor performance in the past, this could be only a fraction of the eventual total. DOE also should re-evaluate its original goals and strategies for dealing with this problem. This is not to imply that contamination of these sites is insignificant. To the contrary, the amount of radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex is so great that more effective action is absolutely essential.
<p>
The Environmental Management program was supposed to clean up all sites within 30 years. Agreements signed by DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulatory agencies specify requirements and set milestones for achieving those requirements. Unfortunately, however, the costs of cleanup have escalated rapidly, breakthroughs in technology have not occurred at the pace originally estimated, and the nature and scope of the contamination problem simply are not known. "As a result," notes the General Accounting Office, these cleanup "agreements taken together do not reflect a national strategy of targeting resources based on the highest risks to human health and the environment."<sup>11</sup>  It is now clear that DOE will not be able to clean up the sites either within the 30-year time frame or any time soon thereafter.<p>Much of the problem lies with the assumptions that were made in setting these goals. The focus has been on timelines for reducing contamination rather than on the more sensible goal of reducing risk to human health and safety to the maximum extent possible for any given level of funding. This "biggest bang for the buck" approach would save far more lives at far less cost. For instance, if a site poses little threat to the local population, it may be better to delay cleanup until it becomes a higher priority. This would allow funds to be spent on sites that pose a more likely threat. Additionally, since the value of money is a function of time (how far in the future it is spent), cleanups would cost relatively less in the future -- especially if new technologies are invented. Alternative strategies such as land use controls also might encourage more effective cleanup decisions.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills contain solid provisions for prioritizing remediation actions at the various contamination sites. First they would transfer cleanup responsibilities to a civilian office within the Department of Defense. Then clear goals for reducing overall risks to public health would be adopted to ensure that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first. These sensible reorganization and prioritization plans would ensure an efficient yet effective process of remediation.
<p>
<b>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</b>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is charged with constructing a permanent repository for the nuclear waste generated at civilian nuclear power plants. In the past, this material has been stored "on-site."  Realizing the danger to residents of surrounding areas, Congress in 1982 passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which mandated the construction of a single storage site that could hold all of the nation's nuclear waste beginning in 1998.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Reconstitute OCRWM as a mixed government-private corporation as a first step toward full privatization.<sup>12</sup><p><li>Redefine the new corporation's mission to concentrate on interim rather than permanent storage.<p><li>Establish concrete goals leading to the commencement of storage in 1998.<p></ul>Rationale:  The Department of Energy's efforts to create a safe and permanent repository have been dismal from the start. DOE has spent more than $4 billion just to study the viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada and estimates that another $2.3 billion will be necessary over the next 15 years. The construction, maintenance, and operation of the future repository will cost an estimated $30 billion. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office now estimates that storage cannot begin until 2023.<sup>13</sup>  In other words, for every year OCRWM has been in existence, it has fallen a year behind schedule.
<p>
These inefficiencies are attributable primarily to two factors. First, the National Waste Policy Act specifically requires the permanent, rather than temporary, storage of nuclear wastes. This has added great costs to the investigation process and will add even more to the future cost of storage and maintenance. Several proposals over the years, including Senator Grams's legislation and this year's House-passed appropriations bill, require the federal government to consider interim storage.<sup>14</sup>  This would allow storage and waste consolidation to begin in the near future. It also would allow for more detailed research and development into viable options for permanent storage.<p>Second, the program's organizational structure reflects many of the inefficiencies that haunt the Department of Energy in general:  excessively high expenses, scheduling lapses, poor contractor management, and a politically charged environment. Numerous studies over the past decade have commented on these problems and suggested that their cause is OCRWM's position within the Department of Energy. As early as 1984, only two years after the office was created, a report to the Secretary of Energy found that "Location of OCRWM within the Department of Energy makes it vulnerable to changes of policy and senior management as Administrations come and go."<sup>15</sup>  Studies generally have suggested that OCRWM be moved out of the Department of Energy and given the freedom to operate without political constraints.<sup>16 </sup><p>It is widely felt that the dangers presented by the transportation and storage of nuclear waste justify both stringent federal oversight of OCRWM and the timely and cost-effective construction of a nuclear waste repository. In the short term, both goals can be accomplished by creating a mixed government-private corporation. Such an organization would retain government oversight to ensure safety while allowing for efficiencies associated with private-sector incentives. In the long run, full privatization w
ill encourage the most efficient waste disposal by eliminating government interference in day-to-day operations. Safety standards could still be enforced through stringent congressional oversight.
<p>
Neither congressional proposal addresses the future of OCRWM privatization. Instead, control over civilian nuclear waste disposal is given to the Army Corps of Engineers. Given the long history of failure within the Army Corps,<sup>17</sup> it is disturbing that both Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would give it such a sensitive responsibility. It also does not seem likely that simply transferring its responsibilities to another government organization will solve the office's structural deficiencies.
<p>
High-Energy Science Research<sup>18</sup><br>The Department of Energy spends over $1.1 billion per year on basic research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and other general science programs. Many of these projects, such as the recently terminated <a href="http://www.ssc.gov">Superconducting Super Collider</a>, are considered "big science" because they require large and expensive facilities and teams of researchers.
<p>
The department owns nearly 30 research facilities around the country, nearly all of them managed and operated under contract by universities and private organizations. Of these facilities, 17 direct most of their programming to basic science and technology, high-energy physics, or nuclear physics research. Five are multi-program laboratories like <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne</a> near Chicago; <a href="http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/bnl.html">Brookhaven</a> in Upton, New York; and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore</a> in Berkeley, California. Another 12 are specialized, or "program-dedicated."  These include Fermilab near Chicago; the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> near Stanford, California; and the Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (formerly known as the Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences) at the University of California at Los Angeles.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Phase out over three years all federal funding for general science and basic research.
<p>
<li>Transfer the federal laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them or sell them to private-sector operators. 
<p>
<li>Shift any remaining funding for basic research to the National Science Foundation. 
<p>
<li>Award all funds based on competitive bids.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Many of the laboratories now owned by the Department of Energy were established during World War II in conjunction with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the world's first atomic bomb. Since then, they have "expanded their missions to encompass civilian research and development in many disciplines -- from high-energy physics to advanced computing," reports the GAO; but because of DOE mismanagement, "the multi-program laboratories -- both individually and as a group -- do not have either clearly defined missions or specific implementation strategies that bring together laboratory resources to focus on accomplishing departmental objectives or national goals."<sup>19</sup>  With no defined mission, other analysts report, these laboratories often compete directly with the private sector.<p>More surprising is the amount of money DOE has spent subsidizing private companies. For instance, the department has spent more than $5.2 billion on "technology transfer" programs. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary defends this by stating, "It's about jobs; it's about creating jobs. If we don't create jobs, then it's a failure."  As two <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reporters note, "By O'Leary's own measure then, it's a flop."<sup>20</sup>  Between 1990 and 1994, for example, the federal government, largely through the DOE laboratories, transferred $293.1 million to eight large companies with annual revenues of $700 billion. Yet, over the same four-year period, these eight firms reduced their U.S. payrolls by 329,438 positions and their research and development budgets by $516 million (two dollars for every dollar of government subsidy).<sup>21</sup><p>Numerous studies, including the recent Galvin Commission report, have made recommendations to DOE on how to focus the work of these laboratories, but the department has failed to do so. Indeed, many laboratory managers report that the Energy bureaucracy often stands in the way of scientific progress. These managers "view DOE's day-to-day management as costly a
nd unproductive in meeting the laboratories' missions."<sup>22</sup> <p>The only way to free these laboratories from DOE's bureaucratic micromanagement is to sell them to private research firms or transfer them at nominal charge to the universities currently operating them. This would allow these facilities to forge partnerships with other private technology interests or to pursue basic research independent of the political or budgetary process. 
<p>
Federal funding should be phased out over a three-year period to give these facilities time to find other sources of funding. One option would be to use the $1.6 billion realized from selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve to establish an endowment for university basic research facilities, freeing them permanently from the uncertainties of the budget process.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals would establish a laboratory closure commission, similar to the present military base closure commission, to study the problem and recommend which DOE laboratories (except for those engaged in defense-related activities) should be closed, privatized, or downsized. It is important that Congress establish strict guidelines for the commission so that facilities which remain within the structure of the federal government engage solely in research directly applicable to federal functions. Such guidelines would mandate that all laboratories, regardless of stated mission, are investigated for inefficiencies and wasteful programs.
<p>
<b>Power Marketing Administrations</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) which sell wholesale electricity generated by 131 dams built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These PMAs (Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area) sold nearly $3 billion worth of electric power in 1994 -- just under 8 percent of all power generated in the United States.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>End all federal assistance to the PMAs, including direct appropriations and the authority to borrow from the Treasury.
<p>
<li>Sell the Power Marketing Administrations to private investors through a variety of privatization schemes by the end of 1998. 
<p>
<li>Sell the hydroelectric power plants by the turn of the century.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  After nearly 50 years of taxpayer subsidies, it is time for the five Power Marketing Administrations to become fully private enterprises. Customers have enjoyed hidden subsidies for years because these government-owned utilities have been able to borrow from the Treasury at below-market interest rates and take as long as 50 years to pay back the loans. Of the more than $16 billion lent to the PMAs by the Treasury, only about 25 percent has been repaid.<sup>23</sup><p>PMA electricity is not sold to the highest bidder. Instead, it is sold at varying rates to municipal utilities, cooperatives, industrial users, other government facilities, and investor-owned utilities. Municipal utilities and rural cooperatives are "preference customers," which means they pay for electricity at cost -- often as little as half the rates paid by customers in other parts of the country. Industrial users have a different rate schedule. Aluminum companies, for example, consume as much as one-third of Bonneville's power, and "the rate they pay is, by contract, tied to aluminum prices."  Thus, when aluminum prices fell over the past five years, Bonneville was buying power "for as much as 3.5 cents a kilowatt hour, [but] it had to sell it to those utilities for 1.8."<sup>24</sup> <p>Selling the PMAs is the only way to bring sound business practices to these government-owned utilities. Congress should follow the example of countries around the world that are moving to privatize their state-owned utilities. In 1993, for instance, Argentina, Germany, and the United Kingdom raised a total of $4.4 billion by selling state-owned electric utilities to private investors -- including U.S. investors. 
<p>
The British experience is particularly relevant to the United States. In 1991, the British government restructured its government-owned electricity-generating facilities into four regional corporations and sold them to the public in a stock offering. These companies compete to offer electricity through a national grid system. They also compete with various small producers. The stock offering included preferential pricing for employees as well as discounts and incentives for electricity customers and small investors. Stock also was offered for purchase on foreign exchanges. This strategy of building support for the sale among employees, customers, and small investors made the sale very popular. The stock offering was heavily oversubscribed and yielded over $6 billion for taxpayers.
<p>
When the Reagan Administration failed to get Congress to act on its 1987 proposal to sell the Alaska and Southeastern PMAs, it tried unsuccessfully to reform the PMAs' debt repayment schedules. This effort has continued under the Bush and Clinton Administrations. This year, the Clinton Administration also is renewing the effort to sell four of the PMAs (excluding Bonneville) for a total of about $3.7 billion. The White House says it will work with Congress to develop specific proposals to privatize these assets. President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget projects that the Alaska sale could generate $83 million. This sale has been in negotiation for more than six years and could be completed quickly if Congress acts to authorize it.
<p>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that the relatively small Southeastern and Southwestern PMAs could be sold for $500 million each.<sup>25</sup>  The Southeastern PMA, which sells less than 2 percent of the power in its region, could be sold swiftly to regional utilities because it does not own or operate any transmission facilities. It simply pays a fee to various utilities to market power through their transmission lines. The Southwestern PMA, which accounts for 4 percent of the energy sold in its region, also could be sold to regional investor-owned utilities.
<p>
OMB estimates that selling the much larger Western Area PMA (WAPA) headquartered in Golden, Colorado, could generate some $2.6 billion. According to the Department of Energy, while WAPA markets about 9 percent of the power in its region, its service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its wholesale customers provide power to 16 million consumers in 15 central and western states. Because of its large distribution area, WAPA should be broken up and sold in manageable pieces to investors.
<p>
Selling Bonneville (BPA) would be more complicated because of its size and the fact that it provides about 65 percent of the electric power in the Northwest. One method, used successfully by such countries as Britain, would be to sell through a broad-based stock option plan in order to neutralize opposition from the interests served by Bonneville and win popular support from public investors. Stock could be sold at favorable prices to employees, residential customers, environmentalists, fishing and agricultural interests, or others who may feel they stand to lose from privatization. Such a move also might bring support from the many investor-owned and public utilities in the region which reportedly have threatened to build their own power generators to free themselves from BPA's near-monopoly status.<sup>26</sup><p>Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals call for immediate sale of the Alaskan, Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations. This would result in savings of roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In addition, both plans transfer control of the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration to the Department of the Interior and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study outlining future courses for Bonneville.
<p>
<b>Energy Supply Research and Development</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $3.7 billion per year on research designed to develop or improve sources of energy. Initiated in response to the OPEC oil embargo to free U.S. consumers from dependence on foreign oil, these projects involve research on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear power, and such non-renewable sources as fossil fuels. Appropriations approved by Congress for fiscal 1995 include, among others, $442 million for fossil energy R&D, $288 million for solar energy research, $37 million for geothermal research, $293 million for nuclear energy research, and $49 million for wind energy systems.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all federal funding for energy supply research and development, including fossil fuel R&D.
<p>
<li>Privatize all government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In today's dollars, the federal government has spent over $70 billion on energy research programs since the Department of Energy was created in 1977 and has little or nothing to show for it. The United States imports 30 percent more petroleum now than before the oil shock of 1973, and alternative energy supply methods account for only one percent of all energy produced in this country.<sup>27</sup><p>Much of this DOE-funded research is already conducted by private firms or simply irrelevant to market needs. Electric utilities, for instance, voluntarily fund the $240 million-per-year Electric Power Research Institute at no government expense. Moreover, "the major new technologies for enhanced oil recovery... have come from private industry, not DOE," according to the Congressional Budget Office, and DOE's $9 billion investment in nuclear fission research has gone to waste because the private sector has no interest in building new nuclear power plants. Thus, Energy "has little in the way of commercial applications to show for its investment."<sup>28</sup>  All the federal government's attempts to outguess the energy market have produced are such expensive failures as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.<sup>29</sup>  Federal funding for renewable and non-renewable energy research and development should be halted immediately.<p>There are seven federal laboratories engaged in Energy Supply R&D research:  one multi-program laboratory (the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) and six program-dedicated laboratories like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. These facilities consume over $1 billion of total Energy Supply R&D funds. Congress should move to sell all seven to the private firms which currently operate them or transfer them to the universities with which they are affiliated. Private firms then can choose to continue funding for any research they decide is commercially relevant.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills include a review of these research and development activities by a laboratory closure commission. The Tiahrt plan is bolder because it establishes specific spending reductions for each of the next five fiscal years (a 25 percent reduction in fiscal 1997 and 50 percent reductions in each following year); Senator Grams proposes to leave any reductions to the discretion of the commission. The problem with allowing a commission to review DOE's research activities is that, while it helps remove political pressures from the process, it also fails to take into account the dismal record of these activities. DOE's energy supply research and development should be terminated, immediately and completely.
<p>
<b>Naval Petroleum Reserves</b>
<p>
Established in 1912, the federally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) is comprised of two commercial oil fields at Elk Hills (near Bakersfield, California) and Teapot Dome (near Casper, Wyoming) and oil-shale reserves (near Rifle, Colorado).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the highest bidder.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no longer any compelling national, strategic, or commercial reason for the federal government to own the Naval Petroleum Reserve. These oil fields were set aside by Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson to assure fuel for the Navy as it converted from coal to oil. By and large, they sat idle until the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974, when Congress decided that NPR oil should be pumped and sold and the proceeds used to ready the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Department of Energy owns 78 percent of the Elk Hills facility, and a private oil company (Chevron) owns the remaining 22 percent. Overall, the NPR is the equivalent of less than one percent of total U.S. domestic output -- hardly enough to be vital to national security interests.
<p>
Although the NPR generates more than $400 million per year in revenue to the government, studies have found that these fields are operated far less efficiently than comparable privately owned oil fields. The NPR was targeted for privatization by the Reagan Administration in a proposal endorsed by the President's Commission on Privatization in 1988. The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 budget also proposes selling the NPR, but Congress so far has failed to act. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the government's interest could be sold for some $1.5 billion, netting roughly $321 million after deducting the more than $400 million in revenues the NPR produces each year.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should embrace this effort and remove any legislative obstacles to selling these assets as quickly as possible.<p>The Tiahrt bill would transfer responsibility for the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the Department of the Interior and mandate the sale of a significant portion of the reserves to the private sector. The Secretary of Interior would then conduct a study to determine the best course of action concerning the remaining reserves. The Grams proposal, on the other hand, calls for sale of the entire reserve. This approach is preferable because it would result in much larger savings and serve taxpayers better.
<p>
<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b>
<p>
Created by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the nearly 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stockpile of crude oil available for release in the event of market disruptions such as the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The Department of Energy operates six underground salt dome storage sites on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserve immediately.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has become an expensive and obsolete vestige of the regulated oil markets that existed before the Reagan Administration deregulated them in 1981. Over the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States has spent about $4 billion constructing the SPR storage facilities and another $17 billion to fill the reserves. Although Congress has not approved funds to expand the reserve beyond its current level of 592 million barrels, the annual cost of operating these facilities is some $200 million. 
<p>
Since deregulation, the oil market has become increasingly diversified and the futures market, which hedges against price fluctuations, has become highly sophisticated. As a result, interruptions in the world oil supply of the sort that occurred during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991 do not have the same impact on the economy they once did. Moreover, the CBO notes, while the market responded efficiently to the Gulf War interruption, "both the process of deciding to use the SPR and the mechanism for selling the oil may have actually contributed to market uncertainty at the time."<sup>31</sup>. <p>The CBO estimates the SPR's current market value at $10 billion, or about $17 per barrel. However, the sales value may be less because the SPR is suffering water leakage as well as heat and gas buildups, which may present difficulties in extracting the oil. But even a more reasonable purchase price of $7 to $10 per barrel would generate revenues of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
<p>
Both congressional plans to terminate DOE call for partial sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, principally those held at Weeks Island, Louisiana. Representative Tiahrt proposes to transfer control over the other portions to the Interior Department, with the Secretary of Interior responsible for determining whether there is justification for selling further reserves. Senator Grams proposes to transfer responsibility for the SPR to the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense then would be responsible for determining what portion of the reserves should be maintained and what portion sold. Whoever is responsible, the goal should be to privatize the maximum amount of SPR possible. The final bill should set strict guidelines to ensure this.
<p>
<b>Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b>
<p>
For some 40 years, the U.S. government ran two uranium enrichment facilities, one at Portsmouth, Ohio, and the other at Paducah, Kentucky. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act transformed this federal program into a wholly owned government corporation (similar to Amtrak) called the United States Enrichment Corporation. The USEC currently produces and markets uranium enrichment services to more than 60 private utilities that own and operate commercial nuclear power plants in this country and abroad. The corporation generates revenues of approximately $1.5 billion annually and, after expenses, returns a "dividend" of roughly $30 million to the Treasury.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<ul><p>
<li>Sell the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to the private sector in FY 1996.
</ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no reason for the U.S. government to operate a commercial business, especially one that returns only a small profit to the Treasury while maintaining effective market control over the industry. According to its own promotional material, the USEC serves "approximately 90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the world market."<sup>32</sup>  Its annual revenues of $1.5 billion would rank it 286th on the <i>Fortune</i> 500 list of industrial firms. <p>Congress should remove the many needless obstacles and impediments placed on the corporation by the 1992 Act so that it can be made more attractive to private buyers and investors and sold in FY 1996 for top dollar. A businesslike enrichment corporation could bring bids of at least $1 billion if freed from oppressive congressional restrictions. Ideally, the two facilities should be sold to different buyers to avoid creating a private monopoly.
<p>
The House already has passed legislation to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
<p>
<b>Energy Conservation Research and Grant Programs</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $800 million per year for energy conservation and research. This research is targeted toward improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, industry, private and public buildings, and utilities.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all DOE conservation research and grant programs.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  This program funds research and grants that should be financed by the private sector and state or local governments. For FY 1995, for example, Congress approved over $430 million for research targeted toward private industry. This funding includes some $20 million for building systems, $2 million for heating and cooling technology, over $25 million for industrial co-generation, $22 million for materials and metals processing, over $50 million for alternative fuels utilization, $1.2 million for "engine optimization in alternative fuels utilization," $1 million for vehicle systems materials, $1.5 million for light duty engine development, and some $3 million for international market development.
<p>
Congress also earmarked $226 million for state-based weatherization programs, $22 million for state conservation programs, and an additional $29 million for the "institutional conservation program."33  However important these conservation measures may be, they are not properly a function of the federal government. Congress should get out of the business of funding and micromanaging purely private research and purely local responsibilities. <p>Energy Information, Policy, Regulation, and Departmental Administration<br>Some $400 million of the Department of Energy's $18 billion-per-year budget is dedicated to departmental administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Energy Information Administration, and the Office of Economic Regulation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
<li>Close down or privatize the Energy Information Administration.
<p>
<li>Eliminate all funding for non-defense departmental administration while closing down the Department of Energy. 
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In testimony before a congressional subcommittee earlier this year, the General Accounting Office warned that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management of the nuclear weapons complex to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight of contractors, inadequate information systems, and work force weaknesses."<sup>34</sup>  Although the department has reorganized many times over the years to correct these deficiencies, those efforts have failed. The only recourse for Congress is to close the agency.
<p>
To dismantle the Department of Energy, Congress will have to complete various housekeeping duties such as eliminating over $400 million per year in departmental overhead funding and spinning off entities which can stand alone. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is charged with regulating certain interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydropower, and electric industries, easily could be made an independent agency like the Federal Communications Commission. FERC is basically self-financed by the fees paid by regulated industries. Congress should begin a serious debate, however, over the extent to which the federal government should continue to regulate the private energy sector.
<p>
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is a quasi-independent agency within the Department of Energy intended to collect and disseminate data on petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, electricity, alternate fuel sources, and energy consumption. All of the activities and functions performed by the EIA are carried out by private firms, newsletters, trade magazines, and industry associations. The EIA should be privatized and all federal funding eliminated.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The proposals by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would close down DOE, not just re-invent or re-organize it. This is important because it would prevent future Congresses from simply re-inflating the department's funding. In contrast, Secretary O'Leary's re-invention plan maintains DOE's inefficient bureaucracy and perpetuates some of the department's most unnecessary functions. And, although O'Leary's plan would "save" a reported $14.1 billion over five years, a significant portion of these savings are from asset sales. Once these sales are complete, the Department of Energy -- re-invented or not -- will continue to exist at little or no savings to taxpayers. The two congressional termination plans, on the other hand, ensure large savings well beyond the next five years.
<p>
Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Energy does not fit this description. There is no role for DOE in energy supply or regulation with the fall of OPEC and a stable international flow of oil. There is no need for massive nuclear weapons production with the end of the Cold War. All that remains of the Department of Energy's core missions are environmental remediation and research and development. The first could be managed more efficiently by the Department of Defense. The second should be the responsibility of private-sector energy providers. Thus, while DOE still performs a few functions that are likely to continue as federal responsibilities, these functions in no way justify continuing the U.S. Department of Energy as an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor (DoL) has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government. Created in 1913, DoL is currently responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. This proliferating body of legislation and regulation covers a wide range of workplace activities for nearly 10 million employers and well over 100 million workers, presenting a barrier to the formation of firms and their ability to create jobs.1<p>The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. If implemented, such reforms could save America's taxpayers $10.5 billion from 1996 to the year 2000 alone. The primary objectives of this effort should be to: 
<p><ul>
<li> Reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety; 
<p>
<li> Improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
</ul><p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing this Cabinet-level department and moving certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
The Department of Labor's programs are organized into seven main functional areas: <p>
1) Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES),
<p>
2) Job Training Programs,
<p>
3) Workplace Health and Safety,
<p>
4) Private Pension Protection,
<p>
5) Employment Standards,
<p>
6) Economic Statistics, and
<p>
7) Labor Union Oversight. 
<p>
UI and ES form the largest functional area, accounting for around 75 percent of DoL's budget (set at $25.5 billion for FY 1995). The next largest budget function, Job Training Programs, accounts for around 20 percent. 
<p>
Examining these seven areas reveals that the administration and enforcement of American labor laws can and should be reformed, both to achieve the department's underlying objectives of workforce protection, including workplace health and safety, and to reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations. To do this, Congress should take the following steps:
<p><ul>
<li> <b>Devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services to the states.</b> This would enable states to decrease the duration of unemployment, reduce payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution should include the Veterans Employment Service, labor market information projects, the one-stop career system concept, and the administration of unemployment insurance. Congress also should repeal the Federal Extended Benefit program and provide incentives for states to overhaul and integrate their employment services with a view to reducing the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance. Any remaining federal administrative functions should be transferred to the Treasury Department. 
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant.</b> Congress should combine these programs, including the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, Indian and Native American Employment and Training, and Youth Fair Chance, into a block grant attached to the new welfare block grant recently passed by Congress. This would eliminate a maze of categorical programs and provide states the flexibility they need to develop programs that effectively reduce welfare dependency. States should be required only to focus these resources on means-tested job placement assistance and conduct control group evaluations of their effectiveness. Federal target and categorical requirements should be removed. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant.</b> This new block grant for job placement assistance and training would include such things as dislocated worker programs, School-to-Work programs, and Adult Technology Learning programs. Even the Department of Labor recognizes that a block grant would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars.2  The determination of target groups should be left to the discretion of the states. Because the effectiveness of today's training programs is questionable,3 total funding for this block grant should be cut by 50 percent and frozen until scientific studies can prove they are effective. In carrying out these studies, states should be required to have at least one ongoing control group evaluation on programs funded from the block grant. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).</b> This reform is needed to "refocus the [federal] responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."4  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.5  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,6 to maintain and continually improve workplace safety. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner. Congress also should spin off the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined by a department subject to political influence.  
<p>
<li><b> Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration.</b> Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across three departments.7  Combining the agencies responsible for this oversight would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. In addition, Congress should spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, fund the PBGC separately, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.8 <p><li><b>Repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations.</b> Congress should streamline labor regulation by eliminating the heavy burden of outdated or restrictive rules. This means, for example, nullifying Executive Order 11246 and related affirmative action regulations affecting federal contractors and subcontractors; eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP); repealing the Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act, as well as Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; reforming the Fair Labor Standards Act; and strengthening the Portal to Portal Act of 1947. Congress then should transfer all remaining functions of the Wage and Hour Division to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li><b> Combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau within a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics.</b> A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. It also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Statistical functions of other departments also should be housed within the new bureau to ensure that the government's data collection efforts are insulated from politics.
<p>
<li><b> Close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (Striker Replacement).</b> Government promotion of high-performance workplaces actually serves only as corporate welfare and a training subsidy for unions. These activities already are conducted in the private sector through business associations and unions. Congress should transfer labor union oversight and investigative functions, including those in the Office of the Inspector General, to the Justice Department. 
</ul><p>
The 104th Congress has held a number of hearings and introduced a variety of bills to reform and update America's labor laws, and it continues to reassess dozens of labor policy issues that have been neglected for years.9  This year's budget process also has provided Congress with a vehicle for reform. Aside from reforming and consolidating job training programs, the Administration's proposed budget did little to "reinvent" DoL. President Clinton proposed to raise the department's budget authority by over 14 percent and its full-time staff by 304.10  Congress appropriately rejected the President's budget and is proceeding with its own plan to reform the administration of federal labor policy through the budget process. <p>The House recently voted to reduce FY 1996 DoL discretionary spending by 13.8 percent. It also instituted several important reforms. For example, the House budget prohibits funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, prohibits the issuance of two unnecessarily burdensome OSHA regulations on ergonomics and fall protection, and bars DoL from promoting "economically targeted investments" (ETIs) by private pension plans. The House also is planning to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
The Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to reduce DoL discretionary spending for FY 1996 by 12.6 percent. Although the Senate's DoL budget prohibits implementation of the striker replacement executive order, it does not contain the House's OSHA regulatory provisions or the prohibition on promoting ETIs. Differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out in conference committee.
<p>
As the following study demonstrates, the U.S. Department of Labor has gone far beyond its original mandate to become a burdensome and feared regulatory agency that presents significant barriers to creating jobs and increasing real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace requirements makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy of American business. Congress should do what the Clinton Administration promised but failed to do -- reform this overgrown and intrusive bureaucracy. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor was created by Congress in 1913 in response to pressure from organized labor. Its goals, according to the statute, were to "foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage-earners, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."  Initially, DoL consisted of four bureaus transferred from the old Department of Commerce and Labor:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly the Bureau of Labor), the Bureau of Immigration, the Bureau of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau. These bureaus reflected the department's original focus:  collecting information and publishing reports on employment, wages, and working conditions; reviewing the effects of immigration on the job market; and monitoring the use of child labor.
<p>
In 1918, during World War I, Congress established the War Labor Administration (WLA) to insure adequate industrial production and foster labor peace in defense production industries. The WLA set policies on wages, hours, and working conditions. It recruited women and minorities to work in defense industries. It also sought to encourage better workplace race relations, promote worker safety and health, and address other employment-related problems that might hinder war production. Although Congress moved quickly after the Armistice to end its activities, the WLA's initiatives embodied ideas of the Progressive movement that later would spawn the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, and War on Poverty. 
<p>
What began as primarily an advocacy, educational, and administrative department over time became a regulatory and enforcement agency. Since 1918 Congress has expanded DoL's regulatory functions considerably, often because of political pressure from social reform movements or organized labor. For instance: 
<p><blockquote>
	During the 1920s, in response to the women's suffrage movement, the Women's Bureau was added to promote the status of and job opportunities for women. DoL also implemented the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 that ended U.S. free immigration policy by imposing a quota system. 
<p>
	Confronted with the depression of the 1930s, Congress passed several laws to protect workers from economic change. The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted explicitly to protect white unionized workers on federal construction sites from competition by low-skilled nonunion workers, chiefly blacks and Hispanics. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Act established the Unemployment Insurance system. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandated a minimum wage, overtime requirements, and child labor restrictions.
<p>
	In the late 1940s, DoL underwent many organizational changes. Its immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the postwar years, the failure of DoL to mediate a wave of strikes prompted Congress to transfer the department's labor conciliation functions to the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and veterans' reemployment rights became DoL's responsibility as the Defense Department was scaled back. In 1959, concern over the influence of organized crime and other union abuses led Congress to pass the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to oversee the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions.
<p>
	In the early 1960s, unfounded concern about the impact of technology on the labor force, combined with the War on Poverty, resulted in passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Ten years later, spending on federal job training programs was increased significantly by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 reduced the enormous cost of CETA but did not improve the effectiveness of federal job training programs. 
<p>
	Since the 1960s, pressure from the civil rights movement has led to a variety of equal employment opportunity laws and redundant presidential executive orders to protect certain groups of individuals -- women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly -- such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Executive Order 11246 as amended.11<p>	In the 1970s, DoL's regulatory and enforcement role expanded dramatically with passage of the landmark Occupational Health and Safety Act and again when responsibility for mine safety and health was transferred from the Department of the Interior. 
<p>
	Concern over the negative impact of federal trade policies on workers prompted Congress to pass the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act in 1974. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was enacted in 1988 to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to workers and their communities. 
<p>
	During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress has enacted various employee benefits and protections, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
</blockquote><p>
Since 1960, the expansion of federally mandated benefits and worker protections has begun to take its toll on business formation and job creation.12  In 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, legally required benefits accounted for 32 percent of all benefits paid to workers on an hourly basis.13  Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are shifted largely to workers in the form of lower real wages.14  Further, the increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to businesses of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.15  Although well intentioned, these requirements add to the cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, and how long to retain that worker. The rise in nonwage labor costs is important because it is one of the forces leading employers to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.16<p>Ironically, organized labor has been so successful in persuading Congress to legislate matters that once were the province of collective bargaining that they have nearly driven themselves out of business. And with each Congress, Washington has placed more and more requirements and restrictions on employers and the labor market.17  This growing regulatory burden has made DoL inspectors as feared as IRS auditors and most small businesses very cautious about hiring additional workers.<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>Today's labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed since most of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. Only a fundamental rethinking of DoL and its functions can lead to the formulation of a proper and truly effective federal labor policy. The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
<p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by eliminating the DoL as a Cabinet department. Certain key national functions should be carried out by sub-Cabinet agencies or transferred to other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
<b>I. REFORM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE.</b><p>
Over two-thirds of DoL's budget is consumed by the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.18  This program has two main objectives:  to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to recently unemployed workers, and help stabilize the economy during recessions. The UC program is financed by a Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) of 0.8 percent19 of the first $7,000 in wages and state unemployment insurance taxes that average 0.9 percent of total wages. The revenue raised by FUTA is used to administer Unemployment Insurance (UI) and maintain a system of Employment Service (ES) offices. Portions of FUTA revenues also fund the federal half of the Extended Benefits Program and federal loans to depleted state accounts. State UI tax revenues fund state UI benefit payments and the state half of the Extended Benefits Program. At the end of fiscal 1995, state accounts in the UI Trust Fund had a balance of $35.6 billion. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, any positive balance in the UI Trust Fund is used to fund other federal programs. General revenues are used to fund federal unemployment benefit programs and allowances such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. 
<p>
When the UC program was enacted in 1935, Congress intended that it be a federal-state partnership. The federal government was to set broad parameters, provide adequate and equitable funding for state administration, and oversee state law and operations to ensure compliance and conformity. The states were to be responsible for carrying out the program while complying with all federal laws and regulations, as well as their own state requirements. However, the federal government has used the state conformity process to convert the basic program philosophy into a more acceptable ideology and frequently upsets the balance of administrative funding and workloads by dictating that states absorb the costs of administering additional programs.20<p>Over the past decade, federal budget constraints have had a detrimental effect on services provided to unemployed workers by the state UI system and ES offices. Even though FUTA revenues collected for UI and ES administration have been more than sufficient, Congress continues to extend the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax on jobs and limit UI and ES administration appropriations.21  This masks the true size of the federal deficit. The federal government actually uses the UI system to fund programs that lead to longer periods of unemployment for workers22 and unnecessarily high payroll taxes. This is contrary to the primary purpose of the UI system23and reduces real wages.24<p>The UC program should be reformed to limit the federal role, as Congress originally intended, and to restore responsibility and accountability to the states. Studies show that states can decrease the duration of unemployment and thereby reduce payroll taxes and increase jobs.25 <p>What Congress Should Do:<p><b>Devolve financing and funding for the UI system and Employment Service to the states. </b><p>Congress should repeal the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax and increase the FUTA offset26 from the current 90 percent to 100 percent if a state conforms with federal law. States should be allowed to collect one UI tax for administration and benefits. Each state would be responsible, and accountable, to employers for UI payroll tax dollars and for the administration and effectiveness of the UI/ES system. Receipts from the single state UI tax should be deposited into each state's UI account, maintained by the Department of the Treasury. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Wagner-Peyser Act and amend FUTA to require states to establish public employment offices in labor market areas designated by state legislatures. </b>
<p>
Each state should have the flexibility to deliver job placement assistance in ways that meet the needs of its employers and job seekers. However, states should be required to ensure reasonable access to services for workers and to register for work all eligible claimants who are not temporarily laid off. Reform must provide incentives for states to explore ways to integrate employment services and reduce the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. These incentives should include opening up the job placement assistance offered through the state ES offices to private competition and other UI experiments.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the federal extended benefit program and the federal extended unemployment compensation account (EUCA). </b>
<p>
Funds in the EUCA should be transferred to state UI accounts based upon each state's relative share of covered employment. The 1992 amendments that made it easier for states to trigger extended benefits (EB)27 should be repealed. The 1992 change made it easier for states to qualify for extended benefits and encouraged individuals to stay on unemployment benefits even when jobs were available. By basing the trigger for extended benefits on a state's total unemployment rate rather than its insured unemployment rate, Congress also broadened considerably the number of those who can qualify for extended benefits. Those who argued for this change claimed that basing benefits on the insured rate meant that many of the unemployed were not receiving benefits and that the program therefore was not working as intended. But, as pointed out at the time by Labor Department officials, this gap between the number of people who were unemployed and the number collecting benefits is normal and is an intended purpose of the program.28<p><b>Eliminate the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), which is used to loan money to insolvent state UI accounts. </b>
<p>
 Funds in the FUA come from a portion of the FUTA payroll tax on jobs.29  The federal government uses the FUA to provide loans to states that have depleted their UI accounts during severe recessions. When the FUA is not being used for state loans, the surplus that builds up is used to fund other government programs and amounts to a tax on jobs to reduce the deficit. At the end of September 1995, there will be a $7.4 billion surplus in the FUA. The FUA should be eliminated and its funds transferred to state UI accounts. States that deplete their UI accounts should be able to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury rather than from a surplus account maintained to offset the federal deficit.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and the Local Veteran Employment Representative Program and amend FUTA to incorporate the veteran preferences already in Title 38 of the U.S. Code (Veterans Benefits). </b>
<p>
The administrative efficiency of ES offices could be improved significantly by repealing barriers to the integration of veterans' services with other employment services. As the Vice President's National Performance Review noted in calling for the removal of barriers,30 DoL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service provides for state-employed, federally funded employment specialists to serve veterans in local state employment service offices. However, staff are legally prohibited from helping non-veterans. "So, if a local office is crowded with non-veterans," points out the NPR, "these specialists cannot help out -- even if they have no veterans to serve."  Employment Service staff would be used more efficiently and the public better served by eliminating this requirement.
<p>
<b>Eliminate Trade Adjustment Assistance. </b>
<p>
This program funds payments for unemployment benefits, allowances, and training costs to workers affected by foreign trade imports under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA). In addition, the TAA provides for payment of similar benefits to workers adversely affected by NAFTA. As well intentioned as this may be, workers who can prove they lost their jobs because of foreign competition or NAFTA should not receive government benefits that exceed the assistance available to those laid off due to domestic competition.31  In any case, the department's own auditors have concluded that the TAA has not worked as intended, and the new NAFTA-TAA program likely will meet the same outcome:  Instead of providing retraining help, the TAA program has turned into a compensation program.32  Funding for these ineffective programs should be eliminated.<p><b>Permit state legislators to determine ES administrative budgets, payroll taxes, and UI benefits under limited federal guidelines. </b><p> The UI system is an experience-rated and employer-paid payroll tax. It was set up with specific objectives and a designated tax as its funding source. Federal proposals to combine the funding sources for the ES program and job training programs are unwise. Job placement services have different goals, populations, and outcomes from those of training programs. ES offices are supposed to get unemployment claimants back to work quickly, thereby ensuring that employer taxes are as low as possible. Job training programs often do not share that objective. Suggesting that FUTA payroll tax funds be used for anything other than paying unemployment benefits and funding state job placement assistance is merely a backdoor way to introduce a payroll tax for training. Devolving ES funding removes the potential for Congress to dilute the mission of the system and divert funding for other purposes.
The limited federal guidelines should include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>	The single state UI tax for both administration and benefits should be experience rated.
<p>
<li>	Funds should be used only for program administration and weekly benefits and should be capped at levels necessary for proper and efficient administration during periods of high unemployment.
<p>
<li>States should be required to continue cooperative and financial contracts to administer the interstate benefit program.
<p>
<li>	Federal funding for the administration and payment of federal employee UI benefits, military separations, and disaster unemployment programs should be deposited in state UI accounts as needed.
<p>
<li> Federal oversight should be limited to determining whether state laws conform with federal requirements.
</ul><p>
<b>II. CONSOLIDATE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANTS.</b><p>
The current maze of discretionary job training programs accounts for another substantial portion of DoL's budget. Many DoL programs overlap programs in other departments. The General Accounting Office has identified 163 employment training assistance programs across the federal government, spending about $20 billion per year.33  Moreover, "this fragmented system wastes resources and confuses and frustrates clients, employers, and administrators."  For FY 1995, thirty of these programs, totaling $5.8 billion, were funded through DoL.34  The Employment and Training Administration, the primary DoL agency responsible for job training programs, is run by 1,529 employees and accounts for 50 percent of DoL's discretionary budget.35<p>President Clinton, as part of his "Middle Class Bill of Rights" initiative, has proposed significant funding increases in his FY 1996 budget.36  For example, DoL proposed to increase funding for the School-to-Work program by 63 percent and funding for the One-Stop Career Center program by 100 percent. But the Clinton Administration also agrees that federal job training programs are fragmented, overlapping, and lack accountability. Part of the President's initiative is to consolidate and reform 70 job training programs. 
<P>
Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must first ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work?37 <p>Job training programs, although well intentioned, have not raised the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter what happens when individuals neglect their first 12 years of primary education.38  The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much too late. What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening curricula, and completing high school. Reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform federal job training programs. The House recently passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (H.R. 1617), introduced by Representative Howard McKeon (R-CA). The Senate also recently passed the Workforce Development Act of 1995 (S. 143), introduced by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS). Although both bills improve current law by consolidating some of the federal job training programs into state block grants and increasing accountability, major changes need to be made in conference.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Consolidate more programs into the block grants.</b>
<p>
S. 143 consolidates only around 80 of the 163 federal employment and training programs and reduces spending by 15 percent. H.R. 1617 consolidates even fewer programs. H.R. 1617 does not include Job Corps, the most expensive federal job training program, or vocational rehabilitation programs. S. 143 marginally reforms Job Corps, but does not consolidate it in the state block grant. However, S. 143 does include vocational rehabilitation programs. 
<p>
 Congress can improve both bills by consolidating the Job Corps, vocational rehabilitation, and the Senior Community Service Employment program into the state block grant.
<p>
<b>Provide maximum flexibility to the states in designing their programs. </b><p>
Overly prescriptive federal requirements should be removed. State and local elected officials are in the best position to allocate block grant funds. There is tremendous diversity among and within the states. What Washington prescribes as the solution for problems in urban areas often does not fit well in places like Utah or Vermont. Prescriptive solutions and fixed allocations of funds will work in some places, but will also be the worst possible solution in many others.39  State and local workforce development boards should be optional, not mandatory. Continuing School-to-Work activities also should be optional and not mandatory.<p>Further, states should have the discretion to transfer funds between the welfare and job training block grants for the purpose of implementing work requirements and job placement assistance programs. This would provide additional flexibility to states and eliminate micromanagement by the federal government. 
<p>
<b>Strengthen accountability with control group evaluations.</b>
<p>
Each state should have at least one control group evaluation of its job training programs ongoing at any given time. Such scientific evaluation should be conducted by using experimental and control groups chosen by scientific random assignment and, at a minimum, should determine whether job training and job placement programs effectively raise the hourly wage rates of individuals receiving training through such programs. Each state should report annually on the status and results of its control group evaluations.
<p>
The addition of state control group evaluations would quickly build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job training programs. Few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluation.40  As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."41  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training. Historically, performance measures and benchmarks have been the more common but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. The findings from performance measure methods, particularly the negative ones, have been easily manipulated and explained way. Without a requirement for rigorous, control group studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>
<b>Scale back the labor market information system.</b>
<p>
Initial labor market information system (LMIS) activities should be restricted to conducting a feasibility study, developing LMIS options, and estimating the cost of those options. The current LMIS provisions in both H.R. 1617 and S. 143 immediately plunge the federal and state governments down an untested and expensive path that may not be feasible. Further, mandating states to create a LMIS at the substate level for which no data current exist will be extremely expensive. The initial information for the labor market information system should be restricted to data readily available from the Census Bureau and other federal and state agencies.
<p>
Further, employers should not be mandated to provide any information. All employer provided information on job openings, application procedures, employment requirements, wages, benefits, and hiring patterns should be strictly voluntary. Any information supplied by either individuals or employers should also be immune from the legal process and should not, without the consent of the individual or employer, be used for any judicial or administrative proceeding. 
<p>
<b>III. REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY.</b>42<p>Although Congress intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.43  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards.44  Significant reform is required to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health and "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."45  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review correctly recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely, given the federal budget situation. A new approach is required to increase workplace health and safety and balance the budget. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. 
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.46  In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA and MSHA spending by 8.9 percent. The House recently voted to increase funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 19.2 percent while reducing overall OSHA and MSHA spending for FY 1996 by 12.5 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 5.0 percent funding decrease for OSHA compliance assistance and a 3.1 percent overall reduction. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively uses the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Significantly reform OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is implemented. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Reform OSHA's regulatory process. <br>
Because OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.47  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. Development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>
<li>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.<br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces, but the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health. 
<p>
<li> Give first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.<br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.<br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.48  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p></ul>
<b>Merge the Mine Safety and Health Administration with a reformed OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.49  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
<p><ul>
<li> Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the memoranda of understanding that currently exist between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
<li> The Heritage Foundation estimates that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.50  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need to write two separate health regulations for the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p></ul>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.51  Each underground mine will be inspected thoroughly at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of inspecting mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>Establish the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency that functions as a national safety and health standard-setting agency. </b>
<p>
Establishing health and safety compliance programs can be extremely costly and complicated. For employers operating in multiple states, where requirements vary from state to state, developing compliance programs can be almost impossible. There is no justification for different requirements in different states. The risk posed by certain hazards may vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace, but not from state to state. Therefore, different states do not need different requirements. National workplace health and safety standards should be developed exclusively at the federal level.
<p>
National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined in a department that has been, and continues too be, subject to political influence. Independence and objectivity are crucial. The potential costs and benefits are too high for politics to play any role. The "new" OSHA should be a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. Its members would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The board would be responsible for standards promulgation, oversight of a peer-review process, and issuance of compliance directives. It also would report its activities to Congress twice a year and be subject to congressional oversight hearings.
<p>
<b>IV. REFORM PRIVATE PENSION PROTECTION.</b>
<p>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in employee pension plans that provide workers with retirement benefits promised by their employers. The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is the DoL agency that administers and enforces ERISA. ERISA protects the integrity of assets by requiring administrators of private pension and welfare plans52 to comply with strict fiduciary responsibility standards.53  It also requires administrators to provide participants with easily understood summaries of their plans, to file those summaries with PWBA, and to report annually on the financial operation of plans and the bonding of persons charged with handling funds and assets. Jurisdiction is shared by the PWBA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Generally, PWBA has authority over Title I of ERISA,54 the IRS has authority over Title II,55and PBGC has authority over Title IV.56
<p>
PWBA is responsible for overseeing 720,000 pension plans and 4.5 million health and welfare plans in the private sector. ERISA-covered private pension plans cover over 88 million working Americans and their dependents and hold approximately $2 trillion in assets. Over 100 million workers are covered by employer-sponsored health and welfare plans. Three-quarters of PWBA's $65 million budget and 582 FTEs (full-time equivalent employees) is dedicated to enforcement focused on compliance with fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. PWBA audits plans and conducts criminal and civil investigations. In 1993, the government carried out 6,033 investigations. 
<p>
President Clinton proposed to increase PWBA's budget by 17.1 percent. The House recently voted to reduce PWBA's FY 1996 spending by 7.5 percent and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a 5.2 percent reduction. The House budget bill also prohibits the Department of Labor from promoting economically targeted investments with respect to private pension plans covered by ERISA. It specifically prohibits both the implementation of last year's PWBA Interpretive Bulletin and the funding of any Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse. The Senate Appropriations Committee deleted this House provision.
<p>
The primary focus of ERISA legislation this year is health insurance reform. In the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) has introduced the ERISA Targeted Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 995), which would provide for health insurance portability, increased participation, improved plan solvency, and other consumer protections for workers. Senator Kassebaum has introduced the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028), the provisions of which are a subset of H.R. 995. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee.
<p>
A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions have been introduced in Congress. The most comprehensive bill, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 (H.R. 2037 and S. 1006), has been introduced by Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator David Pryor (D-AR). These identical bills would create alternative methods for satisfying nondiscrimination provisions, repeal the family aggregation provision, repeal 5-year income averaging for lump-sum distributions, repeal the $5,000 exclusion of employees' death benefits, simplify the method for taxing annuity distributions under certain employer plans, and target access to pension plans for small employers.
<p>
The House has passed H.R. 1594, introduced by Representative John Saxton (R-NJ), to place restrictions on the promotion of economically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit plans by the Department of Labor and other federal agencies. A similar bill (S. 774) has been introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL).
<p><blockquote>
	Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. Transferring PWBA to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. Combining PWBA with HHS also would be a good first step toward privatizing Social Security.57
</blockquote><P>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Abolish the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse.</b>
<p>
In 1994, DoL established the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse (ETIC) to provide information on investment opportunities to pension plan managers. This program is DoL's way of encouraging pension plans to invest in areas of the economy that bureaucrats and politicians feel are underfinanced by private capital markets. It is misguided and jeopardizes the safety of pension plan assets.58  Tax dollars should not be used as another form of corporate welfare to market public investment choices to pension plan managers. If an investment, public or private, provides a good opportunity to pension plan managers, they will allocate plan funds accordingly. 
<p>
<b> Eliminate the Office of Inspector General's independent investigative authority.</b>
<p>
The experience and expertise for investigating fraud and abuse involving employee benefit plans reside in the PWBA. The existence of competing enforcement authorities within the DoL creates confusion and leads to duplication of effort. In recent years, PWBA has increased its efforts to bring criminal cases. As a result, PWBA investigators not only have expertise regarding how plans operate, but also know how to work criminal cases.
<p>
<b>Remove ESOPs from Title I (fiduciary standards) of ERISA.</b>
<p>
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are hybrid benefit plans with two often competing goals. They are designed to increase employee ownership in companies and thereby improve productivity. They also are treated as retirement plans, with participants allowed to defer taxes on the value of their stock until it is withdrawn at retirement. Although ESOPs are governed by ERISA's fiduciary rules, several tax code sections give them special treatment not available to other retirement plans. Because the nature and financing of ESOPs are not always compatible with ERISA's rules, PWBA has struggled to accommodate ESOPs under the rules without damaging the fiduciary requirements that generally work well for other retirement plans. The result has been confusing and complicated rulings and legal standards. Congressional intent clearly has been to foster employee ownership. Trying to incorporate ESOPs into an Act designed to protect retirement income will only undermine this goal.
<p>
<b>Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to the Social Security Administration, spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance. </b>
<p>
This would combine the agencies responsible for oversight of public and private retirement programs and result in more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a semi-independent, wholly owned government corporation modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and guided by a board of directors. Congress should fund the PBGC separately and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.59 
<p>

<b> V. ELIMINATE OBSOLETE WORKPLACE STANDARDS.</b>
<p>
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) administers and directs programs under a variety of federal labor laws and executive orders. The Wage and Hour Division: <p><ul>
<li>Administers and enforces federal minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act; 
<p>
<li>Determines prevailing wage rates for federal contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts;
<p>
<li>Registers farm labor contractors and enforces worker protections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; and
<p>
<li> Enforces provisions and restrictions of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. </ul>
<p>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs administers and enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended, which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in hiring. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers the three basic federal workers' compensation laws:  the Federal Employees Compensation Act, Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and Black Lung Benefits Act.
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's major labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but America's labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. The heavy burden of outdated and restrictive workplace rules reduces job opportunities and real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and requirements now makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers and is one of the forces leading employers to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor. 
<p>
The House of Representatives recently voted to reduce ESA's FY 1996 spending by 12.2 percent.60  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 9.9 percent reduction. Both bills prohibit funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, and the House plans to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
A number of bills to reform America's labor laws also have been introduced in Congress.61  The House recently passed the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act (H.R. 743) to allow employers to create employee involvement committees. A similar bill (S. 295) has been introduced in the Senate by Nancy Kassebaum.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Nullify Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all affirmative action provisions in federal law.</b>
<p>
Executive Order 11246, as amended,62 and its implementing regulations prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity for protected groups. Contractors must develop a written plan covering each of their establishments that includes remedial steps to correct underutilization of available women and minorities.
<p>
Federal contractors and subcontractors already must comply with existing civil rights laws without the executive order. Laws requiring non-discrimination in employment are enforced through agencies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice. There are other, more equitable ways to expand employment opportunities for all Americans without requiring preferential hiring simply because individuals belong to certain groups. In addition, the regulations to implement Executive Order 11246 impose 20.4 million hours of paperwork (9,795 full-time, year-round workers) on federal contractors and subcontractors, the single largest DoL paperwork requirement.
<p>
A recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action concluded that "the federal government can no longer make decisions based on the race of the individual except when there is a compelling governmental interest."63  Concurring, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction."  Further, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."
<P>
<b>Repeal the Davis-Bacon and related Acts and the Service Contract Act.</b>
<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs.64  Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded. This year's budget process may be the only real opportunity to put an end to this Depression-era law that contributes to racial discrimination, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If only the facts were at issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would be repealed. However, repeal is threatened once again by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve their generous subsidies. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American workers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<p>
The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost of federal service contracts by as much as $500 million per year and, like Davis-Bacon, creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled entry-level workers, who tend to be poor and minorities. DoL has long been criticized for the way it operates under this law. Despite two amendments,65 the SCA continues to suffer from statutory ambiguity, administrative problems, arbitrary requirements, and capricious enforcement.66  The General Accounting Office has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's "inability to administer the act efficiently and effectively" and because "it is impractical, in our opinion, to make 'prevailing wage' determinations under the act in a consistently equitable manner."67  Outdated by extensions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to service workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic burden that should be repealed.
<p>
<b>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options.</b>
<p>
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers. However, in today's economy where both parents likely are working, its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than help. The FLSA deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home. For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 35 hours one week  in order to attend a child's parent-teacher conference, in exchange for working 45 hours the following week, either must forgo five hours of pay or have an employer willing to pay overtime the second week. Congress should extend to private workers the same freedom that federal employees have -- flextime -- and enable employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options to their workers.68  
<p>
<b>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions on the ability for employers to create employee involvement structures.</b>
<p>
Employee involvement (EI) structures are a way to involve workers in business operations to improve productivity, safety, and customer service. Under current law, however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly legal between employers and employees are those that occur in traditional collective bargaining arrangements. Employers can listen to their nonunion employees but cannot respond to their views without risking litigation and significant legal costs. Further, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations noted that the most legally vulnerable EI structures are "those that take a broader, more systemic approach to participation that the evidence suggests have the greatest long-term, positive effects on economic performance."69  Congress should reform the National Labor Relations Act to exempt EI structures formed to address issues of quality, productivity, safety, and customer service.  
<p>
<b>Transfer immigrant worker oversight and enforcement functions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</b>
<p>
In the late 1940s, DoL's immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then, the federal government has shifted some of its immigration responsibilities to employers70 and added new DoL enforcement requirements.71  Responsibility for immigration policy once again is fragmented. Transferring DoL's immigration functions to the INS would combine the responsibility for federal immigration programs in one agency and facilitate more efficient immigration policy coordination.
<p>
<b>Transfer any remaining ESA programs to more appropriate departments or sub-Cabinet agencies.</b>
<p>
Legal enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act should be transferred to the Justice Department. Responsibility for federal workers' compensation laws and black lung benefits -- both primarily health-related income assistance programs -- should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Responsibility for all employment discrimination complaints should be consolidated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
<b>VI. GIVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.</b><p>
The American statistical system is one of the most decentralized data-producing systems in the world. Eleven specifically statistical federal agencies spend more that $1 billion annually. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has found more than 70 individual agencies spending more than $500,000 a year for statistical activities and estimates that the federal government spent at almost $2.7 billion in FY 1994 for statistical operations.72
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary federal data-gathering agency in the broad field of labor economics and prices. It has no enforcement or regulatory functions and operates somewhat independently from DoL. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data relating to employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor market. It also publishes data on consumer and producer prices and workplace health and safety. Most of the data are collected by voluntary surveys conducted by the BLS and the Bureau of the Census, or on a cooperative basis with state agencies.
<p>
Change is needed. The current structure of the federal statistical system is inefficient and ineffective.73  The problems with the U.S. statistical system result directly or indirectly from fragmentation across the federal government. The system has neither the advantages that come from centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong coordination of a decentralized system. As currently organized, it will be hard-pressed to meet the data demands of a technologically advanced and increasingly global economy.
<p>
The House recently voted to reduce BLS spending for fiscal year 1996 by 1.3 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 6.1 percent reduction. Both bills double the amount appropriated for revising the consumer price index (CPI).
<p>


What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Transfer the BLS into a new sub-Cabinet Bureau of National Statistics along with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</b>
<p>
Consolidating the Census Bureau, the BLS, and the BEA in a centralized system is "the most effective solution to the problems of the federal statistical system."74  A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. The BNS also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Incorporating the Bureau of Economic Analysis into the BNS is essential if the new bureau is to influence priorities for the broad array of statistical information required for the national income and product accounts. Reforming the system will assure a much better use of the tax dollars currently being spent on statistics.
<p>
Three major concerns need to be addressed. 
<p>
1) The BNS should be run by an independent Board of Directors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a fixed term similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
<p>
2) To ensure that the public's response to voluntary surveys is not jeopardized, the BNS should be given complete legal confidentiality for all information collection activity. Data sharing arrangements with other agencies, for statistical purposes only, could be maintained under carefully controlled procedures approved and administered by the BNS Board.
<p>
3) Any administrative savings should stay within the agency to improve the quality and quantity of the nation's statistical information. Providing accurate information to the public and their state and local representatives is an important function of the federal government. 
<p>
<b> VII. ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE.</b><p>
The Office of the American Workplace (OAW), created in 1993 by Secretarial Order, is responsible for administering and directing discretionary workplace programs that encourage the development of "high performance" workplaces.75  OAW also is responsible for administering statutory programs to certify employee protections of various federally sponsored transportation programs, overseeing the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions, and assisting unions in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently has assigned OAW the task of implementing President Clinton's executive order prohibiting the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors. 
<p>
OAW carries out these functions through two offices:  the Office of Workplace Programs (OWP) and the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). In FY 1995, of OAW's total budget authority of $31.4 million and 400 employees, $7.4 million went to OWP and $24.0 million to OLMS. For FY 1996, the President requested $41.8 million, or 33 percent more. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have voted to eliminate OWP and transfer OLMS to DoL's Employment Standards Administration. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Workplace Programs. </b>
<P>
In addition to setting up a clearinghouse for information on high performance workplaces, OWP provides funds to unions to train labor leaders on what constitutes a high performance workplace. However well intentioned this may be, the federal government should not subsidize businesses and unions to teach them about the concept of "high performance" workplaces. This is more appropriately a function of business associations, chambers of commerce, and labor unions themselves. It is corporate and union welfare and should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Labor-Management Standards.</b>
<p>
Nor should American tax dollars subsidize unions to "assist" them in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. These functions should be eliminated, the number of full-time equivalent positions in OLMS should be reduced significantly, and OLMS field offices should be eliminated. The investigative and union oversight functions of the office should be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Department of Justice.76
<p>
<b>Repeal Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. </b>
<p>
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration Act of 1964 gives public transit the most restrictive labor environment in America. To receive federal funds, local public transit agencies must pay employees up to six years of severance pay if their jobs are eliminated as a result of efficiency improvements. No other workers enjoy such special privilege. Should public transit agencies pursue service improvements that lead to fewer workers, their mandated 13(c) liability can surpass the federal funds they receive.77  Although many local governments are trying to improve their public transportation systems through competitive contracting and allowing private sector suppliers to operate, Section 13(c) discourages or blocks these efforts. 
<p>
Section 13(c) also adds to public transit costs and discourages efficiency by giving labor unions special privileges. Before a public transit agency can receive a federal grant, DoL must certify that special protective arrangements for local transit workers have been made. DoL generally interprets this to require negotiation of special labor agreements between the public transit agency and its union.
<p>
Public transit agencies want desperately to improve service and lower costs. At the same time, however, unnecessarily high labor costs make them unable to withstand a long period without federal funding. Section 13(c) has created this "Catch 22" for most public transit authorities and should be repealed. 
<p>
<b> VIII. STREAMLINE DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT.</b><P>
The Departmental Management (DM) appropriation provides funding for a number of different programs that manage, set policy, and oversee its implementation at DoL. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Solicitor's office, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Civil Rights office, and the Women's Bureau.
<P>
In FY 1995, DM's total budget authority was about $155 million and 2,548 employees. Over half the budget, $82 million, went to legal services and adjudication, and $26 million went to executive direction. For FY 1996, the President requested $173.1 million, or almost 12 percent more. The House recently voted to reduce DM spending for FY 1996 by 13.2 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 7.6 percent reduction. The House substantially downsized the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, noting in its report that the bureau's activities are primarily discretionary and could be carried out by the Office of the Trade Representative or the State Department. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), the Women's Bureau, the Civil Rights office, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. </b>
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Women's Bureau, Civil Rights office, and National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee either duplicate existing federal functions or perform unneeded functions. 
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs coordinates the Department's international responsibilities, including relations with international organizations, estimating the impact of trade proposals, and ensuring compliance with worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law. These functions duplicate those carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.
<p>
The purpose of the Women's Bureau is to promote "the welfare of wage earning women and [seek] to improve their working conditions, to increase their efficiency and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."78  The mission of the Department of Labor, including the Secretary, is to promote the employment opportunities of all Americans. There is no need for a separate bureau devoted to women, just as there are none devoted to other minorities, such as African Americans, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. 
<p>
The Civil Rights office ensures compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other regulatory nondiscrimination provisions in programs receiving financial assistance from DoL, and promotes equal opportunity in these programs and activities. It also makes sure that all Department of Labor employees and applicants are treated equally. There should not be a separate appropriation for this activity within the department. All agencies within DoL should ensure that their programs are carried out in a nondiscriminatory manner. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against by the department can file complaints under existing laws enforced by the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
Despite what federal officials may think, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee is not a necessary federal function. After funding for job training is consolidated into state block grants, the states should be given the option of setting up their own committees, in the event they decide that such committees would be useful, and funding them out of their block grants.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but U.S. labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. Further, proliferating workplace legislation and DoL regulations to enforce them present a significant barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs, as well as to increases in real wages. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws, and this means a fundamental rethinking of both the Department of Labor and federal labor policy. 
<p>
The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department. If the recommendations in this study are implemented, $10.5 billion can be saved for the taxpayer from 1996 to 2000.
<p>
	Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Labor does not fit this description. Administering unemployment insurance, three-quarters of DoL's budget, is a state function and should be devolved to the states as a first step toward privatization. Ineffective federal job training programs should be consolidated into state block grants and rigorously studied. OSHA should be significantly reformed, combined with MSHA, and set up as an independent sub-Cabinet agency free from political influence. America's statistics would be improved by combining the BLS with the Bureau of the Census as another sub-Cabinet agency. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down. What remains of the Department of Labor, less than 2 percent of its budget, then could be transferred to more appropriate Cabinet-level agencies like HHS, Treasury, and Justice. There is no reason for these remaining functions to be conducted by an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<li>    The current 0.8 percent FUTA tax rate has two components:  a permanent tax rate of 0.6 percent and a temporary surtax of 0.2 percent. The surtax was passed in 1976 to restore depleted state UI accounts and was supposed to expire in 1987. The surtax has been extended four times, primarily to fund extended benefit programs, since 1987 and now is supposed to expire in 1998.<p>

This study concluded that extending the duration of UI benefits from six months to one year will increase the mean duration of unemployment by four to five weeks. Examples of federal programs that increase the duration of UI benefits are the Extended Benefits Program and Trade Adjustment Assistance.<p>
<li>    In today's economy, the primary purpose of the UI/ES system is to move workers whose jobs are permanently lost into new ones as quickly as possible.<p>
 <li>   Daniel S. Hamermesh, "New Estimates of the Incidence of Payroll Tax," <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>, Winter 1979. Research on the incidence of taxation generally has concluded that payroll taxes are borne predominantly, if not completely, by labor in the long run through lower real wages.<p>
<li>    Bruce D. Meyer, " Policy Lessons from the U.S. Unemployment Insurance Experiments," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 4197, October 1992. The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded. <p>
<li>   The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent. However, employers in states with federally approved UI programs (all 50 states) may credit 5.4 percent (90 percent FUTA offset) against the 6.2 percent tax rate, making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent.<p>
 <li>   The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate (TUR) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate (IUR). The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI. The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state. Eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) have approved the use of TUR triggers.<p>
<li>    Benefits generally are paid to workers with substantial labor force attachment who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- not to workers who quit their jobs voluntarily, who were fired for cause, or who have had no recent employment, such as those who are entering or reentering the labor force. Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self-employed, certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers, railroad workers, and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits.<p>
<li>    FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) have reached their statutory limits. The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out. Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs.<p>

<li>   The TAA provides benefits to workers for 78 weeks, while the vast majority of other laid-off Americans, who qualify only for unemployment insurance, receive just 26 weeks of benefits.<p>
<li>    In its 1993 semiannual report to Congress, the Department of Labor Inspector General (OIG) discovered in a nine-state audit of the program that "After 19 years of operation, neither ETA nor the states know whether the TAA program is effective" in achieving its original goals of helping workers find suitable employment. The OIG found that only one in ten former participants "found new training-related employment that paid or had the potential to pay suitable wages."  Although the Act requires that participants enroll in approved training courses, " participants who did not wish to attend training were almost always granted waivers without losing entitlement allowance." <p>

September 7, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	"Ideas have consequences." This simple truism became the battle cry of the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. But it was true long before Ronald Reagan's term in the White House, and it is no less true today. America still needs the ability to explain its policies and to educate people around the globe about American values and the principles of freedom. Because so many in the world yearn to enjoy the freedom which the United States represents, the world still needs desperately to hear America's voice. 
<p>
	Reconvening this week after the August recess, Members of Congress should remember that although ideas have consequences, they will be impotent and inconsequential if they cannot be heard in the global marketplace of ideas. Congress will soon complete work on appropriations bills that provide funds for foreign operations and international broadcasting. In its zeal to cut wasteful and unnecessary government spending, the Republican majority is poised to cripple the Voice of America, even though VOA is both America's primary means of conveying ideas and information overseas and a cost-effective and strategically effective component of U.S. foreign policy. 
<p>
	 The congressional raid on U.S. government international broadcasting is an unfortunate convergence between Members who believe foreign affairs accounts are politically attractive targets for budget slashing and the Clinton Administration, whose lack of a coherent foreign policy means, among other deficiencies, inadequate support for international broadcasting. As a result, the 104th Congress is about to reduce the Voice of America's budget by as much as $54 million, a small amount in terms of the federal budget, yet a cut which will have disproportionate, far-reaching consequences. It could silence America's most effective voice in the global marketplace of ideas, even though VOA's benefits -- potential and actual -- far exceed the modest amount in the Administration's FY 1996 budget request ($395 million).
<p>
	Before embarking upon a budget-cutting course that is penny-wise but pound-foolish, Congress needs to take a closer look at the vital role VOA plays in foreign policy and public diplomacy. Instead of subjecting VOA to a false economy, Congress should provide enough funds to ensure that it remains the nation's international broadcasting flagship.
<p>

<b>IDEAS FUEL DEMOCRACY AND FREE-MARKET REFORM</b>
<p>
Social scientists never tire of explaining that today is the Age of Information. Television is ubiquitous. The transistor has made cheap portable radios common even in the world's poorest nations. Multi-spectrum radio broadcasting, proliferating cable, satellite, and direct broadcast television, microwaves, computers and fax modems, and other means of high-speed transmission have linked the world as never before. In the modern world, information dissemination and content have become indispensable instruments of state power. 
<p>
	 Information is no longer neutral; it has "strategic" value, as recent history demonstrates. In the victory of America and the West over Soviet Communism, military power kept the "Evil Empire" contained. But it was ideas and information, not bombs and bullets, that ultimately brought the Soviet edifice crumbling down. 	
<p>
	 However, if it is technologically the Age of Information, politically it is the Age of Chaos. The end of the superpower condominium has unleashed potent new forces kept contained by 45 years of Cold War. Today sub-national, tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict are battering peace and stability in the world as new nations and new ideologies struggle to be born. In this dangerous and uncertain world the interests of the United States will be challenged in ways Americans cannot now imagine. The ability to convey ideas and information will remain a necessary component of American foreign policy. America must be able to shape the course of the world through a voice that encourages the forces of freedom and discredits the forces of oppression.
<p>
	Perhaps it is self-evident, but in this era of dramatic global change it bears repeating that human behavior is determined by what one believes. There is a flow to history and culture; and its wellspring is the inner life of the mind -- thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs, and the passions they engender. This is especially true of the corporate actions of men and women, such as political decisions. The results of their thoughts flow through their hands or from their tongues and into the external world. Why else do dictators expend such immense efforts to control the content and flow of information?. What is usually the first objective of a <i>coup d'etat</i>? The answer is obvious -- radio and television stations. 
<p>
	 It is important to remember that the VOA did not begin as a weapon of the Cold War or in response to Soviet Communism. It was launched in 1942 at the beginning of World War II to counter Nazi propaganda, to reassure America's allies, and to give hope to people struggling against tyranny. Today the Voice of America is the nation's sole worldwide broadcasting service, reaching 100 million regular listeners over a network of shortwave, AM, and FM stations in English and 46 other languages. During the Persian Gulf War, VOA was America's only means of rebutting Saddam Hussein's propaganda aimed at the people of Iraq and was a key voice in reaching the nations of the Allied coalition.
<p>
	 VOA told the peoples of Nazi-occupied Europe during the darkest days of World War II:. "The news may be good or bad. We will tell you the truth.". Today VOA still follows this mandate, as required under its Charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415), which obliges VOA to provide "a consistently reliable source of news and information" based on accuracy, balance, comprehensiveness, and objectivity.
<p>
	The accuracy and objectivity of America's radio voice are having a profound impact on nations emerging from 45 years behind the Iron Curtain. The Open Media Research Institute surveyed 400 leaders in government and politics, the military, religion, higher education, media, and private enterprise in the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic States, and in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. According to this survey approximately 18 percent of the elites of these nations are regular listeners to VOA programming. In the Baltics, over 40 percent of decision-makers interviewed were regular listeners. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still needed despite the new freedoms enjoyed by their own news media.1<p>	The importance of getting America's message to the elites of emerging nations simply cannot be overstated. President Lech Walesa of Poland and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic have publicly confirmed the role which America's international broadcasting, including the VOA, has played in building democracy in their countries. In Ukraine, VOA's "Window on America" is said to be the most popular radio program in the country.
<p>

	VOA's example of free, uncensored news and objective, balanced features encourages the development of a free press among the listening nations, even when the Voice presents a less than flattering portrait of America. The example is strengthened by VOA's policy of maintaining a clear distinction between editorials, which speak in the name of the U.S. government, and news programming. 
<p>

	 The Cold War with the Soviet Empire may be over, but a cold war of a global nature -- the struggle over which ideas legitimize human governance -- is not over. The ideals of representative and limited government, of free enterprise and free institutions, have prevailed for the time being over Marxism-Leninism in much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but by no means have they been accepted everywhere in the world. Most of the world's people still live under some sort of despotism or suffer from revolution and civil war.
<p>

	The VOA is America's force projection in this continuing global struggle between competing political principles and social values. The United States is under no obligation to convert the entire world to America's system of beliefs, but it is widely acknowledged that democratic nations are more peaceable and less likely to challenge U.S. interests than dictatorships. Both advocates of a foreign policy based on national self-interest and those who stress the moral component of foreign policy can support a vigorous, information-rich public diplomacy that makes the world friendlier and more compatible with American interests. As long as America can engage in this global cold war of ideas with information instead of military force, the struggle can remain "cold."
<p>

	Even the Kurds -- embattled on all sides and fighting among themselves -- believe the broadcast word is mightier than the sword in building an independent nation. Instead of using scarce resources to buy arms, Kurds are creating a London-based television service to beam Kurdish-language programming to Europe and the Middle East as a "better weapon to win a homeland" for their people.2 <p><b>INFORMATION AS A TOOL OF U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY </b><p>Today's world contains rogue states and hostile nations whose main weapon is the well-disseminated lie -- lies about America's goals, interests, methods. To perpetuate themselves, these hostile regimes depend on propaganda, first to control their own populations and then to justify aggression abroad. It is an essential feature of modern dictatorships, one which they have in common despite differences in geography and culture, to consolidate power by controlling public opinion without having to answer to any traditional consensus or transcendent definition of right and wrong. 
<p>

	 Many Russians now freed from the yoke of Communism have remarked that the most hated feature of the Soviet regime was not the possibility of arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag, but the pervasive falsehoods that touched every aspect of life and tainted everything they touched. This kind of morally inverted society built on propaganda can be altered only through rebuttal by trustworthy, countervailing information over time. The only antidote to falsehood is truth, but truth is impotent unless America has the means to convey it into the domain of the lie.
<p>

	Today the threat of Soviet Communism has receded, only to be replaced by a new threat. By now it is universally acknowledged that revolutionary Islam represents one of the main challenges to democracy and American interests in the world -- not Islam <i>per se</i>, but the revolutionary movement which draws legitimacy from a militant and politicized interpretation of Islamic theology. 
<p>

	 The vast majority of the world's Muslims are not part of radical movements. Indeed, the governments of moderate and friendly Muslim countries are the primary targets of Islamic radicals. Today revolutionary Islamic regimes have ample money and access to the latest information technology. In this global contest for hearts and minds, VOA is the most potent means America has to combat the rising tide of a revolutionary ideology in which Mohammed has replaced Marx. 
<p>

	 Muslim revolutionaries realize the value of information as a tool of their strategy. Radio Tehran broadcasts daily in 23 languages, in English and European languages as well as languages native to the Middle East and the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union. Significantly, Radio Tehran broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian to Bosnia, constantly reinforcing the theme throughout all of its coverage area that the United States is the faithless enemy of Islam and that America has imperialist designs on the Persian Gulf and the oil-rich Middle East. Though these charges are false, there are enough points of reference in the message to make it plausible to Tehran's audience and give the falsehood a political impact. 
<p>
	 VOA's daily presence through its Arabic and Farsi services is balancing the picture and countering Iran's daily radio diet of anti-Western propaganda. VOA's 100-kilowatt AM transmitter in Kuwait will be upgraded to begin transmitting next year at 600 kilowatts and will reach all of Iraq and most of Iran, where the Voice already has an 11 percent listenership. America's message to Iran also sustains hope among those who suffer persecution at the hands of the mullahs, like members of the Baha'i and Christian faiths. In this part of the world where America has had to fight to defend its vital interests, VOA gives an accurate picture of a free society which respects all religions and treats Islam respectfully, reporting, for example, that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States. 
<p>

	In the Balkans, VOA's shortwave and medium-wave AM stations around the periphery of the zone of conflict provide a thorough blanket of coverage. Broadcasting three hours a day in Serbian and one hour daily in Croatian, VOA is the largest international broadcaster in the region and enjoys a 32 percent listenership in Sarajevo. It also broadcasts in Albanian to Kosovo, another potential flashpoint in the Balkans. 
<p>

	The recent NATO air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia provoked bitter denunciations in Belgrade and in Serb-controlled Bosnia. In Moscow the NATO air campaign against Russia's traditional allies also prompted vocal condemnation. With their tight control of news media, Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb leaders stir up ethnic hatred and keep violent passions high. They black out all information about Serb atrocities and war crimes charges in the West. Disinformation and falsehoods are a major part of their overall strategy. Without the VOA there would be no voice explaining U.S. and Allied actions to the people most involved or rebutting the false charges the Serbs use to legitimize their aggression.
<p>

	VOA recently began a refugee hotline as part of the Serbo-Croatian service. It offers broadcast facilities to reach separated family members in the Balkans, who can call a VOA telephone number and leave a message on the Serbo-Croatian line. VOA then broadcasts the message to reach separated family members. Numerous families have been reunited through this service. 
<p>

	This is more than a humanitarian gesture, one whose exact value is impossible to quantify. If American soldiers ever have to enter Bosnia, for example, as part of a NATO operation to cover the withdrawal of the U.N. Protection Force, America may find out how much it is worth. It is conceivable that the goodwill engendered by this service will save American lives if that day does come.
<p>
	In another volatile region of the world, VOA is broadcasting in Korean to counter the propaganda of the Stalinist North on the Korean Peninsula. In China, VOA is America's link to the most populous nation in the world. China's emergence as a global power and America's relations with the Chinese will be among the defining issues in the 21st century and will affect the future structure of world politics. It is absolutely essential for the U.S. to maintain an active presence there. The audience for VOA's Mandarin service has grown to include 70 percent of China's college students since the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Such programs as the "Harry Wu Watch," after the arrest of the human rights activist, and "China Forum" generate more than 4,000 faxes and letters to VOA per month from Chinese listeners. 
<p>

	VOA's Tibetan service recently expanded its broadcasts from a half hour to two hours a day. It is the only independent news source for the Tibetan-speaking areas of the world. In fact, the communist regime in Beijing devotes considerable efforts to jamming the VOA's Chinese and Tibetan broadcasts. Devoting scarce resources to jamming attests eloquently to VOA's effectiveness.
<p>

	In Myanmar, better known as Burma, the democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently was freed by the ruling military junta after nearly six years of house arrest. The only reliable sources of this news were the VOA's Burmese language service and the BBC. 
<p>

<b>Surrogate Radios</b>
<p>

In evaluating the role of broadcasting in global strategy, it is important to distinguish between the VOA and the so-called surrogate radios -- Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia, and Radio Mart, which broadcasts to Cuba. The mission of the surrogate radio services is to tell listeners what is happening in their own country, to provide information which their own radios would provide if their countries were free. This difference in missions is a matter of U.S. law. The surrogates also have a vital mission, but they do not explain or defend U.S. government policy; nor do they present U.S. values and institutions. That mission is unique to VOA. 
<p>

	 Under the International Broadcasting Act of 1994, federal funding for RFE/RL will end after 1999. And when Fidel Castro's grip on his island prison ends, as it inevitably must, federal funding for the Office of Cuban Broadcasting and Radio Mart probably will end. But there still will be a need for VOA to perform its role as America's voice to the world. 
<p>

	 Ultimately, no information strategy can be a substitute for adequate military power. Force of arms will always be the final argument when nothing else suffices. But it is far better to shape the world's events in advance, if possible, through "soft" means like information. Using broadcasting successfully as a tool of global strategy can create conditions of friendship and convergence of interests that make conflict unnecessary and give America options other than the last resort of armed force. 
<p>


<b>MYTHS ABOUT THE VOA AND U.S. GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING</b>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. government's international broadcasting programs propagate five myths to justify public neglect of the VOA or reduction of its resources.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Myth #1: The VOA can be privatized.</b>
<p>
The VOA provides both a means of public diplomacy to promote America's values to the rest of the world and an official voice for the U.S. government to explain and defend its policies. In other words, VOA is an instrument of policy, not just a source of entertainment. Private entities simply cannot carry out this function. Moreover, the VOA's network of facilities is extensive, operating in many remote corners of the world. It is inconceivable that private operations would have the inclination, resources, expertise, or profit-making incentive to take over such an extensive network. In the 1980s the U.S. government invested heavily to upgrade the facilities for international broadcasting. It would be a waste of that investment to curtail VOA's scope just when the return on that investment is beginning to be realized.
<P>

<b><li>Myth #2:. We have CNN and do not need the VOA.</b>
<p>
CNN does not reach an audience as wide, diverse, and strategically targeted as VOA's --. in their own languages. CNN does not provide the same content or policy-significant information; nor does it adequately explain or defend the positions of the United States. In fact, CNN's popular "World Report" program actually does the reverse. Its correspondents feed policy-significant information from foreign governments to the U.S. and other audiences.
<p>
<li><b>Myth #3: The Cold War is over, so the VOA is unnecessary.</b>
<p>
Those who make this assertion have a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between VOA and the surrogate radios like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Mart, which are products of the Cold War. VOA is more necessary than ever to give America a voice in the highly competitive global marketplace where the struggle for democracy and freedom is still being waged. Other nations, many unfriendly to America, are speaking effectively into this marketplace. The revolutionary regime of Iran is a notable example. Why should America now choose not to engage in this vital war of ideas?
<p>

<li><b>Myth #4: Government broadcasting has plenty of fat; all government broadcasting should be cut.</b>
<p>
Since 1992 VOA has reduced its broadcast staff by 25 percent, cut direct broadcast hours from 1,080 to 850 hours weekly, abolished or converted numerous language services, eliminated 14 senior management positions, and cut 170 other line positions to meet mandated budget reductions. VOA is now at a core operating level. Any further cuts will force VOA to eliminate entire language services to critical world regions.
</ul><p>
It can be argued that the need for surrogate radios will diminish over time if and when democracy, accompanied by freedom of information, takes hold in existing dictatorships and formerly totalitarian countries. But VOA needs to stabilize at a funding level commensurate with its vital mission, and not be subjected to further cuts. As stated in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, "If Congress wants to cut federal broadcasting, the better target is domestic public TV, for which a multitude of commercial alternatives do exist."3 <p><b>EFFECTIVE BROADCASTING REQUIRES ADEQUATE FUNDS</b>
<p>
	The Administration's FY 1996 budget request for VOA is $395 million. But VOA faces a $10 million reduction from the 1996 request mandated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the State Department authorization bill. 
<p>
	The Foreign Relations Committee report accompanying the authorization bill acknowledges that budget authority for international broadcasting (not counting the separate radio facilities construction account) in the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 is 21 percent below the operating level in 1994 ($487 million). In other words, VOA already is operating at the margins because the agency chose to absorb past funding cuts by reducing staff and broadcast hours across the board in order to keep critical language services on the air. 
<p>
	If Senate appropriators agree to the $385 million recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee, VOA will have to reduce direct broadcasting from 850 to 715 hours per week, eliminate another four language services, and end all shortwave transmissions to Latin America.
<p>
	The situation on the House side is even more bleak. The House Appropriations Committee marked up its State Department appropriations bill before the August recess, providing $341 million, or $54 million below the FY 1996 budget request. The committee's report acknowledges that a cut of this magnitude "could mean a reduction of at least 400 personnel, and the possible cessation of broadcasting in as many as 20 languages. These reductions come on top of the major reorganization/downsizing that occurred because of the 1994 Act (the International Broadcasting Act of 1994), which has resulted in staffing reductions of 900 at RFE/RL and 350 at VOA."
<p>
	If outlays fall to this level, the VOA in effect will cease to be a global broadcaster. America's voice will fall silent in vital corners of the globe as VOA scales down to a narrow regional focus, like Radio Australia or Radio Netherlands. 
<p>
	A cut of this magnitude will allow only 535 hours of weekly broadcasting in about 20 languages, with greatly diminished English transmissions in three of six key global regions. VOA would lose about half of its estimated direct broadcast global audience. 
<p>
	As it completes work on the State Department appropriations bill, Congress should keep in mind that the Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget request for international broadcasting was inadequate from the start and represents a substantial cut from prior year operating levels. At a bare minimum, House and Senate appropriators should fund the VOA at the $385 million recommended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
VOA embodies the importance of democratic culture and shared values, not just raw economic interests or military power, as a basis for international relations. America has a natural advantage in promoting U.S. interests and values in the world, unlike dictatorships which have to lie, since most people aspire to the values America represents. 
<p>
	The importance of moral leadership in the world by precept, by reasoning, and by sharing information is vital. It enables America to shape the world without having to use heavy-handed, intrusive means. Broadcasting America's values and views to 100 million people in critical areas of the globe for $395 million per year is money well spent, and a bargain at the price. To cut VOA further is indeed, in the words of VOA Director Geoffrey Cowan, the unilateral disarmament of the Information Age.

<h2>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</h2>

INTRODUCTION
<p>
The congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1996<i>1</i> calls for elimination of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). With its many sweeping changes, this resolution is both symbolic of the change in philosophy of this Congress and a very practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to dismantle the Department of Commerce,<i>2</i> and both the House Commerce Committee and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have held hearings.<i>3</i> The congressional leadership has indicated that the FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill will include language to close down the Commerce Department.<i>4</i>
<p>
The idea of closing the department comes entirely from Congress. The Administration's reinventing government initiative barely touches the Department of Commerce, which indeed cannot be "reinvented."  The proper course of action is to dismantle the agency, which is little more than a collection of disparate programs. The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments.
<p>
To close the department, obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated, and duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments. Commercial activities should be privatized or ended -- leaving private corporations to pay for their own research, advertising, and other costs of doing business.
<p>
Specifically, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration.
<p>
<li>Use the staff of the Inspector General as the core for the transition work but abolish the office upon completion of this work.
<p>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, with outstanding loans to be collected by the Treasury Department.
<p>
<li>Consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistics Administration, within a single new independent agency.
<p>
<li>Transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department.
<p>
<li>Close the domestic offices of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the Minority Business Development Agency.
<p>
<li>Close down the Travel and Tourism Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the major part of the Commerce Department -- to other Cabinet departments that perform similar functions and close down the NOAA Corps.
<p>
<li>Establish the National Weather Service as an independent agency, with commercial services privatized.
<p>
<li>Establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation.
<p>
<li>Close down the Office of Technology Policy (Technology Administration).
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology and transfer residual functions to the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and privatize electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
</ul>
A Cabinet department reporting directly to the President of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies. Defenders of the Commerce Department argue that its various activities are valuable and useful, but no case has been made that these functions cannot be performed in the private sector or elsewhere in government, or that they are more valuable than the budgetary resources consumed.
<p>
Because Commerce would be the first Cabinet department in U.S. history to be dismantled, the absence of clear precedents and procedure presents a challenge for the House and Senate task forces chaired by Representative Dick Chrysler (R-MI) and Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Title I of both their bills establishes a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. An administrator of this temporary agency, appointed by the President, would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function" according to "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency" that the President must submit to Congress within six months. The agency would have three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property.<i>5</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>THE "DEPARTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS AFFAIRS"</b>
<p>
According to its own Inspector General, Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."<i>6</i>  The General Accounting Office reports the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" and shares "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<i>7</i>
<p>
Most of the department's resources have little or no relation to its purported mission:  "encourag[ing], serv[ing], and promot[ing] the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement."<i>8</i>  For instance, nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget (about $2 billion per year) and some 37 percent of its staff are in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts a number of environmental programs, including weather-related activities and research programs in marine and atmospheric sciences. Meanwhile, export promotion programs are distributed among ten different federal agencies:  "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<i>9</i>
<p>
Not only are many of the department's other activities -- especially its commercial operations  questionable as federal functions, but most badly need modernization and capital investment. Due to political and budgetary pressures, much of its capital stock is in disrepair. The GAO reports that departmental infrastructure -- "federal laboratories, a fleet of ships, weather satellites and radar, information systems, and other facilities and equipment -- will require investments of at least $7.4 billion over a 15-year period."<i>10</i>  The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>11</i>
<p>
The Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented."  The optimal course of action is indicated by the congressional budget resolution:  The department should be dismantled. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments, and its commercial activities should be privatized or closed.
<p>
The following analysis examines each organizational unit in the Commerce Department and recommends how to terminate or transfer its activities. For reference, data from the President's budget<i>12</i> are included in tables at the head of each section, with full-time employment levels and budget outlays in millions of dollars for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. In addition, major programs are detailed with obligated spending in millions of dollars.
<p>
<br>
<b>Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration</b><br>
The position of Commerce Secretary was established in 1913 when Labor was separated from the original Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established in 1903. The new agency was supposed to foster modern industrial production, rather than agriculture (which already enjoyed its own Cabinet department for 41 years). 
<p>
The Secretary of Commerce often is portrayed as the advocate of pro-business policies in a President's cabinet.<i>13</i> But public policy decisions affecting business generally are not made in the Commerce Department. Rather they come from such agencies as the President's Economic Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Commerce, in recent administrations, has served more often as an important fund-raiser for his President's election campaigns than as the architect of policies to help the nation's commerce.
<p>
</b>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
The administrative and coordination functions of the Secretary of Commerce and supporting bureaus under his immediate authority should be assigned to a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency, as provided in Title I of the legislation introduced by Representative Chrysler and Senator Abraham. The President would submit to Congress within six months "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency," and an administrator appointed by the President would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function."  This temporary agency would have no more than three years to execute the legislative mandate:  terminating programs, reassigning civil service personnel, and disposing of surplus property.<i>14</i>
<p>
<b>Inspector General</b><br>
The Office of Inspector General was established in 1978 to provide agency-wide audits and investigations and to recommend corrections for waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b> 
<p>
Congress should close the Office of Inspector General, although its personnel could form the core staff for the temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency established by the Chrysler-Abraham legislation.
<p>
<b>Economic Development Administration</b><br>
During the Johnson Administration, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 established a program of grants and other financial assistance to targeted cities and rural regions identified as "economically distressed."  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) also operates the Revolving Loan Fund, lending money to state and local governments that they in turn lend to businesses. The EDA will spend roughly $362 million in fiscal 1995 and $401 million in fiscal 1996.<i>15</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should close down the Economic Development Administration and direct the U.S. Treasury to collect all outstanding loans.<i>16</i> Congress approved $408 million in EDA spending for fiscal 1995, including $202 million for public works, $26 million in planning grants, $120 million for defense economic conversion, and $45 million in economic adjustment grants.<i>17</i> The EDA's development functions duplicate the activities of programs within the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.<i>18</i> On these grounds alone the program should be terminated.
<p>
Throughout the EDA's history, grants have been used by Members of Congress to distribute favors to constituents by "earmarking" funding to projects, bypassing the formal hearing process. This often means EDA grants go to locations with healthy economies that do not need federal assistance. In fact, the 17 states represented by the members of the relevant House and Senate subcommittees received $1.10 per capita in EDA grants during 1994, compared with 68 cents per capita in those states without representation, despite the fact that the average unemployment rate for the states represented was only 5.2 percent, compared with the national average of 5.4 percent that year.
<p>
The pork-barrel projects funded in the FY 1995 appropriation bill include:
<p>
<b>Egegik, Alaska.</b> The small fishing village of Egegik, with a population of 101, rests on the western shore of Alaska. Egegik has a per capita income of nearly $20,000 and is home to 23 families with an average family income of more than $60,000. Yet, in 1994, EDA granted the village $826,000 for the construction of a public dock. This is the equivalent of $8,178 for every person in Egegik.
<p>
<b>Key Biscayne, Florida.</b> A town of 8,854 residents, Key Biscayne is located in the middle of one of the most popular vacation spots in the country. Taking advantage of its beautiful climate and year-round influx of tourists, the local population enjoys a per capita income of more than $37,500. Yet Key Biscayne was awarded a 1994 EDA grant of $750,000 for the installation of a storm sewer system.
<p>
<b>St. Cloud, Minnesota.</b> St. Cloud University was awarded $91,512 in 1994 for the rehabilitation of its university center. According to EDA guidelines, these centers "must focus on service areas with significant economic distress."<i>19</i>  But this area hardly qualifies as distressed; St. Cloud has an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent and an above-average per capita income. Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.2 percent, the fourth lowest in the nation.
<p>
Almost all federal development programs, moreover, have proven to be expensive failures. Federal public works, job training, and regional development programs create few new jobs for the considerable amounts of money they cost to administer.<i>20</i> As a typical example, the General Accounting Office noted that no more than 35 percent of the beneficiaries of the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983 actually had been unemployed.<i>21</i> Another analysis suggested that only 84 previously unemployed people received jobs under the program at a cost of some $307,000 per job. The average private-sector job costs only about $40,000 to create.<i>22</i> Congress could do far more to spur economic development by closing down the EDA and using the savings to reduce the tax burden faced by private-sector employers, who are in a better position to create jobs.
<p>
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has  jurisdiction over the sections of the Commerce Department Dismantling Act that abolish EDA, voted instead on August 2 to support a measure that would preserve all of the pork barrel substance of the program.<i>23</i> It creates a new Undersecretary of Commerce and an Office of Economic Development to "replace" the current EDA and authorizes funding of $340 million per year for five years. Section 605 of the legislation even contains a provision to assure that EDA's functions will survive the elimination of the Commerce Department.
<p>
The proposed substitute bill adopts the model of the Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965 as a temporary response to poverty in 13 states, which today continues to provide highway construction grants and other financial aid to those states and local governments. The House committee not only reauthorized the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years, it created eight additional regional commissions as independent agencies, administering grants and loans for spending on government-financed projects. Up to 45 percent of the United States would qualify for pork barrel spending based on the following eligibility criteria:  per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; or an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period; or sudden and severe job loss; or "a pocket of poverty."<i>24</i>
<p>
This effort by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is extremely ill-advised. The proposal for a group of regional commissions to hand out grants and below-cost loans will only perpetuate and expand the unsound practices of subsidizing construction projects for political gain. 
<p>
<b>Bureau of the Census</b><br>
The Bureau of the Census was established as a permanent office in 1902. In addition to conducting the decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution, the bureau continuously gathers and tabulates a wide range of economic and demographic statistics.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer the U.S. Census Bureau to a new independent agency, a Bureau of National Statistics, which would house all data collection functions of the government. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood, in her recent <i>Organizing to Count:  Change in the Federal Statistical System,</i> puts forth a practical and detailed proposal for such reorganization.<i>25</i> A centralized statistical agency for the United States, similar to that of Canada, also was recommended in The Heritage Foundation's <i>Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America 26</i> and by the National Association of Business Economists.<i>27</i>
<p>
Section 207 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation would transfer the Census Bureau to the Treasury Department, which already performs substantial data collection in administering the Internal Revenue Code and collecting customs duties. The House and Senate task forces set out to reduce the size of government, not merely to rename existing bureaucracies (although Census would remain under their bill), so they call for no new independent federal agencies. But the benefits from establishing an independent Bureau of National Statistics are substantial. One of the most important would be to take statistical functions out of politicized bureaucracies and place them in an agency with no policy functions, thereby helping to insure that data collection is not influenced by political considerations.<i>28</i>
<p>
<b>Economics and Statistics Administration</b><br>
The Bureau of Economic Analysis was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1953. It reports to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who also oversees the Census Bureau. The two agencies together are known as the Economics and Statistics Administration, although the much larger Census Bureau is always identified separately. The agency draws upon the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and other data collection sources to compile the national income and product accounts and prepare forecasts and indicators of economic activity, widely followed by the news media and economists.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (along with the Census Bureau) within an independent Bureau of National Statistics, which would be responsible for all economic and demographic data collection and analysis for the federal government. Statistical functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health, and Labor also should be merged within the new agency.
<p>
Section 208 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation provides for transfer of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to the Federal Reserve System, which already performs substantial data collection as part of its banking regulation and monetary policy functions. As with the Census Bureau, sponsors are reluctant to establish any new federal agencies. The independent Federal Reserve, however, should not be assigned functions by Congress only tangentially related to its central role of monetary policy and policing the nation's payments system.
<p>
<b>International Trade Administration</b><br>
The International Trade Administration (ITA) was established in 1980 by the Secretary of Commerce and also encompasses the Bureau of Export Administration. The ITA is charged with promoting U.S. exports, both through "export promotion" advocacy and diplomatic intervention by Commerce officials. It also processes petitions by U.S. industries seeking antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory weapons to erect trade barriers against foreign producers and products.<i>29</i>
<p>
The Undersecretary for International Affairs also runs numerous other programs, such as the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service, which target a handful of industries for export development. The Undersecretary has a Deputy Undersecretary and a Director of Administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and three other Assistant Secretaries, plus the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (which has offices in 68 countries throughout the world as well as 47 district offices and 21 branch offices in the United States).
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer all Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, including direction of the Import Administration, Trade Development, and the Foreign Commercial Service (see chart above). The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy. Outside the United States, the Secretary of Commerce is perceived correctly as a minor Cabinet officer. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for U.S. currency exchange rates, U.S. policy in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and macroeconomic coordination among the G-7 industrialized countries. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring to the task.
<p>
To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements, a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries, the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department currently is responsible for all enforcement relating to matters involving taxation of transnational corporations, and this has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department.
<p>
As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct pricing of these imports and exports, both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.<i>30</i>
<p>
Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, which has been considered in hearings before the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, transfers all international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective but small agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees, which conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place all trade functions and more than 2,500 additional employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's economic leadership among world leaders, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports. Most witnesses at the recent congressional hearings expressed concerns about this change.
<p>
The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation<i>31</i> to establish a U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, along with the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. The insulation of trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the Administration.
<p>
<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to the new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had failed to correct a number of organizational problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer  --  without substantial reorganization  --  of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<p>
<br>
<b>Bureau of Export Administration</b><br>
The seven-year-old Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) administers export controls and coordinates the 17-nation Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The BXA's primary mission, therefore, is to safeguard the national interest by monitoring the export of potentially dangerous "dual-use" technologies.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department. Controlling the export of militarily useful commodities is a national security matter. If such technologies proliferate, the burden falls on the military to solve the problem. The Department of Defense deserves to be involved directly in the export licensing process because it is in the best position to judge the military utility of particular technologies. Putting the responsibility for export controls in the hands of the USTR or the Treasury Department implies that export controls should be treated as a trade issue, not a national security issue. It would be appropriate, however, for controversial licensing decisions to be appealed to the presidential level.
<p>
A special interagency report issued by the DOC with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State drew attention to the duplication of export control programs by the BXA. The four-agency report concluded:  "Consolidating these functions under the appropriate official will provide not only the proper oversight but also a more efficient and effective approach for tracking referred applications and examining export trends."<i>32</i>
<p>
The bill introduced by Senator Abraham transfers BXA functions to the Defense Department, but the version introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Chrysler transfers export licensing to the State Department.<i>33</i> The legislation introduced by Representative Mica transfers all export licensing functions to the proposed new Cabinet department for trade.<i>34</i> Both the Chrysler and Mica proposals would introduce greater uncertainty for key U.S. export industries such as aircraft, chemicals, and computer technology. Transferring all BXA responsibilities to the Defense Department would correct the problem of administrative conflicts between agencies, but exporters will object that dual-use technology sales will still be made by other countries. New procedures for review of the Defense Department's licensing decisions at the presidential level are needed to address this concern. The USTR, as the President's trade envoy, would be able to address these problems in trade policy and work to stop foreign export sales of dual-use technology.<i>35</i>
<p>
<b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><br>
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created by executive order in 1971 to help promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to show these businesses how to secure government contracts. The MBDA also provides funds for numerous Minority Business Development Centers (MBDCs) and American Indian Development Centers (IBDCs). Congress appropriated nearly $45 million for this program in fiscal 1995.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should close down the Minority Business Development Agency.<i>36</i> Although hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the MBDA since 1971, it has never been authorized formally by Congress. The MBDA's stated objective is to show businesses how to get government contracts, which is hardly the best way to encourage minority business development. Its approach merely duplicates the efforts of the failed 8(a) loan program of the Small Business Administration. Numerous reports have criticized this kind of preference program lending, finding that many of the small businesses favored by these kinds of programs are never able to stand alone without government assistance.<i>37</i>
<p>
In recent years, Congress has altered the MBDA's mission toward what is best described as corporate welfare, subsidizing high-technology firms and university research projects. These questionable expenditures duplicate dozens of other wasteful federal programs and seem little more than an attempt to justify the existence of an agency whose only rationale is dispensing special-interest funds.
<p>
The most effective way for Congress to help small minority-owned businesses would be to repeal labor regulations that generally frustrate small start-up firms and to amend the tax code to encourage investment in new small enterprises. In addition, minority firms serving the public sector would be helped by repeal of such discriminatory laws as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965. These laws raise the costs of government construction and service contracts by requiring companies that bid for such contracts to file mountains of paperwork documenting that they pay their workers above-market wages. Larger firms, which tend not to be minority-owned, have the advantage in bidding on such contracts. Repealing these laws would create a level playing field, instantly making smaller firms more competitive.
<p>
<b>Travel and Tourism Administration</b><br>
Created in 1981, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) spends nearly $20 million per year supposedly to promote tourism and recreational activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material, and running regional marketing shows. The USTTA administers the Disaster Relief Financial Assistance Program, which supports tourism for states recently hit by natural disasters. A new program is "developing a regional and global understanding within Governments on the relation between tourism and the environment."<i>38</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should close down the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.<i>39</i> There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in an activity already well handled by a vast private travel and tourism industry. In 1992, over 45 million foreign travelers visited the United States. These tourists spent more than $55 billion in this country, including $17 billion in fares to U.S. air carriers. 
<p>
Private industry thus has a significant financial interest in promoting tourism and does not need taxpayers to pay its advertising costs. The agency often works with private-sector organizations, including the Travel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the "Discover America International Pow Wow" or the "Pow Wow Europe."  There is no justification for federal involvement in such commercial promotional activities, with taxpayer funds used to pay for normal business marketing costs. Tourist promotion should be organized by private-sector interests without taxpayer assistance. The federal government does not belong in the travel industry.
<p>
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</b><br>
The $2 billion-per-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed in 1970 to consolidate commercially oriented ocean resource activities housed in other government agencies. NOAA's non-weather-related programs include a broad range of unrelated activities, such as commercial fisheries management, endangered species protection, habitat management, and research projects.<i>40</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should (1) separate the National Weather Service from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishing it as an independent agency with its functions reduced to specialized data collection and emergency warning activities,<i>41</i> and (2) reduce by 50 percent all non-Weather Service NOAA funding over five years. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should be transferred to the current Department of Interior. Most functions of the National Ocean Service should be privatized, and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet should be closed down. To accomplish this, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Return the functions performed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to what are now the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Coast Guard.<i>42</i>
<p>
<li>Impose fees on commercial and recreational fishing interests for fishing in federal waters. These fees should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with managing federal fishing stocks.
<p>
<li>Privatize most National Ocean Service functions.
<p>
<li>Terminate the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet.<i>43</i>
<p>
</ul>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consumes nearly 60 percent of the budget of the Department of Commerce and about 37 percent of its staff. NOAA oversees three significant non-Weather Service agencies:  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet. Many functions of these programs can be moved to other agencies, terminated, privatized, or turned over to the states.
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency managing marine mammal and commercial fisheries resources in federal marine waters. Savings can be achieved by transferring NMFS fisheries and protected species management activities to the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. NMFS fisheries monitoring and enforcement activities can be transferred to the Coast Guard, which already has policing powers over federal waters. Specific fisheries management functions can be transferred to the regional councils in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf states. Federal funding should be ended for state fisheries grants, commercial fisheries promotion and development programs, and aquaculture research. The seafood inspection program could be transferred to the FDA inspection program.
<p>
Currently, unlike commercial interests that use public lands and extract minerals, the commercial and recreational fishing industries pay nothing for the right to fish in federal waters. Because these resources are considered free, and because the industry is overcapitalized as the result of government loan and fishing vessel construction programs, the federal fishing stock is rapidly becoming depleted. Indeed, the government has paid millions in income supplements to Northeast fisherman who have seen their profits fall due to depleted stocks. It also spends millions on fisheries recovery programs, stock surveys, and hatcheries. The industry that benefits from these programs contributes nothing to their cost.
<p>
Charging commercial and recreational fishing interests a fee or requiring them to pay a royalty to the federal government would place a premium on fishing in federal waters. Such a fee system would help defray the cost of resource management and a smaller fishing fleet would reduce the stress placed on federal fishing stocks that has forced a moratorium on fishing from many ports.
<p>
The National Ocean Service (NOS) engages in such diverse activities as mapping and charting, oil spill research, coastal monitoring, and marine sanctuary management. Savings can be achieved by privatizing the agency's navigational and aeronautical charting and mapping activities currently performed by its National Geodetic Survey office.<i>44</i> The Geodetic Survey has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to chart navigational routes. There already are private companies drafting and marketing aeronautical services. Those activities that cannot be privatized should be transferred to the Coast Guard.
<p>
In addition, all regional coastal management programs, such as the $45 million Coastal Zone Management grant program and the $1 million Charleston area management plan, should be terminated and continued by state authorities if they choose to do so. Marine sanctuary programs can be merged into the Department of Interior or transferred to state governments.
<p>
The NOAA Corps also has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Today the Corps operates a fleet of 18 research vessels, as well as ten fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters. All of these functions should be terminated. The NOAA Corps is outmoded, and its research fleet, reports the GAO, is "old and technologically obsolete."  NOAA is calling for a 15-year, $1.9 billion program to modernize and purchase 24 vessels but "has no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represents the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements."<i>45</i>  Many of the Corps' charting activities are duplicated by private companies or the Coast Guard and need not be continued; its ships should be given to universities and marine research centers, and its aircraft to the Air Force. Hurricane research now can be performed entirely through satellites.
<p>
<b>National Weather Service</b><br>
The primary function of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to issue warnings of severe weather and floods in order to minimize life and property loss. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service -- an NWS adjunct -- operates the satellites producing the data the NWS uses to conduct its forecasts. The combined budgets of these programs comprise over half of NOAA's nearly $2 billion annual budget.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should reduce funding for the National Weather Service by 50 percent over three years. The Weather Service should reduce its role by specializing in data collection and emergency warning efforts. NOAA's satellite program could be merged with the redundant Air Force weather satellite program. An assessment then should be made of the possibility of privatizing polar-orbiting satellites and information distribution functions.<i>46</i>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and bureaucratic inefficiencies, the reputation of the National Weather Service is under fire. For example, according to the General Accounting Office, its modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>47</i> The only way to salvage this program is to reduce it to its core functions and introduce a significant dose of competition and private-sector capital.
<p>
Many functions of the Weather Service should be contracted out to private firms or simply transferred to the private sector. There are now approximately 300 private companies in the U.S. preparing and disseminating weather forecasts to businesses and the public on a commercial basis. According to the Commercial Weather Services Association, "private meteorologists and for-profit companies provide the public upwards of 85 percent of its weather forecasts, through television weathercasts, in newspaper weather maps, and on radio."<i>48</i>
<p>
The Weather Service should turn over to private firms its specialized services, such as fruit frost and agricultural forecasting, aviation forecasting, and fire weather forecasting, and privatize or close the regional climate centers that compete directly with private firms.<i>49</i> In addition, the Service spends about $200 million per year in "fringe" weather operations -- such as Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts and Decadal to Centennial Change -- which have little scientific validity and no practical value. These should be terminated.
<p>
The Service's field structure should be consolidated. The NWS has five headquarters offices, six regional offices, four national centers, and 334 field offices. This field office structure was designed when technology did not allow instant communication. Little has been done to alter this outmoded structure. Reducing these offices to no more than 25 facilities would save millions each year.
<p>
The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes privatizing such specialized NWS services as aviation, marine, and agricultural forecasting. The Office of Management and Budget projects these measures will save $40 million over five years. These recommendations are a small but good beginning.
<p>
<b>Patent and Trademark Office</b><br>
The patent system was established by the first Congress "to promote the progress of the useful arts" under Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. The registration of trademarks was first authorized in 1870. About 110,000 patents and about 69,700 trademarks were registered for fiscal 1992 alone, and 5,700 trademark registrations were renewed. A substantial portion of the annual Patent Office budget is funded by fees and other payments for publication and services by the public.
<p>
<br>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
Section 205 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation places the Patent and Trademark Office under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Other alternatives also have been proposed. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA) has introduced legislation<i>50</i> to establish an independent government corporation, an idea favored by the American Bar Association's Section on Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law.<i>51</i> An independent corporation, as proposed by the ABA, is clearly superior because this function can be fully self-financing. Documenting the ownership of patent and trademark rights is an activity that provides specific economic value to private parties, who can enforce these rights in civil lawsuits.
<p>
<b>Technology Administration (Office of Technology Policy)</b><br>
The Technology Administration (TA) was created in 1988 as a successor to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. This program oversees the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which are intended to promote commercially useable technology through research grants and subsidies. The office of the Undersecretary for Technology is an example of administrative overhead that can be eliminated by dismantling the Department of Commerce. The Undersecretary for Technology exercises executive and policy direction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technological Information Service, which is one of the largest publishing firms in the United States. The principal functions of the office, however, are to send representatives to interdepartmental meetings throughout the federal government and to supervise public relations activities, such as the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should close down the Technology Administration. The National Technical Information Service should be closed or privatized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, in addition to the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships program,<i>52</i> also should be abolished. The technology programs represent most clearly the failed theories of government-industry "partnership," in which bureaucrats pick projects to subsidize and encourage private-sector interests to pursue government funding rather than to invest in entrepreneurial research. The House of Representatives has voted to discontinue funding for the Advanced Technology Program.<i>53</i>
<p>
<b>National Technical Information Service</b><br>
The National Technical Information Service is a publishing firm within the federal government which collects and disseminates scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by government and foreign sources. It provides databases and other computer services to private-sector and governmental clients and essentially covers its costs by setting prices for its publications and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should privatize the National Technical Information Service. The NTIS is required by law to pay its own costs and usually does so. This Commerce Department program is essentially a publishing business which already prices its products and services to those who benefit from them. Since it has proven itself able to operate in a businesslike way on its own, it should be privatized immediately.
<p>
<b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b><br>
Most of Commerce's recent growth in spending is due to increases in the budget for industrial policy funding of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Overall, outlays for NIST are scheduled under current law to skyrocket from $167 million in FY 1994 to $466 million in FY 1995 -- a 180 percent increase in one year. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes that outlays for NIST nearly double by FY 1997, to $1.02 billion.
<p>
NIST's primary role is to promote commercial research and development projects. It carries out this mission through research projects and grant programs such as the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships(MEPs).<i>54</i> In FY 1996, the Clinton Administration proposes a 622 percent increase in budget authority for ATP, when compared with 1993 levels. MEP budget authority will jump by 716 percent over the same period under the Administration proposal. NIST, once called the National Bureau of Standards, also sets industry standards for various technological goods and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br>
Congress should close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This means ending NIST's Advanced Technology Program and its Scientific and Technical Research and Services, in addition to halting construction of new NIST research facilities. Weights and measures and other standards can be supervised by the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
Although the Clinton Administration and many in Congress believe industrial policy initiatives like NIST are the key to America's competitive success, the exact opposite is true. Industrial policy programs rarely encourage the development of vibrant new industries, and when they do it is usually at very high cost. More important, NIST already shows signs of becoming one of the federal government's leading high-technology pork-barrel programs, replacing highway and other infrastructure programs. 
<p>
NIST should be abolished before any more harm is done to the economy and before any more taxpayer dollars are distributed wastefully to favored interest groups. Its research programs and facilities could be privatized very quickly. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, notes that such transformations have been proved successful even for organizations funded exclusively with federal money. White argues that privatization of federal R&D labs makes sense because, "With their new freedom to pursue research in whatever areas the market demands -- rather than just fulfilling government missions -- these laboratories might, if successful, spin-off companies and attract new businesses at a far greater rate than they do today. Research universities and private R&D companies with less governmental direction of their activities tend to contribute significantly to their region's economies."<i>55</i>
<p>
<b>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</b><br>
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) jointly manages the electromagnetic spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The NTIA also gives Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants to public television and radio organizations to help expand the audience for public programming. The newest NTIA promotional effort, the National Information Infrastructure (NII), hopes to channel funds into various "information highway" projects. Although an estimated $70 million - $100 million is to be spent on such projects in 1995, the Administration has set higher funding goals of $1 billion - $2 billion annually for future years.<i>56</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should cut by 75 percent the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and transfer the remaining functions (those concerning oversight of public bands of the radio spectrum) to the Federal Communications Commission.<i>57</i> These functions then would be phased out with the FCC as the entire spectrum is privatized.
<p>
Efforts like the Public Telecommunications Facilities and Information Infrastructure programs are little more than high-technology pork projects. But whether it is spectrum management or public programming promotional efforts, the NTIA has little reason to be independent from the FCC. Communications policy should be embodied in one agency to minimize duplication and cut costs. Hence, all current NTIA tasks, after funding has been reduced 75 percent, should be transferred to the FCC. In addition, Congress should not allow the FCC to use the transfer of authority as an excuse to increase its budget. This should encourage the FCC to reform and simplify federal spectrum management policies, which are inefficient and discourage the advance of telecommunications competition.<i>58</i> Congress's goal should be to place all spectrum into private hands as rapidly as possible, abolish the FCC, and transfer responsibility under international spectrum management treaties to the State Department.

<p>
	Consolidating federal job training programs and giving the funds to the states in the form of block grants is a major part of the Senate welfare reform debate. Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better-paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately, they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work? 
<p>
	Job training programs, although well-intentioned, have not proven effective in raising the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal -- better-paying jobs -- because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.1 What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these two goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.<p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few rigorous studies that have been conducted generally fail to show that job training significantly increases long-term hourly earnings. Process-based performance measures traditionally have been the easier, but inappropriate, method for determining whether these programs work. But performance measures can be manipulated easily to explain away poor results by those with an interest in holding on to federal job training money. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.2 Without these studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>

<b>FEW STUDIES AND DISMAL RESULTS</b>
<p>
	Federal and state job training programs are intended to enable participants to build productive skills that will provide them with higher real wages. Only a few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluations, and the results show a record of failure.3 As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."4  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training.<p>A national controlled scientific study of the Title II-A programs of the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) reported these dismal findings:5<P><ul><li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on either the average earnings of young females or their employment.

<li>	The program had a large (7.9 percent) negative effect on the earnings of young males and no effect on their employment.

<li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on the average earnings of adult men.

<li>	Although the overall program had a small (3.4 percent) effect on the average hourly wage of adult women, classroom training did not have any statistically significant effect. Further, training for those adult women that received welfare or were high school dropouts had no statistically significant effect on earnings.

<li>	Immediate placement in a job did have a small effect on earnings, but not on higher hourly wages. The increase in earnings was due primarily to working more hours rather than to higher hourly wages.
</ul><p>
Further, in 1991 the General Accounting Office found that the majority of service delivery areas underreported administrative expenditures, resulting in a misrepresentation of program costs and amounting to a circumvention of the statutory limitation placed on administrative costs.6 <p>A controlled scientific study of the Summer Training and Employment Program (STEP) reported these disappointing findings:7<p><ul><li>	After two to three years, STEP graduates did not have higher graduation rates or grades than the control group.	<li>Graduates of STEP were no more likely to be working than the control group.</ul><p>A scientific control group study of the Job Corps, one of the most expensive job training programs, has never been conducted. However, a 1982 quasi-experimental study found these results:8  <p><ul><li>	Job Corps did not significantly help single mothers (the largest number of welfare recipients).<li>	Job Corps did not affect the overall arrest rate.<li>	Further, a report by the Department of Labor's Inspector General found that only 17 percent of the Job Corps funding went to educational and vocational training, compared to 26 percent for administration.9 A study by the General Accounting Office also raised "serious concerns about the validity of job placement information."10  The GAO was unable to verify job placement for 15 percent of their Job Corps sample. After 30 years and billions of dollars spent, this program has never been subject to rigorous evaluation and only recently has begun to determine the employment status of Job Corps students.11</ul><p>A controlled scientific study of the Jobstart program also reported disappointing findings:12<p><ul><li>	There was no significant increase in overall employment or earnings for the total four-year study period or for any individual year.

<li>	The program did not reduce welfare receipt.

<li>	Jobstart did not affect overall arrest rates. 
</ul><p>
A controlled study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration program reported only very small improvements in earnings:13<P><ul><li>	This demonstration project clearly indicates there are incentives associated with reducing welfare benefits to single mothers who do not stay in school or get a job. AFDC grants were reduced by $160 for those who chose not to participate.

<li>	However, even this significant penalty increased enrollment in school, job training, or employment by only 13 percentage points and annual earnings by only $300.

<LI>	There was no improvement in the poverty rate for participants.
<p></ul>
Controlled studies of the WIN and JOBS programs reported only very small initial improvements in earnings, and these tend to "fade out" after five years:14<p><ul><li>	The main effect of these programs is to speed up the transition from welfare to work.

<li>	There was only a small increase in average earnings per year, about $300 to $700, and after five years there was no difference in earnings between the control group and the group that participated in the program.

<li>	In most cases the increases in literacy skills and educational attainment did not translate into increased earnings or employment.15</ul><p>A study by the General Accounting Office also found that the Department of Health and Human Services "does not know whether JOBS is reducing welfare dependency because it does not gather enough information on critical program outcomes."16<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant long-term increase in hourly earnings directly related to job training. Performance measures and benchmarks are easy but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. They are easily manipulated and explained away. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.
<p>
	One thing is clear from the few studies that have been done:  Government can do little, if anything, to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.
<p>
	The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much, too late. What is needed are fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. In addition, parents need to make their children stay in school, do their homework, stay out of trouble, and graduate from high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for expensive government job training programs that do not work.

<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Job placement assistance may speed up the transition from welfare to work and increase the number of hours worked per year, but that is entirely different from the primary purpose of training: better-paying jobs.
<li>The job training block grant in the Work Opportunity Act of 1995 (S. 1120) improves state accountability by requiring performance measures on the employment outcome of program participants, but it does not require control group evaluation studies.<li>The only method for evaluating job training programs effectively is to conduct an experimental design study that randomly assigns individuals either to a treatment group that can receive services from the program under study or to a control group that cannot, and then evaluate the outcomes.

<title>Abolish The Department of Commerce -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Abolish the Department of  Commerce: <br>
Move the Undersecretary for International Trade to the Treasury Department</h3></i>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #425<br>
August 14, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>
	The legislation in Congress to dismantle the Department of Commerce (DOC) has raised concerns about how necessary functions currently performed by the department will be preserved. Business leaders in particular have expressed concern about protecting U.S. interests in international trade. Although the idea of creating a new Cabinet-level Department of International Trade is gaining momentum, it would not reduce the size of the Cabinet. Responding to the concerns of the business community about U.S. trade policy need not conflict with the initial goal of dismantling Cabinet agencies and reducing the size and scope of government. A more effective solution is to transfer international trade functions to the Treasury Department.
<p>
	<b>Re-examine the Initial Proposal.</b> Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act transfers international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees. It conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place more than 2,500 Commerce Department employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's role as a world economic leader, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports.
<p>
	The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation to establish a new U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, like the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
	Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. Insulating trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
	<b>Create an Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade.</b> Congress should transfer Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
	The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department now has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy, so the Secretary of Commerce is perceived abroad as a minor Cabinet officer. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring.
<p>
	To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements -- which is a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries -- the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department is currently responsible for all enforcement relating to taxation of transnational corporations, which has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department. As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct invoicing of these imports and exports both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.
<p>
	Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the administration.
<p>
	<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to a new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had not corrected a number of problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer -- without substantial reorganization -- of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<P>
	<B>What Congress Should Do.</B> Export and import concerns should continue to occupy a priority position in the President's Cabinet, and the role of the USTR should not be diminished by any administrative reorganization. Congress should reject any proposals to create a new Cabinet-level international trade department. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet and would not carry the same authority internationally as the Treasury Department. The American people would see through the "shell game" nature of any such exercise and question the commitment of Congress to reducing the size of government. The Clinton Administration would be handed a strong argument for vetoing the entire reorganization proposal. Establishing a new Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade responsible for all current functions of the Commerce Undersecretary would address these problems and strengthen the administration of U.S. trade policy.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Transportation -- Heritage </title>

<h2>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</h2>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder #1048<br>
August 17, 1995
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
<p></center>
INTRODUCTION<b> 1</b>
<p>
The U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) was created in 1966 by consolidating several independent agencies devoted to specific transportation sectors, chiefly the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration, into a new Cabinet-level department. Also included in the new department were several transportation-related divisions from other departments, such as the Coast Guard (which had been at the Department of Commerce), together with newly established federal responsibilities for mass transit under the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964. In 1970, DOT added interstate passenger rail service to its duties when it took over money-losing passenger routes from private railroads and reorganized them as money-losing Amtrak. Several years later, for a brief period, the department was home to Conrail, a collection of bankrupt rail freight lines in the Northeast, which soon became one of the few federal privatization successes.
<p>
For this fiscal year, federal spending on transportation is budgeted at just over $39 billion. Nearly half -- $19 billion -- will be spent on highways, while roughly 25 percent -- $10 billion -- will be spent on aviation, primarily air traffic control operations and airport grants. Much of the department's spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished by the federal fuel tax that every consumer pays when he fills up his tank, and the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket tax and several lesser aviation user taxes.
<p>
Largely unchanged in structure and purpose since its creation in 1966, DOT has been the object of a number of recent reform proposals, including a recommendation by the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review that it be overhauled. Several of these proposed reforms, such as "corporatization" of the air traffic control system and consolidation of many surface transportation programs into infrastructure block grants that would be provided to the states, were part of the FY 1996 federal budget. At the same time, the Administration proposed to reduce slightly the amount of money the federal government spends on transportation over the next several years. 
<p>
These relatively modest reforms met with considerable opposition even among House Republicans, who wanted to maintain much of the nearly $40 billion the federal government spends on transportation each year. Fortunately, Senate Republicans have been more committed to fundamental reform, and this was represented in the House/Senate conference agreement on the FY 1996 budget resolution. Though somewhat vague on critical points, the conference report did commit Congress to downsizing and streamlining DOT, and even recommended privatization of the air traffic control system -- in contrast to the House Republicans' initial proposal to keep it as a government bureaucracy. The report, noting that the nation's infrastructure needs are not being met by the current centralized command structure, also urged greater privatization and federalism.
<p>
Specifically, the conference report proposes to phase out Amtrak, which will be cut by $205 million from last year, and mass transit operating subsidies, which will be cut by $300 million. Other areas of transportation, however, receive substantial increases. Spending on highways would rise a staggering $880 million over last year, while $660 million will be provided to start 30 new transit systems, most of which will be in light rail, the least cost-effective of the options available to Americans. This reflects a $19 million increase over last year's new start spending, and is significantly more than President Clinton recommended in proposing only 12 new transit starts in his 1996 budget.
<p>
This reluctance to impose fiscal discipline is troubling. Even worse is the record the House is compiling in attempting to reform the restrictive labor practices past Congresses have forced on Amtrak and local transit systems, as well as Davis-Bacon Act provisions affecting highways. In July, efforts to reform costly labor practices and mandates on mass transit and Amtrak were defeated overwhelmingly as many House Republicans joined with Democrats to vote down every reform proposal put forward as part of the transportation appropriations bill.
<p>
Although too modest in scope, the Clinton Administration's proposals could help reinvigorate the process of fundamental transportation reform that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan Administration, and the House/Senate conference report at least includes general endorsements of reform, decentralization, and privatization. The Administration's proposals implicitly recognize that DOT's duties are largely commercial in nature and might better be left to the states or to the private sector. In the past, the federal government often helped facilitate the more rapid commercialization of a new technology (aviation) or a new concept (limited-access interstate highways). Generally, however, the Department has simply preserved, at considerable taxpayer expense, such inefficient transportation concepts as urban mass transit monopolies or poorly managed interstate passenger rail service. Despite its early successes in highways and aviation, federal involvement in these areas has become costly, bureaucratic, and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves the privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees, and unions that benefit financially from the status quo.
<p>
It is time for Congress to recognize that continued federal involvement in transportation is an inefficient use of society's scarce resources. To decrease the costs and decentralize the management of America's transportation system, the Department of Transportation should be closed down, and most of today's federal transportation responsibilities should be returned to individual states, local communities, or the private sector. Such actions would have the effect of continuing the successful transportation policies of the late Carter Administration and early Reagan Administration, when airlines, interstate rail freight, trucking, and the moving industry were deregulated to the considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers, and businesses.
<p>
Specifically, Congress needs to institute major reforms in several areas of transportation policy:
<p>
<b>Surface Transportation</b><br> 
Congress should return to the states much of the responsibility, with the necessary resources, to operate and fund those transportation functions that are the province of government. Most transportation concerns are local in nature, and continuing to force politically influenced, centralized solutions on local problems will be no more successful in the future than it has been in the past.
<p>
Today, the federal government determines how much will be spent on transportation infrastructure, raises the money, and then decides how it will be distributed and divided among the many different forms of transport -- such as highways, mass transit, aviation, and rail passenger services -- in accordance with a central plan developed by the DOT, Congress, and the states and influenced by the many private industries that depend on federal grants and contracts. Costly strings are attached to these funds in the form of dozens of mandates, directives, and special set-asides to satisfy certain constituencies. 
<p>
Congress can reverse this process in 1997 when the legislation authorizing the DOT's largest program -- the Highway Trust Fund -- and the taxes that support it expires. Funded with an 11.5 cent share of the 18.4 cent per gallon federal gas tax, the trust fund each year takes in and disburses approximately $20 billion on highways, bridges, and mass transit initiatives. The program should be allowed to expire as scheduled so the states can assume this relinquished taxing authority to fund their own transportation programs. As an interim step, all the money collected by the federal government through the fuel tax should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in exact proportion to the amount collected in each state. The accumulated balance in the trust fund, now approaching $18 billion, should be returned to the states in proportion to the amount paid in once the federal budget reaches balance, as scheduled, in the year 2002.
<p>
This block grant would be unrestricted except for a requirement that it be used for transportation, with each state free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs. For states needing rail passenger service, a portion of the funds could be used to maintain some or all of the lines that formerly were part of Amtrak. For heavily urbanized states, funds could support mass transit beyond revenues generated by fares. And for most states, most of the money would continue to support highway and bridge programs. After 1997, when the federal fuel tax author-ity expires, states could assume responsibility for the tax <b>2</b> or could develop other funding mechanisms, including taxes, user fees, greater private investor participation, and tolls, to maintain and sustain their own transportation program.
<p>
<b>The End of Mandates</b><br> 
Also terminated should be the large and costly collection of federal mandates, regulations, and prohibitions that have inflated state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative, low-cost transportation solutions. Mandates associated with federal highway funds force states to incur additional costs that may equal as much as 80 percent of the federal funds received. For the federal transit programs, the costs of fulfilling federal mandates can be two to three times the value of the federal subsidy. Ending these mandates would increase substantially the buying power of a transportation block grant, and eliminating the many federal restrictions discouraging states from forming partnerships with private investors to develop or rehabilitate highways and bridges would allow states open access to substantial pools of private development capital. 
<p>
<b>Urban Mass Transit</b><br> 
The most important action Congress can take to reform surface transportation is to terminate the Federal Transit Administration, the most wasteful and counterproductive of all DOT programs. Federal spending on local transit initiatives runs in excess of $4 billion per year, part of which is financed from the 1.5 cent share of the federal fuel tax. Urban and community transit programs are almost entirely local in nature, have few (if any) national ramifications, and derive only about five percent of their operating funds from the federal government. But because of federal mandates, including costly provisions that directly benefit organized labor, the hidden cost to the community may be two to three times higher than the value of the subsidy itself. Thus, all existing federal transit legislation also should be amended to remove all federally imposed mandates and restrictive labor practices. Once the program is terminated and the laws amended, states would be free to fund mass transit programs through the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<b>Amtrak</b><br> 
As part of a comprehensive reform of DOT surface transportation programs, all federal funding to Amtrak should end and Amtrak's management should be encouraged to work with interested and affected states to develop creative ways to maintain cost-efficient service. States could use a portion of the new transportation block grant to maintain some local or regional rail service in cooperation with other states and Amtrak, or its successor entity. To this end, the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 should be amended to eliminate excessive labor protections and Amtrak's federally enforced monopoly status. In addition, an eight-state compact to maintain and fund operations in the Northeast Corridor should be pre-approved by Congress and the formal transfer of assets (rolling stock, road bed, stations) to the new consortium included in the legislation terminating Amtrak. Popular long-haul routes should be privatized separately to take better advantage of their tourism potential. 
<p>
<b>Aviation</b><br> 
DOT aviation programs, operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and financed largely from the airport trust fund, should be privatized (in the case of air traffic control) or fully devolved to the states (airports). Aviation safety responsibilities should remain with the federal government in a new transportation safety agency. Specifically, and similar to proposals of the Senate Budget Committee, the National Performance Review, and the Clinton Administration, the FAA should be split into three parts. The air traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation, funded by direct user fees, and ultimately privatized; the airport improvement program, and the taxes and fees that fund it, should be turned over to the states and localities. Meanwhile, the safety, licensing, inspection and training functions of the FAA should be carried out either by an independent federal aviation safety agency or by a new government agency that also deals with safety issues related to highways, boats, rail, and other forms of transportation.
<p>
As part of this change, the airport trust fund, with a balance now in excess of $12 billion, should be dissolved and the federal passenger ticket tax ended. A portion of the balance could be used to fund some of the potentially high transition costs involved in privatizing the air traffic control system and to honor existing commitments under the airport improvement program. Once the federal budget is balanced, the remaining funds could be returned to existing airport authorities in proportion to ticket taxes previously collected.
<p>
Existing federal laws, mandates, and prohibitions governing airports should be amended or eliminated to allow greater freedom for airport managers and more private sector participation in airport ownership, construction, development, and management. With these mandates ended, airports would be free to establish their own charges, fees, or taxes on aircraft or passengers in order to fund ongoing operations and improvements.
<p>
<b>The Coast Guard</b><br> 
The Coast Guard's chief responsibilities now focus largely on law enforcement. Congress therefore should transfer the Coast Guard and its coastal security and interdiction functions to the Department of Justice, so that its activities can be coordinated more effectively with those of other federal law enforcement agencies. Other, less pressing duties could be shifted to the private sector, the states, or other agencies. Basic rescue responsibilities, for example, could be turned over to existing private competitors and volunteer organizations, with government retaining responsibility only in the event of extreme emergencies and severe weather conditions beyond the scope and resources of the private sector. Boat safety responsibilities should devolve to the states, where most other transport safety issues already are lodged. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take over the Coast Guard's anti-pollution responsibilities, and states or regional authorities should assume responsibility for maintaining navigational aids, policing waterways, and icebreaking.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be terminated except for its international regulatory roles, which should be transferred to the Department of State or the U.S. Trade Representative. Safety functions and responsibilities should be retained in an independent federal agency. The Maritime Administration and Congress's long, counterproductive interference with the ocean shipping industry have succeeded only in destroying America's once proud maritime heritage. The price, in addition to considerable taxpayer expense, has been the loss of thousands of jobs.
<p>
<br>
<b>FEDERAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM</b><br>
Today's federal highway programs began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1944 Federal Highway Aid Act which earmarked $1.6 billion for highways over three years, and Dwight D. Eisenhower's Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956. The former created the federal responsibility; the latter shaped the program that exists today. Specifically, the 1956 Act called for completion of a 41,000-mile interstate highway system by 1972 and created the Highway Trust Fund, financed by a federal excise tax on gasoline, as a long-term source of federal funds for road construction. 
<p>
Congress originally intended the highway program to be a federally assisted state program.<b>3</b> But over time, as more and more federal mandates and money have been added, it has become a state-assisted federal program. A $30 billion program with a fifteen-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now thirty years behind schedule.
<p>
Although the broad objectives of federal involvement have been met, the federal highway program, operating out of Washington as a centrally managed monopoly incorporating the ideas and transportation concepts of the 1950s, is no longer what America needs. It also is no longer consistent with the original intent of a federally funded state program. With the national highway system largely completed, and with existing and emerging surface transportation issues predominantly local or regional in nature, a centralized, one-size-fits-all program makes little fiscal, management, or creative sense.
<p>
<b>Unresponsive and Bureaucratic.</b> The principal weakness in the current federal system is its centralized allocation of financial resources according to mechanical formulas based more on political influence than on transportation needs. Money collected at the state level from individual drivers whenever they fill their gas tanks is funneled to Washington, where a little less than two-thirds is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund for reallocation back to the states for a variety of federally determined purposes in federally determined proportions. 
<p>
Of the 18.4 cents per gallon now paid at the pump in federal excise taxes, only 10 cents goes to highways. Of the remainder, 1.5 cents goes to mass transit, 0.1 cents to cleaning up leaking storage tanks, and 6.8 cents to the government generally. On October 1, 1995, the highway dedication will rise by 20 percent to 12 cents per gallon and the transit dedication will rise by one-third to 2 cents per gallon. These increases will be financed by reducing the 6.8 cent highway tax support for general government (no overall tax increase will occur).<b>4</b> Similar diversions of tax funding from deficit reduction to highways and mass transit will occur at the same time with respect to other motor fuel taxes.
<p>
How much money each state receives from the fund is determined according to an elaborate mechanical formula which has left a trail of winners and losers. Since its inception in 1956, states such as Alaska and Hawaii, along with the District of Columbia, have received in grants substantially more than they have paid into the fund, while states such as South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin have received just over half the amount they have paid in fuel taxes.<b>5</b>
<p>
Once the aggregate allocation is determined, the money returned to the states is earmarked for specific types of projects as determined jointly by members and staff of key congressional committees and staff and officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In the 1995 budget, developed in cooperation with President Clinton and the 103rd Congress, $20.1 billion in federal highway aid was allocated in specific amounts to such programs as the national highway system, the surface transportation program, the bridge program, interstate completion, interstate maintenance, interstate substitutions, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, intelligent vehicle highway systems, emergency relief, federal lands, administration and research (more than $700 million), demonstration projects, high priority corridors, highway-related safety grants, motor carrier safety grants, and miscellaneous appropriations of a quarter of a billion dollars for 80 specific highway projects mandated by Members of Congress for their states or districts.<b>6</b>
<p>
In addition to the predetermined allocations among the states and between specific types of highway projects, Washington determines how much and what types of urban mass transit assistance each state receives, how much passenger rail service is available to it and at what cost, and how much money will be provided for airport construction, improvement, and modernization.
<p>
<b>Miles of Red Tape.</b> In order to receive these predetermined funding allocations, states and local communities must agree to adhere to a growing list of mandates that substantially raise the cost of meeting transportation needs, thereby actually diminishing the amount of transport services that each federal dollar can buy. Chief among these counterproductive mandates are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Construction Wage Laws. The Davis-Bacon Act of 1932 requires that any project receiving federal funds must pay workers the area's "prevailing wage" as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. In most cases, this means above-market union wages and adds an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent to the cost of affected projects.<b>7</b>
<p>
<li>Environmental Regulations. Threatening to withhold federal highway funds is one way the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the DOT, frequently forces states to apply a variety of environmental regulations to car drivers. As a result of these threats and mandates, for example, drivers in certain areas of the country must undergo costly mandatory emissions inspections and switch seasonally to more costly and less efficient oxygenated fuels to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and photo-chemical smog to national standards established by the EPA. 
<p>
These substantial costs are forced on automobile owners despite the absence of conclusive epidemiological evidence that these emissions adversely affect human health. And while the health and environmental benefits of these and other regulations are uncertain and questionable, the financial benefits of the oxygenated fuels mandate to the ethanol industry are both substantial and obvious. In addition to these restrictions, new highway construction projects must be preceded by costly and time-consuming environmental impact statements.
<p>
<li>Safety Regulations. Similar threats have been used to require states to enforce costly safety initiatives, such as the recently repealed, federally mandated 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that added to costs, inconvenience, and congestion on the highways while making only a negligible contribution to decreased deaths, injuries, and property damage.<b>8</b> Such regulations have been wholly inappropriate and counterproductive to states, and regions within states, characterized by low population densities, as well as to regions where long-distance driving often is essential for employment and other day-to-day tasks.
<p>
<li>Miscellaneous Regulations and Mandates. Other federal requirements and mandates linked to federal highway funds include driver's license screening procedures for controlled substances, safety belt enforcement, drug-free workplace requirements, creating and maintaining a problem driver point system, commercial motor vehicle safety provisions, enforcement of the Truth in Mileage Act, requirements for minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise contracting, implementation of sound abatement barriers, bicycle paths and right of ways, metric conversion, establishment of an information data base system, hazardous waste operations, emergency response training programs, treatment of storm water runoff, compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as it relates to recipients of federal grants, and utilization of pulverized, recycled rubber in highway paving and repaving materials. A recent study of the cost of highway-related federal mandates imposed on California concluded that California incurred expenses of $1.8 billion to fulfill these mandates so it could receive $2.3 billion in federal highway money. <b>9</b>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need to End Federal Limits and Prohibitions on Tolls and Private Investor Participation.</b> Among the most damaging federal requirements are the limits on the extent to which states can charge tolls and work in partnership with private-sector investors. Highways funded in whole or in part by the Highway Trust Fund may neither charge any tolls (except for a small number of Washington-approved demonstration projects) nor be developed or renovated with private investor participation. Thus, an opportunity to add significantly to the funds available for highway construction -- at no cost to the taxpayer -- is foregone, and America's ability to meet its transportation needs is held hostage to federal funding limits and allocations established by Congress and DOT staff. For example, an estimated 230,000 highway bridges need significant repair at a projected cost of $60 billion or more.<b>10</b> In this year's budget, the Clinton Administration requested just $2.6 billion in FY 1996 for bridges under the Federal Aid to Highways program, or just less than 5 percent of the estimated need.<b>11</b>
<p>
In addition to the unnecessary limits on resources that it creates, the prohibition on tolls precludes opportunities to contribute, however modestly, to the alleviation of congestion and the better utilization of existing transportation resources through market pricing mechanisms. For example, the major surface transportation issue in communities throughout the country is congestion, generally associated with commuting and rush hour travel. With existing highways offered to consumers (drivers) as a "free good," or at least as a pre-paid service, drivers have no financial incentive to alter their schedules or their mode of transportation so they might use this valuable asset more efficiently to minimize congestion. To induce drivers to alter their travel plans to diminish congestion during peak travel periods associated either with holidays or workday rush hours, tolls could be levied (or increased where they already exist) on specific bridges or highways, as appropriate. This would encourage some individuals to defer travel, to utilize an alternative mode of transportation such as public transit or car pools, or take a different route.
<p>
Such congestion pricing tolls have been implemented in several cities in Europe and Asia (for instance, Bergen, Oslo, and Singapore), and public transit systems in Washington, D.C., and several other U.S. cities charge a premium for rush hour travel on buses and subways to encourage riders to shift travel to off-peak times. Although by no means a panacea, there is no reason why this concept could not be applied selectively to auto travel in the United States in those places and along those routes where existing traffic patterns make it possible and where driving patterns may be sensitive to price incentives. Unfortunately, federal prohibitions and habit deter its use, so efforts are limited to public exhortations urging citizens to ride buses or join car pools. 
<p>
Until recently, placing tolls on congested urban roads and bridges was not always economically practical because the collection costs and ensuing delays would likely have worsened the situation. However, new technologies allow electronic assessment of tolls from moving cars and trucks, using inexpensive transponders or receivers mounted on the vehicles. In the United States such automated systems have been implemented on the Crescent City Connection 12-lane bridge in New Orleans, the 17-mile North Dallas Tollway,<b>12</b> and the Oklahoma toll road system.
<p>
Allowing for tolls creates opportunities for the private sector to develop and operate highways or to participate as partners with government in highway construction and operation. While private toll roads are common in Western Europe, and several are under construction (or planned) in several places in the U.S., their use has been limited severely by prohibitions and constraints at both the state and federal levels. Many states simply prohibit privately owned highways, while others tightly regulate them and require an elaborate and costly approval process. At the federal level, while there are no outright prohibitions on private highways, there have been tight controls on the extent to which private and public moneys can be commingled in infrastructure investments developed on a for-profit basis, and these controls have largely discouraged any private interest.<b>13</b>
<p>
At the same time, ambiguities regarding ownership of existing federally supported public roads, as well as federal anti-toll provisions, deter the creation of for-profit public/private partnerships that could rehabilitate, modernize, or widen -- at little or no taxpayer expense -- an existing public road that once received federal funding for some or all of its construction. Until very recently, there was no formal legal mechanism to allow for the sale or disposal of such highways, or to assess properly a reimbursement payment to offset the past federal investment. As a consequence, previously built highways in need of rehabilitation, modernization, and widening must wait their turn and compete politically with other highway projects for federal grant money. In recent years, executive orders promulgated by both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have resolved some, but not all, of these problems. 
<p>
Private-sector participation would allow some highway rehabilitation projects (particularly for well-traveled highways with restricted access) to receive immediate attention and financing at no cost to the taxpayer. A partnership could be formed between the state or local community and private investors, who would provide the funds to widen and resurface the aging highway to current standards and needs and be compensated for the effort, risk, and investment by receiving a portion of the tolls collected on the highway. The community's transportation needs would be addressed sooner and for less money (thanks in part to no federal red tape, which adds at least 20 percent to 30 percent to highway costs). Meanwhile, those who benefit the most -- the drivers who use the new road -- would pay for it in direct proportion to usage and benefits received.
<p>
Private highway projects currently are under construction in Virginia and California, and others are planned for Minnesota and Washington State. Private toll roads have long been in operation in France, Germany, and Italy and are underway in Argentina, Chile, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, and Mexico.<b>14</b>
<p>
Although toll roads, including hundreds built and operated by private companies, played an important role in the early development of America's transportation infrastructure, the growing federalization of the highway system over the past forty years has discouraged and formally prohibited both private sector participation and the use of tolls on public roads. The rationale for this prohibition is thin and merits brief discussion. 
<p>
<b>Haven't We already Paid For It?</b> The chief argument used against tolls and highway privatization is that drivers already have paid for the highway through the federal fuel tax and Highway Trust Fund, which roughly relates taxes paid to highway usage. Under these circumstances, it is argued, any additional levies or user fees would be unfair and redundant. But this exaggerates the extent to which fuel taxes paid by individuals actually fund the highways, as well as the correspondence between costs incurred and benefits received. Further, it vastly overstates the ability of the user fee, as currently configured, to finance the U.S. highway and bridge system to the desired level of quality and capability.
<p>
A principal complaint about the existing user fee system is that less than 55 percent of the tax goes to highways, suggesting that any reference to the gas tax as a user fee is misleading. Further distorting the relationship between fees paid and benefits received is the fact that a disproportionate share of federal highway money goes to just 22 percent of U.S. road miles, which includes the interstate highway system and, to a lesser extent, its arterials and collectors. It does not include local roads, however, so auto owners whose driving is primarily local pay the federal fuel tax without receiving much in the way of direct benefits. 
<p>
In a similar vein, drivers who pay to use existing toll roads, such as the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Turnpikes or Interstate 95 between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, also pay the gas tax, yet are not eligible for a rebate due to double taxation. Indeed, the price of fuel sold on these toll roads includes the federal fuel tax. Also distorting the relationship between fees and benefits is the fact that while different types of vehicles impose significantly different costs on highways, these differences are not reflected properly in the fees they pay. Heavy trucks, for example, cause substantially more wear and tear than is covered by the various fees and taxes they pay.<b>15</b>
<p>
Thus, it is not true that bridge and highway tolls are unfair because they would distort the relationship between fees and usage. The addition of more road and bridge tolls dedicated exclusively to highway improvement actually would enhance the correspondence between what drivers pay and what they in turn receive.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li><b>Do not reauthorize the federal highway and transit program.</b>
<p> 
Federal motor fuel taxes should be allowed to expire as scheduled.<b>16</b> This would constitute complete and final devolution of the program to the states, which would finance their highway, transit, and leaking underground storage tank needs as they see fit (probably by increasing state motor fuels taxes or substituting a state fuel tax for the terminated federal fuel tax).
<p>
Abolish the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (49 USC app. 1651 note).
<p>
<li><b>Devolve the federal highway program to the states.</b> 
<p>
This would require repeal of Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with the exception of Sections 204, 205, 210, 212, 215, 216, and 218, and would comport with the original intent of the law that the federal highway program be a state program. Full devolution to the states is appropriate, since local governments are units of state government. Research programs would be financed by the states and by private-sector interests in the highway industry. 
<p>
Devolving the program would involve several actions:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Before the scheduled re-authorization, all federal motor fuel taxes dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in proportion to their collection. 
<li>All federal mandates (funded, underfunded, and unfunded) should be removed. This could be accomplished by simple legislative language such as the following:<b>17</b> "Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, states shall have the right to waive any federal requirement in Title 23 and Title 49 Section 1601 et seq." 
<li>The returned funds should be subject to conventional state legislative and administrative procedures.<b>18</b>
<li>Return the balance in the Highway Trust Fund to the states from federal budget surpluses earned after the federal budget is balanced.<b>19</b>
<li>Disbursements should be based on a formula that reasonably approximates prior state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Establish an Office of Interstate Highway Cooperation.
<p>
This office could be created either as an independent agency or within a successor entity that absorbed remaining responsibilities of terminated or consolidated agencies. It would bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states (such as designation of interstate and USC highway numbers). Minimal funding would be required.
<p>
<li>Transfer International Programs to the Department of State (23 USC 212, 216, and 218).
<p>
Included in DOT are numerous transportation responsibilities with international ramifications, such as landing rights for air carriers, limits on fares, negotiated shipping rates, and safety issues. These matters could be handled better by the Department of State in coordination with other diplomatic issues.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Federal Lands Highway Program, forest development roads and trails highways, and territorial highway program to the Department of the Interior or its successor agency (49 USC 204, 205, and 215).
<p>
<li>Transfer defense access roads to the Department of Defense (49 USC 210).
<p>
<li>Terminate separate highway programs of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and consolidate these responsibilities into the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<br>
<b>HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is responsible for regulatory and other programs involving highway and vehicle safety. In addition, the Office of Motor Carriers deals with safety issues associated with interstate bus and truck transportation, and the Office of Research and Special Programs includes or oversees several other related efforts including Hazardous Materials Safety, Pipeline Safety, the Transportation Safety Institute, and university research programs. 
<p>
All of these programs should be reviewed for effectiveness or redundancy and to determine whether they are more properly the province of the states. Once reviewed and restructured, the remaining federal safety responsibilities should be transferred to a newly created independent federal entity  an Interstate Transportation Safety Office (or Administration) -- which includes all the other transportation safety responsibilities now within DOT, such as those of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Maritime Administration. 
<p>
As part of this review, Congress should consider creating national maximum vehicle safety standards to discourage states from imposing more restrictive regulations that impede interstate commerce and add unnecessarily to costs. A possible precedent for such federal maximum standards is the standards promulgated and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the manufactured housing industry. Again, however, highway safety programs are more legitimately the province of the states.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (23 USC 401).
<p>
<li>Merge vehicle-related interstate safety programs into the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office.
<p>
<li>Devolve the remaining non-interstate highway safety programs to the states.
<p>
<li>Merge any critical statistical functions into the Census Bureau or its successor agency.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION</b>
<p>
Created by the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 and administered by DOT's Federal Transit Administration, the federal transit program is a costly failure:  Mass transit's market position today is the same as 31 years ago when Congress passed the Act. The program has consistently led to unwise transportation decisions by state and local authorities, encouraged local transit monopolies, and precluded the adoption of cost-effective operating methods and innovative solutions.
<p>
Although funding from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and other federal revenues provide only a small fraction of the financial resources available to urban mass transit systems, the many regulations and mandates attached to federal funding have had a profoundly adverse influence on local transit policy. Despite the billions of dollars of state, local, and federal money invested in costly transit systems over the past 30 years, annual transit trips per capita have declined by one-third, and barely two percent of person trips today are by transit. In addition, transit's work trip (commuter) market share declined from 1980 to 1990 in 36 of the nation's 39 metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million.<b>20</b>
<p>
<b>Monopolistic Control.</b> Transit's vastly diminished status reflects more than a century of government meddling and government-sanctioned and protected monopolies, whether public or private. Private transit companies and systems emerged in the late 19th century and grew rapidly in response to the growth of the urban population during the industrial revolution. Although private in origin, these rail-based companies quickly became monopolies by obtaining exclusive franchises from local and state governments. As early as the second decade of this century, governments in city after city outlawed jitneys (independently owned and operated buses), eliminating any competitive threat that might confront the private transit monopolists.
<p>
Unfortunately for these transit companies, their government protection from competition was not without its cost. Over the ensuing decades, these private systems were subject to price controls on their fares, mandatory service on designated routes, and mandated frequency of service. At the same time, they became easy prey for organized labor, which could shut down an entire city because all competing systems and companies had been eliminated. Private transit systems had little choice but to accede to exorbitant union wage demands and work rule requirements. These work rules are still in force, but in the public transit sector where federal mandates help maintain organized labor's privileged position in local systems.<b>21</b>
<p>
Local governments could suppress organized business competition to their protected transit franchisees, but they could not suppress the striving of individual commuters for something better. These individuals began to exercise their free will and seek a more convenient and cost-effective solution by driving their cars to work and to market. Subject to heavy government regulation and high labor costs, and thus unable to compete, the private transit monopolists began to face serious financial problems as their customers went elsewhere. With harsh labor contracts precluding cost savings through labor efficiencies, transit companies turned to deferred maintenance, capital acquisition, and reductions in other services. The ensuing deterioration in service further discouraged customers, and revenues continued to decline until the systems went bankrupt. One by one, they were taken over by local governments or multi-jurisdictional transit authorities. Taxpayer-supported public monopolies replaced the private ones that had failed.
<p>
<b>The Federal Takeover.</b> The next step was to get the federal government involved. This occurred in 1964 with the enactment of the Urban Mass Transit Act, which provided for capital grants to fund up to 75 percent of local projects. Section 13(c) of the Act also effectively codified organized labor's privileged position within the transit system by requiring, as a condition of federal aid, that a transit authority sign a U.S. Department of Labor-approved contract with transit unions. Among other things, these mandated agreements generally include provisions requiring a six-year severance payment for transit employees dismissed because of efficiency measures.
<p>
This Act was just one of several pieces of federal legislation during the 1960s that shifted heretofore local responsibilities such as housing, transit, and welfare to the federal government, all with disastrous results. Ten years later, in 1974, the Urban Mass Transit Act was amended to extend federal support to operating subsidies as part of a national energy conservation effort. Today, the federal government spends about $4 billion each year to help subsidize a service that millions of consumers overwhelmingly reject in growing numbers:  Just over five percent of employees now get to work using public transit.
<p>
<b>Impact of Cutting Off Federal Subsidies.</b> Because federal support accounts for only about five percent of transit operating costs, and because existing transit system borrowing capabilities would be sufficient to add more and replace existing capital assets, the termination of all federal subsidies would have little initial negative impact on transit's ability to serve its dwindling customer base. Indeed, encouraging greater self-reliance and removing all of the costly and counterproductive mandates attached to federal grants and subsidies would leave enterprising transit authorities financially better off, because the estimated cost of these mandates is more than two to three times the value of the subsidy.<b>22</b> For FY 1996, the House/Senate conference report on the budget proposes a substantial reduction in federal financial support of transit but stops short of recommending the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration, as proposed originally by the House.
<p>
With the provisions of Section 13(c) eliminated and no longer able to disrupt productive labor-management relations, transit authorities could adopt widely available cost savings opportunities through such practices as competitive contracting and better management of existing workforce. Because of the lack of incentives for properly managing existing personnel, and because of the many restrictive work rules common to its federally approved labor contracts, America's public transit industry has been the only major industry to experience a decline in labor productivity during the 1980s. Over that period, transit's productivity fell a staggering 40 percent compared with an increase in all other transportation sectors, including even Amtrak.<b>23</b>
<p>
The combination of rising wages and falling productivity has had a profoundly adverse effect on transit's cost structure. Unit costs (costs per mile or hour) are often double, or more expensive than market costs for the same services, even when provided by private contractors using union labor. As a result, U.S. transit cost escalation has been greater than that of health care and greater than that of transit systems in other developed nations.<b>24</b>
<p>
As long as the federal government is there to bail them out, transit authorities have no incentive to become more efficient or to adopt management techniques common to other businesses, and local communities and governments, which oversee these transit systems, have no incentive to interfere or to exercise their responsibility on behalf of their constituents and transit's customers. Without the federal cushion and indirect oversight, local governments could restructure their transit systems in ways that serve the customer, not managers and employees and Washington bureaucrats that devise and enforce the regulations and mandates.
<p>
With the federal government no longer providing capital grants that mandate certain types of equipment, transit authorities also would be free to acquire less expensive but more suitable equipment. Moreover, with transit authorities now fully responsible for servicing the debt incurred to acquire the equipment, these capital assets would be better maintained than has been the practice.<b>25</b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Competition.</b> Chief among the necessary reforms is opening the local transit market to competition by eliminating the legal monopoly now held by all transit authorities. Today, anyone offering services in competition with existing public transit is in violation of various criminal and civil statutes. As the limited contracting out done by transit services demonstrates, private-sector providers, often using unionized workers, are able to provide the same service for less money, make a profit, pay taxes, and service the debt on their equipment -- four simple tasks that no public transit service in the country could hope to accomplish. 
<p>
While the potential cost savings are considerable, the real benefit to consumers from competition is the creativity that it will unleash in devising innovative solutions to traditional problems. In the hands of government monopolies, U.S. transit systems now rely on a combination of solutions and services that have not evolved much beyond those that were developed between 1880 and 1920, except that they cost much more and offer less convenient service. Not surprisingly, modern Americans have little interest in a type of service that was becoming obsolete when their grandparents were coming of age.
<p>
Typical of Congress's fascination with 19th century technologies are the costly light rail systems it has funded in communities across the United States, notwithstanding a pervasive lack of commuter interest. The "new start" rail capital program has financed some of the most costly and ineffective pork-barrel projects in the nation, despite the absence of any evidence from anywhere in the world that urban rail lines reduce traffic congestion. These systems involve sometimes staggering costs. According to one recent report, the congressionally approved Tasman Corridor, a $500 million, 12.4-mile light rail line in California linking Milpitas and Mountain View, will cost $33 for each new rider.<b>26</b>
<p>
A DOT study by Harvard economists indicates that bus-ways can be built and operated for one-fifth the cost of new rail systems.<b>27</b> But rail systems have become a federally financed way to enhance civic pride and accommodate the preferences of hobbyists and rail buffs. Virtually all academic researchers not dependent upon income from the transit industry or the Federal Transit Administration agree that building publicly financed rail transit is indefensible. 
<p>
Even if the cost could be justified, no element of today's local transit programs calls for federal involvement. Transit programs are, by definition, local in scope, and where two or three states are involved in the same system, interstate compacts can be formed to provide region-wide management and help raise the funds needed to maintain the service. Removing the federal government from local transit matters would leave state and local governments free to devise their own solutions, reduce costs by getting rid of federal red tape, and adopt creative solutions from a competitive private sector that stands to profit by serving its customers. 
<p>
Supporters of the status quo argue that there is no money to be made in transit and that the financial failures of government-regulated monopolies in the 1950s and 1960s prove this. What they really prove, of course, is the counterproductive effects of government-sanctioned anti-competitive practices and regulation. Today, scores of profit-making, private transit firms bid eagerly on every government contract offered, and at prices below the level charged by public transit. The only thing that prevents a flood of private buses, vans, and taxis from offering low-cost, for-profit transit services in cities and suburbs is the threat of legal action from government.  
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Transit Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the federal transit program (49 USC Chapter 21).<br> 
States should be free to provide financial support to their transit systems through the transportation block grant proposed in the previous section or through other means.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees rail safety, rail subsidies, and rail research. It also administers the Northeast Corridor rail rehabilitation project and owns and administers the Transportation Test Center, staffed by the Association of American Railroads. Only one of these functions -- interstate rail safety -- is an appropriate federal activity. Research should be funded by the railroad industry. 
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Railroad Administration (49 USC APP. 1652).
<p>
<li>Repeal all FRA functions not involving interstate rail safety.
<p>
<li>Sell the Transportation Test Center to the private sector. 
<p>
<li>Merge rail safety programs into the proposed Office of Interstate Transportation Safety. 
<p>
<br>
<b>THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (Amtrak)</b><br>
The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) was created in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail service. Conceived as a two-year federally assisted experiment, Amtrak has managed to survive for 25 years at a cumulative cost to the taxpayer of over $17 billion plus interest. With a fleet of approximately 2,200 cars and engines operating on over 25,000 miles of track, Amtrak carries approximately 22 million passengers a year. 
<p>
President Clinton's budget proposed a subsidy of $750 million for FY 1996 and assumed that Amtrak will adopt substantial reforms to make itself more commercially viable and reduce its reliance on federal operating subsidies. Although the original House Republican proposal was even more generous, the House/Senate budget conference cut more than $200 million from Amtrak. However, efforts to reform operations, particularly onerous labor requirements, failed as many House Republicans voted with the Democrats to preserve the extraordinary privileges in organized labor's Amtrak contract. This failed reform effort illustrates why it is time to terminate the federal subsidy at the end of this fiscal year, giving Amtrak time to develop a strategic plan to achieve financial independence from the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Amtrak's Marginal Impact on America's Transport Needs.</b> Carrying less than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers, Amtrak has become a costly burden on the taxpayer. Proposed for termination in several budgets during the Reagan Administration, it has been kept alive by Congress, which has provided billions in annual subsidies in return for promises that the corporation would become commercially viable. It never has, and those who believe it will in the future are allowing hope to triumph over experience and good sense. Despite 25 years of reform efforts and promises, the best the government has been able to do is to reduce the annual subsidy from over a billion dollars during the Carter Administration to about half that during the Reagan Presidency. Under Clinton the subsidy has been creeping back up to Jimmy Carter levels of generosity. 
<p>
After years of mismanagement, overly generous labor agreements, and intense competition from airlines and long-haul buses, Amtrak's financial situation has deteriorated, and its prospects for improvement are even more illusory than in the past. In December 1994, as a result of competitive pressures on revenues, higher than expected operating costs, and a serious accident, Amtrak's budget went even deeper into the red, forcing the company to announce a series of major route and service cuts to stay within its existing budget and federal subsidy. Faced with persistent competition from private buses and airlines, Amtrak will continue to struggle with a worsening deficit, in addition to which deferred maintenance, an aging fleet (23 years per car today, compared with 17.5 years in 1989), and rapid depreciation of the Northeast Corridor's roadbed will likely cause operating and essential capital costs to escalate rapidly, requiring even larger taxpayer subsidies.
<p>
Amtrak represents a failed attempt to convert inter-city rail service from a subsidized system to a self-sustaining, profitable system. Amtrak achieves a significant market share only in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston) -- and only with heavy subsidies per rider. In virtually all other markets, eliminating service would have no discernible impact on transportation facilities (highways and airports), because Amtrak's market share is infinitesimal.
<p>
To compensate for the loss of federal financial support, Amtrak's strategic survival plan should include privatization of commercially viable routes; partnerships with other transportation, travel, and recreational entities; or regional public-private partnerships through more aggressive use of the 403(b) provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which allow for greater cost sharing with states and local communities served by Amtrak. In the event that the mid-Atlantic and northeast states served by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operation find the service of value to their citizens and businesses, they could use some portion of their proposed transportation block grant or state-controlled fuel tax to keep regional Amtrak service in operation. To facilitate this, the DOT should be prepared to conduct an orderly transfer of necessary assets and responsibilities -- chiefly the rolling stock and roadbed -- to the affected states.
<p>
Existing law and practice allow for this, and there is precedent for state takeover of routes abandoned for budgetary purposes. Under the Section 403(b) provisions of the Act, and in response to Amtrak's elimination of several costly and wasteful lines, California will take over daily Amtrak service between San Francisco and Sacramento.
<p>
There is no public purpose to be served by further taxpayer support of Amtrak. Nor is there any practical reason to phase out federal support only gradually, as many in Congress suggest. A careful reading of 25 years of presidential budget proposals and congressional appropriations bills for transportation, shows annual promises by Amtrak to get its house in order. But Amtrak has never delivered on its promises, and never will. This Congress should distinguish itself from its predecessors by being the first not to be fooled by Amtrak's bureaucracy or its powerful unions.
<p>
<br>
<b>The High Speed Rail Program</b><br> 
In addition to subsidizing Amtrak, the DOT subsidizes a costly high speed rail program designed to encourage the development of high speed rail corridors. This program serves no useful purpose because the inter-city transportation market already is served by self-sustaining (profitable) air and surface operators. High speed rail is not commercial in the United States for a variety of reasons, among them the country's relatively low population densities, relatively high access to automobiles, and competitive (deregulated) air transportation market, which is capable of price discounting that renders high speed rail uncompetitive. As a result, a number of privately financed high speed rail proposals have failed, and the federal government is not likely to improve on this record.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Eliminate all Amtrak funding (including operating and capital support, the Northeast Corridor improvement program, and Penn Station). Management should be encouraged to develop creative solutions for survival.
<p>
<li>Repeal the National Railroad Passenger Act and the Rail Passenger Service Act. This, among other things, would terminate Amtrak's statutory monopoly (45 USC 541).
<p>
<li>Pre-authorize, in legislation, an interstate compact among northeastern states and the District of Columbia for the purpose of facilitating Northeast Corridor rail transportation in the event that citizens of these states are willing to subsidize the service.
<p>
<li>Repeal Amtrak's labor protections. Workers today can receive up to six years severance pay and enjoy numerous other protections and privileges because of costly work rules.
<p>
<li>Repeal the high speed rail program (49 USC Chapter 22).
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with an annual budget of $8.4 billion and 49,000 employees, manages the nation's civilian air traffic control system, promotes air transport safety, and assists in the financing of airport improvements. Approximately three-quarters of its personnel are involved directly with the air traffic control system,<b>28</b> composed largely of the operations of airport control towers, which guide aircraft through landings and takeoffs, and twenty en route centers, which manage the flow of air traffic between airports in the system. The FAA has broad responsibility for regulating air transportation and managing the nation's airways, in addition to such safety-related duties as aircraft certification, airport security, maintenance inspection, and pilot licensing.
<p>
The FAA's programs are funded through a combination of general revenues and the Aviation Trust Fund, itself financed by a series of user fees and dedicated taxes related to system usage. In 1995 these user fees and special taxes totaled over $6 billion. They were derived chiefly from the passenger ticket tax ($4,829 million), the waybill tax ($325 million), the fuel tax ($195 million), and interest on the trust fund ($809 million). At the beginning of 1995, the trust fund account had accumulated to $12.3 billion.<b>29</b>
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Air Traffic Control Responsibilities</b><br>
Although the FAA's air traffic control (ATC) system has helped provide the American traveler with one of the safest forms of transportation, shifting the system to the private sector would give it the flexibility and resources needed to speed modernization, enhance operating efficiency, and better manage and retain its many employees. The ATC system's efforts to improve and modernize operations have suffered from the bureaucratic idiosyncrasies of the federal procurement process, the civil service code, and congressional and executive branch meddling. One former FAA Commissioner noted that congressional committees had mandated the installation of thirty pieces of equipment neither authorized by Congress nor requested by the FAA. At the same time, rigid government pay scales have limited the FAA's ability to attract experienced professionals to high-cost, high-stress urban air traffic control facilities.<b>30</b>
<p>
<b>Faster Modernization.</b> The ATC's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar modernization program is a costly failure. As a result, the system remains one of the world's largest users of vacuum tubes, some of which are available only through formerly East Bloc countries.<b>31</b> Freed from oppressive government procurement procedures, a privatized corporation could speed the modernization of the air traffic control system by drawing on private capital. This would reduce costs by raising worker productivity; improving passenger safety through better and more accurate controls; diminishing weather-related cancellations, delays, and safety risks; and allowing more intensive use of existing airports, thereby cutting future infrastructure costs.
<p>
At the same time, automation of the many ATC functions that would be triggered by privatization would quickly turn an existing liability into an asset. Dependent upon the obsolete, high-maintenance, and labor-intensive technologies of the past, today's air traffic control system confronts a serious shortage of skilled personnel as an aging workforce becomes eligible for retirement. With the adoption of advanced technologies that allow a few to do the work of many, and that also require less maintenance, the prospect of significant retirements over the near term would allow for the orderly and costless downsizing of FAA's substantial workforce. 
<p>
<b>Budgetary Savings.</b> Although the ATC system relies heavily on user fees, general revenues still supplement its budget. An internal DOT study in 1994 concluded that converting the FAA's ATC component into a self-sufficient, independent government corporation could lead to savings of $18 billion, or approximately $2 billion per year, from 1996 to 2005.<b>32</b> As a quasi-government entity, this corporatized system would continue to rely on the passenger ticket tax as the chief source of ATC funding, but the general revenues that now fund a portion of FAA/ATC operations would be cut off. To compensate for this loss, the system would be permitted to borrow in capital markets on its own account to fund long-term investments and modernization. The FAA's safety and regulatory functions would remain within the federal government as part of a much smaller FAA, whose role would be largely one of system oversight, a legitimate federal function that would improve in quality as the government concentrated its energies and resources on a limited number of activities. 
<p>
While the Clinton Administration's plan for the ATC system is bold and innovative by past federal reform standards, opportunities for even greater reform exist in today's political climate. These should be pursued, as they are now in other industrialized countries. At present, the air traffic control systems in Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are corporatizing, privatizing, or actively considering one of these options. 
<p>
To privatize the ATC system, Congress should use as its model the proposal developed by Robert Poole of the Reason Foundation in a series of reports and publications dating back to 1982.<b>33</b>
<p>
<b>Privatizing the ATC System</b><br> 
The first step would be to reorganize the FAA by creating, as an independent government corporation, a U.S. Airways Corporation (USAC) and transfering to it all current ATC-related FAA staff (about 40,000), all FAA facilities and equipment used to operate the ATC system, and all ATC responsibilities now held by the FAA. During the reorganization period, and until the new corporation was established and operating successfully, all of its shares would be held by the U.S. Treasury on behalf of the federal government. Also as part of the reorganization, consideration should be given to creating several new air traffic control companies to ensure post-government competition. Half the towers could go into one, and half to another (the same would be true for the en route centers). Once privatized, they would be free to compete for business.
<p>
After the transition, the shares would be sold to the public, with special allowances for concessionary purchases by existing employees and managers. Within the portion of shares available to the public, a sub-portion could be set aside for purchase by firms and industries heavily dependent upon the USAC's services, such as the major airlines or associations representing general aviation, international aviation, passengers, overnight package delivery, and general cargo. 
<p>
Once established, the USAC would operate on a self-supporting basis and would be authorized to borrow for major capital expenditures, modernization, and other improvements. In contrast to the Clinton Administration's proposal to continue funding a restructured ATC through the existing passenger ticket tax, the private USAC would be funded by a direct user fee levied on the aircraft according to their utilization of the services provided by the system. As Poole has observed, the "daunting challenge facing ATC spin-off proposals is developing a user fee structure that is politically feasible yet fully funds the corporation"<b>34</b> and which also avoids the cross-subsidies inherent in the current system.
<p>
These cross-subsidies are considerable. For example, whereas passenger ticket taxes collected through the airlines account for 88 percent of the current system's revenues, airlines utilize 49 percent of its en route services and just 20 percent of the tower services. In contrast, general aviation provides just three percent of the revenues but accounts for 21 percent of en route costs and 60 percent of tower costs.<b>35</b> At the same time, government flights, chiefly military, utilize some ATC system services, but pay no direct, indirect, or other fees, although the military air traffic controllers provide some services to civilian aircraft, also at no charge.
<p>
In developing a new fee/price structure for the USAC, Poole recommends three general guiding principles:
<p>
<li>No one should pay for services they do not use;
<p>
<li>Non-commercial ("true" general aviation) customers should pay only the marginal costs they impose on the system; and
<p>
<li>Charges should be based upon long-run economic costs. 
<p>
A fourth principle should be added to Poole's list, based on prevailing views within Congress:
<p>
<li>Military (government) flights should not incur direct charges for utilization of USAC services, but the USAC -- through an annual appropriation from general government revenues  -- should be compensated for costs incurred.
<p>
<b>Fees That Are Fair.</b> Poole proposes a fee structure based on the technique of marginal cost pricing that utilizes the earlier pioneering analysis of Richard Golaszewski.<b>36</b> Golaszewski established marginal cost estimates for each of the four major user groups (airlines, commuters, general aviation, and military) for each of the key air traffic control services (air traffic control centers, flight service stations, terminal radar control facilities, and air traffic control twoers) and then allocated to each group their estimated share of fixed costs and other overhead.<b>37</b> Poole modifies these cost estimates by inflating the original 1985 estimates to 1991 levels and by reducing non-commercial general aviation's share of the costs to direct marginal costs actually incurred. Congress should further modify the Golaszewski/Poole proposal by deleting fees charged to the military and instead covering such costs incurred by the USAC on behalf of the military (which would have amounted to $8.3 million in 1990) out of general government revenues. 
<p>
With this modification, a new fee structure that meets the four principles above and covers all costs of operating the USAC would be approximately like that indicated in the table on the previous page. This table provides the specific fee per aircraft for each service incurred for each of the four main categories of civilian aviation.
<p>
<b>Savings for Passengers and Airlines.</b> The benefits of a privatized ATC system, stimulated by the profit incentive and free to pursue modern and innovative solutions to air traffic control problems, would be substantial. One airline estimates that a satellite-based air traffic control system modeled after the military's Global Positioning System would allow for precision approaches to airports and could save the airline industry $525 million per year through delay reduction, direct flight routing, and other improvements. Other analyses put the range of savings from ATC improvements in the range of $300 million to $1.5 billion per year.<b>38</b> As noted earlier, even greater savings would accrue to the taxpayer. Both DOT and the Senate Budget Committee project annual federal budget reductions of as much as $2 billion per year from corporatizing or privatizing FAA's ATC functions, largely by shifting the funding of its capital requirements from the taxpayer to the credit markets where it more logically belongs.
<p>
Management efficiencies and service improvements would follow from the USAC's ability to escape current civil service restrictions that make it difficult to fill key positions in high-cost areas because of pay caps and national pay scales. Under the current system, key towers and control facilities in such critical places as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles frequently are understaffed because of an uncompetitive pay scale. Similarly, the end of civil service constraints would allow the hiring of more professional managers with the business skills and experience to implement a comprehensive overhaul of the system.
<p>
Most important, freedom from congressional meddling and second-guessing and an end to federal procurement requirements and red tape would allow for swift implementation of a badly needed, but oft-delayed and error-plagued, technological upgrade of the system.
<p>
<b>Taking Care of the Work Force.</b> Obviously, a restructuring involving nearly 50,000 employees entails substantial and complicated transition issues, including labor contracts and explicit and implicit employment commitments. To ease the transition and reduce employees' uncertainty regarding their treatment, a formal commitment could be made to entitle the transferred workforce to civil service retirement system benefits already earned. This commitment could be financed out of general government revenues in the same way that earned worker health and retirement benefits were maintained when the post office became an independent government corporation in 1970. Alternatively, interest earnings on -- and, if necessary, the surplus in -- the Aviation Trust Fund could be used to cover the unfunded liabilities in the civil service retirement obligations for employees transferred to the USAC. For all workers hired after the formation of the USAC, a new pension system would be established that is fully funded and consistent with private-sector norms.
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Flight Safety Responsibilities</b><br>
All existing FAA air transport safety, licensing, and certification functions would be transferred to a new independent transportation safety agency, the Interstate Transportation Safety Office or Administration (ITSO), as discussed earlier. This new entity could be funded from general revenues or from a portion of existing waybill and fuel taxes. At present, the FAA has primary safety rule-making authority, which includes certificating aircraft and developing and enforcing operating rules and procedures. Other safety functions include pilot and mechanic licensing, accident investigation, airport safety, safety analysis, and information.
<p>
ITSO would be responsible for continuing the safety-related duties now performed by the FAA and by the other transportation safety-related divisions within DOT and elsewhere. Under the current organizational arrangement, portions of these functions are located in the FAA's Regulation and Organizational Analysis Division, Regulations and Standards Training Division, Airport Safety and Operations Division, Office of Aviation Systems Standards, Civilian Aviation Security, and the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification. All of these functions and staff would be transferred to the Aviation Safety Division of the new ITSO. Funding for the aviation division of ITSO could come from the existing freight waybill tax, fuel tax, international departure tax, and interest earnings on the trust fund. DOT's 1994 "Air Traffic Control:  Analysis of Illustrative Corporate Financial Scenarios" estimates that the FAA's safety duties cost $700 million in FY 1993.
<p>
<b>Better Safety.</b> Although the FAA has an excellent reputation for overseeing one of the safest air transport systems in the world, there is always room for improvement. The proposed restructuring could help facilitate this for several reasons. First, undistracted by its commercial-type ATC functions, an independent flight safety component could devote all of its attention and energy to promoting safety. Second, and related to this, those responsible for maintaining safety no longer would have to make the compromises necessary in an entity with multiple, and at times conflicting, objectives. As the operator of the ATC system, FAA essentially regulates itself and is required to make tradeoffs in trying to promote both safety and the health of the U.S. aviation industry.
<p>
<b>Airports and the Airport Improvement Program</b><br>
Funded from the Aviation Trust Fund through a portion of the passenger ticket tax and other dedicated taxes, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants to eligible airports for certain infrastructure projects. The federal government owns no civilian airports, except for Dulles and National, both of which serve Washington, D.C., and are now operated under long-term lease to a regional authority. Of the nation's 17,000 civilian airports, 13,000 are privately owned (mostly small and serving non-commercial general aviation primarily). The other 4,000 are owned by local governments or regional public airport authorities. Within these 4,000 are all of the airports served by the commercial airline industry as well as all of the hubs, both minor and major. 
<p>
In any given year, the AIP provides just a fraction of the funding for eligible airport improvement projects, with the largest and busiest airports receiving the smallest cash return relative to passenger ticket taxes paid. A 1990 analysis found that major airports at Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, and San Francisco received in annual entitlement grants less than 12 percent of the amount they contributed to the Aviation Trust Fund in ticket taxes. Meanwhile other airports (including, for example, such smaller airports as Charlotte, Dallas, Love Field, and Memphis) each received more than 30 percent of their contribution.<b>39</b> (Because the passenger ticket tax also partly funds the FAA's air traffic control and safety responsibilities, AIP grant returns will always be well below 100 percent of ticket tax revenues.)
<p>
<b>Costly Mandates.</b> As with urban mass transit and the Highway Trust Fund, the regulations and mandates attached to federal airport grant money may be more costly than the value of the grant because they constrain an airport's ability to tailor its services to the specific needs of its community and diminish its incentive and ability to become financially more self-sufficient. In return for accepting these funds, airports must agree to a number of federal regulations, including how and how much they charge for landing fees, caps on passenger fees, and limits on the utilization of surplus revenues earned on airport operations, as well as numerous other revenue and spending restrictions.
<p>
For example, federal law requires that airports charge landing fees based on weight of the aircraft, even though small planes take as much time and runway space to land as large planes. This leads to overuse of scarce airport resources by planes carrying only a few passengers. Peak load pricing for landing fees is also prohibited, thereby removing any direct financial incentive for passengers, aircraft, and airlines to schedule flights at less congested times, and for passengers to be charged accordingly. Likewise, the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act prohibits airports from charging passengers a use fee of more than $1, $2, or $3 per passenger and limits how these revenues may be used. In a number of cases, the FAA has forbidden airports from applying such funds to improvements in surface transit access that could alleviate vehicular congestion and delays. And sections of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 prohibit federally funded airports from using any profits generated at the airport for non-airport purposes, thereby discouraging cities and communities from fully developing the economic potential of their airports.<b>40</b>
<p>
Because of the many onerous strings attached to federal grants, many airport managers have concluded that they would be better off without this assistance. A 1987 DOT poll of operators of hub airports found that the majority of large, medium, and small hub operators would be willing to give up federal financial assistance, including airport improvement grants, in return for the elimination of the numerous federal restrictions on their operations and the freedom to set their own fees on airport users.<b>41</b>
<p>
The airport grant program should be terminated along with the FAA's passenger ticket tax, a portion of which funds AIP grants from the trust fund. At the same time, all the needless federal restrictions and prohibitions on airport fees, revenues, and profits should be struck from the law. Airports should be free to fund their operations and their expansion and improvement programs with financial resources derived from their own choice of fees, rents, taxes, or other measures. With no limits on profits or what can be done with them, airports would have an incentive to develop their facilities more intensively with rent-paying hotels, restaurants, parking facilities, retail stores, offices, and other businesses that would pay a premium to be either at or near an airport. 
<p>
Airports also could alter their landing fee structure by raising fees at peak times -- early morning and late afternoon -- and lowering them at off-peak times to encourage airlines to shift flights to less congested periods. Similarly, they could reimpose some form of a ticket tax, or head tax, but at well below current rates. Whatever the choice, the source and amount of the replacement revenues would conform more closely to the specific needs of a particular airport, as well as the passengers and airlines it serves. At the same time, improvement projects at any airport would occur when it chose, not when officials in Washington finally approve and schedule the project. 
<p>
To accomplish this, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act must be amended substantially, and the remaining portions of these laws limited largely to legitimate safety issues and <i>bona fide</i> issues of interstate commerce. These legislative changes would better facilitate airport privatization at the discretion of existing airport owners (primarily state and local governments), or regional authorities established on their behalf. Currently, such privatizations are authorized, albeit on a restrictive basis, by Executive Order 12803, issued by President George Bush on April 30, 1992, and implicitly endorsed by the Clinton Administration, which issued Executive Order 12983 on January 6, 1994, to clarify federal law facilitating such privatizations. These orders, and FAA's narrow and limiting interpretation of them, should be reviewed and changed as necessary to reflect the broader privatization options that would be available under the above proposals.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Transform the Air Traffic Control system into an independent corporation. This could be either government or private, funded entirely by direct user fees.
<p>
<li>Transfer FAA safety responsibilities to a new federal safety department.
<p>
<li>"Defederalize" airports by freeing them from non-safety-related regulations as well as financial support from the Airport Improvement Program.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE COAST GUARD</b><br>
With an annual budget of approximately $3.7 billion, the Coast Guard (CG) performs a variety of services, including coastal law enforcement and national defense, marine safety, environmental protection, search and rescue, and navigation and waterway management (traffic management, ice breaking, and maintenance of navigational aids).
<p>
Given the large changes in its objectives over the past several decades in response to the rapid increase in drug smuggling, the Coast Guard and its law enforcement and defense functions should be transferred to the Department of Justice to permit better coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies and activities. Related Coast Guard functions also should be transferred to Justice. These include the Office of Command, Control and Communications; Office of Engineering, Logistics and Development (ELD); Office of Personnel and Training; Office of Readiness and Reserve; and Military Personnel Command. ELD would be given more of an oversight function, with much of the work now done in house performed by the private sector on a contract basis.
<p>
With its focus now primarily on law enforcement, the Coast Guard's search and rescue duties should be limited to extreme emergencies and severe weather. Routine rescues and assistance to recreational and commercial boaters would become the responsibility of the more than 200 existing private rescue services that handled more than 40,000 cases last year. Among other savings, this should allow for a significant reduction in the number of Coast Guard air and sea facilities, including the 185 small boat units now maintained by the Coast Guard, as recommended by the General Accounting Office.<b>42</b>
<p>
The Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection should be split among existing government departments. Environmental responsibilities should be shifted to the EPA, and oversight for marine safety matters should be transferred to the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office. The Coast Guard already is using the private sector for some licensing and inspection, and this should be accelerated. Merchant vessel regulatory issues other than safety or environment should remain within the divisions transferred to Justice.
<p>
Waterway navigation, maintenance, and safety responsibilities of the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services that are purely local or regional in scope -- rivers, bays, ports, and harbors -- should become the responsibility of contiguous states. Those of an unambiguous national nature would remain with the Coast Guard as reconstituted within the Department of Justice. Many of these functions could be privatized easily. GAO, for example, has recommended the VTS 2000 system now under development as a candidate for privatization. The Port of Los Angeles VTS system already has been privatized.
<p>
<br>
<b>The Maritime Administration (MARAD)</b><br>
The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to ensure that the United States maintained a domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency. Organized as an agency within the Department of Transportation, it spends nearly $700 million a year implementing a series of Depression-era maritime laws that shield U.S.-flagged vessels from foreign competition. 
<p>
MARAD's Operating Differential direct subsidy program pays U.S.-flag vessel operators the difference between the costs of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flagged vessel and the costs of shipping on a foreign-flagged vessel. The Ocean Freight Differential program (authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985) subsidizes a portion of the cargo preference costs on agricultural food aid shipments for commodities exported with grants or loans from the Department of Agriculture. Cargo preference laws require that 75 percent of such exports be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The Jones Act, authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires that cargo transported between two U.S. cities be carried on U.S.-built and U.S.-flagged vessels. MARAD also maintains the merchant ships retained in the Defense Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be closed down, and the Operating Differential Subsidies, Cargo Preference rules, and Jones Act should be repealed. The government-owned merchant ships in the Ready Reserve Fleet should be sold and the Federal Ship Financing and Maritime Guaranteed Loan programs ended.
<p>
For over sixty years, the federal government has spent billions on a variety of programs intended to support the U.S. maritime industry. Instead, these programs have undermined the competitiveness of U.S. shipping and shipbuilding. Today, only about four percent of waterborne cargoes imported and exported from the United States are carried on U.S.-flag carriers. According to the GAO, between 1982 and 1992 the number of U.S. privately owned ships decreased by 31.4 percent, from 574 to 394.<b>43</b>
<p>
The Maritime Administration pays over $200 million in direct Operating Differential subsidies to 48 oceangoing container ships and 27 bulk cargo vessels. Most of these subsidy contracts are due to expire by the end of 1997. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget requested a reduction to $154 million. However, the Administration also would create a new Maritime Security Program which would give $100 million per year in direct payments to up to fifty U.S. flagged vessels for a period of ten years. This proposal should be rejected.
<p>
In 1994, the GAO reported that "the application of cargo preference to food aid programs does not significantly contribute to meeting the intended objectives of helping to maintain U.S.-flag ships as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency or for purposes of domestic or foreign commerce."  The GAO found that by sheltering U.S. shippers from competition, "cargo preference laws make it possible for U.S. ship owners to maintain inefficient and commercially uncompetitive U.S.-flag ships that do not significantly contribute to the ability of the U.S. merchant marine to carry foreign commerce other than food aid."<b>44</b>
<p>
MARAD's Ocean Freight Differential program spends over $60 million a year reimbursing the higher costs paid by the Department of Agriculture to export domestic agricultural products. These cargo preference requirements, as they are known, also increase by some $520 million annually the shipping costs for the Departments of Transportation and Defense, the Agency for International Development, and the Export-Import Bank. The Maritime Administration does not reimburse these agencies for these added costs. Meanwhile, Jones Act restrictions on inter-city cargo transport cost consumers billions of dollars but do not show up on the federal budget. According to a September 1994 study by the International Trade Commission, the Jones Act increases costs to American consumers by at least $3 billion annually, and perhaps by as much as $10 billion.
<p>
The Maritime Administration spent $330 million in fiscal 1994 and $205 million in fiscal 1995 maintaining the fleet of government-owned merchant ships known as the Ready Reserve Force. By all accounts, these vessels are in such a state of disrepair that only a few could be made seaworthy in time to carry cargo for the Persian Gulf War. These ships should be sold for whatever the government can get for them.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Shut down the Maritime Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the Operating Differential Subsidies, the Cargo Preference Rules, and the Jones Act.
<p>
<li>Privatize the Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
<li>Terminate the Federal Ship Financing Program and the guaranteed loan program.

Lecture 536: Downsizing Government, by Senator Abraham
 -- Heritage </title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 536</b>

<hr>
<h3>Downsizing Government:  Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3>
Senator Abraham addressed a meeting of The <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage">Heritage Foundation</a>'s Washington Policy Roundtable on July  26,  1995.
<p>
<br>
As the Co-Chair of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov/">Senate</a> sponsor of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our efforts to eliminate the <a href="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</a>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank The Heritage Foundation for putting forward detailed proposals for eliminating several Cabinet departments; many of your suggestions have found their way into the four Cabinet elimination bills that the task force has developed.
<p>
In my mind, no issue better symbolizes the dramatic changes that have occurred since the November elections than the ongoing efforts to eliminate departments of the federal government.  Just a year ago, members walking the halls of Congress were discussing the merits of making the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> a Cabinet-level department.  Today, Morton Kondracke is predicting on "The McLaughlin Group" that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the Department of Commerce will not be eliminated this year.  I don't agree with his prediction, but I like his choice of topics.
<p>
Our task force was set up to examine ways to dismantle four Cabinet departments:  Commerce, <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>. These four departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have combined budgets of $70 billion -- 133 times more than the entire federal government spent at the turn of the century. We must target these departments if we are truly to restrain the growth of government, reduce the tax burden on American businesses and workers, and balance the budget.
<p>
The goal of our task force is not simply to "zero out" these Cabinet departments, but rather to examine rational approaches to consolidate, privatize, and/or devolve back to the states their functions.  In our efforts, we adopted the following four principles as our guide:
<ul>
<p>
1) Those programs deemed unnecessary or wasteful are terminated;
<p>
2) Those programs duplicative of other departments or agencies are consolidated;
<p>
3) Those programs that serve a valid purpose are transferred to more appropriate agencies; and
<p>
4) Those programs which can be better performed outside the government will be privatized.
</ul>
<p>
By applying these guiding principles, our Cabinet proposals both reduce the federal spending on, and increase the effectiveness of the truly vital functions of, each department. 
<p>
Now let me turn to our efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department -- the only department slated for elimination in the congressional budget resolution.  As former Commerce Secretary Mosbacher notes, the department is "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  In my judgment, no other department better symbolizes the waste and duplication prevalent in the federal government than Commerce.
<p>
First, many of the department's functions are either duplicated or outperformed by other government agencies and private industry. Its own Inspector General notes that the department has evolved into a "loose collection of more than 100 programs," while the GAO states that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities," sharing its "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."
<p>
Second, its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and more than 60 percent of its resources are dedicated to noncommercial activities. For example, almost 60 percent of the department's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> -- the nation's weather and ocean mapping service.
<p>
Third, many of its programs are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.  A prime example is the notorious Economic Development Administration.  At some point in its history, 40 percent of the EDA's loans were in default, while economic assistance grants were being distributed to such economically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, Florida.  Even when it is effective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in other departments.
<p>
Today's Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented." Its problems can be solved only if it is dismantled. Using the four guiding principles I mentioned earlier, our Commerce legislation would do the following:
<p>
First, we would eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and wasteful programs such as the EDA, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a>.
<p>
Second, we would transfer the various functions of NOAA -- which comprises the lion's share of the department's budget -- to more appropriate agencies and departments, or to private institutions.  For example, seafood inspection would be transferred to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, which already carries out most food inspection programs.  Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be transferred to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/avads/index.html">Interior Department</a>, which already manages some fisheries.
<p>
Third, we would transfer many of the Commerce Department's trade programs to agencies where their functions may be better performed.  Nineteen distinct federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. exports, but only 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. Secretary <a href="http://www.doc.gov/misc/BrownBio.html ">Ron Brown</a> may argue that Commerce leads federal efforts at export promotion, but almost three-quarters of the export promotion funds go to the Department of Agriculture, not Commerce. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the very traits that make Commerce a likely target for elimination -- its hodgepodge of unrelated agencies -- also make navigating its elimination through the legislative process extremely difficult.  Commerce offers something for everyone, and our efforts have stepped on a lot of toes. In the end, however, I believe we will prevail for the simple reason that, while one can justify many of the programs under the Commerce umbrella, there is no justification for the umbrella itself.  It's an accident of political evolution, not the product of sound policy.
<p>
For that reason, dismantling the department presents us with the unique opportunity to rationalize many of the functions currently under its jurisdiction, including those functions related to trade.  Let me say at the outset that I am a big proponent of free and expanded trade.  During my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I endorsed the <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/nafta.html">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, a politically difficult position to take coming from an industrial state like Michigan.  In fact, I was the only candidate from either party to do so.  Expanded trade does increase American jobs and living standards.
<p>
Clearly, establishing contacts and building trade relationships is important.  But just how effective is the current structure of our federal trade programs?  Opposition to dismantling Commerce comes from two sources -- bureaucrats in the Department who stand to lose their power and prestige, and certain portions of the business community who are concerned about our proposed reforms of the department's trade functions. Their principal concern is that Commerce is essential to promoting American exports abroad.  In fact, in testimony before a House committee the other day, Secretary Brown claimed that the Commerce Department is a "job creator" that builds the economy by increasing exports.
<p>
You might have heard the claim that trade advocacy and counseling efforts by the Commerce Department "returned $10.41 to the federal Treasury for every dollar invested in export promotion."  According to the Department of Commerce, this number and others like it are based upon undefined estimates.  As the Heritage Foundation's Joe Cobb pointed out in testimony Monday before the House Commerce Committee, "estimate" means "made up." Other economists agree. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute and former economic advisor to Bill Clinton argues that there is "no economics" to the notion that export promotion creates jobs. Shapiro states, "All you can do with them is increase jobs for companies with the clout to get the subsidy. But that's at the expense of industries that don't have the clout. You're just shifting things around."
<p>
None of this is to say that the federal government has no role in promoting international trade.  My legislation begins the important process of consolidating our trade functions by transferring them to more appropriate agencies, thereby increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. As former Commerce official Wayne Berman points out, "You shouldn't negotiate open markets in one department and then try to exploit those open markets in another department. It ought to be a focused, well coordinated effort."
<p>
The Commerce Department Dismantling Act embraces this view by transferring over 70 percent of the International Trade Administration, including the Import Administration and the Foreign Commercial Service offices, to the USTR, creating one office where our trade agreements are negotiated and enforced.  In addition, the legislation creates a series of Industry Advisory Boards composed of representatives from the private sector to provide advice to policymakers and to ensure that industry has a "voice" in any administration.
<p>
Another trade-related agency my bill affects is the Bureau of Export Administration.  As it is currently situated, the Export Administration is criticized for two failings.  According to the defense community, it does a poor job of analyzing risks and protecting U.S. security interests.  Meanwhile, businesses criticize the Administration for being unresponsive to many requests by industry, often sitting on applications for extended periods of time instead of notifying the exporter of possible problems.
<p>
Given these criticisms, I see legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce as an opportunity to make the Export Administration more responsive through two basic reforms: First, setting a time limit for granting export licenses and second, formalizing, either legislatively or through report language, the inter-agency process by which licensing concerns are raised.  These two reforms would make the BXA a much more effective partner with businesses while protecting our national security.
<p>
In conclusion, let me say that the 104th Congress has a historic opportunity to stop the growth of government and move us toward the limited central government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Given this opportunity, it would be a tragedy if one of the flagship efforts of the new leadership, the effort to eliminate the Department of Commerce, is defeated.  It will be impossible, in my judgment, to successfully address the massive growth of government and balance the budget if we cannot even address dismantling this department and redesignating its core functions to other agencies.  If we lack the will to do this, it will be virtually impossible to implement the reductions in social service programs that will be necessary to achieve balance.
<p>
My point is this: If we cannot dismantle the Department of Commerce simply because 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion must be spent by the department, then where can we cut spending? In my judgment, if we don't dismantle one of the least defensible Cabinet departments, then we won't make the tough decisions to limit spending for other sympathy-engendering spending programs.
<p>
In closing, I believe the goals of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and those of American industry are the same -- limited government, efficient regulation, low taxes. In that sense, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is more than just a symbol for eliminating government waste;  it's a  key step in downsizing government for the benefit of all Americans. I hope that we can work together to make the elimination of this department a reality.

Backgrounder Update #253<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
<p>
Updating <I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, May 1995.<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>

 Despite much talk in the Clinton Administration about ending
&quot;corporate welfare,&quot; the Administration actually has
flinched from offering concrete proposals. When President Clinton
released his first Fiscal Year 1996 budget in February, there
were only a handful of proposals to end corporate subsidies. And
when the President unveiled his revised budget blueprint last
week, he recommended only a $25 billion reduction in unspecified
corporate subsidies - and took pride in drawing attention to his
plans to boost spending on two high-technology pork programs slated
for termination by Congress. 
<P>
  The President's weak attack on corporate welfare contrasts sharply
with the way in which Washington policy groups and the new Congress
responded to the Administration's call to trim unnecessary business
subsidies. The Heritage Foundation, along with many other research
organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Progressive Policy
Institute, have reviewed the federal budget and identified dozens
of corporate welfare programs that should be eliminated. In <I>Rolling
Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, The Heritage
Foundation identified more than three dozen spending subsidy programs
as corporate welfare that should be reduced or eliminated, producing
more than $100 billion in savings over the next five years. As
the attached table illustrates, many programs were included in
the House and Senate budget proposals, but not in either one of
the President's two budget proposals. 
<P>
 For decades, the federal government has been providing American
businesses with billions of dollars in spending subsidies. These
have been justified by proponents as necessary to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in the world economy, encourage the development
of high technology products and research, maintain a strong national
defense, or assist socially disadvantaged groups. Most of these
spending subsidies are concentrated in three industry groups -
agribusiness, transportation, and energy and natural resources
- to support research, advertising, and other costs of doing business
that achieve these goals.
<P>
 Experience indicates that most spending subsidies for business
do not achieve their goals and are not in America's economic interest.
These subsidies can be expensive and actually hurt the economy.
Subsidizing one business or industry rather than another distorts
private investment decisions, taking resources from more efficient
uses. Over the last ten years, for example, the federal government
has spent, on average, about $14 billion annually subsidizing
production of wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and other commodities.
More than half of farm payments flow to farmers with gross farm
sales in excess of $100,000 annually. This has led to crops being
planted and harvested at great - but subsidized - cost in places
where production is uneconomic. Allowing farmers to make their
production decisions based on market forces rather than government
subsidies would result in a far more efficient farm economy.
<P>
 Some subsidies are just a waste of money, providing little economic
benefit. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is an excellent
example. SBA is supposed to aid the development and expansion
of small businesses through direct and guaranteed low-interest
loans worth more than $11 billion annually. However, SBA's loan
loss rate is greater than that of private lenders, and the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO) has questioned whether the SBA's
assistance actually helps stimulate small business development
at all. Other examples of waste include: monies from the $4.6
billion Community Development Block Grant program to pay for swimming
pools, carousel renovations, and other forms of local pork, and
the $17 million spent each year by the U.S. Travel and Tourism
Administration to help the $55 billion tourism industry promote
tourism in the United States.
<P>
 Rather than end corporate welfare, Clinton's budget actually
would add the high technology and information services sectors
to the list of heavily subsidized industries. The nation's economy
has been shifting from manufacturing to a high technology and
information services base. This has been occurring without government
help. But the Clinton Administration wants Congress to enact generous
subsidies to promote high technology products and research. For
example, the President proposes to increase, &quot;by almost $500
million a year by 2002,&quot; the Advanced Technology Program
(ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). In <I>Ending
Corporate Welfare As We Know It</I>, the Cato Institute points
out that in 1994 ATP money went to a number of Fortune 500 firms,
such as AT&amp;T, Shell Petroleum, Inc., Boeing, Inc., and Chevron
Corporation. At the same time the President is proposing to increase
such subsidies, he also is proposing to increase taxes to end
corporate welfare by eliminating a set of still undefined &quot;corporate
loopholes&quot; and &quot;special interest tax breaks.&quot;
<P>
 Spending subsidies too often either enrich those who have already
detected good profit opportunities or direct private capital into
less efficient investments. An example of the latter is the Administration's
support for high speed rail systems. The GAO reported that, without
federal support, such systems are unlikely to be built because
the private sector does not consider them to be financially viable.
The costs of laying one mile of track for a high speed system
can run between $10 million and $20 million. Nevertheless, the
Administration has supported spending as much as $1.3 billion
over five years, even though the American taxpayers might never
see one mile of high speed track. 
<P>
 Taxpayers may recall that programs like this have been proposed
and funded more than once before, only to turn into expensive
white elephants. In the late 1960s, the federal government spent
nearly $1 billion on the Supersonic Transport, which went bankrupt
and never flew a single passenger. In the late 1970s, the federal
government spent more than $2 billion on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation
to produce new forms of energy, but it was shut down without producing
a single kilowatt of power.
<P>
 Only when spending subsidies clearly provide a benefit in the
national interest, such as a strong defense, should they be preserved.
Because it is a legitimate function of the federal government
to provide a national defense, &quot;uneconomic&quot; investments
in the research and development of new defense technology are
justifiable. For example, R&amp;D investments within the Department
of Defense are critical to preserving the nation's security and
cannot be considered corporate welfare - even though they should
be scrutinized carefully for waste. On the other hand, the part
of NASA's budget spent on aeronautical research and development
programs that subsidize R&amp;D for the commercial aircraft industry
should be eliminated.
<P>
 As the House and Senate work on a final budget resolution, lawmakers
must resist the last-minute pressure of corporate special interests,
take a far bolder step than the Clinton Administration, and adopt
the deep cuts in corporate welfare. If Congress does not adopt
the House proposals in the final budget bill, it will show a lack
of will to make even the most basic cuts in spending subsidies,
the true &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; If so, Congress will be
guilty of the same hypocrisy as the Clinton Administration, which
has ignored its own call to end corporate welfare. Congress must
demonstrate evenhandedness in ending wasteful, unnecessary programs
and start making significant cuts in corporate welfare in the
FY 1996 budget.

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

<h2>The FCC and the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Putting Competition on Hold?</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, II and Jeffrey A. Eisenach
<a href="compfoot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
After years of hard work, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law designed to "provide a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework  by opening all telecommunications markets to competition."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#1">1</A></sup>  The bill has been heralded by leaders of both major political parties as a significant step toward moving America's telecommunications system into the digital age.However, as many of us pointed out at the time, the Act did not guarantee a deregulatory outcome.  Instead, it gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulatory commissions permission to pursue deregulation.  Unfortunately, the early signs suggest the FCC has gone in the opposite direction, attempting to use the Act to expand its regulatory authority.  
<p>
The best evidence that the Commission has gone astray is its massive "interconnect" order, issued this August.  Intended to implement the provisions of the Act requiring competition in local telephone service, the order established a complex and pervasive system of Federal price regulation, effectively pre-empting the process of private negotiations and state oversight Congress intended as the means to achieve competitive markets.
<p>
This month, acting at the behest of state regulators, local telephone companies and others, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC's rules, pending a hearing scheduled for early next year.  Thus, by overreaching and failing to abide by the Act's intent, the FCC has allowed the entire process of telecommunications deregulation to be placed, at least in part, "on hold."  The new rules -- and the litigation they have inspired -- will in all likelihood delay the advent of competition for local telecommunications services.  And, as the FCC moves to implement other provisions of the Act -- including its universal service provisions -- the new rules send a worrisome signal that the Commission still views itself as the regulatory czar of the telecommunications marketplace.
<p>
<CENTER><B>The 1996 Act and Congressional Intent</B></CENTER>
<p>
The intent of Congress in the Telecommunications Act was clear: to open up local telephone networks to competition, principally through the interconnection of telephone networks so that all carriers can compete and complete the calls of their customers. However, the Act, like many such massive bills, speaks only in broad terms, leaving tremendous discretion to the FCC and to state Public Utility Commissions charged with implementing its provisions. 
<P>
According to the Act, the interconnection process is to be driven principally through negotiations among the carriers competing in the market.  Congress considered private negotiations, not regulatory fiat, to be the best means of moving rapidly toward a competitive telecommunications industry.  Congress gave the FCC authority to implement the interconnection policy contained in the Act through the adoption of overall guidelines, but did not intend for the FCC to write detailed requirements governing every aspect of interconnection agreements.  That was supposed to be left to the market and to the states, which are authorized to act as arbitrators in cases where interconnection negotiations break down.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Implementation:  Undermining the Law</B></CENTER>
<p>
In some areas of implementation, such as the entry of the Baby Bell telephone companies into video, the FCC seems to accept the broad deregulatory intent of the Act.  But in the interconnection proceeding, the FCC adopted a very heavy-handed, regulatory approach. In its August 1996 "interconnect" order, consisting of more than 1,400 single-spaced pages and 3,200 footnotes, the FCC issued minutely detailed regulations governing local-loop competition.<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#2">2</A></sup>  The rulemaking addresses nearly 10,000 issues and sub-issues, and adopts meticulous directives for many of them.  Among the egregious examples of over-regulation is a requirement on how to allocate square footage in a telephone company central office, including how floor plans must be devised.  There is even a requirement that phone companies check with their competitors before remodeling.
<p>
The FCC's approach to implementing the Act demonstrates its lack of faith in the ability of the market and states to promote competition in telecommunications.  For instance, the FCC regulations determine in detail the manner in which interconnection should occur, leaving little room for private negotiations among competitors.  The FCC expressly rejected the prospect that individual states might implement the Act in ways tailored to local market conditions, suggesting that such an approach would create too great an administrative burden for Federal regulators.  Instead, the rules provide for a national baseline for companies to follow in negotiating the price and manner of interconnection agreements.  These provisions usurp from the states their historic authority to regulate local telephony and reduce their role to merely checking that the FCC's rules are followed.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Back in Court</B></CENTER>
<p>
After years of difficult negotiation in Congress, where competing sectors of the telecommunications industry were heard and their interests and the public interest were carefully balanced, the 1996 Act emerged as a bill that no one saw as perfect, but most saw as a step forward.  Importantly, the Act offered the prospect of removing oversight of telecommunications markets from the courts (which have acted as de facto regulators under the infamous "Modified Final Judgment" breaking up AT&T) and placing it back in the hands of the marketplace, the states and -- to a limited extent -- Federal regulators.
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has had the opposite effect.  By attempting to use the Act as the basis for a Federal power grab, the Commission ensured a court challenge.  That challenge came not just from aggrieved parties (i.e., local telephone companies) who found the Commission's pricing rules unfair, but also from states who saw the order as an infringement on their authority.
<p>
In granting a stay of the FCC's order, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear its view that the Commission's order was more likely to harm competition than encourage it.  "Before the FCC published its regulations," the court found, the parties were "working together to implement the local competition provisions of the Act. The Act's system of private negotiation backed by state-run arbitration was operating without input from the FCC."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#3">3</A></sup>  The Commission's order, said the court, would "establish a price ceiling," which "inevitably confines and restricts the give and take of free negotiations and arbitrations."  As a result of the order, the court continued, "the negotiations preferred by Congress are already breaking down due to the competitors' desire to hold out for the FCC's proxy rates" (i.e., the price ceilings set in the FCC's order).
<p>
The court was also clear in suggesting that the Commission overstepped its bounds. "[W]e are skeptical," it stated, "that the FCC's roundabout construction of the statute could override what, at first blush, appears to be a rather clear and direct indication . . . that the state commissions should establish prices."  As a result, the court concluded, "the petitioners have demonstrated that they will likely succeed on the merits of their appeals."
<p>
Still, no one can be sure how the court -- which will not issue a final decision until at least next Spring -- will ultimately rule.  Thus, the process of creating competition in local telephone markets is effectively on hold.  Such legal wrangling, which may drag on for years, will delay the implementation of the law, denying to consumers the benefits of competition in the local telephone market  -- including access to low-cost ISDN and other advanced services needed for growth of the Internet.   
<p>
<CENTER><B>What Next?  Implementing Universal Service</B></CENTER>
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has implications well beyond the question of local competition.  In particular, it creates a dangerous precedent as the FCC prepares to implement the universal service provisions of the 1996 Act.
<P>
By November 8, the Federal-State Joint Board created by the Telecommunications Act will make a recommendation to the FCC on implementing the universal service provisions.  The Joint Board is almost exclusively composed of regulators, and it thus will not be surprising if they recommend regulation as the best method of implementation.  If the interconnect rule really does signal the FCC's continued love affair with detailed, excessive regulation, the result could well be yet another attempt to expand Federal authority.  The intent of the Telecommunications Act could, in other words, once again be turned on its head.
<P>
The Joint Board and the FCC should keep in mind a number of principles regarding universal service, including:
<P>
While people may have a "right" to dial-tone service to call the police or paramedics, no-one has a "right for that dial tone to be delivered over wires."  In some cases cellular phone service may be less expensive than wire.  If anything is to be mandated, it should be the service offered, not the technology by which it is accomplished.
<P>
Federal mandates, if any, should be minimal and limited to lifeline telephone service.  Provision of other telecommunications services (for example, voicemail or Internet access) should not be mandated from Washington but left to state officials to order and purchase.
<P>
Federally mandated universal service should be paid for by the Federal government; such subsidies should be raised in a competitively neutral manner and be obvious to those from whom they are collected.  States should be responsible for paying for any supplemental state mandates.  The FCC should set guidelines to ensure that any state subsidies are raised in a competitively neutral manner and are explicit to those from whom they are collected.
<P>
The essentially local nature of universal service  as ordered by Congress and demanded in practice  reinforces many of the arguments advanced by Congress and the Courts on interconnection.  The costs of specific universal service programs are impacted, in large part, by the progress of competition in specific local markets and the pricing of interconnection agreements.  The devolution of Federal authority over interconnection agreements therefore implies the devolution of universal service mandates.  On the other hand, Federal usurpation of state authority on interconnection issues makes state leadership on universal service questions nearly impossible.
<P>
Wherever possible, the FCC should rely on the market, not regulation, to most effectively implement universal service policies.  For instance, competitive bidding (similar to FCC-auctioned licenses for personal communications systems) could be used to control the cost of subsidies in high-cost areas.  Auctions to provide service among potential competitors would reveal the minimum subsidy required for them to provide service.  This would remove the arbitrariness and controversy associated with cost estimation by government mandate.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Moving Ahead:  Accountability to Congress</B></CENTER>
<P>
The telecommuncations marketplace is not yet fully competitive.  Congress recognized the need for continuing, limited oversight by the FCC to manage the transition.  But massive, detailed regulation is not the way to achieve competition.  Instead, in implementing the Telecommunications Act, the FCC should concentrate its efforts on a few overarching issues and articulate a limited number of boundary-setting guidelines.  The practical, prudent approach is for the FCC to defer largely to the states, while preserving the FCC's ability to address significant problems on review.
<P>
If the FCC fails to reaffirm both the deregulatory intent and the devolutionary spirit embraced by the Telecommunications Act, the prospects for rapid progress toward a competitive telecommunications marketplace will be dramatically reduced, and Congress' central intent in passing the Act will be frustrated.   The question for Congress will then be clear:  Will it allow a regulatory agency to flaunt Congressional will, or will it act to ensure that the goal of a competitive marketplace is achieved?<p><BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>In an attempt to keep Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" in perspective, The Progress & Freedom Foundation convened its Aspen Summit '96:  Cyberspace and the American Dream Conference August 4-6.
More than 150 people gathered in Aspen, Colorado, to explore the promise and peril of the Digital Revolution.  "We want to remind ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  Great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay  even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world," said Foundation President Jeffrey A. Eisenach.
<P>
<a name="first">
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>First Panel</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/society.gif" ALIGN="left">
<DD>David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report moderated a panel discussion on "Shaping American Society for the Digital Age" that featured Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, David Gelernter of Yale University and Heather Higgins of PFF.
<DD>Dyson described how in the digital world people may need to distinguish between public and private persons.  A private person, using encryption technology as a defense mechanism to protect themselves, is ensured of confidentiality in one-to-one communications like e-mail.  However, when one posts information on the Internet for all to see, offers something to sell, or asks for credit to pay bills, that part of their activity becomes public and will require more disclosure and verification.
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist and author of 1939:  The Lost World of the Fair, said that America's biggest problems, our failing education system and struggling families, are things computers cannot deal with.  Basically, Gelernter said, we use computers for word processing, data manipulation, information storage and communication.  However, he asked, "compared to Americans in 1939, are we better writers?  More informed?  Better educated?  Richer communicators?"
After the discussion, Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) offered "a practical view" on the how the digital revolution is affecting American society.  "When I walk into a labor hall and a union member tells me that he just lost his manufacturing job, what am I supposed to say? 'Great, now you can go get a knowledge job.'"
<P>
<a name="second">
<BR>
<H4>Second Panel</H4>
<P>
<DD>A second panel discussion at the Summit, moderated by Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute, featured author George Gilder, Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, Rich Karlgaard of Forbes ASAP and Jay Keyworth of PFF.  Les Vadasz of Intel offered the "practical view" of the technologies creating the new economy.
<DD>After a series of working group sessions on Education, Regulatory Convergence, Intellectual Property, and Privacy and Censorship, the Summit concluded with a debate on if the "Growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of Progress."
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<a name="toffler">
<BR>
<H4>Toffler Explores Political Flexibility</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>"What do Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich have in common?" asked author Alvin Toffler as he opened PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  "They both promised revolutionary change  Hillary in health care and Newt more broadly  and both were slapped down," he concluded.
<DD>Toffler's speech, titled "Future Shock in the Present Tense," described how Americans feel battered by the very acceleration of the Information Revolution.  "They want a chance to slow down and <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/toffle.gif" ALIGN="left">catch their breath.  People, including companies, are disoriented and grasp after anything" that seems to offer reassurance.
<DD>The American political system, its very structure, Toffler said, is ultra stable and resists change.  "It punishes change makers like Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich."  Toffler explored whether Americans want a political system that is more flexible and thus might better adjust to the changes in society being engendered by the Information Revolution.  With too many alienated people, Toffler wondered if more flexibility in America's political structure might be needed to avoid violence.
<DD>Toffler also spoke about the importance of no longer discussing "the future of the economy" because it implies a continuation of the industrial age, but instead to focus on "the economy of the future," which will compel a redefinition of basic economic fundamentals.
<DD>In conclusion, Toffler said that the Information Age is shattering existing cultures around the world, and while we can "remain American, we cannot remain Americans of the past but will be Americans of the future."

<H4>Making Public Policy for Cyberspace</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Representative Rick White (R-WA), co-chair of the bi-cameral and bi-partisan <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/bradley.gif" ALT="Rep. Rick White and Sen. Bill Bradley at Aspen Summit '96"  ALIGN="right">Congressional Internet Caucus, addressed the Chairman's Dinner at PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  White urged the high-tech audience to learn how to effectively deal with Congress.  Until recently, the computer industry did not need to interact much with Washington, White said, but with their success has come increased government involvement in the industry.

<BR>
<a name="pull">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>It's Time to Pull the Plug on Federal Power</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Declaring that federally owned power facilities created during the New Deal have accomplished their mission, PFF released a white paper urging their privatization.  The <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/1.gif" ALT="Rep. John Shadegg"  ALIGN=right>paper, co-authored by Representative John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Foundation Senior Fellow Michael Block, proposes a privatization method modeled on Czech experience, where consumers receive a portion of the money from privatization.
<DD>Power Marketing Administrations (PMA's) were designed to provide a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas; today, many of the once underdeveloped areas are affluent.   "PMAs' assets are of significant value to the private electric energy industry and, if sold by the government, would increase operating efficiency, eliminate market distortions, advance competition in electricity markets, and generate significant revenue for federal deficit reduction," argues the paper.
<DD>The paper  Lights Out on Federal Power:  Privatization for the   21st Century  outlines how the federal government should sell three PMA's, generating nearly $4.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit.

<P>
<H4>PFF Releases Telecom Book, The Innovation Age</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Peter K. Pitsch, PFF Adjunct Fellow and former Chief of Staff and Research Director at the FCC, authored the newly released Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution.
<DD>Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic, technological and social change that Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  Economic growth in this realm, argues Pitsch, depends on constant innovation and competition; therefore, government efforts to regulate these new technologies should adapt to reflect this new paradigm.
<DD>"Today's complexity and change make Hayek's 'spontaneous order' and Schumpeter's 'creative destruction' more compelling than ever before.  Peter Pitsch combines these concepts in a new economics of innovation that provides an illuminating view of telecom  both how to understand it and why market forces will regulate it best," says author George Gilder about The Innovation Age.
<P>
<a name="clean">
<P>
<H4>For Cleaner Air,  PFF Says Think Globally, Act Locally</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>A new PFF white paper urges the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.
<DD>"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas. 
<DD>"Alternative fuel  or non petroleum-based  vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions' strategies for meeting clean air goals," says the paper.

<H4>Fortson Joins District Council</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Senior Fellow Jane Fortson, director of PFF's Social and Cultural Studies, continues her involvement in urban issues and the District of Columbia.  She recently joined other District leaders as a founding board member of the DC Agenda Support Corporation, an organization modeled after the highly successful Fund for the City of New York.  Additionally, she is participating in an advisory group examining revenue issues for the District, sponsored by the Brookings Institution.

<h2>The Unveiling of the Innovation Age </h2>
</center>

On behalf of Hudson Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation, I am pleased to invite you to a special briefing on Wednesday, September 11 to unveil Hudson's latest book,<i> The Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution</i>.  The book's author is Hudson and PFF adjunct fellow Peter Pitsch, former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications Commission.<p>


Mr. Pitsch will provide opening remarks, and we have asked <b>Congressman Bob Walker</b> (R-PA) to do the same.  Serving as panel discussants will be <b>William E. Cohen</b>, Deputy Director, Policy Planning, for the Federal Trade Commission and <b> Blair Levin</b>, Chief of Staff for Chairman Reed Hundt of the Federal Communications Commission.  In discussing Mr. Pitsch's new book, they will attempt to answer the following questions:<p>
<ul> 
<li>Is the "Innovation Age" real?
<li>Does it require developing a new political economy of innovation?
<li>Has it strengthened the comparative advantage of marketplace solutions vis--vis regulation?
<li>Are the book's proposed reforms to telecommunications regulation desirable?
</ul>
	Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic and technological change which Mr. Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  In the book, he describes how the resulting complexity and potential for explosive growth have increased the cost of regulatory distortions, especially in the telecommunications market.  Peter Passell of <i>The New York Times</i> calls <i>The Innovation Age </I>  "painless introduction to the way economists are now rethinking regulation."<p>

	<i>This special briefing will be held from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 11, in Room 106 of Dirksen Senate Office Building.</i>  If you would like additional information, please call Mary Brown, Hudson's Director of Special Events, at 317-549-4150.  We hope you will be able to stop by.<p>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Advances in technology are perhaps the single
most important ingredient of further progress in providing a cleaner
environment for America and the world.  New clean-up technologies,
more efficient production processes - and simply the transition
from a smokestack-laden industrial economy to a digital economy
- provide the opportunity for today's Americans to live in a dramatically
cleaner world than the one their parents left them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Unhappily, current environmental policies often
lock obsolete technologies in place, or fail to provide appropriate
incentives for the development and adoption of new technologies
that are both cleaner and less costly than those currently in
use.  Even where our current policies work to encourage the adoption
of new technologies, they do so in ways that are often ineffective,
typically through the use of top-down, command-and-control mandates.
<p> 
Current policies also fail, in many cases, to recognize that
while our commitment to a cleaner environment is national in scope,
the problem is often local or regional in nature - and hence not
easily addressed through national, one-size-fits-all standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America's current policies with respect to
air pollution are a case in point.  Since the 1970s, we achieved
significant progress in reducing emissions, but never enough to
meet clean air standards nationwide.  In response, the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments set different rules for the most polluted regions
and called for the development and deployment of new technologies
- including alternative fuel (nonpetroleum-based) vehicles (AFVs).
Yet in implementing a complex patchwork of programs to promote
AFVs, the Executive Branch is utilizing top-down mandates that
attempt to impose a uniform regime on an environmental problem
that varies dramatically by region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The clean air benefits of AFVs vary widely
by region for two reasons.  First, the types of air pollution
AFVs address are limited mainly to 22 cities, the state of California
and a 12-state region in the Northeast.  Second, the best way
of addressing these pollution problems also varies - in some cases,
AFVs may be the better approach; in other cases, different options
will be more effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the same time, the national security benefits
of AFVs (i.e., the reduction in American dependence on imported
petroleum) know no regional boundaries and hence call for a national
approach to encourage AFVs.  Achieving national promotion of AFVs
while maintaining regional flexibility in their use to reduce
air pollution is a complex challenge.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among different alternative fuel technologies
being developed, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural
gas offer the best prospects for AFV expansion.  And while the
infrastructure problem associated with refueling and delivery
of alternative fuels is a challenge, the hurdles for serving important
markets have been reduced significantly in recent years.  In fact,
in some important niche markets, conversion to alternative fuels
is justified on differences in fuel costs alone.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The current government approach to providing
incentives for AFV use is neither efficient nor effective.  For
example, our examination of current policies shows that:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The peculiar atmospheric traits of different
urban areas are not recognized by federal standards designed to
reduce urban smog.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Efforts by the Department of Energy to

in the federal fleet are not coordinated with EPA's efforts to
improve air quality in metropolitan regions.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel tax policies are not well
geared to provide larger incentives for cleaner-burning fuels.
(State fuel tax incentives are more closely tied to emission characteristics.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The mandated purchase of AFVs by operators

<FONT FACE="Arial">America needs a new, more effective and efficient
approach to promoting AFVs.  Among its main features should be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A program of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that recognize the peculiar environmental challenges of
U.S. cities and regions.  These newly created EIAs should be given
complete flexibility in choosing the means for meeting baseline
environmental standards and should serve as coordinating units
for federal efforts to expand AFV use.   </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel taxes that no longer favor
or discriminate against alternative fuels used in the search for
cleaner air.  Instead, tax policy should be designed to provide

taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels
in their areas.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore,</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal funds to cover the full incremental

American reliance on imported petroleum, incentives for AFV use
are a lower-cost way to improve automobile fuel efficiency than

<FONT FACE="Arial"> By removing barriers to expanded AFV use and
deployment of other improved technologies, implementation of these
proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and
national energy security goals.  This plan would expand AFV use
and concentrate environmental benefits in the most appropriate

be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Multiple Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that will provide a national laboratory for discovering
lower cost institutions for improving all dimensions of environmental
quality.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The more logical expansion of AFV infrastructure
due to the creative and expanded use of EIAs and federally provided
funds to assist with the expansion of the AFV fleet.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Minimized costs in producing cleaner air
through the encouragement of tradeoffs between AFVs and other
approaches for reducing air pollution.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Improved technological innovation through
the adoption of new technology.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is no magic bullet or one best approach
for reducing air pollution in the United States.  A successful
policy for the 21st century will rely on a multitude of solutions
that emerge from those closest to the problem.  AFVs are a proven
technology that offer meaningful environmental benefits.  With
appropriate incentives and flexible institutions for accomplishing
environmental goals, AFVs can become an even more important part
of the environmental arsenal.</FONT>

<h2>Bradley, White to Attend Aspen Summit 96</h2>

Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be among the participants at the Aspen Summit this August 5-6, The Progress & Freedom Foundation announced today.  The Summit will explore whether America's future in the digital age will be one of progress or decay.
<p>
White, who is chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Bradley, who recently completed a tour promoting his new book <b>Time Present, Time Past</b>, will be among the more than 30 participants at the Summit.  Also attending will be author Alvin Toffler, PBS commentator David Gergen, ACLU president Nadine Strossen, author George Gilder, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and author David Gelernter.
<p>
"A recurring theme in this election year is the insecurity Americans feel about their future," said Foundation president Jeffrey A. Eisenach.  "The Summit will examine how America can best cope with the transition to a new society  how to make the transition less painful and more productive for all Americans."
<p>
The Summit, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Aspen, Colo., will also feature a debate on whether the growth of the Internet is a "Leading Cultural Indicator of Progress." Participants will include Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, authors of "Smash the Internet" (<i>Weekly Standard</i>, Oct. 30, 1995), G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, former Science Advisor to President Reagan, and Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings.
<p>
Four working groups at the Summit will explore what government policies should be pursued to ensure continued progress toward a better future in the digital age.  Former FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick will highlight a session on regulatory convergence and Shira Perlmutter, Associate Register for International Affairs and Policy at the Copyright Office, will highlight a session on intellectual property.

<h2>Administration Undermines Information Age National Security</h2>

The Clinton Administration's efforts to control the spread of "encryption" tools that scramble digital communications is putting at risk America's lead in the global communications race and threatening the U.S.'s future ability to protect itself, asserts a report issued today by The Progress & Freedom Foundation.<p>

	Encryption tools are key to the development of on-line banking, protecting privacy in an age when more and more information is stored on computers, and ensuring the authenticity of electronic messages. Fearing that terrorists and drug smugglers will encrypt their communications and thus foil American intelligence's electronic "eavesdropping" capabilities, the Administration is supporting continued controls on the export of encryption software.<p>

	Yet the PFF report, co-authored by G.A. Keyworth, chairman of the Foundation and former Science Advisor to President Reagan, found that "no matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption to fill the void left by American abdication of the market."<p>

	The report warned that government attempts to control encryption tools will destroy America's commercial and technological lead in the field.  This will eventually deny America - including the intelligence community itself - the latest encryption tools, because they will no longer be developed in the United States.<p>

In addition, the report continued, the Administration's policies jeopardize America's continued lead in the communications race and thus diminish the rewards of economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities Americans would otherwise have enjoyed.<p>

<h2>THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION, ENCRYPTION AND
TRUE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G. A. Keyworth, II, and David E. Colton, Esq.
<a href="encry-foot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
 Americans take it for granted that when they a send package via first class
mail its contents are protected.  We do not worry that someone will open our
envelopes and take our checking or credit card account numbers, read our
personal letters, or steal our business ideas.
<P>
Yet our privacy could be threatened as we move to a digital economy, where
more and more information is shared electronically  over the Internet, via
fax machines or on wireless phones.  Right now, the Clinton Administration is
proposing to restrict Americans ability to use "encryption" tools that
scramble digital communications so that they cannot be read by anyone other
than the intended receiver.  Today, basic encryption technology is utilized
every time you punch in your ATM code or use a password to protect files on
your computer.   But better encryption tools are needed to protect the assets
of on-line banking customers, the rights of musicians selling their songs in
Cyberspace or the trade secrets of American companies e-mailing documents to
their overseas branches.
<P>
America currently leads the world in the development of computer software 
including encryption.  Indeed, our current position as the undisputed leader
of the digital age derives from our overwhelming success at winning the
computer race. Start-ups that were born in our garages and hobby clubs less
than twenty years ago have created a whole new economy, the $1.5 trillion
digital industry.  As a result, the nexus of technological innovation and
wealth creation for this new economy is in Silicon Valley, not Tokyo, Paris
or Bonn.  
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>The Clinton Administrations attempt to control encryption technology is one
of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory thinking threatens
Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
Yet a new contest is already underway: the race to generate wealth by
connecting computers into a global, digital communications system.  The rules
for this competition are just now being set, and the situation is very
different from the computer race.  The government largely refrained from
regulating the computer industry (no one told Apple or Microsoft or Intel
what markets they could enter or what products they could sell).  In the
communications race, America's regulatory apparatus (i.e., the FCC)  created
in the 1930s, before television networks, cellular phones or e-mail  is a
huge handicap.   Americas competitive lead in the communications race could
be squandered by the retarding forces of excessive regulation, with immense
consequences:  lost technological leadership, fewer jobs and lower standards
of living.
</td></tr></table>

<P>
While the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an important first step toward
removing roadblocks in the creation of a digital communications network, much
work remains if America is to maintain its international lead.  Our most
formidable opponent is not foreign competition, but a misguided, overzealous
Federal government.  The Administrations attempt to control encryption
technology is one of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory
thinking threatens Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Encryption:  Protecting Your Valuables from Theft</b>
<br>
The encryption concepts at issue are not complicated.  In essence, encryption
technology empowers people to protect their digital property from
unauthorized use.  Whether you are sending an e-mail to a friend, your doctor
is faxing your medical records to the insurance company, you are ordering a
take-out dinner over you wireless phone (and using your credit card number to
pay in advance), or giving the plans for your latest product to your business
partner on a floppy disc, encryption tools allow you to "scramble" your
message.  Only the intended recipient  who holds a "key"  can access the
information.
<P>
Encryption technology is based on strings of numbers (the "key").  The more
numbers in the key, the "stronger" the encryption.  For instance, the
standard ATM code of four numbers would be harder to crack if it were ten
numbers.  The possible variations increase dramatically each time a number is
added to a key, and thus more computing power is required to figure out all
the possible combinations.
<P>
There are two types of encryption.  The first is known as single key, in
which the key to code and decode a transmission is the same. 	The second
encryption system, known as the public key approach, uses two sets of keys.
 One key is publicly revealed, the other is known only to the user.  The keys
are linked in such a manner that information encrypted by the public key can
only be deciphered by the corresponding private key.  Public key techniques
are much more secure than single key approaches.  Such programs are
available, world-wide and generally free, through the Internet.  It is these
public key programs that are the real focus of the Administrations attempt
to restrict encryption tools.
<P>
The Administration seeks to retard development of encryption technologies by
allowing export only of mass market software with "weak" encryption standards
using 40-bit keys.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>1</sup></a>   
Similar restrictions apply to hardware and computer
systems.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
   The stated goal is to slow development of encryption technologies
abroad, so that the intelligence community (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.) will have
easier access to communications.
<P><br>
<b>Are Encryption Controls Part
of the American Spirit?</b>
<br>
<table>
<tr width=80>

<td>
The Administration invokes "national security" concerns to justify export
control regulations that cripple development of sophisticated U.S. encryption
technologies.  The government claims that it must have the ability to monitor
communications in the digital age in order to protect Americans from
terrorists, drug smugglers and other nefarious types. To achieve this, the
Administration argues, we must control the terms and conditions by which
individual Americans can use sophisticated encryption technology both <i>at home
</i>and abroad.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>3</sup></a>   
Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community
never seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the
lives of American citizens.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community never
seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the lives of
American citizens.</h3><hr width=75>
</td>
</tr></table> 
<P>
How we handle this issue has profound implications for American society in
the digital age.   The encryption debate raises serious Constitutional
questions.  What is the role of the Fourth Amendment, which reserves to the
people the right "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects"?
 What constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in Cyberspace?  What
rights to privacy can citizens expect in a digital era?  These are major,
fundamental questions that the American people must resolve.  No one yet has
the answers.  Yet the Administrations encryption proposals, if enacted,
would allow what are little more than bureaucratic interests in the national
security community to dictate the answers.
<P>
The outcome of the encryption debate will also shape the foundation for U.S.
economic prosperity in the digital age.  A society of connected computing and
networking requires that all individuals have confidence that their
communications are secure and that messages and data are authentic, not
forgeries.  Encryption is the means to make that possible.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.</h3>
<hr width=75></td>
<td>
But encryption technology is not just about privacy and secure
communications.  It is also about protecting intellectual property.  For
instance, with innovative encryption systems, the makers of <i>Jurassic Park II
</i>(for example) would be able to encrypt a digital signal in the movie that
prevents bootlegged copies of it being made and sold on the black market.
 Before artists, entrepreneurs or Fortune 500 companies will invest their
resources in a new digital product, they will demand assurances that it be
secure from theft.
</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
The best means of protection is self-defense.  American companies should be
allowed to develop and use encryption tools to protect their intellectual
property and trade secrets before turning to government for assistance.  In
that sense, encryption can be thought of as the "barbed wire" of the digital
age, allowing owners of intellectual property to be their own first lines of
defense against theft and encroachment, just as barbed wire allowed farmers
on America's prairie to protect themselves against encroachment by wayward
cattle.  Barbed wire was not an <i>alternative</i> to government enforcement of
property rights, but it allowed government to serve as a <i>backstop</i> rather than
as the first line of defense.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>4</sup></a>  
<p><br>
<b>Encryption Obsolescence
at Hyper Speed</b>
<P>
To maintain their competitive lead in the digitally connected economy,
American companies are continually creating encryption technologies.  Such
rapid innovation makes the national security and  intelligence communities
goals of controlling this technology illusory.  Governments can no longer
dictate the pace and scope of technological innovation.
<P>
The core concept of the computer revolution, Moores Law, states that the
power of a microprocessor doubles approximately every 18 months while its
costs stay the same.  Thus, in 1984, a desktop computer could execute 2
million instructions per second, but by 1994, the same machine was capable of
256 million instructions per second.  By 1998, a desktop microprocessor will
run more than 2 <i>billion </i> instructions per second.  Such incredible
advancement in computer power guarantees that the intelligence community will
fail to control encryption technology.
<P>
Moores Law makes the focus on encryption key length irrelevant.  So-called
strong encryption is only "strong" relative to available computing power to
crack the string of numbers that comprise the key.  As computing power
doubles every 18 months, no encryption scheme will remain strong for long;
adding numbers to the key merely forestalls the inevitable. Encryption will
be rendered quickly weak without constant innovation .
<P>
Yet the Administration proposes to enshrine in law a mandated encryption
standard based on todays computing power  a standard that would soon be
rendered obsolete by advances in microprocessor speed.  This is not a
theoretical prediction; it is hard fact.  Indeed, the governments preferred
40-bit key has already been compromised  in this case by two French graduate
students using their schools computer to hack Netscape.  Cheap and
affordable chips customized to break encryption keys are readily available.
 For example, one "field programmable gate arrays" chip, costing as little as
$20, can crack the 40-bit key in about five hours.  But many such chips can
be used together, in parallel, to break a 40-bit key in about 24 <i>seconds</i>.
 Clearly, government encryption "standards" would soon be overtaken by
technology, leaving Americans handcuffed in their ability to compete with
foreigners.
<P><br>

<b>The True Threat to National Security: Encryption Controls,
Not Encryption Technology</b>
<p>
The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.  Export controls already are threatening to drive Americas software
industry off-shore.  Allowed to continue, this phenonemon eventually will
deny America -- <i>including the intelligence community itself</i> -- the latest in
encryption technology.
<P>
Among the many problems with export controls on encryption technology, first
and foremost is the fact that they are unworkable.  In the past, it was
possible to contain specific technologies (e.g. metallurgical science applied
to design of submarines or "stealth" airplanes) through export controls.
 These technologies focus on specific capabilities and require significant
infrastructure to be of use.  But digital technology can be taken out of the
country almost effortlessly by transmitting it over the Internet.  And, of
course, nothing can prevent foreigners from coming to America, legally
purchasing encryption technology (at stores such as Wal-Mart) and then
(illegally) taking it home with them. Hackers try to demonstrate the
absurdity of export controls by noting that it may be considered illegal to
wear a t-shirt, when leaving the United States, that has printed on it the
code for an encryption key (the t-shirt would be considered a munition).
<P>
It is also absurd to assume that, just because American encryption technology
is not legally for sale on the international market, that foreign
governments, companies and criminals will not be able to encrypt their
communications and intellectual property.   Unlike, say, nuclear weapons,
which require amounts of difficult-to-obtain materials to build, computer
software design has virtually no "barriers to entry."  Joseph Schumpeters
description of the capitalist firm truly applies here:  "Most new firms are
founded with an idea and definite purpose.  The life goes out of them when
that idea or purpose has been fulfilled or has become obsolete or even if,
without having become obsolete, it has ceased to be new."   This is
particularly apt for encryption technologies.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>5</sup></a> 
<P>
<table>
<tr width =80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>Preventing Americas leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td>
No matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a
bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption
to fill the void left by American abdication of the market.  A recent survey
of products employing cryptography both within and outside the United States
confirms the lack of barriers to entry in encryption technology.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>6</sup></a>    Companies
from more than 28 countries sell almost 500 encryption products.  If American
leadership stumbles, others are ready and eager to assume the mantle.
</td></tr></table>
  Today, the intelligence community is worried about controlling the latest
encryption technology developed in the United States.  With export controls
in place, Americans may find in just a few short years that the true national
security problem is trying to obtain the latest encryption software developed
<i>outside</i> the United States.
<P>
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies  perhaps to present Congress
a <i>fait accompli</i>  have urged foreign governments to adopt approaches to
regulating encryption similar to those in America.   But even the adoption by
other governments of proscriptive encryption regulations would not alter our
analysis.  One individual, such as the legendary Phil Zimmerman, can create
an encryption system as widely acclaimed as his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) in
just five months in his cabin in Colorado.  That program is now available
world-wide through the Internet.  Digital technology and the lack of barriers
to entry mean that individuals  from almost anywhere can circumvent
government-imposed limitations  regardless how many governments impose them.
<P>
Export controls also hurt Americas high-tech industry.   Many law abiding
international customers want to protect their communications and intellectual
property for the same reasons as Americans, and, as noted above, they will
develop the technology to do so themselves if they cannot purchase it from
the United States.  The global demand for secure computing continues to grow
with the spread of connected computing.  After all, the international market
for Internet connectivity is 20 times what it is in the United States.  
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>7</sup></a>  In
this burgeoning market, the highest demand over the next decade will be for
goods and services that incorporate the assurance of confidentiality only
encryption can provide.
<P>
Preventing Americas leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race. Already, 60 percent of American workers
are knowledge workers, and eight of ten new jobs are in information intensive
sectors of the economy.  More Americans make computers than cars.  More
Americans make semiconductors than build construction equipment, and people
processing data outnumber those refining petroleum.  Should American firms be
foreclosed from competing to win in this market, the immediate effect may be
a 30 percent loss in market share for computer systems alone.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>8</sup></a>     The impact
on the whole U.S. software industry would be equally devastating and
threatens the commanding 75 percent market share for mass market software
enjoyed by American companies today. <a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>9</sup></a> 
   This is merely a short-term extrapolation.  The long-term effects could be even 
more pernicious: lost technological leadership is rarely recovered.
<P>
Yet probably the greatest threat to Americans national security from the
encryption controls being proposed by the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies would be the loss of freedom on the part of U.S. citizens.  Seeking
to retain some control over public key encryption, the most recent
Administration proposal seeks to have Americans register their personal keys
with a government-approved third party.  This is analogous to the government
asking all Americans to place a copy of their safe deposit box keys with a
government-approved third party.  By coercing so-called "voluntary"
cooperation, the intelligence community asks that every American leave
themselves exposed before the State in the digital age.
<p>
Nothing could be more perverse than to turn the potential of the digital era
to empower individuals into a more invasive means of government surveillance
and control.  We believe that the Administrations positions will not
withstand Constitutional challenge.  The question to ask is why, in light of
all we've learned as America's competitiveness has resurged in this new
digital economy, should we waste our time and energy pursuing something that,
in a Jeffersonian sense, is so patently un-American and which, in the
practical sense of Moore's Law, is simply wrong.  As Americans hesitate, the
window of opportunity for continuing our leadership of the computer
revolution is rapidly closing.  
<P><br>
<b>The Threat To American Intelligence and Law Enforcement Is Overstated</b>
<p>
Together with law enforcement agencies, Americas intelligence community
plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation.  Moreover, in many instances
the resources they can bring to bear to battle crime are without peer.   The
technical capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community, for example, are
the finest in the world.  The community has and will continue to have the
technical and human resources to meet its mission.
<P>
The National Security Agency (NSA) and its sister agencies have the capacity
to break current encryption systems, and there is little reason to believe
they will not have the capability to penetrate future designs.   Public
estimates of  the time the NSA requires to break 40- and 56-bit key codes are
conservative, for the agency has truly massive parallel processing power for
"brute force" attacks on a given code.  More importantly, NSA specialists are
world-class, and can often succeed in cracking an encryption system through
"number crunching."  They often understand the inner workings of a given
program or code and can exploit these vulnerabilities, greatly reducing the
burdens of decryption.  While in the short term encryption controls might
make the NSAs task easier, in the long run, as we have noted above, we as a
nation would suffer greatly.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, the intelligence community can provide
time-urgent penetration of communications networks for collection and
counter-intelligence needs.  Cracking an encrypted digital e-mail may not be
as easy as wire tapping an analog telephone.  Nonetheless, the United States
currently has the technical capability needed for security in the digital
future.  To most effectively utilize these capabilities might require tasking
and prioritizing resources in a new way, something all bureaucracies,
including the intelligence and law enforcement agencies, naturally dislike
because it upsets the status quo.  But, ultimately, the intelligence
community relies on the technical innovation and leadership of the Americas
private sector to keep it at the forefront of developments.   Any decline in
U.S. leadership in the computer race, which controls on encryption technology
will lead to, will have repercussions on the NSAs abilities as well. 
<P>
Domestic law enforcement can also pursue its public safety mission without
draconian invasions into the privacy of citizens through mandatory key escrow
systems.  Clear thinking without emotion is required.  Allegations that
encryption technology will result in future New York City World Trade
Tower-type terrorist incidents or bombings of Federal buildings are
irresponsible.  Encryption technologies, of course, had no connection at all
to either incident. (Indeed, it is worth recalling that the FBIs own
informant tried to warn the Bureau  unsuccessfully  about the impending
attack in New York).  Furthermore, it is just as easy to plot a terrorist
attack through almost completely secure first class mail as it is via e-mail.
<P>

<tr width=150 hspace=5>
<td>
While there have been and certainly will be instances of law enforcement
agencies successfully averting a crime or catching criminals due to the
monitoring of communications, the FBI and other police agencies must adjust
the existing framework for traditional wireline intercepts to the digital
age.   To do so, they must admit one simple truth: organized crime and drug
cartels  or anyone seriously intending to violate the law  will attempt to
buy the best encryption technology available.  Preventing American industry
from developing it simply means the illegal enterprises will buy the
capability from Japan, Bombay or Taiwan.  They may even pay American software
writers to covertly develop code for them.   Regardless of the method,
criminals will obtain encryption technology.

</td></tr></table>
<P>
The solution is thus not to "dumb down" the American economy and industry.
 Rather, law enforcement must become more digitally savvy.  Upon obtaining
court authorization for digital surveillance, law enforcement must have
access to sufficient resources in the intelligence community should
encryption issues arise.  If it is a question of sharing resources and
capabilities among national security agencies (who currently have among the
best encryption writing and cracking capabilities) and law enforcement
agencies, Congress can help this to occur by developing new coordination
mechanisms.  Long standing bureaucratic rivalries between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can (and should) be overcome.  If suitable cooperation
is not forthcoming, law enforcement could be permitted to develop its own
cryptographic capabilities.  That would be a small price to pay to enable
America to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Controlling our Future in
the Digital Age</b>
<p>
We are in the midst of a profound revolution made possible by the
microprocessor.  It is transforming our society more completely and faster
than did the printing press, the telephone or even the television.   By
winning the first round of the computer race, we reaped the rewards of
 economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities.  We can
win the race for connected computing as well.  This is the best means of
providing for national security, broadly defined. 
<P>
What is called for in encryption is no less than an end to government
sponsored encryption standards, except for its own use.  Export controls on
commercial digital technology, especially in the consumer realm, should be
terminated.  Moreover, the Federal government should be explicitly barred
from placing restrictions on the sale and use of encryption programs
domestically, and mandatory key escrows should be prohibited.  These steps
are necessary for two, reinforcing reasons:  The first is that such barriers
to our future wealth generating capacity are simply unaffordable;  the second
is that such interventions will not work anyway.  
<P>
In a more general sense, however, it is we citizens, not the intelligence
community, who should determine the nature of our Constitutional heritage in
the digital age.

<h2>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?</h2>
<P>
<img src="bi.gif"><P>

We're always being asked what our logo represents, so we thought
we'd explain (but, believing in competition as we do, we thought
we'd offer a couple of alternatives -- each one has its own champions
internally).
<P>
<B>It's From the Story of Sisyphus</B>
<ul>
The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was king of Corinth, holds that
he saw the god Zeus carry off the beautiful maiden Aegina.  Sisyphus
then told Aegina's father what he had witnessed. Enraged with
Sisyphus, Zeus condemned him to Tartarus, where he was compelled
for eternity to roll to the top of a steep hill a stone that always
rolled down again.(1) The struggle for both progress and freedom
is this -- never-ending, difficult, sometimes torturous.  Absent
inspired action, progress is replaced by atrophy.
</ul>
<B>It's From the 1939 World's Fair</B>
<ul>
Dominating the landscape at the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940
were a white obelisk and globe -- the Trylon and Perisphere --
that came to symbolize the meaning of the fair. For a nation just
coming out of a depression, the fair presented its overall theme
-- The World of Tomorrow -- as a very bright one,  through ever
inventive technology, brilliance of industrial and architectural
design, comprehensive planning, scientific progress and the democratic
ideology.  The fair presented a compelling and cohesive vision
of the world that the New Dealers told us they would make -- a
world based in an industrial planning model that now needs replacing.(2)
</ul>
<B>It's From an Economist's Graph</B> 
<ul>
The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two ideas are different.  Things never
stand still but always move ahead.  Yet the world being the way
it is, things rarely stay constant as they move, but progress
or decay, as in the graph below.<br>
<img src="arrows.gif">
<br>
The nature of progress being what it is, you must have a vision
and sense of right and wrong to know where you should be heading.
 From your starting point you must set out to build a better world,
or else you accept decay.  Thus, you must always be pushing to
ensure progress.(3)<br>

<td valign="top" width="20%">PFF is working to describe what a Transformation of American Life
driven by the new technologies of the information revolution really
means.  How will it change our fundamental values and beliefs?
 Society's elemental relationships?   The organization and workings
of our economy?  And our political compact with ourselves [or
is it, after all, between us and the state]?
<P>
If we can describe what is to come, we can show what is to be
done.  In addition, policy change is taking place in Washington,
in state legislatures, indeed, in governments around the world,
as policymakers attempt to understand the consequences of the
move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on regulatory
policy.  PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications debate,
focusing on the next generation of deregulation.

<td valign="top" width="20%">The talk in Washington is all about the end of the old party system.
 Not FDR's grand coalition (already dead!), but the two parties
themselves, the party system itself, seems to be unraveling. 
Are rebel voters, renegade factions, and brash new parties just
perturbations on an historical continuum? Or is the Old Order
really tottering?  And if it goes, what rises to take its place?
<P>
From where does all this voter anger arise?  Why do they feel
so alienated from their government?  The current structure of
the Federal government - centralized, bureaucratic decision making
in Washington to solve the nation's problems - came to the fore
in the 1930s and has reigned supreme ever since.  Until today.
 What type of governmental structures are needed for the 21st
century?  Is it time to replace the industrial state?

Surgical Lasers!  Genetic Engineering!  Molecular Transports!
 Surgery in Cyberspace!  Civilization is poised to make major
strides in medicine and health.  These advances have the potential
to dramatically increase both life spans and the quality of life,
while at the same time reducing the cost of health care.
<P>
Yet America's enjoyment of these benefits is threatened because
every day the current system for approving new medical technology
stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths and
suffer senseless pain.   Why is that many of our drug and medical
device companies are able to offer products to patients in Europe
years before they ever receive FDA approval to do in the USA?
 How do we speed the approval process while ensuring safety? 
Who should pay for all this?  Is it time to replace the FDA?

<td valign="top" width="20%">Why should I care about this, you ask?  Because the computer you
are using right now is consuming power that costs you money on
your electricity bill every month - costs that have the potential
to be reduced significantly with sound reform.  Electric energy
is huge; the United States is home to nearly 1/3 of the installed
electric generating capacity in the world.
<P>
Why does the Federal government own some of it?  And why is it
regulated in a way to make a Soviet bureaucrat proud?  Should you - and
could you - choose the source of your power just like you choose
your long-distance company?  The Japanese are building tons of
it, the French have a flourishing industry in it, but in America
the nuclear energy industry is dying.<h4><a href="nrglink.html">Why?</a></h4>

America is undergoing a transformation as profound as the Industrial
Revolution.  Our work, leisure, education, warfare &#133; our
conceptions about society itself are all changing.  Revolution
is an over used word these days, but we are experiencing one.
Revolutions are messy; they often get violent, and unless we have
a sense of where we want to go we may end up in a place we don't
want to be.
<P>
Yet no one in the Imperial City wants to talk about Big Change.
 We are hampered by having lived most of our lives in a stable
political world where Revolution just didn't happened.  But it's
here, so now what?

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
"The views expressed here are solely those of the authors and do not
necessarily represent the views of the Board, Officers or Staff of The
Progress & Freedom Foundation."

<br>

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

          achieve their egalitarian purpose.  However, in the
          process significant economic disincentives and
          inefficiencies are introduced which reduce growth and
          fairness.  Consequently, a flat-rate may be a
          preferable alternative.

Contrary to popular opinion, the data suggest that giving to charities probably would increase with passage of a flat tax with no charitable deduction. The reason: The flat tax increases economic growth, personal income, savings, and net wealth, all of which lead to higher levels of giving.

<p>
Lower taxes followed by sweeping tax reform is a recipe for renewal. This book should arm American taxpayers with the information they need to spread the word about the benefits of a pro-growth tax policy.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">Backgrounder #1091,</a> <i>The Case for Repealing the Estate Tax,</i></b> by William W. Beach (August 21, 1996)<p> 

   "Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception." In this careful analysis of the short and long-term effects of estate taxes in the United States, Beach demonstrates the negative impact of such taxes from both an economic and a philisophically liberal position.  Warning that the apparently minor significance of the tax makes it easy and dangerous to overlook, Beach sees its repeal as a source of a better economy, more jobs, and higher wages.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090.html">Backgrounder #1090,</a> <i>How to Measure the Revenue Impact of Changes in Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (August 9, 1996) <p>
One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in the 1996 election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  Using decades of empirical evidence, Mitchell explains why government officials should take such economic variables into account when determining the budgetary effects of tax reductions.

Economic evidence proves that when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Examining three decades--the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s--Mitchell shows how tax policy can affect the economy and the Treasury, and provides suggestions for changes to tax policies in the 1990s.

Government taxation and spending have reached intrusive levels in our economy and personal lives. The best way to solve the problem, the panelists argue, is to enact a flat tax that reduces the tax burden on workers and businesses, while restricting Congress's ability to take money out of the economy. Additionally, by limiting government spending and enacting laws requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise taxes, Congress would go a long way toward alleviating the fiscal burden the federal government places on citizens.

</HEAD>
<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/7-10-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]</h5>




<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>
<td>

<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>

<li>Accountant for Al D'Amato

<p><br>


<img src="simp.gif" align="left">

<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>
