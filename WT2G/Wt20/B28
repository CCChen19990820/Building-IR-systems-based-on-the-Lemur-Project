EDITOR'S PAGE<BR>

<P>
As our cover design illustrates,
the Republican Party presently has a serious public relations
problem. It is viewed as being too heavily weighted toward balancing
budgets and too light on compassion; in other words, out of balance.
<P>
Regarding the current budget debate,
polls show the largest share of the public--about 44 percent--blames
the Republican-controlled Congress for the paralyzing federal
government shutdown, a third blame President Clinton and about
half as many blame both.
<P>
In many regions once hostile to
Clinton, bumper stickers proclaiming, &quot;Clinton! At Least
He Cares,&quot; have replaced the more familiar, &quot;Impeach
Clinton.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The difficulty the Republican
Party faces,&quot; says Rob Mosbacher, a GOP activist in Texas
and son of the former Secretary of Commerce, &quot;is convincing
the American people that it is equally as enthusiastic about helping
people solve their problems as it is about cutting spending.&quot;
<P>
Author James Pinkerton agrees:
&quot;What the Republicans haven't done,&quot; says Pinkerton,
a former aide to President Bush, &quot;is convince the people
at the bottom half of the economy that there's something there
for them. I think they made a vision mistake by not going after
corporate welfare more energetically.&quot;
<P>
But rather than shore up their
credentials as good fiscal managers, the negotiations and subsequent
shutdown have instead made them look irresponsible and inept.
According to <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, preliminary
estimates suggest that the three-week episode cost at least $1
billion--on top of the estimated $700 million price tag for the
more extensive shutdown that lasted four working days last November.
<P>
The lack of balance in the GOP
message may explain the recent surge of Malcolm &quot;Steve&quot;
Forbes in Iowa and New Hampshire presidential polls. Although
Forbes has seemingly insurmountable political liabilities--being
the son of a wealthy man, having inherited hundreds of millions
of dollars, and possessing no elective experience--voters long
for a positive, upbeat message, which the millionaire publisher
provides along with his controversial flat tax proposal.
<P>
The remainder of the GOP presidential
field, including front-runner Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, would
hardly be called an inspirational bunch. With the exceptions of
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Richard Lugar, they seem to be driven
more by the politics of fear, blame and resentment, than by optimism,
idealism or vision.
<P>
But there are some bright spots
on the Republican horizon. There are some GOP pols who understand
that perception is indeed reality. Freshman Rep. Sam Brownback
of Kansas blunted some voter outrage in his district by giving
back his pay during the first shutdown and setting up an escrow
account for it during the second.
<P>
Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana
has authored a 19-part legislative agenda called the Project for
American Renewal, which includes a $500 tax credit for charitable
gifts. &quot;We need to reorient people back to what effective
compassion really means.&quot;
<P>
And Empower America founder Jack
Kemp recently unveiled recommendations for a single, low tax rate
for all Americans. Kemp and 13 others formed the National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform last year, at the behest of
Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to unify Republicans on the
question of taxes.
<P>
In his comments at the Jan. 17
press conference where the commission's report was released, Kemp
stressed the importance of relieving the tax burden on the poor
and on working men and women. The former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development is widely known--and is sometimes criticized--for
his ability to empathize with Americans at all income levels.
<P>
To turn around the public perception
that Republicans are mean-spirited, party leaders need to secure
more media exposure for spokespersons like Brownback, Coats, Kemp
and others who understand that, to become a majority party, they
must get votes not only from avowed conservatives, but from moderates
and independents as well.
<P>
Our three contributors to this
discussion of the GOP are all members of the party themselves.
Lynn Martin is a former congress member and was Secretary of Labor
during the Bush administration. Martin expresses confidence that
the GOP is aware of its errors and is working to correct them.
<P>
Walley Naylor is executive director
of the Mississippi Christian Coalition. In his piece, Naylor writes
that the party once represented a beacon of hope, but today &quot;that
beacon has burned out.&quot;
<P>
Jerry T. Burley ran unsuccessfully
in 1994 as the Republican nominee for Texas' 18th Congressional
District. Burley posits that the public's perception of party
members as a whole takes a toll on the prospects of those who
run for office championing the GOP banner.
<P>
Interestingly, all three link
the Republican Party's image of being insensitive toward the poor
to its failure to attract a significant portion of black votes.

<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>School Choice</h2>
<P><i>February 23, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 In 1983, President Reagan's Commission on Excellence in Schools
released its report, <I>A Nation At Risk</I>, warning of major
problems plaguing the public school system.  Today, more than
ten years later, low test scores, consistently high drop-out rates,
drug use, and increasing violence characterize many of our public
schools.  American education is still in crisis, and we need a
change.
<P>
 The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority.  People around the country sense this:  In 1994, twenty-five
states had some form of school choice legislation pending or introduced.
 Denis Doyle, writing in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> (June
13, 1995) indicates that teachers, both public and private, are
more likely to send their children to private schools than the
general public (17.1 percent vs. 13.1 percent).  And in urban
areas like Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland, the percentage of public
school teachers who send their children to private schools is
much higher.  The widespread support for school choice is part
of the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
 School vouchers would provide all parents -- regardless of income
level -- with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child.  If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school.  If they are not, parents now have
a choice -- they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school.  This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University.  Higher education performs better
because of it.
<P>
 School choice allows all schools -- including private and religious
schools -- to compete for public dollars.  In addition, a voucher
system will save taxpayers money, and would promote a healthy
scholastic rivalry between public and private schools, as well
as among public schools, challenging them to serve parents and
students better.
<P>
 The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
 School choice is the most important and far-reaching education
reform in America.  It empowers parents to select schools that
reflect the values and the academic goals that they hold for their
children.

       <hr width=50%></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I love my nation but I fear my government." So read a bumper sticker I saw in Topeka, Kansas, during my first campaign for political office. I was running for Congress and I had to wonder: Was this not the same government that had mobilized the nation to win World War II, that had defeated communism, that had built the interstate highway system? What had gone so desperately wrong? A few months later, I understood perfectly the meaning of that message. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't see them reflected in their government. Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral values, family, community, and free markets. Yet their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government has become their master, not their servant.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To address these concerns, I ran a campaign in 1994 based on three words: Reduce, Reform, and Return. Reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Reform the Congress. Return to the basic values that had built the country: work and family and the recognition of a higher moral authority.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many were rightfully skeptical back then that what I said would ever happen, none says so now. We are finally seeing some progress toward reversing a trend thought unstoppable: the growth of government, the irresponsibility of Congress, and the loss of the moral character upon which the nation was founded. The current debate over the budget is about more than simply learning to live within our means. It is a turning point in the history of the federal government. The crucial issue is who should be in charge of major programs like welfare and Medicaid -- the bureaucrats and regulators and members of Congress in Washington, or the American people and their elected state and local representatives.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our Founding Fathers designed the federal government to be limited. But in the name of compassion, the federal government now tries to do all things for all people. We have discovered, by spending trillions of dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that government cannot solve all of our problems. Indeed, exceeding the authority for which the system was designed hurts people.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I certainly discovered this in the district I  represent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	LeCompton, Kansas, has a population of 750. At the city hall one day, I met Jeff Goodrick, who showed me a ramp that has provided access to the handicapped for 20 years. Under the new Americans with Disabilities Act, the town was told to replace this ramp for an estimated cost of $15,000, even though the design of the old ramp had never denied anyone access to the tiny city hall. The new one was to be slightly longer, with a slightly more gradual slope. The people of LeCompton don't have the money to pay for this new ramp without sacrificing other services essential to their community. Their freedom had been diminished, and for what?
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Erie, Kansas, I walked up and down the main street while I was campaigning. I entered a small repair shop and visited with the owner, Rex Bohrer. He had the thick, callused hands of a man who has not lived a life of leisure. I asked him for his vote. Rex stared up at me from behind an air-conditioner he was repairing and said, "You runnin' for the U.S. Congress?" --  to which I answered a timid "yes." He said, "I want to talk to you." He led me to the front of his shop and showed me a government manual containing more than 50 pages of fine print telling him how he must repair refrigerators under new regulations regarding the chemical freon. He asked, "What the heck am I supposed to do with this? I don't understand this manual, and you tell me that if I violate any provision it could cost me $10,000. What am I supposed to do?"
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I didn't know. I certainly do not want to pollute the environment with dangerous chemicals. But here was an honest citizen trying to earn an honest wage who was being directed by an impossibly complex manual and who face fines of up to $10,000 if he violates any of its provisions. Rex's only recourse is to quit the business that he needs for survival. What is he to do?
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Girard, Kansas, I was speaking to the seniors of Girard High School about the Social Security trust fund. A number of these students had already paid some Social Security taxes. I asked how many of them expected to receive anything from Social Security when they reached the age of 65. Out of nearly 100 students, only four raised their hands. Then I asked how many of them believed in extraterrestrials. About 15 hands went up. This mirrors the responses of young people everywhere. Nationwide, fewer Americans under 25 believe that they will receive anything from Social Security when they retire than believe in UFOs. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Troy, a farming community in northeast Kansas, I held a town meeting about the need to balance the budget and cut the government back for the sake of future generations. Blaine Holder held up his hand and said, "Well, I can tell you how to do away with the entire U.S. Department of Agriculture and the farm programs, but we as farmers have to have some sort of promise that the government won't use food as a political weapon. We need a contract with the State Department that if they ever use food as a diplomatic weapon, they will reimburse us for the reduction in price that we receive because of our government's actions. If the government would enter into a contract of this nature with the American farmer, I think many of them would be willing to do without all of the government interference and price supports." Of course, Blaine thought the possibility of such a contract was hopeless. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In nearly every town hall I visit, I hear complaints about our tax system. The complicated and frequently politically driven statutes that now make up our tax code compromise our economic growth and provoke class envy. No one can understand the 10,000 pages of tax laws; even the tax lawyers complain about its complexity. When America's taxpayers call the IRS for information, they get five different answers from five different agents. Whatever happened to a tax code designed only for raising federal revenue? How did we end up with a system that micromanages our lives and our economy?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Everywhere I go, I hear stories that reveal an overreaching regime distorted by the false notion that centralized authority will lead this nation on the right path. In fact, the American people believe they can handle most of their problems better than the federal government can. They are right.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government threatening their rights than they are of any other government? <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We got off track by forgetting our core principles. But the good news is there is a way out. It's called the Constitution. However much we may have strayed from the precepts of that document, Americans continue to revere it and the principles it enshrines. Ratified by our founding generation and amended by succeeding generations, the Constitution stands equally for self-government and limited government. It is the instrument with which we empowered the federal government in the first place. But it is also the instrument with which we limited that government. If we would only return to those principles of limited government, then our nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow stronger than we have seen for a generation.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The bureaucratic model of growth and prosperity for a nation has been shown wanting all over the world, from communism in the former U.S.S.R., to socialism throughout Europe, to the welfare state in America. Those running for office in 1996 will find that one of the keys to success and leadership will be a vision of hope, of a brighter future with a smaller government -- one that is at last turning toward its constitutional principles and away from the idea that a centralized, bureaucratic government will solve all of our problems.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must create an environment in which Americans look first to themselves and to each other for help, not to their congressmen. We must return to a society where people rely on their communities and do not regard their government as a substitute for civil society. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Faith-based institutions can address the needs of the poor more compassionately than federal bureaucrats can. Right now America could profit tremendously from a Fourth Awakening of the moral and spiritual fiber of this country. The government cannot lead that and it certainly should not thwart it. Government should take the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm" to the values, the faith, and the moral and spiritual roots of the people of this deeply spiritual land. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must restore the master-servant relationship between the people and the government. The people, of course, are the master, and government the servant, but even the best servant can't do everything. We must remind ourselves, as Ronald Reagan once said, that a government big enough to do everything for everybody is big enough to take everything from everyone. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Constitution gives the federal government a limited number of important enumerated powers -- for example, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, to establish post offices and post roads, to declare war, to coin money, to lay and collect taxes for all these purposes. Powers not granted and enumerated are retained by the states and the people. Much of the federal government literally has no constitutional basis. And that is where we find ourselves today.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The underlying principles limiting the federal government are embodied in our founding documents -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Civil War Amendments. These documents paint a picture of government, and the role of government in human affairs, that is subtle and profound. As the product of many compromises, the Constitution is not perfect; in fact, one of its compromises took a civil war to resolve. The process of refinement began with the Bill of Rights, which concludes -- in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments -- with a succinct statement of the Constitution's blueprint for a government of enumerated powers and delegated to the government by the people. Finally, the Civil War Amendments ended the immoral institution of slavery, then corrected the imbalance between federal and state power by adding a federal check on the states' power, thus adding greater force to the Declaration of Independence's original promise of liberty and equality for all. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the Declaration of Independence, we find the American vision of freedom and responsibility in its purest form. The Declaration's essence is captured in the few short phrases that begin with the most important phrase of all, "We hold these truths to be self-evident." In that simple line, Thomas Jefferson placed us squarely in the natural-law or higher-law tradition, which holds that there are "self-evident truths" of right or wrong. And what is that higher law? It begins with a premise of moral equality --  "all men are created equal" --  then defines our equality by reference to our "inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There, in a nutshell, is the moral vision -- a world in which moral people are free to pursue their own happiness, constrained only by the equal rights of others to do the same. It is not the responsibility of government to secure our happiness for us. That is our responsibility -- and our right. The role of government, rather, is to secure our rights, as the Declaration goes on to say. That is its basic function. But to be just or legitimate, government's powers must be derived "from the consent of the governed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have evolved this century from a constitutional government to a government that behaves without regard to constitutional principle. That moral vision in which people have the right and responsibility to pursue their own happiness has been lost. The federal government no longer derives its powers from the people -- it just takes them. This is why citizens distrust their government so much today. It is time that we re-limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal government was never intended to perform.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If we can begin to restore a constitutional government, I foresee an America where freedom and responsibility grow for individuals, families, and communities. Freedom and responsibility cannot be separated. Our freedoms never belonged to the federal government, but to the individual. We must make our government return them.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I foresee an America that is the most family-friendly nation on earth. The family, not the government, should be the backbone of society. Government should cease trying to supplant it. When we are careless, legislative initiatives can harm families. By pledging to spare families from additional legislative and regulatory tinkering, we will do more to protect the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness than any federal legislative quick-fix.
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I also foresee an America where far fewer decisions are made by Washington, and more are made by individuals, markets, or localities. Imagine the federal government, operating within its limited role, serving as a model of efficiency and effectiveness. A federal government focused on its constitutional missions -- rather than creating new ones -- could become a model for other governments. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So, how do we return to a constitutional government? To start, we can give the American people a clear choice in the next election. I propose that all Republican candidates running for president, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives start working together to develop a specific plan to return to a limited federal government as intended by our Founding Fathers. We must develop an agenda to recover the rights of individuals from their government. <p><b>A New Contract With America</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Call it a new Contract With America -- one that passes laws, not merely proposes them. Our party's greatest asset is our message, not our messengers. We should stake the future of our party -- and the country -- on a certain set of ideas, a governing moral code, rather than on any particular politician. Our goal should be to implement reforms consistent with those timeless principles embodied in the Constitution. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our pledge to the American people should be clear: "If you elect a Republican president and maintain Republican majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, we will do the following . . . ." Here are some broad outlines for such a contract: <p><b>I. Reduce Government Spending</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will reduce the size of the federal government by a tangible measurement over a period of four years. My preference would be a reduction of federal spending from 22 percent of our GDP to 15 percent or less (which may take longer than four years). Imagine taking these resources from the hands of government and putting them back into the pockets of families and entrepreneurs.<P><b>II. Transform the Tax System</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will remove all social engineering from the U.S. tax code to create a new tax system designed strictly for the purpose of raising revenue efficiently. The power to lay and collect taxes was meant to fund the enumerated powers, not to become a political device in and of itself. Today, we discourage certain behaviors and reward others based purely on the whims of those who control the tax leviathan. <p><b>III. Reorganize the Executive Branch</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will redesign the executive branch to be consistent with its constitutional authority instead of one still operating on 20th-century, centralized government experiments. We will replace the 14 cabinet-level agencies, which impose more than half a trillion dollars worth of regulations upon the U.S. economy each year, with perhaps nine, and restrict their regulatory powers under constitutional principles. The Constitution does not authorize at the federal level, for example, many of the activities within the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Education, and Energy. <p><b>IV. Create a Constitutional Caucus</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will form a constitutional caucus or commission to evaluate all federal programs for an authorizing principle under the Constitution. A constitutional cleansing of the federal government is long overdue. Furthermore, Congress should require that all legislative proposals cite their precise constitutional authority before they can be enacted. In the case of existing illegitimate programs, Congress should identify and debate which ones should be returned to the states or phased out entirely.<p><b>V. Seek Change with Compassion</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As we phase out unconstitutional programs, we will implement change with compassion, so that people currently dependent upon federal programs will have time to prepare for the transition and enjoy the empowerment they receive from their new freedoms. <p><b>VI. Pay Off the National Debt</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will implement a plan not only to balance the budget, but to run surpluses and pay off our $5-trillion national debt over 30 years, so that our children can decide their own future. <p><b>VII. Remove Barriers to Good Citizenship</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will erase from the books all laws, regulations, and other barriers that prevent local voluntary and civic institutions from helping their neighbors. Faith-based and civic institutions that are leading the fight for a civil society should not be stymied and penalized by mountains of federal laws and regulations that merely supplant local acts of kindness with the cold attitude of "government knows best." Why do we have a poverty class at all, when we spend an average of $36,000 in federal, state, and local welfare funds on every family below the poverty level? Because as much as 70 cents of each government anti-poverty dollar doesn't even reach the poor -- it is engulfed by administrative overhead and "professional" personnel. We will form a task force to conduct an exhaustive investigation of rules and laws that are interfering with those faith-based and civic institutions that are working to revive their communities and families. Then we will implement its recommendations. Local church and community groups can do far more to bring their people back to self-sufficiency than a central planner could ever hope to achieve. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are conservatives who believe that, with the proper leadership, the federal government can engineer the comeback of the family and civil society. But we should not yield to such temptations. If we are trying to end social engineering from the left, how can we justify it from the right? Our highest goals should not rely on new legislative initiatives as much as on the proper legislative restraint.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With this platform and this contract with the American people, we will continue to be the party of ideas and of commitment to constitutional principles, to prosperity, to a revived citizenry, and to a government on the side of those who want the culture in America to reflect their basic values. This is more important now than ever before, because government thwarts those values by attempting to replace them. Today, on behalf of the "public good," government crowds out the individual's "pursuit of happiness" --  including private investment and private charity -- by replacing them with government substitutes.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We face today a set of deep-seated problems --overweening government, massive public debt, and crippling dependence on federal programs. But we face as well a historic opportunity to base our solutions upon our very roots as a nation, and upon our principles as a people -- freedom and responsibility. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let us seize the opportunity before us by recovering those principles. If we restore government to its proper role under our Constitution, we will look back in years to come and say that the moment was right, and we were a match for that moment. And our children and grandchildren will thank us. <p><i><b><a href=" http://www.house.gov/brownback/welcome.html"> Sam Brownback</a></b> is a freshman Republican congressman from Kansas.</i>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>The fault-lines of today's divorce policies</FONT>
<P><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER>

<P>Once upon a time a private eye could build a flourishing business with a cheap camera, a good skeleton key and an appetite for the prurient, setting up a married man in a compromising position with a woman not his wife. A quick snap and the photograph was on its way to his lawyer.

<P>Not only would the &quot;unfaithful&quot; husband pay a premium for these fraudulently scandalous photos, artlessly staged, but his &quot;betrayed&quot; wife could appreciate them, too. She wanted a divorce as badly as he did and they had to prove someone's sexual infidelity to get one.

<P>Other scenarios were not so hypocritically benign, with the private eyes sneaking around hedges at the Bide-Away Motel, an out-of-the-way apartment or house, all to get the goods on someone's private pleasures.

<P>&quot;No-fault&quot; divorce became the simple-minded cure for all this. No-fault divorce, an erroneous label stolen from a no-fault automobile insurance policy, suggests that marriage is a little like a traffic accident, with the same high speed that bends the colliding parties out of shape but without the body and fender shop to put everything aright again. The intent of the law was to make divorce easier, more humane and less hypocritical for both parties. Feminists quickly saluted it as a means of asserting their independent rights.

<P>This was OK when both parties wanted the divorce. The law merely reduced employment opportunities for professional snoops. But many times no-fault divorce put the wife at a severe disadvantage, enabling her husband to make a unilateral decision which overnight reduced her standard of living, whether she had a job or not.

<P>State Rep. Jessie F. Dalman, a Republican, introduced a bill Feb. 14 in Michigan - with a bow to St. Valentine -  to repeal no-fault provisions when one spouse still wants to preserve the marriage. This places Michigan on the cutting edge of the movement to think again about the preservation of the terms of endearment. Other states are moving that way, too.

<P>In the Michigan bill, unilateral divorce would be repealed, with certain obvious exceptions - if the party wanting the divorce could prove the other spouse abusive, addicted, adulterous or in prison. At the least, judges would move more slowly in granting a divorce when half of the loving (or not-so-loving) couple wants to remain in the state of bliss.

<P>Every state now has some form of &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce. This approach has been especially unkind to women and children. Maggie Gallagher, in her forthcoming book &quot;The Abolition of Marriage,&quot; demonstrates how no-fault divorce literally allows one spouse to get away with murder, the &quot;murder of a marriage.&quot; Unilateral divorce radically alters the legal and moral basis of marriage: &quot;Today, while it still takes two to marry, it only takes one to divorce.&quot;

<P>Ms. Gallagher makes the larger argument that no-fault divorce dilutes the marriage contract, rendering it considerably less binding than, for example, a contract to sell a car or a cow. When the law supports the one who flees commitment(s), more marriages &quot;irretrievably break down.&quot; Chalk up another victim of the iron law of unintended consequences.

<P>Women in the 1960s and 1970s who should have known better were brainwashed into believing that a man who wanted a divorce should no longer pay alimony, just child support. &quot;Let the wife eat the cake she bakes.&quot;

<P>Brian Willats, communications director of public policy for the Family Forum in Lansing, Mich., a think tank that studies family issues, supports the Michigan bill because he thinks it strengthens the leverage of the &quot;virtuous spouse,&quot; the one who lives up to the marriage vows and doesn't want to break them. It tips the balance of power to the steady spouse, reducing the clout of the wandering spouse seeking greener pastures.

<P>This also restores a missing solemnity, a certain dignity, to the idea of the marriage contract. We've all heard, ad nauseam, the litany of ills that follow the single divorced parent, the poverty that attaches itself to the spirit as well as to the pocketbook, to society and to the family.

<P>When two people no longer want to stay together, they ought to be able to split their blanket. But not so fast: If one spouse objects, he or usually she should get an opportunity and a little more time to seek a reconciliation. If it takes two to say &quot;I do,&quot; shouldn't it also take two to say &quot;I don't&quot;?

<h2>How to Speak up for the GOP Revolution</h2>

by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Higgins">Heather Higgins</a>
<P>
We have heard much in the past year about the internal divisions
of the Republican coalition and how those strains would first
polarize, then fracture, this revolutionary venture.  The moderates,
we were told, would balk at the cruelty of the &quot;Contract
with America&quot; and break from the extremism of the budget.
 The extremists, went the theory, would alienate the moderates
by rejecting the politically possible in pursuit of the politically
pure.  We were blessed with those profound insights before the
election; which continued after the election; they went on through
the Contract (remember how the &quot;hard part&quot; was always
just ahead?), up into the appropriations process and the budget
debate; and now they are part of the primary campaigns.  The point
has been that collapse is just around the corner.
<P>
It isn't.  Not because there aren't differences -- there are.
 But because Republicans know there are, and have therefore quite
consciously worked on operating as a team.  They know that in
any majority coalition, by definition, there will be differences.
 The problem is to first find the  common ground and the common
language that holds the coalition together and advances its agenda.
<P>
This is not only common sense, it has been the reality of our
political life since the founding.  The American Revolution became
possible when those favoring economic liberty joined forces with
those seeking a virtuous society.  Yet that coalition, so much
an analogue to the present day, only coalesced when the two sides
learned a common vocabulary -- words such as &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;providence&quot; that galvanized all concerned.
<P>
If there is a problem with the Republican coalition, however,
it is that much of the managing is by deferral -- the &quot;tough&quot;
issues are on hold until later in 1996, or even 1997.  This is
understandable; control of Congress came more quickly than expected
and is still numerically slim, making the immediate challenges
first  a swift transition and then advancing an identifiable GOP
legislative agenda.  Not much time, if any, was left for the further
careful stitching together of  this quilted coalition.  This is
the weakness that is about to be exploited, as the latest  argument
for internal division in the Republican ranks.
<P>
The claim is this.  The Republican split is not so much between
moderates and extremists.  Rather, on the one side is the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition, identified in a phrase made famous by
key Republican strategist Grover Norquist when characterizing
the commonalties between gun owners, taxpayers, home-schoolers,
small business owners and others (Mr. Norquist contrasts this
with the &quot;Takings&quot; coalition of  Democrats, comprised
of those who want something from government that has been taken from others.)   On the other is
what the Wall Street Journal  portrayed on the last Friday of
the year alternatively as &quot;civil-society Republicans,&quot;
 communitarians&quot;, &quot;big-government conservatives&quot;
those who ostensibly wish to use the power of the state to promote
virtue, for example through tax credits for charitable giving.
<P>
Leave aside the flaws in the argument -- for example, the fact
that there are  substantial differences between the policy preferences
of communitarians as opposed to civil-society conservatives, or
the fact that tax credits are endorsed by many in the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition as an excellent way of removing power
from the state and restoring it to citizens.  The argument that
there is a conflict of visions is still powerful.  It captures
a real concern felt within republican ranks.  The fear is this:
Presume we do leave folks alone, then what happens?  Saying they
want to be left alone sounds pretty anti-social and selfish. 
Will sufficient people contribute to charity and help those who
need help?  Or will they look at the infirm, the aged, the sick
and the needy and choose to leave them alone?
<P>
What is meant by the &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot; coalition is quite
different from how it often has been characterized.  It's not
that Republicans aren't clear what they mean -- talk to strategists
like Mr. Norquist and it becomes apparent that they have a robust
vision of a strong civil society fully committed to addressing
our social problems.  But Republicans need to remember that these
are arguments that have not been articulated in political discourse
for some time.  In speaking about these ideas therefore -- particularly
given the Democrats' tireless depiction of Republicans as selfish,
greedy, and uncaring, they cannot use the shorthand they use among
themselves.  Rather, Republicans need to develop and use the common
ideas and language of the coalition if they are to resonate with
voters.
<P>
To say that Republicans represent a &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot;
coalition is simply and quite legitimately to explain what Republicans
want. To prevent a wedge being driven into the coalition, however,
it is critical that Republicans also start addressing why they
want it, and why others should as well.  Left in a vacuum, the
phrase &quot;leave us alone&quot; to the unaccustomed ear makes
no distinction between liberty and license, or civic-mindedness
and self-indulgence.  It provides no vision of  the kind of society
Republicans propose, and gives no assurance that the results will
improve, rather than worsen, the current situation.
<P>
In truth, however, the traditional American vision of limited
government and a strong civil society is a noble one.  Republicans
need to explain that in their view, Americans are trustworthy,
responsible adults. And adults should be &quot;left alone&quot;
in order to better carry out their obligations as citizens, in
order to exercise the responsibilities of authentic liberty.
<P>
Authentic liberty is not license; it is the freedom to do what
we ought to do, not whatever we want to do. And the freer a society,
the less intrusive the state, the more compelling the obligations
of individual citizens.
<P>
As commentator Dennis Prager points out, in the Torah, Moses doesn't
say to Pharaoh, &quot;Let my people go.&quot;  Rather, he says
&quot;Let my people go that they may worship their God.&quot;
 Or as Edmund Burke said, &quot;But what is liberty without wisdom,
and without virtue?  It is the greatest of all possible evils;
for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.
 Liberty without purpose devolves into license and has little
social claim; liberty with purpose has the moral authority to carry a revolution.  The distinction is critical and needs to be articulated.
<P>
This language will be difficult for some.  As a coalition, for
example, Republicans tend to have a hard time with anything smacking
of &quot;caring&quot; and &quot;compassion&quot;.  It's not that
they object to the real article -- anyone who believes in minimal
government has indeed a deeper obligation to private charity --
but that in political discourse those words became a code for
&quot;government program.&quot;
<P>
Moral vocabulary, too, will be difficult.  The Progressive era
moved Americans away from a language of internal virtue and external
principles, providing instead a lifetime for the deliberately
relative language of &quot;values.&quot; Yet slowly, people are
beginning to realize that in life &quot;value-neutral&quot; is
itself a set of values, and that there are indeed some virtues
critical to any society which aspires to democracy, prosperity, and freedom.
<P>
Liberty is arguably the most powerful idea in American life, made
so by the complexity of the idea and the many visions to which
it speaks.  As David Fisher explains in &quot;Albion's Seed&quot;,
the &quot;most important fact about American liberty is that is
has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even
contrary traditions in creative tensions with one another... It
has become the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society
in the United States.  In fact, this plurality of freedoms may
prove to be the nation's most enduring legacy to the world.&quot;
<P>
Harnessed properly, understood in the context of its obligations
to civil society, liberty is also the resonant image that will
speak compellingly to the Republican coalition and convincingly
to the nation.

<TITLE>A Seven Step Recovery Program -- PFF
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul>
<blockquote>
<a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<br>
<h2>A Seven Step Recovery Program</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Huffington">Arianna Huffington</a>
<P>
The GOP has had a string of bad news recently: For the first time
since 1962, a Democrat was elected to the Senate from Oregon;
in a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 74% disagreed with how the
Republican Congress is handling the economy (versus 50% disagreeing
with Clinton's performance); the GOP has been completely outmaneuvered
by Clinton on the balanced budget and has even retreated on its
promise not to raise the debt ceiling.
<P>
There are two ways for the GOP to deal with all these setbacks.
One: They can spin them. Two: They can heed them as the wake-up
call they are. So far they've chosen the spin cycle. They're comforting
themselves with transparent excuses: The defeat in Oregon was
too narrow to be significant; Oregon was one of only three states
to elect a new Democratic governor in 1994; Oregon voted for Dukakis
in 1988; it's the Senate with wimpy Republicans caving in; it's
the uncompromising House freshmen, recalcitrant and extremist;
it's Clinton, the Great Empathizer; it's Dick Morris, the brilliant
strategist.
<P>
As anyone familiar with 12-step programs can tell you, there is
nothing as inventive as the human mind in denial. And since the
GOP is unquestionably in denial, here is my suggested seven step
recovery program. (In the budget saving spirit of the times, we
have reduced 12 steps to 7.)
<P>
The first step for the GOP is to acknowledge that it has a problem.
<P>
The second step is to stop whining, especially about the media.
As some sage once said, the Constitution guarantees a free press
-- it does not guarantee a fair press. The GOP should forget about
whether the media is misrepresenting their message and go about
improving it.
<P>
The third step is to stop sounding like accountants and to begin
sounding like leaders. The good news for Republicans is that 80
percent of the American public wants a balanced budget. The bad
news for them is that so does Bill Clinton -- in seven years with
CBO numbers. So Republicans need to move the debate beyond balancing
the budget, not because this battle is over, but because, for
the moment, the President has framed the debate in way that makes
it impossible for Republicans to win. Both sides want to balance
the budget, but the President, in his own words, wants to &quot;balance
the budget in a way that reflects our values.&quot;
<P>
The fourth step is for the GOP to stop repeating, ad nauseum,
that it is not cutting anything -- but merely reducing the rate
of growth. This may be factually correct, but didn't Republicans
campaign on the theme of cutting things -- cutting government,
cutting entitlements, cutting taxes? Did they come to power to
reduce the rate of growth of government or did they came to power
to reduce government?
<P>
So instead of being so defensive about what they are doing, I
suggest that they take step five and be courageous enough to tell
the American people just what they want to do: reverse 60 years
of New Deal and Great Society thinking, according to which all
solutions to social and economic problems revolve around government.
Yes, this is bold, but a time of crisis requires boldness, decisiveness,
and honesty. This rethinking of the role of government has to
go hand in hand with a fundamental redefinition of the role of
the citizen -- challenging the American people to meet less from
Washington with more from themselves and their communities.
<P>
The sixth step, without which the revolution will remain stalled,
is to talk about community solutions -- about what is working
around America. They must talk about it not once in a while but
as frequently and as seriously as they have been talking about
balancing the budget. The GOP must go beyond just talking about
dismantling government, and start talking about what they are
going to replace it with. This is a critical step. When Newt Gingrich
first became Speaker, he was going to hold Congressional &quot;success
hearings.&quot; He was going to bring to the Capitol the community
leaders who are making things work and are turning lives around
-- introducing them to the American public as the people who embody
the alternative vision of rebuilding America.
<P>
The final step is to bring a sense of urgency to the debate --
to shift it from balancing the books in seven years to taking
steps right now to reform conditions in education, in welfare,
in the ways we deal with those most in need among us. Let Dick
Gephardt and David Bonior defend a broken system of government
programs that has left millions of children hungry, abused or
neglected, and let the Republicans speak of weaving a real safety
net from the involvement and resources -- in time and money --
of millions of Americans.
<P>
Instead of spinning all these setbacks or blaming the media, it
is time the GOP took these seven simple steps to produce a message
that has both economic and moral truth on its side. If Republicans
truly want to recover from what ails them, they must seize the

"Union leaders this week said  the election push was a way the new leadership could quickly 
demonstrate results for both the public and the AFL-CIO's member unions."
<P>
-- <i>The Washington Post</i>, January 25, 1996<sup> 1</sup>
<p>
"The Oregon race provides a vital first chapter in a new textbook on politics we're going to write 
this year, as we  build the core of a powerful new grassroots movement."
<P>
  -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, January 31, 1996<sup>2 </sup>
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After decades of declining political influence, labor 
unions have pledged to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest. The 
first real test of organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United States 
Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily backed by big labor. Similar 
efforts can be expected in numerous House and Senate races this fall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When AFL-CIO President John Sweeney swept into 
leadership of the nation's largest labor federation last fall, he did so on an agenda of action, 
pledging more active organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and promising 
vocal political campaigns to promote the union's movement's liberal agenda. Every indication was 
that the AFL-CIO would be a major force in 1996.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Shortly after Sweeney's election, voters went to the polls 
in a few political contests around the country. These November 1995 contests did yet not have the 
full Sweeney imprint (he had been in office only for a few weeks), but organized labor nonetheless 
managed to demonstrate a significant presence in several states. In fact, after the elections, Sweeney 
attempted to take credit for the supposed public turn to the left he claimed had occurred.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO had its first test for 1996. 
In the special election to fill the seat of former Oregon Republican Senator Bob Packwood, big 
labor lined its horses up behind Democratic Congressman Ron Wyden. With substantial backing 
from organized labor, Wyden managed to beat Republican Gordon Smith narrowly in a mail-in 
election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As this pivotal election year proceeds, the AFL-CIO and 
other labor organizations will continue to invest heavily in campaign activity. Unfortunately, much 
of this politicking will be funded through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and 
unregulated by federal election laws. Direct PAC donations and independent expenditure 
campaigns on behalf of specific candidates represent only a portion of organized labor's political 
activities. It behooves Members of Congress to pay careful attention to these activities. Hard-
working union members should not be compelled to surrender their own pay, earned by their own 
sweat and toil, to finance political activity to which they may well object.
<p>
<b>THE PRELUDE:  KENTUCKY AND MISSISSIPPI '95</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's claim to victory in 1995 lies in the 
Kentucky governor's race between Paul Patton (D) and Larry Forgy (R). The national federation's 
propaganda organ, the <i>AFL-CIO News</i>, bragged that "even Forgy, in a call to the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, conceded that labor had made the difference, not only in heavily unionized 
counties but in helping turn out the African-American vote through the A. Phillip Randolph 
Institute."<sup>3 </sup>  (The A. Phillip Randolph Institute is an arm of the AFL-CIO dedicated to 
reaching out to African-American unionists.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to the <i>News</i>, 83,000 phone calls and 
158,000 pieces of mail led labor's efforts. The same report went on to disclose that 7 federation 
employees joined 9 activists from other labor unions to put a significant political operation in place 
on the ground in Kentucky, and that "two members of the Electrical Workers and CWA 
[Communication Workers of America] also were working with the [A. Phillip Randolph Institute]."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the end, Patton defeated Forgy by a slim 51-49 margin.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The story in Mississippi was similar, except for the 
outcome. Incumbent Republican Governor Kirk Fordice was pitted against Democrat Dick Molpus. 
The AFL-CIO and other labor groups committed 3 full-time staff and 10 part-time workers to the 
race. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> reports that the unions dropped 44,000 pieces of mail and placed 
20,000 phone calls in an effort to promote Molpus. While organized labor's contribution may have 
helped narrow what appeared to be a blowout, the end result was that Fordice won with 55 percent 
of the vote.
<p>
<b>THE OPENING SALVO:  OREGON '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first meaningful test of organized labor's muscle in 
the new year has occurred over the past few weeks in Oregon, where voters were inundated with 
aggressive tactics by big labor to help influence the outcome of the special election. According to 
AFL-CIO documents and press reports, 37 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) worked 
full-time to elect a Democratic Senator<sup>4 </sup>  --"an unusually large number of political 
operatives" from unions, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>.<sup> 5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, 
bragged that "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to 
an estimated 40,000."  The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the 
candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."   
Shortly after the election was complete, AFL-CIO President Sweeney announced that the union had 
made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent over 350,000 pieces of mail.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining 
forces with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable presence in this one 
targeted race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, American 
Federation of Government Employees, National Association of Letter Carriers, and International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The considerable firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in 
more than $183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic candidate. Not one 
penny of union money went to Republican Gordon Smith.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, impact is not measured in direct PAC spending 
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots organizing are all significant 
activities that labor used in Oregon and can be expected to use throughout this year to promote 
favored political candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In Oregon, 
these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than direct, reported expenditures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics played a significant role in the Oregon 
election. In fact, organized labor's activities themselves came under scrutiny by the media and the 
voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for an ad blaming the death of a teenage worker on 
the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, 
was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politics are nothing new. There is no question that 
organized labor has a right to participate in the electoral process. Unfortunately, in many states like 
Oregon, unions rely on coerced funding -- in the form of mandatory union dues -- to finance many 
of their political activities. Therefore, every hard-working union member in Oregon supported the 
candidacy of Ron Wyden with his sweat and toil -- even if he cast his vote against Wyden.
<p>
<b>THE ROAD AHEAD:  ELECTION '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney decided that his new 
leadership team must make its mark quickly. They have decided that their goal of organizing more 
than a million workers is too ambitious to be completed in the near term, and that they therefore 
should devote much of their resources to political action for a quick score.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Plan. In keeping with that decision, the labor 
federation recently announced its intent to spend $35 million on election activities this year --as 
much as 7 times the normal budget and nearly two-thirds of the cost of a presidential general 
election campaign. This allocation will support:
<p><ul>
<li>Targeting 75 House districts, with 1-4 full-time staff in each;
<p>
<li>Creating a base of at least 100 activists (volunteers and paid) in every congressional district;
<p>
<li>Hiring state field directors in 36-40 states;
<p>
<li>Placing 2,500 workers in the field for the final October/November get-out-the-vote efforts;
<p>
<li>Reassigning 12-15 organizers and adding them to the 16-member political field staff, for a total 
of 31 traveling political operatives; and
<p>
<li>Financing a "massive media fund" to deliver the union's political messages.<sup> 6</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rosenthal, even before the election results were known, 
indicated what labor's post-election response would be. He told the <i>Washington Post</i> that 
"The election in Oregon stands by itself" but that "At the same time, it's a national election, and we 
hope it will be similar to Harris Wofford's victory in 1991, and could well set the tone for 
1996."<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Warming up for November. The 1996 campaign is 
already underway in places other than Oregon. Some 400 unionists, under the banner of the AFL-
CIO's Stand Up campaign, protested outside a recent gathering of freshman Republicans in 
Baltimore, Maryland. While the protesters condemned all of the freshmen, a special target was 
Representative Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), who represents a nearby congressional district. Their signs 
carried messages urging voters to make Ehrlich a one-term Congressman. Similar treatment can be 
expected by 74 other House members who have been placed on the AFL-CIO's national hit list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's renewed focus on politics is clearly 
demonstrated by the fact that the organization's "Union Summer" campaign, which will use 1,000 
or more college students and entry-level workers to help organize unions in non-union workplaces, 
will be diverted to politics in the fall. Originally, it appeared that this organizing campaign would 
be the crown jewel for the new leadership, but they have been forced to shift their attention to a 
playing field on which they believe they can win:  the 1996 elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO Leadership "Impressed" with Union-Led 
Turmoil in France. Unfortunately, it appears that Sweeney and his new team at the AFL-CIO 
envision a much more aggressive and confrontational plan than previous union leaders have 
pursued. In a speech late last year before the Association for a Better New York, Sweeney provided 
the following insight into his thinking:
<p><blockquote>
	I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but 
be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced 
with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few 
parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even 
though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!<sup> 8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Sweeney expressed his hope that such a situation 
would not be necessary in the United States, even suggesting the idea is shameful. The chaos and 
violence of the national shutdown caused by French unions would not likely be admired by many 
Americans but appears to be a possible harbinger of the AFL-CIO's intentions.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Compelling Union Workers to Pay for Politics. The new 
AFL-CIO leadership has implicitly acknowledged their reliance on forced union membership and 
compulsory dues to promote their agenda. One of the resolutions proposed by the Sweeney slate at 
last year's convention lamented:
<p><blockquote>
	The November 1994 elections capped a decades-long decline in labor's political 
influence, a trend closely connected to the decline in union density. This erosion 
also reflects labor's regional weaknesses, the seeds of which were planted decades 
ago by our failure to make adequate in-roads in right-to-work states.<sup>9 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By admitting a link between political weakness and 
voluntary fundraising, Sweeney's leadership is conceding that organized labor's strength lies where 
workers are compelled to pay union dues as a condition of employment.
<p>
<b>COERCED AND HIDDEN FUNDING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Many of the AFL-CIO's political activities, like those of 
the federation's member unions, are financed not through voluntary PAC contributions by 
members, but by forced dues. Those activities that are issue-oriented (like television ads against 
Medicare reform, for example) often are paid for with these coerced dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As Members of Congress consider campaign finance 
reform legislation, they should ask whether it is fair to force every union member to pay for the 
ideological warfare of union officials. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate 
support, and neither should their labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Campaign finance reform should not be entered into 
lightly. Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions 
are used for politics. As the election season heats up, Members of Congress should note the 
activities of labor unions and remember where the money comes from.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO has indicated clearly that aggressive 
political activities by labor unions --paid for on the backs of the union rank and file -- will continue 
throughout this high-stakes election year. Organized labor's renewed political activism promises to 
be a major factor in the 1996 elections. While unions should be as free as other organizations to 
pursue their political goals, the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory advantages 
unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>How many Madison millions?</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%> 
</CENTER>

<P>Just how much money has the failure of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association cost taxpayers? Depending on the source, the timing of the estimate, and the method of calculation, the taxpayer-absorbed losses have been variously estimated at $47 million, $50 million, $60 million, $65 million and $68 million. At one time or another, each of these figures was accurate, but currently even the $68 million estimate substantially understates the cost to taxpayers.

<P>According to a spokesman at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which is the government agency now responsible for keeping score, Madison's bankruptcy has so far cost $73 million. And that is only through 1994. The burden literally grows daily, and no estimate of its ultimate cost can be made at this time.

<P>Why these losses continue to escalate and how Hillary Clinton and the president contributed to them are worth reviewing. After all, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton relentlessly campaigned in 1991 and 1992 by denouncing the 1980s as &quot;a gilded age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess.&quot;

<P>For all practical purposes, and contrary to the assertions of Richard Ben-Veniste, the minority counsel for the Senate Whitewater committee, all of the bad loans contributing to Madison's financial debacle had been granted before July 1986. At that time, the federal government removed Madison's owner, James McDougal, and placed Madison under direct federal supervision, ending the hemorrhaging. When Madison was formally closed down in 1989, the feds estimated its losses at that time to be $47 million, which essentially represented the difference between the cost of paying off depositors and the then-estimated value of Madison's assets.

<P>Over time, however, the ultimate value of Madison's assets continued to decline, according to the FDIC. As in the case of most failed S&amp;Ls, some loans that were believed to be partially recoverable when the thrift was closed eventually proved to be worthless, adding to the initial loss estimate of $47 million. And taxpayers, of course, had to continue to pay property taxes for Madison's failed real-estate ventures until they were sold for losses. While in receivership, interest payments applicable to Madison's borrowings from the federal financing bank continue to accrue, marginally adding to the taxpayers' burden. And litigation expenses are a factor as well. So as not to divulge to potential targets the scope of the government's legal efforts, the FDIC won't provide a breakdown of the sources of increases in the taxpayers' liability until litigation is concluded.

<P>In an absolute sense, compared to some failed S&amp;Ls whose costs exceeded $1 billion, Madison's $73 million taxpayer hit is small. According to FDIC records, however, the percentage of Madison's losses relative to its deposit base is very high even by S&amp;L bankruptcy standards, exceeding 60 percent. That means for every $100,000 of taxpayer-insured brokered deposits - so-called &quot;hot money&quot; - that Madison was able to attract by offering significantly higher interest rates than its competitors, more than $60,000 went down a rathole. This is a truly astonishing accomplishment - Madison's loan losses proved to be more than 20 times the federally required capital base of 3 percent of deposits.

<P>Of even greater interest is the fact that Madison's loan activity increased dramatically after Mrs. Clinton was hired in April 1985 to represent the thrift before the state regulatory body responsible for approving Madison's plan to meet federally mandated recapitalization requirements. Approval was given in May 1985 after Mrs. Clinton telephoned the chief state regulator, who, as a former law student and campaign volunteer of Gov. Clinton, had been appointed by him four months earlier. In 1985's third and fourth quarters, Madison's mortgage loans increased by $32 million. This six-month, $32 million mortgage-portfolio increase was nearly four times the size of Madison's entire mortgage portfolio as of Dec. 31, 1983, when the feds issued numerous cease-and-desist orders.

<P>As sordid as all of this is, just be thankful that 1996's campaign will not be a replay of 1992's, when the thoroughly corrupt, congenitally hypocritical Arkansas crew lectured Americans about the moral hazards of &quot;the corrupt, do-nothing values of the 1980s.&quot;

<P>
Welcome to the fourth life of the American city:  our new urban
world;  America after the Big Change.  <I><B>Byte City!</B></I>
<P>
Not science fiction.  Not prediction.  Not the future -- Just
a way of talking about how we get there.  Because getting there
means that something <B>Big </B>happens.  People will exclaim:
 <I>It's a revolution!</I>
<P>
Well, if it's a revolution, then Big Change means upheaval.  Revolution
cannot be rouged and face-lifted into pretty Progress.  Revolution
is not mere improvement.  Revolutions are upendings.  Old ways
actually lie down and die right at our feet, like statues of Louis
or Lenin.
<P>
Everyone says we are living in such a time.  Look at their big
titles for Big Change:  Toffler talks <I>Third Wave</I>, or Drucker's
orotund <I>Transformation of American Life</I>.  But then, nothing
dreadful happens.  Nothing even fantastic happens.  Tomorrow is
wonderful, different, difficult, but a lot like today.  Only more
so, like a straight line on a chart.  And problems?  <I>Weeell</I>,
they can be <I>managed</I>.
<P>
But revolution will force on us the integrity of destruction.
 We can pretend that everything will stay the same even as everything
changes, but revolution will not listen.  Fortunately.
<P>
If this is revolution beginning to hit, then let's talk about
the real thing. That is the reason for <I>Byte City</I>.  Byte
City meets the acid strip dip of Big Change.  It's big enough
to change our lives like the last Big Change.  Remember:  The
<I>Industrial</I> Revolution?  It blew the old world apart, it
made a new one, and it gave us new life.
<P>
And we still think of it as Modern.  Well, get over it.  It's
now the oldest old order around.  Not just <I>Rust Belt</I>, but
<I>Big City</I>, <I>Edge City</I>, the Paramus Mall too.  Dead,
Dead, Dead.  Byte City is a way to kill the old world in our minds
before it's torn up right in front of us.  Byte City is a way
to get to change as big as coal, steam, pig iron, and iron rails
wrought right where we live.
<P>
That wall-plastering, flat-panel <I>virtu-screen</I> is a portal
into a new urban world.  Our gut tells us that this tool literally
pries open a door into a new way of life.  Thinking it through
is like asking a Scot in 1775:  <I>Tell us about the railroad.</I>
<P>
Would he have said:  <I>Sure:  iron horse, new net of cities belching
smoke, it's all coming, I can see it.  O yeah</I>.
<P>
Or would he scratch his head, squint, and say: <I> Sure would
make stagecoaches faster, if they could go on rails.  Heavier
loads too, easier for drays to haul.  But the teams would need
good gravel beds, or they might bust their hooves.</I>
<P>
Byte City's one cut at the time traveler's question to us.  We
might not do any better than our Scottish cousin, but at least
we have his revolution as guide.  The upheaval that would revvv
up <I>his</I> lifetime helps us see the roar that is already growling
in our <I>own</I>.  <I>Byte City</I> is a metaphor of revolution
<I>now</I> we can stack up against revolutions <I>then</I>:
<P>
Like the one that hit Britain after 1815, and the United States
after 1876.  And they help us look ahead because they happened
to people like us.
<P>
<U><I>They are us</I></U>:  near in time, same in space.
<P>
Kinship helps, because we can watch how they got through it, and
we can pace ourselves.  Big Change is history's gauntlet.  We
have to get through it too.
<P>
So their stories may be our own.  But still ours to tell.  Technology
hits, but <U><I>we</I></U> do the transformation;  <U><I>we</I></U>
make the moves;  <U><I>we</I></U> do the change.
<P>
And it all seems to start after big wars of ideas, big heroic
journeys;  finished, only to find a new one has begun, for
<ul>
<B>Britain</B> after the <I>Napoleonic Wars</I>.
<P>
<B>The United States</B> at the end of <I>Reconstruction</I>.
<P>

</center>
<P>
Start with <I><B>The Driver</B></I>.  <I>Iron horse, locomotive,
train</I>:  The railroad drove change.  And it was more than change's
tool.  It worked into our brain as song and story and myth.  It
became the industrial world's kinetic cathedral.
<P>
Because it had the raw power of faith.  <B>It was the god of destruction</B>.
 Steam was a juggernaut where worshippers of <I>The Modern</I>
threw down their old world, to be crushed under its wheels.  <B>It
was the icon of power</B>. The railroads reeked the highest octanes
of power, Apollo Program stuff, done by billionaire barons and
tycoons.  <B>It was the layer down of judgment</B>.  Its terrible
mix of underworld and the machine--belching cinders, its engine
roaring through the night--told all that <I>The Modern</I> had
no room for the sentimentality of old ways of life [Didn't DOS
do the same?  We, the new, sneered at the pathetic losers who
needed an interface to play].
<P>
But what did the rails make possible?  They made the new city;
 they raised it up as the main place, the place we lived.  People
and industry were joined, and trapped, in bleak sites of mutual
need.  And the rails brought us there.
<P>
And it was, truly, transformation.  The railroad's impact immediately
and visibly moved peoples' lives.  A plaintive cry from the <I>The
Nation</I>, in 1873:
<center><P>
<I>The locomotive is coming in contact with the very framework
of our institutions ...</I>
</center><P>
Contact.  Like the great host of a plague bacillus, or a horde
of lepers.  The end of small town America, Erie Canal America
... <I>&quot;low bridge, coming to a town ... &quot;</I>
<P>
And how it swarmed!  It was fast.  We're so proud of our burn
cycle for CPUs.  But the speed burn of change in last-century
US and Britain should wipe that smirk clean off.  The entire rail
net of Britain was built in just fifteen years, from 1841 to 1855.
 After the Civil War, from 1865 to 1873, thirty thousand miles
were laid here.  Life transformed in the span of one young adulthood.
<P>
Charles Francis Adams, old elite, 1868, clothed his shock in romantic
metaphor, back after five years in the Court of St. James:
<center>
<P>
<I>Had we been Tyrian traders of the year 100 BC landing from
a galley fresh from Gibraltar, we could hardly have been stranger
or the shore of a world, so changed from what it had been ten
years before.</I>

</center>
<P>
And what was the city?  It was:  <I><B>Where We Live</B></I>.
 Think sentimental, think Adams' Beacon Hill;  then think what
took its place.  You have just defined <I>revolution</I>.  Because
revolution made a new city, and the new city was the place where
peoples' lives were upended as they entered.  The city stripped
off old identity.  People naked of meaning jostled and elbowed
their way, packed together in brick and cobbled isometric planes,
until they found something new.  Migrations to the new cities
threw whole worlds together, cramming entire tribes into tenements
by the 7th Avenue El.  Forget the old romance of the bazaar, the
ancient trade city's waterfront teeming with Lascars, Phoenicians,
Tartars, and Greeks.
<P>
That was original city, <I>entrepot</I> city.  Trade made, on
river and sea-nexus, like London or New York.  From its hub spoked
the hinterland network of villages and towns.  How different was
the new net of industrial urbs!  Take a classic of its kind, Springfield,
Ohio. At its height, home for 80,000.  Springfield was a local
industrial hub anchored by three big national plants:  Crowell-Collier,
International Harvester, and Robbins and Myers.  And what remained
of the old agricultural world of Clark County brought its bounty
there in homage to the new city, to the farmer's market in the
neo-Romanesque city hall, stone tower shining city pride just
like 15th century Siena or Bologna.  Oak-shaded Wittenburg was
its civilization-badge, with a football team Ronald Reagan could
have played on, while oysters on ice came every morning by those
rails, fresh from Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
America's whole world was wired by railroad;  cities wired within
by streetcars, and wired without into a national network of cities,
with the former <I>entrepot</I> cities now grown to giant <I>metropoli</I>:
 Chicago, New York, LA.  If we think of the city as a node in
the network of our lives, it is the merest step of imagination
to see what <I>Byte City</I> will be for us.
<P>
The big screen of <I>Byte City</I>, ten or twenty years from now,
is today's railroad, today's god of destruction and creation.
 The railroad was <I>force majeure</I> in English:  it moved people
to the city, moved in goods they wanted, and moved out goods they
made.  The virtu-screen doesn't move anything ... but it brings
everything to us.  The city is in our living room, or wherever
we want it to be.  The portal becomes a vehicle, and like the
railroad before, <I>&quot;it is coming into contact with the very
framework&quot;</I> of our lives.

<P>
So then the next piece of Big Change:  <I><B>Loss of Order and
Connectedness</B></I>.  The new net clung to the heels of the
rails:  Life cobbling to the factories clustering around each
new depot.  People poured into them, searching first for jobs,
and then for a sense of belonging.  Migrants from farm to slum
could not bring with them their own old net of traditions, the
rooted weave of relationships that was small town America.
<P>
Small town America was our mythic heart.  As Robert Weibe tells
it,
<ul>
&quot;small-town life was America's norm in the mid-seventies
<I>[1870s].</I>  Groups of these towns fell into satellite patterns
about a larger center <I>[the entrepot]</I>, to which they looked
for markets and supplies, credits and news.  But however much
they actually relied upon an outside world, they still managed
to retain the sense of living largely to themselves.  With farms
generally fanning around them, these communities moved to the
rhythms of agriculture: the pace of the sun's day, the working
and watching of the crop months, the cycle of the seasons.&quot;
</ul>
Alien.  Weird.  Wild.  New cities broke rhythm itself by busting
the rule of order.  Nature's rules now knelt to human imagination.
 Cities of wonder -- and inescapable wonderment only added to
their sense of <I>anomie</I>.  It was easier for migrants to take
the filth, disease, and toxicity of the new net than the squeeze
of a reality overwhelming and fantastical.  New building systems
of iron made easy Neo-Classical fantasies that Palladio could
but have dreamed of:  symbolized in Britain by the Crystal Palace
of Victoria's heyday;  then, in America, by the Skyscraper, the
<I>El</I>, and endless canyons of steel.  The landscape itself
disoriented in its strangeness,.  It was both harsh and dreamlike,
as in T. S. Eliot's image from <I>The Wasteland</I>:  &quot;<I>unreal
city, under the brown fog of a winter dawn ...&quot;</I>
<P>
We have all read stories of the city's capacity for <I>anomie</I>:
 like my grandfather coming to New York as a boy, hawking fruit
and flopping in a tenement room with twenty others on the lower
East Side; then the rails to Springfield for a job, and ending
up in the wrong Springfield:  Ohio, not Massachusetts.  There
are so many unspoken stories about those times embedded in our
minds, in the place where myth resides.
<P>
But people could make the warp from farm to factory, cabin to
tenement.  Living conditions and physical alienation were not
the problem:  loss of identity was.  Loss of connection hurt when
people were torn, not from the soil, but from their own defining
labor, the worth that came from work.  For example, the industrial
revolution savaged the place of the craftsman in society.  Pittsburgh,
known before 1860 as the &quot;Craftsman's Empire,&quot; became
in just twenty years a kingdom of steel, where labor replaced
craft.  And the furnaces offered no status equal to what was lost.
<P>
What had been lost was identity itself.  The new world of the
assembly line seemed to reduce men and women to mere auxiliaries
of the machine.

<P>
Call this a problem of <I><B>More Money, Less Meaning</B></I>.
 Our soft, clean mind mode cringes before their cities of disease
and death.  Death rates in Britain stayed the same from 1820 to
1870, even though life expectancy was soaring in the countryside.
 Why?  Because city air and water was killing so many.  A Southern
slave in 1850 lived twenty years longer than the average Northern
industrial worker.  But that Northerner just shrugged.  Farm life
scraped hard too.
<P>
They liked the money.  Wages were higher in the new cities.  For
young men freed from the farm, <U>a lot more money</U>.  For example,
real wages in U.S. industry grew more than 40 percent between
1865 and 1873.  People could put up with the crazed atmosphere
of the this world:  the weltering, roiling, pinball pulse of the
new city.  They could put up with the disorientation, and they
could put up with the physical abuse.  Because they had more money,
they believed their quality of life was improving.
<P>
Ah, but then come &quot;depressions.&quot;  <I>The Panic of 1873!</I>
 Progress was replaced by uncertainty.  And uncertainty exploded:
<P>
<center>
<I>Will I be paid a good wage, will I be able to raise a family
in a decent place, will I be treated with dignity for what I do?</I>
</center>
<P>
A wave of depressions followed fast on industry's tide.  They
banged home the brittleness of industrial identity.  Lay-off,
throw out -- <I>You'll work for this, right?</I> -- because new
labor had no given status.  Society had no rules, no custom and
taboos, to regulate the new.  Sure, craftsmen and farmers had
stature and place in the old order of things, but this was waning
work.  No one knew what status to give the new work.
<P>
Money is only a parts-maker for status.  Money is always there,
pieces in the machine of meaning:  a badge of rank, a tool of
display;  but cash only helps make the whole work.  Identity is
a mysterious endowment of society.  Money is no substitute.  Money
can prop up identity in doubt, but only for a time.  People need
to know where they stand with each other.
<P>
So money propped up status in the new work -- for a while.  But
when the market cracked, so to did the identity of the new worker.
 Kicked out of work, wages cut;  arbitrary, brutal signs that
told the new workers:  <I>you are no longer what you were</I>.
 <I>Maybe you are no better than a slave</I>.  And old social
compacts were torn up across all old divides.  What happened to
farmers and craftsmen also happened to yesterday's middle management:
nostalgia's fat, jolly traders who thronged the <I>entrepot</I>
cities and fed the small towns.
<P>
Big change ripping up old meaning lived on in folk songs and literature
alike.  Then our memory of the trauma condensed down to a few
quaint characters  What happened to John Henry?  What happened
to Old Fezziwig?
<P>
What happened to them is the story of a <B>spike</B>.  The total
the Big Change --  the transformation -- took decades, but the
stories come out of a time when a single generation took the main
hit.  Before that, change was being accommodated.  Sure, you could
see the stretch marks, but it was still the same old place.  Things
kept changing and changing and changing ... and then ... then
it was suddenly a whole new place.
<P>
<I>Where am I?</I>  This is the spike.  It hits one generation;
they are the <I>before and after</I> people.  Theirs is the moment
of crisis, they are the ones who make the psychic passage from
one world to another.
<P>
The crisis is not physical.  It is not about problems like pollution
or plagues or panics.  The crisis is about a mind jump.  And there
is one group that just can't make it:
<P>
The Old Order. The Ruling Class.  The Elite.
<P>
Whatever the <I>Blue Book</I> cut is on who runs things, throw
it out.  Throw out the book too.  Because establishments are all
about staying <I>established</I>.  When Big Change happens and
they can't see it, they become <I>dis-.</I>
<P>
They still have power.  Sure, like Gorbachev's generals still
had tanks.  Thousands of them.  <U>They had power, but they did
not have authority</U>.
<P>
And authority is about belief.  Elites get to be elites because
people believe in them, and they believe in their ideas.  All
Old Orders were once New Ideas told by people with fire in their
eyes.  And their message was simple:  we know where we are all
going, and we can get you there.  These people become the new
elite because the majority of <I>all the people</I> believe them.
<P>
Elites fail because they forget this is why they are there.  They
come to think that they are there to preserve a world <U>where
they rule</U>.  They come to speak only to themselves, and, while
change is roaring through society, the only people who still believe
them are themselves.  Worse for them, they come to think that
self-belief is what authority is all about.
<P>
And that is when they really lose it.

<P>
History always remembers the moment when a ruling society discovers
it can no longer rule, because it has lost the belief of its people:
 the moment that  <I><B>Old Ideas [and Elites] Lose Authority</B></I>
<P>
How do old elites come to fail in the face of Big Change?  They
make four big mistakes:
<P>
<ul>
<I><B>R</B>uling Elites cannot see the change, in part because
it hits right after a period of triumph for them, a time when
their own authority has been unquestioned.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen faced with change, elites try to deny what is happening.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the change cannot be held off, ruling elites try
to control, or &quot;manage&quot; change to preserve their position.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the handwriting is on the wall, many among the
elite embrace the new vision, ensuring survival for many ...</I>
<P>
</ul>
... but it is too late for Old Elite society as a whole. The irony
of it all is that the unraveling begins at the moment the ruling
elite is least disposed to accept it.  It happens at the moment
of their triumph.
<P>
Look at the British ruling class after 1815.  23 years fighting
Napoleon ... now <I>Boney</I> was finally doing time on St. Helena.
 Five coalitions it took to do him in;  an Iliad of a war.  But
when it was done, the British latifundial elite -- you know, rolling
estates and country &quot;homes&quot; big as Versailles -- owned
the world, superpower-care-free as a fox hunt.  And right then,
that instant, it all began to strip itself away.  Why?  Because
the entire energy and effort of British society, of British life,
had come to be written as a great struggle.  The elite's bible
was Bonaparte, where he was the Devil of change and upheaval.
 So when he was banished at last, the ruling class thought:  <I>We
have conquered change itself!</I>  Could they just imagine that
by beating Boney, they would lose their last claim on control
of their own?  <I>No</I>. Their world was swirling around them,
and they thought -- <I>wonder of wonders!</I> -- that their authority
was never more majestic.  Double false pride.
<P>
The same thing was true of the United States, which had just fought
its own foreign war.  It happened to be against our own people,
<I>The South</I>.  Like a well-lathered 16-part miniseries, it
wasn't just a war.  It started in the 1850s, with the rise of
Radical Republicanism.  There was Bleeding Kansas, Abe Lincoln's
election, John Brown's body, the Big Bang Battle Hymn of the Republic.
 And after Appomatox, the saga continued.  Crusading war dissolved
into crusading politics:  the uplifting of the wicked called <I>Reconstruction</I>.
 Good <I>vs.</I> Evil, national energy tasked to ideology, and
speechifying leaders -- for 20 years, from 1856 to 1876, we had
our own Iliad.  While gilt-edged Brit elite sang <I>See the Conquering
Hero Comes!</I>, ours claimed emotional authority from <I>The
Union Forever!</I>  Serial melodrama, year after year, was the
elite theater of authority.
<P>
Cold War sound familiar now?  Was Washingtonian strutting any
different, gloating in its <I>End of History</I> triumphalism?
 Call <I>Johnny Reb</I> and<I> Jean Crapaud</I> bad miniseries,
but they had <U>action</U>.  Cold War was plain bad soap opera.
 Like<I> General Hospital</I>, it got very tedious, lapsing in
the end into a stream of mock crises and snore summits.  But the
Sponsors loved it.  And why not?  The Soviet Union had settled
in like welfare squatters on the first floor of American life.
 Commies consumed attention, they sanctioned elite power.  What
could be more important than 50,000 nukes in your face?
<P>
Fifty years should have ratified forever;  but then, suddenly,
it all went away.  And since then, America has suffered the sordid
spectacle of a ruling elite desperately trying to justify its
right to rule on one hand, while PC-bullying the rest of us to
keep taking orders on the other.
<P>
And while that old elite spent the early 1990s in earnest gush
that America would not make it without more elite control -- <I>We're
in economic decline, we need an industrial policy!  We need to
run the world or it will be a mess!  We need national health care!</I>
-- the rest of society was moving toward the first act of revolution.
<P>
Elites make revolutions happen.  They are why we have revolutions
at all:  because elites try to postpone change.  And while they
get their <I>Best and Brightest</I> to tell us why change is bad,
or why it shouldn't happen unless they regulate it ... it happens.
<P>
And in order for it to happen, change has to overcome elite resistance.
 What old elites achieve is the opposite of what they want.  Their
resistance speeds up the very unraveling of authority that they
fear.  Boom!  They garrotte themselves.. We call the public execution:
 revolution.
<P>
Elites not only make revolution possible, <I>they are its midwives</I>.

So the next movement:  <I><B>Old Elites Fail, New Do Not Lead</B></I>.
<P>
But what does elite failure look like?  Elite failure doesn't
mean inevitable tumbrels and a Terror.  The erosion of the old
order and its authority rushes toward a series of happenings that
end the sway of the old ruling elites, and usher in a period without
leadership.  Those who have made economic revolution are not like
the old order they unseat.  They are not the bureaucrats who rise
to high estate as <I>Masters of the Job Description</I>.  Their
roughshod power comes from making things happen, not trying to
stop them.  That is why their Homeric title would be <I>Breakers
of Bureaucrats, </I>because that is what they do while they make
change happen.  They don't know anything about creating a new
system, they would howl at the prospect of <I>going into government</I>.
 They would say:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>Let a new path emerge naturally from the new world.  You can't
force a new path.  That's exactly why the old order failed.  They
tried to hold back change.  And if holding back change was the
problem, then change itself is the solution.  The old won't work,
but everything new will.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
Makers of economic revolution are the necessary agents of change,
but not necessarily the new leaders of society.  Aged elites in
both Britain and the United States flunked the leadership test
when upheaval hit hardest.  Everyone could see that those in charge
blew it.  But the new enterprisers who spearheaded revolution
also failed.  Omission, not commission -- but still failure. 
The standard was theirs to hold.  They just failed to pick it
up.
<P>
The United States and Britain then snagged in midstream, lodged
on a mudbank period of drift in politics, juxtaposed crazily with
the roaring whitewater energies of economic change.  The result:
 the disorder and disconnectedness in peoples lives grew.  Society
itself seemed about to fall apart, while old <I>and</I> new elites,
fearful of the outcome, twitched feebly, with some shaky rattling
of armed authority from above. 
<P>
But feeble gestures only lashed the alienation of the rest from
ruling elites that had squandered their authority.
<P>
How did the elite fail in Britain?  The gentry made a good start
by ignoring what was happening.  Few were actually involved in
business.  There were no landed people who were also corporate
owners in Parliament in 1820, or in 1830.  More tied in with business
as the revolution gathered steam, but gently.  <I>I have  a nephew
in business;  I'm a barrister, you know</I>.  A few might sit
on a corporate board somewhere.  But they let the world pass them
by.  The new Barons--as in Beer Barons, known as <I>The Beerage</I>--were
knocking on the temple doors.
<P>
Then they went out and undercut themselves in style.  If any figure
helped to delegitimate the old order, it was George IV.  Call
him <I>The Prince of Pleasure</I>; let him prove it at 96-course
meals.  Let his friend Beau Brummel offer the only gift of his
regime to society:  the starched collar.
<P>
And this ruling class didn't even try to wonk -- they just let
their policies plain fail.  The politics of that old order are
remembered in the union workhouses, the poorhouse, debtors' prisons,
Luddite loom-smashing, and Redcoats firing on the crowd at Peterloo.
 But political failure was in Britain a far cry from political
fall.  Taking gentry power apart took more than a generation.
 You don't remember?  That's the trouble.  It's so far away now,
like looking at life through dark historical mica.
<P>
The United States?  What failure here?  The pearl of Radical Republicanism
was ground down in the embarrassments of, and backlash against,
a forever unfinished, internal war of ideology.
<P>
Forever repression of the South was failing.  It was failing because
of exhaustion and recognition:  exhaustion over the strain of
beating down our own Reb face in the mirror;  and recognition
that its goals <I>could not</I> be achieved [and so many in the
North, sadly, who did not want them to be achieved].
<P>
But there were <I>undercurrents</I> too, and the undercurrants
that helped kill Reconstruction were more interesting.  Among
them was a gathering in the gut that the <I>Grapes of Wrath</I>
elite -- who had blazed to trample Rebel vineyards -- was giving
way to a group of New Men, <I>Organization Men</I> of the Grant
Administration who cared nothing for America's soul, but plenty
for promises of patronage, and the river of rewards from the new
<I>machine politics</I>.
<P>
And this replacement-Republican elite resisted the claims of the
thronging new workers of the industrial cities.  But the workers
kept claiming, pushed by economic &quot;panic&quot; and depression.
 Their champions began to talk about something called a &quot;moral
economy,&quot; and Ira Steward wrote that<I> &quot;something of
slavery&quot;</I> remained in the North.
<P>
What happened in America in the later 1870s was that the crusading
vision that created Reconstruction was coming home.  It was no
longer held aloft by an elite that once led the grand, rolling
bayonet charge down Cemetery Ridge;  but by regular people, people
who were now forced to defend themselves against the young changelings
of the righteous elite that so recently led them into battle.

<P>
There was a <I><B>Demand for New Meaning</B></I>.
<P>
People began to rebel against their own elite because they felt
betrayed by it, and the people were right.  Grant's New Men seized
fast advantage of industry's stripping of work's status.  And
where the elite firebrands of the 1850s would do anything to give
all Americans full citizenship, their young changelings of the
1870s fought to take it away from all but a few.  The Organization
Men feared full citizenship for all, because they feared it would
mean a workers' world:  the end of their own world.  But turning
on their old ideals, the Republican New Men set out on a corrosive
path, betraying their fathers, denying their heritage, and foretelling
their own, eventual fall.
<P>
Because demand for new meaning would not be denied;  someone was
going to come along and supply it.  And they would lay claim to
leadership.  But first, how was this demand expressed?
<P>
In Britain, early on, there were rural bonfires, from the Luddite
to the Captain Swing disturbances.  But these were the lashings
out of a dying countryside, futile and distant flares of things
to come.
<P>
The real demand could be felt as industry really took root in
Britain, with the migrations in full flood.  Unionism, and then
the Chartist movement were able in the 1840s to put real pressure
on the ruling elite, <I>through politics</I>.  The peoples' demand
-- politely put.
<P>
In the United States, it was more violent.  As Grant's New Men
rose to be <I>Robber Barons</I> in a <I>Gilded Age</I> [what a
turn of phrase on <I>Golden Age</I>!], they defended their civic
order, and their property, by building forts in the heart of every
city.  These arsenals still exist.  What were called armories,
were really castles, strongholds of the robber Barons.
<P>
They were thrown up after the labor rebellions --The Great Strike
of 1877.  They were there so the army and militia could drag out
the guns and sweep the streets.
<P>
Because everyone remembered the whole of Philadelphia's railroad
yards in flames.  If the railroad was the centerpiece of transformation,
the symbol of new elite power, then imagine the elite's shock
as they watched them burn into the night.  Out came the army,
the guns, the grapeshot ... Ergo, the armories.
<P>
And ergo, labor unions.  The number of major unions in America
went from 3 to 21 in the 1870s.
<P>
But as workers mobilized to fight against the elite, society slid
into crisis.  And what is <I>crisis</I>?  It is not <I>coming
apart</I>;  it is the dawning fear that we will unless ... 
<P>
Remember the mind jump from the old world to the new?  In the
gilded age we weren't making it;  and the longer it was ignored,
the harder, our gut said, it would be to get to the other side.
 As Henry Holt wrote in 1895:
<P>
<I>... the large majority of intellectual people </I>[read: elites]<I>
are peacefully sitting on a crust covering a mephitic chasm, or,
as many think, a volcano.</I>
<P>
It was a crisis that the absence of a ruling idea seemed to make
inevitable.

<br>--John Newton, 1831
</center>
<P>
And its absence for twenty years [<I>1876-1896</I>] became something
of a <I>desideratum</I>--the thing most wanted--in American life.
 Demand for new meaning went unfulfilled until <I><B>A Vision,
A Movement, and Order</B></I> came again to national life.
<P>
And not surprisingly,  it was found in elite form; that is, in
an elite that would lead.
<P>
And leadership meant religion.  Reaffirmation.  Religious revival
among American and British elites was a symbol to everyone else
that they could believe in elites again.  A bond of trust with
regular people was renewed.  But there was more.  Revival connected
personal religious calling to civic calling.  Individuals among
the renewed elite suddenly had authority again:  their voices
for reform rang true.  People got excited again.  People believed
again.  Things got done.
<P>
In Britain, this was called Methodism.  Methodist membership soared
in the decades after Wesley's death in 1791, from about 50,000
to more than 500,000 in 1840.  The important thing to know is
that Methodism became the religion of the new elite.
<P>
Methodism gave a new elite something far better than power:  moral
authority.  And this authority was not just put to the reform
of religion: the revolt of chapel [Methodism] against Church [the
ruling class' state religion].  Righteous Methodists brought their
reform faith to bear on all society.  They would cleanse a society
corrupted by Old Order thinking ... through modern thought.  They
would bring in universities and <I>&quot;institutes&quot;</I>
of expertise based on scientific methods.  Above all, they would
legitimate a <I>new class</I> of professionals, who could face
the problems of the world with an integrity [from the Latin <I>purity</I>.
 Clean!] given by reason and education.
<P>
The most important symbol of the new liberalism was the person
of the monarch herself.  The Georgian kings were the family heads
of their ruling society;  they represented the landed class and
their right to rule--and also, in George IV, their vanity, backwardness,
and profligacy.  Victoria, crowned just five years after the first
Reform Act, deliberately set a new course, where monarchy followed
reform, and by embracing it, decisively legitimated it.  Victoria,
in her person, embodied the new elite ethos.  Her sobriety, modesty,
and rectitude gave liberalism national authority.  Here was a
middle class, modern monarch, championing the new agenda of teetotalers,
social crusaders, and engineers.
<P>
And the idea of a democratic franchise gradually took root.  The
sway of the landed elite was worn away between the two reform
acts of 1832 and 1867, and the Beerage was co-opted into the new
spirit of the age.  The Corn Laws were repealed, and a ten-hour
work week was passed in 1841.
<P>
But getting to the new vision -- giving order to a chaotic transformation
in national life -- was long and hard-fought.
<P>
The vision was not even conceived until well after the initial
pulse of economic revolution, and no part of the new vision came
from the old order.  Nothing.  <I>Nada</I>.  And from the rollicking
new elites? -- A new way of life, a new context, a new physical
texture of existence.  But not meaning, not vision, and certainly
-- save for the same elites in their cozy brownstones -- not <I>order</I>.
<P>
The vision came out of a different elite that itself emerged as
individuals deserting both the old order elite and the new industrial
elite.
<P>
The Progressive movement renewed the American ruling class in
much the same way as Methodism led Britain's social revival, fifty
years later.  But our driving religious impulse was Presbyterianism,
offering a kind of Calvinist <I>noblesse oblige</I>, which gave
the early Progressives their high sense of order, determinism
and drive.
<P>
So much of Britain's reform was mirrored in America's elite revival:
<P>
<U><I>Temperance</I></U><I>:</I>  British <I>Teetotalism</I> transmuted
into our own, <I>Prohibition</I>;
<P>
<U><I>Anti-serfdom</I></U><I>:</I>  Not only a kindred lineage
from Wilberforce [<I>the Brit who stopped the slave trade</I>]
to Abolition, but a stretching of the anti-slavery metaphor to
industrial labor;
<P>
<U><I>The Rule of Reason</I></U><I>:</I>  From Bentham [<I>such
a modern guy he had himself stuffed and put on display in London
U., the place he founded</I>] and Britain's university surge,
to a skyrocketing of American engineering [<I>see below</I>] Ph.D.'s,
just before the Progressive era;  and,
<P>
<U><I>Administration by the Engineer</I></U><I>:</I>  The great
fairs in St. Louis and Chicago presaged the Progressive new wave,
just as the Great Exhibition of 1850 gave physical symbolism to
a new sense of order in British society.  Both built their vision
of progress on the physical mastery of the engineer <I>[hence,
the easy glide to &quot;social engineering&quot;].</I>
<P>
The Progressive movement had achieved its goals by 1920.  The
two <U><I>Time</I></U> cover men of the new generation, smooth
bringers of enlightened government and managed society, were Bernard
Baruch and Herbert Hoover.  Their gaze locked to a cloudless future.
<P>
But the nature of labor could not be jammed into an ordered dream
society.  One problem was the decline in agricultural jobs.  Farm
labor still nearly equaled manufacturing in 1900:  13 million
manual [industrial and related] workers, vice 11 million farm
laborers.  The broad swathe of what was now called &quot;white
collar&quot; was still small, at 5 million. 
<P>
Progressives had carefully crafted a world celebrating the worker,
where every American -- <I>as worker </I>-- could manufacture
their own American Dream.  The new managers expected that farm
labor would plummet as mechanized agriculture advanced.
<P>
What they did not anticipate was a decline in assembly line jobs.
 Not only were fewer and fewer needed in agriculture, but fewer
and fewer were needed to make things.  The obvious response was
to coax demand to keep pace with manufacturing efficiency.  Gone
would be the late-century terror of slumps and industrial surplus.
 Some say that to do this the managers created a cult of consumerism,
of ever-growing demand, to keep the workers' world going.  Sly
Pied Pipers!
<P>
But the Progressives' all-knowing vision seemed to crack and totter
after 1929.  The spiral into all-consuming depression could not
be managed;  the movement had failed.  But Progressive elite society
was unfazed by crisis.  It responded by turning on, and demonizing
the small-<I>c</I> conservatives among its own, those who had
run America since 1920.  And Herbert Hoover, master engineer,
became the gaunt-eyed icon of a vision that had failed because
of its conservatism.  The vision was not wrong; it had simply
not gone far enough.
<P>
Bad old Republican progressives had blown it because they let
the chaos of the market continue, but they <I>sinned</I> in believing
that private institutions could keep order and stability through
mere mediation.  It was not enough, the <I>Renewed Progressive</I>
said, for enlightened government just to regulate and advise;
 the state should intervene in the actual workings of society,
in order to insure progress and stay future catastrophe.
<P>
FDR did not bring revolution;  he found a way to renew peoples'
trust in the old elite -- <I>with a new face</I>.  His <I>Brain
Trust</I> borrowed the nicest-sounding tidbits from European social
democrats, but stayed true to the original Progressives' Presbyterian
patterns, especially the <I>noblesse oblige</I> part.  <I>Renewed
Progressives</I> wanted real government management of society,
but stopped short of advocating government ownership.  Their role
models were not gods nor fathers, but headmasters and ministers.
 The whole nation was their classroom and congregation.  They
would make things better -- manage industry right, give social
welfare to all, and coax an equality of outcome in American life
-- by preaching and instructing.
<P>
This elite makeover made sense to Americans.  Then world war actually
renewed emotional ties between people and their elites.  And World
War Two was a rip-snorting celebration of socialism.  The state
took over all our energies -- <I>they owned them!</I> -- for four
years, and they gave us a great adventure in return.  When Americans
came out into the sun and promises of peace, they gave FDR's brand
of progress their full faith and trust.
<P>
But there was no going back to the fervid installment consumerism
of the 1920s.  <I>Boy, but we could make!</I>  American workers
-- many of them women -- made everything world war demanded with
ease.  <I>And this</I> <I>with 12 million workers in uniform,
off the assembly lines</I>.  Recognition hit, at the moment of
the workers' world's biggest win, that the US was no longer for
workers only.
<P>
But we were still pretty creative:  we countered with a new class
of managers.  And a big new labor sector called &quot;management
services&quot; met two needs.  It allowed the economy to increase
total work, rather than rationing it <I>[meaning fewer jobs and
more social welfare]</I>, or reducing it <I>[meaning fractional
jobs for all].</I>
<P>
And much of this new work came with higher status.  This meant
that most millions of Americans could tie &quot;a better life
for our children&quot; to a promotion in <I>class</I>.  The GI
Bill made college the subsidized brass ring of the common man,
and college for all made us all <I>[eventually]</I> middle class.
 Upward mobility for all of us! What a concept!
<P>
This outward and upward expansion of labor unleashed a people
just past depression and war.  Full of pent-up demand for goods,
and, equally, full of pent-up expectations.  The elite had found
a way to meet them both.  Their seductive shibboleth:
<P>
<I>&quot;The American Dream.&quot;</I>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<I><B>&quot;Gee, Wally ...&quot;</B></I>
</center>
<P>
The new order worked like a big block <I>Chevy 454</I>.  And many
continued to believe that enlightened Government and the GI Bill,
had helped make it work.  In the 1950s and 60's, at belief's crest,
75% of Americans thought Government should help manage society.
<P>
LBJs <I>Great Society</I> was the floodtide of our faith in government.
<P>
What had been achieved?  The United States was no longer a worker's
world, it was now a middle class world.  In 1948, two-thirds of
Americans identified themselves as &quot;working class.&quot;
 By the 1960s, most said instead, &quot;middle class.&quot;  The
early TV sitcoms etched an indelible portrait of idealized American
life, a mythology now gathered under the collective mantle of
 <I>Leave It to Beaver</I>. [As nostalgic, <I>Nick at Nite</I>
Yuppies rush to embrace old sitcoms, they lay bare the same Old
Order reflex to revolution as Keats and Shelley lamenting a lost
countryside, or readers of <I>Tom Sawyer</I> and <I>Huckleberry
Finn</I> the demise of small town America].
<P>
People now lived in what academics would call <I>&quot;the mature
variation&quot;</I> of the industrial network of cities.  We called
it <I>suburbia</I>.  Auto and interstates made its sprawl possible,
and the sprawl itself made possible the big upstairs move in status
[for most].  The tract house and its passionste sidekick, the
white picket fence, was the campaign ribbon of a better life that
kept close people and their elites.
<P>
This was the third stage of urban America:  its life cramming
first into the strip shopping center, and then hitting its brief,
glittering zenith with <I>Edge City</I>, The Great American Mall.
 It is the place we still inhabit.  It is the mature end state
of classic industrial society.  It is a world that made room for
too-efficient manufacturing by creating a new management class
and service economy that soaked up the spilling excess of labor.
<P>
It all peaked around 1970.  That year, there were 40 million industrial-related
workers, only 2 million on the farm, and 38 million white collars
in America.
<P>
The new elites had brought order out of the chaos of industrialization.
 Their assembly line world worked.  First they rooted meaning
in the worker, then grafted on this social sod a middle class
world of management and services, living off its harvest.
<P>
Education and entertainment showed how well-oiled it all was.
 Education had become a machine designed to socialize and prepare
workers for an assembly line world, and managers for a world of
<I>pyramid-climbing</I>.  And new entertainment technologies were
harnessed to please and pacify.  Movies, radio, and television
-- unlike vaudeville and opera -- were based on a detached, objectified
relationship between artist and audience, and encouraged far more
passivity than traditional theaters.  And passive people make
controlling people very happy.
<P>
But now, no matter how smooth its control, the elite worried about
how to split up the still-shrinking pool of jobs.  And by jobs,
they meant <I>real</I> jobs.  And in industrial iconography, 
<I>real jobs</I> = <U>manufacturing</U>.  Real jobs would go away
because of -- dread word of that day -- <I>automation</I>.
<P>
This fear was an elite commonplace:  you could catch it in Kurt
Vonnegut's <I>Cat's Cradle</I>, or in high-tone, hard-back rags
like <I>Horizon</I>.  Look at Dennis Gabor's &quot;The Perils
of Leisure,&quot; from the Summer, 1964 issue -- the warm apogee
of the Great Society.  Productivity says Gabor, keeps growing
in the industrial world at a steady <I>x</I> percent, so high
that no social welfare spending can outpace it.  Eventually, said
the trendline, only the privileged would work.  The article's
substance, in fact, is in its opening cartoon, by David Levine.
 First, we see the bad old days, with working people in harness,
pulling a cigar-corpulent plutocrat on a wheeled palanquin.  Then,
we see tomorrow:  with happy mill workers playing cards on that
same, cushy float;  pulled now by three dapper, winking, Harvard
engineers.
<P>
The end of work itself was in sight:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>For the first time in history we are now faced with the possibility
of a world in which only a gifted minority need work, to keep
the great majority in idle luxury.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
This scene of the story ends here, in the mid-1960s, with elite
certainty that the engineering ethos -- managing the human condition
-- had triumphed.  The only problem they saw:  only the engineers
would have jobs.
<P>
But they were wrong.  Totally wrong.
<P>
How could they have been so far off the mark?
<P>
They took a straight line -- or like Gabor, just fondly cited
it as ever-truth -- and pushed it out.  All else stayed constant.
 What they overlooked, <I>or perhaps could not bring themselves
to believe</I>, was that human imagination itself was about to
change how the world worked.  New wealth and new jobs would be
created out of nothing:  <U><I>by creating new demand</I></U>.
 
<P>
This demand would be like the new demand created more than a century
before, at the beginning of industrial revolution.  The irony
for the now-aging elite was that their very success encouraged
innovation that would shake their world apart.  The Progressive
elites of late-20th century America made for themselves the same
predicament as the landed gentry of late-18th century Britain.
 Their wealth and ethos of improvement unwittingly set in train
the industrial revolution that would unseat them.
<P>
And this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the roller-coaster of <I>our</I>
revolution heading toward its first plunge:
<P>
<I>The discovery of Byte City.</I>

</center>
<P>
&quot;Discovery&quot; means a burn-jump:  flash-link idea to technology.
 But we can't do that.  It's still too hard if Flashy ads can
trumpet TV [!!!] <I>as the future</I>.
<P>
<I><B>Humbug!</B></I>  We could demo the virtu-screen <I><B>&amp;</B></I>
Byte City <U>in five years</U>.
<P>
But maybe it doesn't matter whether we see, because we are stumbling
blind toward Byte City anyway through Big Money.  The coalitions
that will build Byte City have just been made.
<P>
And the big combos aren't waiting for the idea.  These are the
big alliances, the merging of corporate muscle in <I>tele-communications</I>
-- Bell South, Bell Atlantic, MCI -- with <I>entertainment </I>--
Disney, Time Warner -- with <I>software</I> -- Apple, Microsoft,
IBM -- and with the big <I>Cable</I> companies.  More than enough
to make <I>Byte City</I> happen ... when they finally figure it
out.
<P>
It doesn't matter that they are still fumbling with stagecoach
metaphors, when the railroad is waiting to be built.  It doesn't
matter that they still speak the language of <I>computer</I> and
<I>TV</I> and <I>telephone</I> and <I>Information Superhighway</I>
... when each one of these tools is poised on the crumbling edge
of historical oblivion.  It doesn't matter, because
<P>
Byte City, the rollercoaster rush to revolution, awaits, simply,
its own 
<P><I>Logos</I>, 
<br><B>The Word.</B>
<P>
The network of Byte Cities will be constructed on top of the on-line
services' road network that exists today.  We still think of <I>The
Net</I> as a communications mesh, but it is really a transportation
network.  It will be like the railroad of the last century because
it will do the same thing the railroads did to our lives.  But
instead of a physical locomotive, taking us to the city, the virtu-screen
will be a <I>virtual</I> engine, bringing the city to us.
<P>
We are only perhaps 20 years away from living, and working, in
the virtual public square of Byte City.  And when it hits us,
its power to entrance will be irresistible, but just as irresistibly,
it will disrupt the inherited rhythm of our lives.
<P>
Keep in mind that this will be nothing like looking at a television,
no matter how big the TV image gets.  Marshall McLuhan told us
that TV was a &quot;cool&quot; medium, because the screen was
always in the way, scratching at our emotional bond with the moving
imagery on it.  The interface was the emotional distance that
diminishes TV &quot;reality.&quot;
<P>
The wall-high virtu-screen parts ways with all of its vacuum-tube
progenitors because
<P>
<I>There is no interface.</I>
<P>
It is not only big like a movie screen, it has the picture fidelity
of life.  High-definition, digital imagery is <I>here</I>, but
the truly life-like is <I>there</I>, only a few years away.  You
will not hit the pavement of Byte City streets, but you will walk
the sidewalks none the less.
<P>
You will appear on those streets, visible to others, in a simulated
form:  a digital composite.  Most, surely, you will also appear
in slightly <I>[or highly!]</I> idealized form.  A whole service
niche will spring up, like the Pinkertons of the last century,
to verify that those we meet in Byte City are who they say they
are ... Countering <I>[of course!]</I> the artistry of an even
bigger new niche, the persona-<I>couturiers</I>;  from <I>haute</I>
to almost off-the-rack.
<P>
In fact, demand for a yet-unimagined range of services will surge
to meet the needs of this fabulous, overwhelming, new urban world.
 There will be so much to do, so much that one wants to do, that
our sense of <I>needs</I> will be wrestling with almost constant
redefinition.  Is it so different now?  <I>I <U>need</U> that
new computer?</I>  Really.  Just take that urge up an order of
magnitude.
<P>
You will work there, you will want to play there, you can do <I>[almost]</I>
everything there.  And each of the Byte Cities -- some big, some
very intimate -- will savagely compete for your time and your
precious subscription.
<P>
But one thing they will not compete for, one thing they will all
strive actively to assuage, will be the eventual <I>anomie</I>
they spread, seeping into our spirits even as we work and cavort
in the cool, passionate swirl of neon and gilded <I>chiaroscuro</I>.
<P>
Because it will change the way we relate to people.  Think about
it:  If you can meet with anyone, anywhere, any time, interact
with them, do anything with them -- immediately, intimately, but
<I>virtually</I> -- the potential for initial social disruption
is as great as that visited on the flood of urban migrants to
the brick cities of smokestacks and furnaces that scarred England
two centuries ago.
<P>
Those cities physically threw people together.  Our revolution
will also throw people together, but the impact of intimacy --
for work or play -- without barriers of time and space, will stretch
and stress our social patterns to the limit.
<P>
How will it do this?  Let's look at three torquings of necessary
intimacy:
<P>
<pre>
<CENTER><I><B>Sports   		Speech    		Sex</B></I></CENTER>
</pre>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Sports</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
keep us tribally blooded.  Not with the band, out for the hunt,
but in a theater of its training.  Sports is our ritual connection
to the tribe working together for survival, seeking great elk
kills.  Sports takes us back to origins, keeping our oldest identity
alive.
<P>
But sports changes to fit new worlds of work.  And sports is not
like work, sports is not for work.  Sports gives us things that
new worlds of work take away.  So when mill and assembly line
made us stand all day, sports let us sit down.  Baseball is America's
industrial sport, the theater that let a tired worker sit down
in the cool evening, have a beer, and watch them play ball.. 
Watching is as important as playing;  they are both equal parts
of the ritual sharing, because in a mass society, if the hunt
is to be tribally shared, the theater must encompass all.  Hence
the 100,000 Bowl, a stadium for the whole <I>polis</I>;  or <I>Monday
Night Football</I>, for the biggest tribe of all.  <I>Nation</I>
meant tribe for the Romans, and nation came from the verb, <I>to
be born</I>.
<P>
But Byte City forces us to get outside and play.  Now we work
in our own cells, we labor without moving, we sweat virtually.
 That vast virtu-screen becomes our master, we long for escape.
 Our urge to feel the primitive overwhelms us.  Forget baseball,
football, basketball, all the ball-pushing million-dollar heroes
do for us -- we want to get out.  Today, in places like Moab,
Utah, yuppie precursors of the new world of work sit all day in
front of their vacuum tubes, longing for the five-hour, four-wheel
drive that will take them to some wind-scarred escarpment where
they can hang-glide, or kayak-surf, or snowboard to within a fingernail's
proximity of themselves, the once-Magdelian hunter, in that very
place, an elk and a glacier ago.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Speech</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is more than how we talk.  It's about the identity we get from
how we talk.  Old Order types talk in writing, and they lament
what they call the end of literacy.  Whining:  <I>When people
stop writing, the greatest glory of human expression will die,
and with it, the heart of civilization itself.</I>
<P>
But the death of Old Order writing is the rebirth of our language.
 The death prose we now call <I>the written word</I> was once
alive with current.  When Samuel Johnson bleu stronge with so
grayte a noyse, written English was vital, rich, hot-blooded.
 We didn't even know how to spell until well into the 19th century:
<P>
Until well into the industrial era.  After the revolution.  The
new elites may have brought order, but they also brought formality,
control.  Over the last century, the enlightened elite wrung the
spirit out of language.  Bureaucrats made rigid the written word,
larded it with rules, a bid to control thought itself.  In industrial
end-times, <I>Elitespeak</I> is unreadable.  <I>Elitespeak</I>
is not for giving a message; it is for hiding it.  It is <I>anti-language</I>.
<P>
But now, as we lose our &quot;literacy,&quot; we liberate our
tongues.  New ways of telling fit new values to be told, all spoken
in a new place.  And telling it affirms what we are, as it overturns
what we are not.  So as we speak the truth, song returns to speech.
 And as we make new landscape heroic in virtual expanse, we come
back to Homeric, Hip-Hop cadence.  New language, new connection,
new message.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Sex</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is to society what C4 is to civil engineering:  it is elemental
both to creation and to destruction.  That is why all cultures
work hard to harness sex, to make it celebrate and reinforce society
... because it also has the power to tear away at it.  Modern
lore remembers two tearing times:  the libertine French Revolution
[as in <I>Marat-Sade</I>:  &quot;What's the use of a revolution
without general copulation?&quot;], and the more widespread wildfire
of &quot;liberated,&quot; pre-AIDS America:  1790s, 1970s.  Neither
lasted long.
<P>
Byte City does not promote uncontrolled sex, it merely removes
the controls.  Remember, you can meet anyone, anywhere, anytime.
 And whatever you do is free of consequences.  Byte City's most
obvious limitation is also its biggest draw:  you can't actually
touch anyone, so no one gets hurt. <I> Physically</I>.  Old style,
uncontrolled sex meant a river of consequences:  unwanted births,
incurable diseases, collateral crimes aplenty, and marital mayhem.
 None of these would attain in <I>Byte City</I>, the ultimate
terminus of protected, vicarious, unbridled sex.
<P>
No culture has ever been offered such a painless feast.  No culture
has ever had its ethos so tested.  Culture controls sex by linking
it indissoluably to love.  Promiscuity requires cruel manipulation
of others while zeroing out love;  even in a society where sex
is available, only a few can sustain the drain on persona that
promiscuity demands.  Byte City's sexual <I>smorgasbord</I> makes
no such demands.
<P>
Everybody can do it:  we feel no pain, no pain is inflicted, identity
is hidden, and fantasex is limited only by mind and by byte.
<P>
But there is a fee.  This is real sex, and there will be consequences.
 How overwhelming?  Look at the constant pushing of the envelope
in on-line sex right now;  but this is nothing to the pulsing
explosion to come.  Baroque paraphernalia will be like quaaludes
in the high-quest:  virtual reality armor and implants, real-time
video changelings for digital personae, and wild, wild metamorphoses.
<P>
Morph sex itself will stretch us, in the end, back to ourselves.
 At that final limit, so far beyond what physical sex restrains,
the very terror we will feel will be in our own reflection;  in
what we have become.
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>And</B></I> the free-wheeling, almost frontier spirit of
Byte City will push the <I>coming apart</I> we all feel is tearing
at American society.  When historians look back on this period,
perhaps they will shake their heads, thinking the clich&eacute;
of all historians:  <I>Couldn't they see it?  It was so obvious:
 the breakdown in family life, the 60% illegitimacy rates of the
early 1990s ... these were just the heralds of things to come?</I>
<P>
But people feel what is coming, even if their elite officially
denies it.  The elite denies by redefining the <I>tsunami</I>
to suit its own needs, even as the wave rises over them:  <I>A
changing labor force?  We can solve that with another federal
jobs retraining program</I>.  People are more honest;  they feel
the revolution's rumble in their guts.
<P>
Because they know the comfort of mature industrial times, the
apparent orderliness of a work force half-maker, half-manager,
has been eroding away for two decades.  But the erosion doesn't
stop;  it accelerates.  The industrial world is going away.
<P>
What does work -- and the identity work brings -- look like in
Byte City?
<P>
Say we end up in this world by 2020.  Byte City -- the new economy
-- will live on ideas.  If ideas are really the currency, if ideas
are really what make things happen, then <I>making it</I> will
be even more meritocratic than it is now.
<P>
It won't be enough to have a college degree from Yale and announce:
 <I>I'm Wolf's Head, <U>cum laude</U>, make me a Foreign Service
Officer</I> -- or some other bureaucratic lifestyle slot.  Or
-- <I>I rate a fat niche on the corporate pyramid at IBM</I>.
 No.  All job worth must be proven in Byte City.  Only a very
few will make it to the ether either ... and Murray's <I>Bell
Curve</I> won't be the best litmus test for their success.  I.Q.
measures what's in the box, but <B>Brain Lords</B> are made by
going out of the box.  That's what Byte City will thrive on, and
that's why they are the great winners, initially, in this world.
<P>
Brain Lords are not like the Robber Barons, nor their enlightened
engineer successors, the <I>Brain Trust</I>.  They are not empire-builders,
like Carnegie, nor do they wish to be managers of millions, like
Ira Magaziner.  Their goal is not control of others.  They seek
realization within their persons, like ancient heroes:  where
their brain power is like the strength and speed of Achilles.
 Tom Wolfe called them, wryly,<I> &quot;Masters of the Universe.&quot;</I>
 Milken, Gates, Spielberg:  they are the Achilles of Smart.
<P>
Yet the brain lords will not represent a heritable class.  They
will make it as individuals, and most of them will make it only
for a brief time.  Burn-out will be their limiting factor.  Like
their prototypes today in entertainment and the media, they will
use up their personal capital quickly.  The top job niche will
emphasize golden parachutes aplenty, with more relaxing work to
follow a forties' retirement.
<P>
Still successful, still needed, will be the <B>Upper Server</B>
society.  Lawyers and doctors will still make big money, but their
top echelon status will be undercut by a wholly new job persona:
 the Agent.
<P>
<B>Agents </B>will be the individual entrepreneur class, those
who offer tailored information services -- including law and medicine
and education! -- in Byte City.  Many in what we still call &quot;the
professions&quot; will squat in this niche.  The rising class
of personal information-providers and navigators will put real
downward social pressure on doctors and lawyers and academics,
because agents will get you -- or take you to -- the knowledge
you need, without a defilingly expensive appointment with the
almighty.
<P>
And maybe 10 percent of the workforce stays in production, whether
it's growing food or whether it's making things.  And they will
form a sort of upper tier themselves.  Because of the highly specialized
skills required to be a new manufacturer, <B>Makers</B> will usually
be part owners of their firms.
<P>
So say about 25 percent are doing well, very well.  And, given
the corrosion and damage to the young in illegitimate and single-parent
households today;  tomorrow's labor force will include a bottom,
an underclass, also about 25%.  This, tragically, will be double
the population share of those discarded in the bad old industrial
era.  These are <B>The Lost</B>;  and in revolutionary times,
societies have shown little inclination to find them.
<P>
And they can be sustained, as they are now, by the great wealth
unlocked by Byte City.  They can be sustained, but they can't
be ignored.  Those who bring order from the chaos of things to
come, those who come after us, will very likely make the rediscovery
of the lost their great task, just as the Victorians and the Progressives
in their day sought out the poor.
<P>
But what will the rest of us, the 50 percent in the middle, the
bedrock of the industrial world's great &quot;Middle Class;&quot;
 the true believers in &quot;The American Dream;&quot;  <I>what
will we do?</I>
<P>
Old Order, New Deal elitists still think that there won't be anything
to do.  Jeremy Rivkin's new book, <I>The End of Work</I>, rehashes
the old lie of the engineer class:  there is only so much that
can be produced, so as the work force gets more productive, there
will be fewer and fewer jobs.  And eventually, there won't be
any work anymore.  Let us, the enlightened engineers of the elite,
apportion work <I>equitably</I> [meaning:  <I>as we see fit</I>].
<P>
We know <I>[Oh! How we know!]</I> that this just isn't true. 
The mountainous evidence is everywhere about us.  Demand creates
wealth;  the industrial revolution created a whole new universe
of demand.  Look at the personal computer.  <I>Demand=Wealth</I>;
 created out of nothing, out of the thin air of an idea!
<P>
There will be plenty of jobs in Byte City.
<P>
There will be plenty of money.  The question is:  What status
will these jobs have?  Of all the old badges, the four-year college
degree will be the most worthless.  People still think:  <I>I
have a college degree, I can be in middle management and rise
to the top if I'm good; I can do it</I>.  That is the motivational
mythology of the industrial age.  It is a blind guide to tomorrow.
<P>
Work in Byte City is all about service.  And the bulk of work
will be in maintenance, sales, support, and delivery.  Like video
game advisors, telling you how to get through <I>Donkey Kong in
Paris</I>, or getting you those perfect tomato cubes from the
Safeway <I>Casbah </I>local warehouse, or showing you wares in
the Woolworth Palace in Mainstreet, USA, or fixing a damaged local
fiber optic line for an Opreyville subscriber, or working up a
new simulated persona for a customer who wants to make a splash
as Conan in <I>Dirty</I> <I>Rita's Party Place</I>.
<P>
A chilling possibility is this comeback of service.  But that
trend today is in full flood.  At least in Byte City, most of
us are serving each other.
<P>
The problem -- <I>always</I> -- is status.  Like those new workers
in the early industrial era, those in the mills and furnaces were
not offered the status of the craftsman they replaced.  They were
pushed to the limit, because there were no limits yet defined.
 They were abused because their undefined status did not culturally
protect them.
<P>
We, the majority, the 50 percent who will make Byte City work,
will go to work in our living rooms <I>[or even, closeted in our
bedrooms]</I> before the big screen, and we will suffer much the
same stripping of self as that majority entering the Midlands
milltowns of 1820 or the East Side sweatshops of 1880.  Already
Americans are working longer and longer hours.  Can you imagine
-- with &quot;<I>global competition&quot;</I> as the excuse --
people in Byte City standing in front of their screens, working
their customers, 12, 15 hours a day?  And with an end to commuting
for many, the Brain Lords will say, S<I>o much the more time to
work</I>.  <I>And you're working at home, right?</I>
<P>
So all this talk about class is upsetting?  Americans don't like
the word:  the elite don't want to be likened to Euristocrats;
 the rest of us don't want to be reminded that The People are
not in charge.  Or maybe just that we didn't <I>make it</I>.
<P>
Class in America is always there, and it rises right to the surface
of our thinking during Big Change.  Why?  Because those driving
change also seize its opportunities.  While old elites topple
and gutter-slide, the new are in chic media worship.  They are
<U>what's happening</U>, we are <U>what is done <I>to</I></U>.
 So while our lives are in free fall, they float, majestically,
in the ether of the new world.
<P>
But what we will see as the new class won't have any of its ancestors'
levers of control.  First it was land, then commodities, then
&quot;the means of production.&quot;  In this this century it
has been knowledge.  The mature industrial world was run by bureaucratic
machine.  And what was that?  It was a pyramid of professionals,
managers, engineers:  these were the noble titles of the twentieth
century's equestrian order of knowledge.  Control of knowledge
was power, and access to knowledge was carefully controlled.
<P>
No one will control knowledge in Byte City.  The new class will
only appear to us as swaggering Brain Lords; we will assume that
they are the new masters of the universe, Robber Barons reborn.
 Their moment will be even more evanescent than in industrial
times.  After the Big Change, when it all shakes down, Byte City
may be a place for Big Men, but not for Lords.  But during the
rollicking, roughshod rollercoaster wavetime, the Brain Lords
will be the riders of the transformation, the ones scoring big,
the arrogant makers and high rollers.  And because they are the
first to benefit big from the revolution, while its impact is
still crashing down on us, we will vent on them.
<P>
Because we will identify the new elites with the whole change,
<I>bad and good</I>.  And because they break the old but then
themselves do not lead, we at last despise them.  We flock to
their network, but then, as we live and work there, Byte City
becomes ours:  a public square, a community of many neighborhoods.
 And we will want a different vision of life in this place.
<P>
So the time will come, soon after the network is built, when we
will, as those before us, demand new meaning.
<P>
And we will find it along two paths unexpectedly familiar:  politics,
and religion.
<P>
The industrial world threw people together.  Their physical closeness,
<I>en masse</I>, allowed people to mobilize politically <I>en
masse</I>.  And they did.  And that was the birth of mass, plebiscitary
democracy.
<P>
But Byte City lets us escape the faceless experience of mass democracy.
 People today are rejecting machine politics because they sense
that the new tools of social connection, the very tools that will
soon fuse into Byte City, will give them the voice to speak decisively
in all decision-making;  and not, this time, in instant mass telephony
-- button-pushing robot Perotistas -- <U>but through thousands
of interest groups and factions.</U>
<P>
Byte City returns us to politics as The Founders meant it to be.
 But politics then -- <I>say, in 1800</I> -- were for a few thousands
of Americans only.  Byte City will let millions of civically motivated
citizens meet, and caucus, and <I>politick</I>:  anywhere, anytime.
<P>
And they will demand directly.  We can only marvel in advance
at the political turbulence that lies in wait.  <I>What will we
do with all those factions?</I>
<P>
Because Americans want unity too.  They want that mythic togetherness,
like a Raoul Walsh war film or a John Ford western 
<P>
<I>Around her neck, she wore a yellow ribbon,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it in the springtime, and in the month of May,</I>
<br>
<I>And when I asked her, why the hell she wore it,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it for her sweetheart in the US Cavalry ...</I>
<P>
American togetherness is slipping away.  Where can it be found
again?
<P>
Maybe in our search for meaning in Faith.  Byte City will open
up new communities of faith as we struggle with disorder in our
lives, and especially, a fracturing of how we relate to others.
 Byte City will redefine words like <I>temptation</I>, <I>abandonment</I>,
<I>anomie</I>.  What will be the basis for connection, for commitment?
 To whom will we owe allegiance, in whom can we repose our trust?
<P>
Byte City's very nature brings a breaking-down of secular society.
<P>
And out of the rootlessness and freaky chaos will come religious
revivals.  But they will not emerge from the Old Order <I>Mainline</I>
Churches -- <I>those bastions of the elite</I> -- nor from the
Evangelical patent-leather bureaucracies that have risen to such
estate in recent years.
<P>
Why <I>patent-leather</I>?  Because to fight the elite society
of the modern state, elite evangelicals organized themselves on
the same lines.  They learned the same machine politics, and they
crafted an agenda of state control.  This time, their state. 
They became the very Church their own prophets had once fled from.
 They became the very image of the thing they fought against.
 Now their <I>tele-ministries</I> and <I>coalitions</I> are full
partners in the Old Order landscape of squabbling necropoli.
<P>
<I>Cities of the Dead</I>.  The new cities are coming, and with
them, a maw of <I>anomie</I>.  The new revival will come as a
calling:  of people rising up.  It will be the evangelism that
meets spiritual crisis head-on, that is witnessed in the new wilderness
by those who speak the truth and give good news.  And the message
will meet the times.  It will not look backward, like the anti-progressive
Old Order, to some nostalgic golden age that we can get back to
if only we have the right regulatory structure, or pass the right
laws, or ... 
<P>
The next <I>Great Awakening</I> will happen in Byte City itself.
 Maybe many sects, hot competition, fighting over their skyrocketing
convert-count.  Yet chances are that it will rise from the grassroots
Of Catholic and Protestant evangalism, like Methodism did two
centuries ago.  And maybe like Methodism, a single vision will
sweep over us.  But the revival itself will meet a great wave
of national emotion.  And [<I>when it comes</I>] its talk will
be the center of our search for new American life.
<P>
[<I>Important!  It won't look like any ad on today's Religion
page!</I>]
<P>
That is why <I>how</I> Methodism came to Britain is what we need
to know, not that it was <I>Methodist</I>.  It came.  We need
to know why it came, because we are in for the same ride.  The
cultural paradox for us at the end of <I>The Modern</I> is that
religion didn't go away.  It's going to be more important.  Just
different.  And whatever it looks like, how we find faith will
be a big part of the way we join hands civically as Americans.
<P>
And what we demand, and how we demand it, will determine who rises
to give demand leadership and vision.  We can say with certainty
that it cannot come from the dying old order:  both deathbed <I>New
Dealers</I> and but slightly less moribund <I>New Democrats</I>.
 And we suspect that it will<U><I> not</I></U> come from the cocky
Brain Lords who build Byte City <I>[but we need them to build
it!].</I>
<P>
But we should know that the Brain Lords <I>will </I>build it,
and that it <I>will</I> change our lives forever.  We know further,
in spite of Social Democracy's sentimental gurglings, that the
future cannot be managed, nor its reality held back.
<P>
But we should comfort ourselves in the knowledge also that these
things have happened before.  Others survived their time of stress,
dislocation, and <I>anomie</I>.  Britain made it through its crisis
to a world that would later be enshrined by us [in <I>Sherlock
Holmes</I>, <I>Upstairs, Downstairs</I>] as among the best of
good times.  And the United States made it through its crisis
to a similar happy place in the American mind [in <I>Meet Me in
St. Louis, Easter Parade</I>].  Crisis was succeeded by a spirit
of confidence and of hope, and a reassertion of the inevitability,
and ultimate good, of Progress.
<P>
<I>How will it happen?  How will we get to these good times?</I>
<P>
That's another story.

<h2><I><B>The War After Byte City</B></I> </h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<PRE>
It was the greatest military power of its day.
Always the innovator, its technologies of war
		were the newest,
Its command &amp; control the best of the best.
Its ability to mobilize national resources
		was matchless,
Its traditions the envy and admiration of all;
And surely, imitated by all.
It was the world's military superpower,
And it owned war.

But now peace was everywhere.
Its great armies, mobilized for decades,
		were drawn down
What had been the center of grand strategy,
		the cockpit: Central Europe,
Was now a portrait of like-minded states.

So the great nation refocused,
Turning its military toward new roles.
It built a mobile deterrent force:
A rapidly deployable army that could be rushed
To quell a regional contingency (or two!),
		and restore stability.
It reshaped its military forces
Around a core, professional force,
That could be used flexibly to achieve
		the larger, strategic goal:
The preservation of a stable world system.


Of course, I describe France in 1860.
</PRE>
<P>
But there is something familiar there for us. Like France then,
we are today's <I>grande nation</I>. And we have been there for
awhile in this American century. Like France then, American culture
has set world fashion, and our English is the world language.
And we too seem set now in a long peace.
<P>
Does a passing historical resemblance tell us anything about the
future of our own national security, or the future of war itself?
And if France may have been, like us, the military superpower
of that era: <I>they were the defeated superpower in 1815.</I>

<P>
True. Yet in the long peace after the wars of Napoleon, France
regained a military preeminence only briefly lost at Waterloo.
By 1860, France again seemed astride the earth like a god of war:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who wrote the doctrine of war everyone used? Henri Jomini.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who was the innovator: The first breechloading rifle - the
<I>Chassepot</I> - the first shell gun - the <I>Paixhans</I> -
the first machine gun - the <I>Mitrailleuse</I> - the first ironclad
battleship - the <I>Gloire</I>?
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Whose army had real global reach? With successful offensive
&amp; peacekeeeping operations just recently concluded in Spain,
Italy, Algeria, the Crimea, and soon, even Mexico too?
</UL>
<P>
France in mid-century was a world power, using its military power
to balance and manage world order. France was pledged to preserving
a world system and nearly fifty years of stability. Like the US
today, France in 1860 was the <I>status quo</I> power ...
<P>
In a world where the <I>status quo</I>, stability, and the old
system itself ... Was about to end.
<P>
<I>And end they would in a big bang for France.</I> 
<P>
Ten years later, the <I>grande nation</I> would begin an historical
reeling from which it would never recover. War with the German
Federation would humiliate the French, destroy their reputation
for war forever, and end also their long certainty of national
greatness. <B>1</B> 
<P>
This could never happen to us. <I>Of course not</I>. Like all
analogies, this one is imperfect, and in mixing military metaphors,
manipulative even. <I>Of course</I>. But as different as they
are, two times and two peoples and two ways of war, France then
and the US now share the same strategic problem.
<P>
Big Change.
<P>
France didn't lose in 1871 because it was stupid or unlucky. Certainly,
its war technologies and combat experience were superior to Germany's.
<P>
France lost in 1871 because a revolution had swept Europe. And
that revolution changed war. But the French military and their
ruling national elites had not kept up. They had missed the revolution
in war.
<P>
But if you could go back to 1860 and tell this to French ruling
elites, they would be offended. They would protest: <I> &quot;We
have the world's most modern military machine. Look at our record
of innovation: superior French science and engineering has changed
the face of war!&quot; </I>And so everyone thought. You could
see it in every newspaper - just look at Daumier's grisly cartoon,
<I>Triumph of the Needle Gun. </I>New gun, new ship, new war.
<P>
If you went back and talked about a revolution in war, people
would nod their heads. <I>Yes, there is a revolution: the ironclad
revolution at sea, and the breechloading rifle - Chassepot and
Needle Gun - on land. Yes. These are revolutionary weapons</I>.
<P>
Everyone thought that revolutions in war are about new weapons.
<P>
But it was the big change in ordinary life, the life of people
in society, that had changed war. The new artifacts of daily life
were the bringers of revolution in war ... Like the railroad.
The railroad was the tool of Europe's transformation, the agent
at the heart of industrial revolution. The railroad had brought
whole pastoral worlds to the new cities of brick and iron.
<P>
And the railroad could also bring whole age cohorts of young men
to the new killing grounds of the needle gun. Between 1815 and
1870, industrial society created industrial war: war by mobilization,
war by train timetable. But in 1860, that war had not yet been
fought. It was still theory in the mind of Moltke. New war had
been enabled, but not enacted. France's elites were free for a
while yet to pursue old wars with modern cosmetics, wars still
won by quick offensive maneuver and long-service veterans, without
apprehension that this way of war was already dead.
<P>
And they could still believe the future of war was theirs: as
long as they stayed ahead of all others in weapons' technology,
and kept their warrior ethos stoked hot. There were no worries
here.
<P>
<B>This is the point of comparison:</B> 
<P>
We are in the midst of an economic upheaval equivalent to the
industrial revolution <I>in its capacity to transform our lives</I>.
And like the industrial revolution, this metamorphosis will reach
up to politics and to war, and remake them as well.
<P>
But America's ruling elites have defined a world system that does
not allow for the possibility of Big Change. Like the French plutocrats
of the 1850s, the old, Cold War establishment is pledged to preserve
the old paradigm at all costs. They define the US as the <I>status
quo</I> power, their sacred word is <I>stability</I>, and their
imperative verb is <I>to manage</I>.
<P>
And the military component of this ruling class sees American
military power as the ultimate world management tool. War is defined
as combat operations in pursuit of stability. Some in the national
security sub-culture talk quietly about a revolution in war. But
they describe this revolution like the French military innovators
of the 1850s: a revolution in weapons.
<P>
<B>This, then, is the hypothesis:</B> 

<P><UL>
<LI>The world economic revolution is true Big Change: what old
German philosophers would call a <I>phenomenon of world-historical
significance</I>. As it transforms individual societies across
the world, it changes the very patterns of relationship between
societies - what we call the world system. And so economic revolution
changes the world system as well as the world's societies. But
here, change comes first as systemic breakdown. New norms - perhaps
a new system - will evolve later.
</UL>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Economic revolution will bring upheaval to world cultures
as old ways of life are torn apart. Upheaval will encourage new
belief systems, as people seek new meaning out of the shock of
Big Change. But change will hit different peoples in different
ways. Culture and environment will shape different demand for
new meaning around the world. New bodies of meaning that arise
- whether we call these religions or ideologies - will look different,
act different, and, most important, see big differences between
each other. New differences will lead to new human conflict.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>New war will serve the needs of new meaning. And the new ideologies
and religions born of economic revolution will use the new tools
of revolution to win. Industrial war used the new tools of railroad
and telegraph, assembly line and spreadsheet to serve the war
visions of the new ideologies: mass democracy and its competing
<I>-isms</I>. New war will be as determined, and as opportunistic.
And new meaning will have no ties to old war.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>But we, the <I>status quo</I> power, greatest of the old powers,
will not only still be fighting old war, we will still be <I>thinking</I>
old war. The successful bureaucracies of old war will continue
to refight old victories, and continue to dress future combat
in the cool desert camo of far battles long won. And we will still
have the world's best high-tech, and our people will have the
combat experience and the military professionalism. But our mythic
reputation, first built on a good war fought eight or nine decades
ago, will be both our glory and our curse.
</UL>

<P>
And we will await our Sedan.
<P>
Let's look at this bundled hypothesis point-by-point.
<P>

<I><B>A Time of Upheaval</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Discontinuous Change a Surprise to US</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Of all world cultures, America believes in the sacredness of progress.
We like to say that this has been <I>A Century of Progress</I>:
meaning, by implication, that progress is a gradual, incremental
thing, accommodating itself to the world it finds, changing it
in polite if not always comfortable ways, giving us time to familiarize
ourselves with the new. Every wrench has been buffered by its
careful insertion into our lives. We didn't jump from Vaudeville
to color TV. It took decades.
<P>
Yet this is not a time of progress. Rather, it is a time of revolution.
Change, instead of stretching the fabric of reality, is about
to rip the canvas. But we are not prepared to see revolution for
what it is.
<P>
Part of our problem is that we have disarmed our own language.
In our vision of progress, we have used the word <I>revolution</I>
as a commonplace. It has been used as an accent, a spicing for
product debuts: Television was a revolution, the Atomic Bomb was
a revolution; and so the jet plane, then the VCR, Dolby sound,
and the microwave oven. These were products that amplified, and
altered, our lives, but in no way did any of them fundamentally
change our <I>way of life</I>.
<P>
We have forgotten what revolution is. And we are about to be reminded.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Second Surprise: It's Our Own Doing</I> 
</UL>

<P>
The Big Change isn't happening out there. We are making it happen
right here. We are bringing discontinuous change to ourselves.
<P>
The US, the premiere <I>status quo</I> power, is now that very
<I>status quo</I>'s undoing. We are the dynamic force actively
dismantling the old paradigm, the old world system,
<P>
<B>We are the system breaker.</B> 
<P>
<I>How's that?</I> 
<P>
We are the makers of revolution, like Britain's self-made industrial
revolution of the last century. We are bringing the new railroad
to American life, and like the railroad, our new net will transform,
first our lives, and then the life of the world.
<P>
As the railroad created a new network of cities and an urban,
industrial society, so this new network <I>[or the net after the
net after today's worldwide web] </I>that we are laying will replace
the urban, industrial world with a new city, a new gathering place
for American life <I>[what I call]</I> 
<P>
<B>Byte City.</B> 
<UL>
<LI><I>What does this mean?</I> 

<P>
<center><i>It means this for American business, and the American way of
life:</i> </center>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be no distance - as well as no time - to transactions.
This happening now <I>[don't even ask!].</I> 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>And there will be no distance, no time barriers as well to
meeting and working in Byte City. You will be able to meet anyone,
anywhere, anytime, with the fidelity of digitized life. It won't
be video-conferencing, and it won't require headgear.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be a new standard of value, defined by the marketplace.
People will set value for knowledge. Directly, person-to-person.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The pressure for openness and transparency of transaction
will be absolute.
</UL>
</ul>
<P>
And this makes a new economy, built on knowledge services.
<br>
There is an explosion of productivity.
<br>
There is a whole new workforce.
<br>
And work takes on wholly new patterns <I>[commuting dies, for
example].</I> 
<P>
It is a new way of life for most Americans.
<P>
But there is also an end to the old workforce, and to the old
job ways, the old rhythms of life built around manufacturing,
and the servicing of the machine.
<P>
This means dislocation, anxiety, fear of the future.
<br>
And this is happening right now.
<P>
But it will get much worse.
<br>
Many will do very well in this new world, as they are right now,
<br>
But many will not.
<P>
We are in the beginning of an upheaval the likes of which we have
never known. Nor have our parents, nor theirs, nor theirs.
<P>
<CENTER><i>It means this for American politics:</i> </CENTER>
<P>
The last Big Change overthrew not just regular people's way of
life, but how all life was organized. How whole countries were
ruled. As millions of Americans find themselves in the fearful,
rollicking slide of Big Change, stripped of old meaning, they
will demand new meaning:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>What is my status in society? How do I belong? What is my worth?
What kind of life can I expect for my family, what kind of future
for my children?</I> 
</blockquote
<P>
These questions, when asked collectively, will tear apart American
politics as we have known it. More exactly, the surge of change
will spell the end of the New Deal, Cold War elite, already under
siege. The world they still represent will have nothing to say
about <I>The Change</I>, but all of it will be seen to have failed.
<P>
And the technologies of the new net, of the not-yet-apprehended
<I>Byte City</I>, will make it possible for regular Americans
so long disenfranchised by machine politics and plebiscitary democracy
to gather and talk and act. Not to nominate petty demagogues,
for they will need no telegenic spokesmen: but to move, to speak,
to be felt directly: as groups of citizens.
<P>
Economic revolution transforms the US economy. Like the last revolution,
this change increases everyone's wealth, but not everyone's happiness.
The stress of social adaptation will mean a protracted period
of inward-turning by America. For as economic revolution liberates
great national energies, these passions unleashed demand resolution.
Like America after the Civil War, there will be very little energy
to spare for the rest of the world ...
<P>
Except that the revolution itself becomes our connection. What
we create here creates demand there. Everyone wants it; it is
the spellbinding new world, the promise of a better life for billions
still tied to sweatshop and factory, and silver billions' more
for elites that can bring its wonders home.
<P>
Like Britain then, we export the agent of transformation: our
new city high on that hill in cyberspace. And the violence of
our Big Change crashes and redoubles itself on them.
<P>

<I><B>How Big Change hits the world</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The cultural dissonance of revolution</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There are reasons why we might expect that our economic revolution
will hit others harder than it hits us.
<P>
The forms of our revolution, as they are developed, tend to fit
our cultural norms and belief system. America is a chaotic culture;
it likes chaos, and even more important, it thrives on chaos.
Apparent chaos. Beneath the spectacle others see of us, there
is the same working pattern here of human culture everywhere:
custom and taboo keep us all in line.
<P>
But the<I> Byte City</I> spectacle will alternately thrill and
repel other cultures. It will thrill individuals with its seemingly
infinite possibilities. It will threaten their ruling classes
in their guts.
<P>
The new economy the US is building directly attacks the entrenched
hierarchies of the industrial world. Pseudo-democratic elites
whose rule depends on control of information will be confounded
by the absolute transparency of <I>Byte City</I>. A social welfare
system jointly created by elites and manufacturing workers cannot
be sustained in an economy where value is determined, not by job
status, and time in job, but directly: by what one actually offers
the new marketplace.
<P>
This means that the elaborate industrial paradigms of Europe and
Japan cannot long survive the advent of <I>Byte City</I> on their
ether's shores. But neither, given American market intimacy, and
the intimate demand of their own people, can it be kept out.
<P>
The problem is in adjustment. The US has already adjusted to structural
dismantling of manufacturing society. The US has made the big
investment in the new enterprises of revolution. And the US carries
much less of a social welfare overhead than the G-7's other six.
<P>
But consider the EC. In each European society, more than 50% of
GNP goes to government. This means that majority support for the
welfare state is built in. But keeping their social welfare world
means squeezing the productive sectors: in France, marginal tax
on business was just increased from 85% to 93%! Yet even this
would still work if there were enough productive enterprises to
sustain the overhead. European economies need the new enterprises
of the revolution, but these are so regulated that they have been
strangled almost to death. Just some stats. EC GNP equals the
US, but
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The value of its software is only about 20% of the US
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The EC has 47% of global manufacturing exports, but only 7%

<LI>US job growth was 33% between 1976 and 1990, in Europe it

<P>
Europeans buy US knowledge products and knowledge services: the
EC runs an $18 billion trade deficit with the US in software.
Smart Europeans who want to save on long distance call a service
in Oklahoma that places their <I>European</I> calls: they save
up to 50% that way. They are becoming parasites of America's revolution.
<P>
Europe's elites still believe that high value-added manufacturing,
like Mercedes and Italian shoes, can finance the industrial welfare
state. But there are no jobs there, and only so much value-added.
The real value-added is here: in the US, 50% of new capital investment
goes to electronics and information systems; in semi-conductors
alone, value in terms of total capital investment shot up from
7% in 1990, to 23% today.
<P>
Right now, real unemployment in Germany is close to 30%, the truth
masked by so many unemployed percentage points stashed in perpetual
job-training programs: Forty days guaranteed vacation cannot fig-leaf
a job world that rations work. In France, where unemployment is
officially 13%, the reality is also closer to a third - if the
marginally employed are counted. New French folklore fastens on
the numbers of <I>three-generation </I>families who have never
held a job.
<P>
As it barrels into this world, America's economic revolution brings
social revolution. The stratified industrial economies of Europe
and Japan - <I>[yes, Japan; 87% of Japanese workers are in globally
uncompetitive companies that receive some form of government subsidy]
</I>-<I> </I>are not prepared for the trauma that we are even
now bringing to them. The old, developed world is as brittle as
the thin civilization of late imperial Rome, its ruling elites
as dogged as 18th century <I>Chevaliers</I> facing The Great Fear,
and yet as helpless to stop its insatiable onrush.
<P>
And what happens to the Third World? What happens to those still
industrializing, still half-locked in the last revolution? If
so much disruption awaits those of the G-7, those who should be
ready but are not, how much worse will it be for those who still
daily deal in famine and industrial pollution?
<P>
To spectral witnesses like Bob Kaplan, the future belongs to the
Third World's masses of misery, where the driving force is not
economic revolution, but human and environmental degradation.
In his tortured landscape, cyberspace is the toy of neo-medieval
privilege, of a post-industrial caste secure in its pristine monasteries.
<P>
We can be sure that the agonies of Abidjan will not soon be relieved
by America's virtual public squares - the vision of <I>Byte City</I>.
But in Victorian times too, the industrial revolution brought
no succour to the slave markets of Mali. Today's transformation,
like the last, begins in a single place, and then fans out, staking
its claim over the historical reality it has created.
<P>
And these are like Victorian times in another way too. Third World
elites routinely, eagerly, spend their pampered youth in American
universities. As the architecture of a new world takes shape here,
ruling elites everywhere will rush to plug in! So the net that
transforms American life will pull in the gangsters and warlords
and languid princlings of Kaplan's forlorn anarchy.
<P>
And entrepreneurs. The economic revolution will make wealth everywhere.
Like the programmers of Bangalore, the new net will be a way out
and up for go-getters who need not get up and actually leave.
But these new enterprisers <I>will be working in America</I>.
And they will be less inclined to pay homage to physically local
rulers. And so ruling classes initially delighted will then clamp
down hard.
<P>
Just one story, from a Singapore Telecom exec-in-the-know:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>My government doesn't care, it isn't listening in to our citizens
on the net; but I'll tell you one thing: Lee Quan et al freaked
out when they were told that there were 3000 unlicensed electronic
bulletin boards on the island! That's why we now have a national
web site. And [surprise] everybody posts there before they post
out. But we don't listen in.</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
Sure. As Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's permanent foreign secretary,
told me: &quot;We don't want America's decadence, but [to control]
there are other alternatives to <I>Pravda</I>.&quot;
<P>
Mechanisms of control will be everywhere; and not all will fail.
The industrial revolution that brought democracy to Britain brought
new paternalism to Germany: workers got protection, but old Junkers
kept political power. Through the wash of peoples we call the
Third World, there will be as many responses to the new as there
are cultures and tribes.
<P>
Those places lost today will likely stay lost. But many places
full of energy - like India and East Asia - will grow in huge
surges.
<P>
What is missing from analysis is how people respond to such creative
destruction. Kaplan controls humanity's outcome by reducing all
our options to a narrowing circle of choices in a world aching
just to survive. But economic revolution means expanding choices:
more stress, but more hope too. Fertile ground not for old, but
for new religions.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New Religions</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Economic revolution takes time to do its disruptive work. The
transformation of American life doesn't happen tomorrow, or next
year. It isn't ushered in by <I>Windows 95</I>, or forced into
our living rooms by set-top-box interactive TV. The world we are
building may only reach <I>initial</I> maturity - meaning an up-and-running
infrastructure - twenty years from now.
<P>
And its impact on the world will take still longer. We can anticipate
Big Change hitting Japan a bit before Europe. But both places
closest to us will be upended no later than a decade after we
take the first hit.
<P>
The great uncertainty rests with culture areas outside our own.
Even if social revolution in Europe is a calamity, it is difficult
to imagine <I>[though not impossible!] </I>the rise of a new ideology
there that would in its fulfillment of new meaning demand the
rejection of all things American.
<P>
It is far less difficult to imagine such an outcome among cultures
that historically have found fault with America. Those culture
areas that have suffered from contact with the West, and those
that believe especially that the US has inflicted on them a lasting
degradation of identity, will be receptive to new constructions
of meaning that celebrate <I><B>all</B></I> differences between
us - and them.
<P>
But even places that have been sympathetic to the American Crusade
since 1945 may respond with dismay to the theater of chaos that
economic revolution stages <I>- for all the world to see - </I>in
early next century America. Their dismay with us could have far
more historical consequence than the sum of all their current
frustrations. Consider:
<P>
Kaplan's terrible &quot;Coming Anarchy&quot; - like Freddie's
<I>Nightmares</I> observed in adulthood - translates into a sordid,
but not necessarily threatening, world. There are lots of unhappy
people out there, but their sad slide means they have less and
less with which to make us truly unhappy. Our national security
problem becomes our choice to be depressed by contemplating such
unhappiness.
<P>
But revolution gives us a <I>real</I> problem. It not only makes
things more interesting, it also makes them more threatening.
Revolution means the US has recreated economic life, but at the
cost of its former world leadership and the world system it led.
US allies from the old paradigm have been undercut, ironically,
by their former leader, whose economic revolution has sliced their
elites' authority off at the knees. Europe and Japan, plunged
into an economic clearance sale, have in pain and anger reorganized
their societies and their politics. And those 1980s dynamos of
growth, Dragons and Tigers, have exploded in their own dynamism.
<P>
<I><B>20xx. </B></I>There are new religions abroad.
<P>
New religions claim new allegiance. Industrial revolution created
<I>anomie</I>; <I>anomie</I> demanded meaning. And meaning came:
Positivism, Marxism, Socialism, Communism, Bolshevism, Fascism
...
<P>
We called these attempted new organizations of humanity <I>ideologies</I>.
Nonsense. They were new <I>religions</I>. And what is always distinctive
about new religions is their passionate conviction: that their
truth is the only truth. A world that creates several new religions
at once is a world eager for combat.
<P>

<I><B>How The New Make New War</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>No New War Without New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There is no point looking at the world as it is, and then trying
to leap to the next war. We get stuck immediately in tortured
excursions that try to make of today's regime in Beijing or New
Delhi an adversary we could face in combat with a straight face.
Such exercises bring new meaning to the term, &quot;suspension
of disbelief.&quot;
<P>
And it gets harder the farther out we go with the same director
and cast - like a never-ending sequel to an old Defense Blockbuster:
<I> DPG XXIII, The Final Agony</I>. Planning tells us to take
today's snapshot - with all current trends holding - to some arbitrary,
even-numbered date called <I>the planning horizon</I>. This gives
us Beijing or New Delhi with <I>x+y</I> number of weapons more
than they have today. But the same, disbelieving face.
<P>
There will be no new war without new religions ... just as there
can be no revolution without a disruption of meaning. But that
disruption has already begun. So new religions are assured. It
is today's stale, crust-brittle constructions of meaning that
are not long to crumble.
<P>
<I>You don't believe this? </I>Why are we so shocked by Serbian
blood-vengeance, Chetchen blood-vengeance, Algerian blood-vengeance,
anybody's blood-vengeance, but not by its absent awareness among
our own?
<P>
<I>Meaning:</I> our elites take pride in denouncing these passions
as primitive, dismissing them as deviant: <I>If they can't be
put down, they should be condemned</I>. But these same elites
have no sense of the authentic source of these passions - a demand
for meaning in a world where stability and order have been ruthlessly
stripped away - and these passions abiding power - to fight starving
in the snow at 30 below, to make of yourself a living bomb, to
head-shot prisoners one after the other, without flinching, because
they are <I>The Stranger</I>. We watch, heads shaking, as the
edges of civilization slough and scale, and feel nothing but scorn
and superiority. The shock will come when it all hits home.
<P>
The shock at the violence of new religions - unlike our contempt
for today's brutal tribal chant - must be the shock of recognition
in revolution itself. Part of the experience of revolution is
overcoming that shock. Eventually, we will accommodate to upheavals
at the center, and they will seem different to us because they
happen here, or in places that we have long ago decided are civilizations'
centers. Not Serbia, not Daghistan; but Japan, France, China.
<I>The US</I>.
<P>
Revolution takes war away from the margins, from tribal splatterings
at the limits of what we control, and puts it back in the firmament
of the center, among close relations, in the heart of the world
<I>metropole</I>. It does this, of course, because revolution
so changes the world <I>bourse</I> that nothing else can stay
the same.
<P>
Conflicting new religions in a world after economic revolution
runs its course will be accepted by Americans. And we will surely
have run a course with many home grown cults and religions of
our own.
<P>
But we may be less ready to deal with triumphant, inimical, movements
that have us directly in their sights.
<P>
By less ready I mean less prepared to deal with the fruits of
their animus against us. Today, we chafe at the prospect of highly
motivated, Islamic revivalist groups doing their worst on us.
But compared to the potential power of a great new religious movement,
drawing strength from its millions and the surging technologies
of revolution, these zealot-clusters are nothing.
<P>
If new religious movements, like the Nazis or Bolsheviks of this
century, claim the energies of whole peoples - passionate, educated
millions - then the new world and its new meaning is really worth
worrying about.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>New War as the celebration of New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
We still think of Nazi Germany as somehow keener on new technology
than we: better tanks, guided missiles, jet planes; forgetting
that we pushed the technology envelope far more in our Good War
than they.
<P>
<I>German Scientists</I> became Cold War slang because of what
science and technology meant to the then-new-isms. And then we
shivered over <I>Sputnik</I> because of the meaning Soviets invested
in war's technology.
<P>
Soviet and Nazi religionists used the sharpest badges of modernism
- high-tech weapons of war - to celebrate <I>[and make us believe
in]</I> the inevitability of their triumph: hence the new wave
panzers and hot Heinkel formations of a Riefenstahl newsreel,
or ICBMs grimly rumbling across Red Square became the totems of
new meaning publically, flamboyantly celebrated.
<P>
Hitler's and Stalin's cults were receptive to new war because
new war could be used to emotionally insinuate the conviction
that their vision, their belief systems, were about to be unconditionally
fulfilled.
<P>
We have come to see war in stark contrast. We permit ourselves
some modest, tame association of war's technologies with our own
belief that mastery of such technology shows a kind of natural
superiority, but then we go and drown this almost-celebration
with apologies in advance of its demonstration. And how we have
done this too in historical retrospect, stripping former celebrations
even from The Good War, <I>even on its 50th</I>. To us, war can
never again be a celebration. It is at best a profession.
<P>
Why does distinction between war matter? It matters because war
for us serves a very different purpose than war for them. This
is the heart of the difference between <I>status quo </I>war and
revolutionary war; and it is the heart of the difference that
matters much more than the visible things that seem to make war.
<P>
Revolutionary war is not defined by revolutionary weapons, just
as <I>status quo </I>war is not defined by <I>status quo</I> weapons.
The weapons of war, and the way war is made, are vehicles
for realizing what this war represents, and in fact, what it is:
<B> Revolutionary War is the celebration, the realization, of
identity</B>.
<P>
This was true for the Hitler cult especially. It is important
also for us to understand how we defeated revolutionary war then.
The US met revolutionary war - the celebratory war of the new
cult - head-on: with a messianic fervor of our own. We made of
world war a <I>crusade</I> [in Ike's words], and used the power
of American movies and American music to infuse our &quot;war
effort&quot; with a religiousity of passionate commitment and
fulfillment. The power of mass, religious mobilization can be
glimpsed in the thrill Americans felt when hearing of Hiroshima.
The Good War built up enough messianism to carry us through a
dreary and depressing Cold War, twenty years and more down the
road. All the way to Vietnam.
<P>
Revolutionary war as enacted by the Hitler cult is worth remembering
because it was done to us. Memory should give us something real
with which to approach the future. Remember that it is a messy,
even unsatisfactory example, <I>but it is an example we all know</I>.
It is <I>unsat</I> because the thing that is to be feared in our
future - from the new religions - will not resemble the Hitler
cult; but war will have the same, celebratory purpose. For the
new religions, war will be essential to their becoming. The very
experience of war is realization of the new: you create yourself
by destroying the stranger.
<P>
This is why it is important to recognize the religious dimension
of Nazi, Soviet,<I> [and American] </I>war. And if The Good War
gave the US its Cold War momentum, The Great Patriotic War did
even more for the Soviet regime. It became the treasured, made-sacred
experience of the Soviet state and its peoples. It may have been
the only shared element of meaning holding up the rotten Church
of Lenin in its last decades.
<P>
But we, like the old Soviets, finally lost the talisman of The
Good War. Vietnam destroyed it, and young generations have all
but forgotten it. A half century of Cold War slowly turned its
back on the very celebratory war that immediately preceded it:
The Good War. The American way of war changed, and those who made
it, changed. Part of this was blamed on the A-Bomb, but there
was more at work than that. Things military became tied to a social
order: its own caste studiously, even excruciatingly niched in
the larger hierarchy of those who ran the Cold War, and Cold War
American life.
<P>
There is no longer an American Way of War in a national, and certainly
not in a religious sense. War has become a toolbox owned by the
ruling establishment. For the American overclass, war today is
a reverse affirmation: of everything that can be lost. This is
classic <I>status quo </I>thinking, of course. War is something
<I><B>not</B></I> to be fought, but its tools are always to be
<I><B>used</B></I> in support of that same <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
But preserving the late-twentieth century American <I>status quo</I>
is far different than France or Britain preserving the mid-ninteenth
century status quo. The difference: Americans don't like imperial
wars. Therefore, the Washington ruling establishment must manage
by demonstration and awe. This means maintaining very high force
levels for world management purposes, even in the absence of a
major competitor. These forces must be constantly and bullishly
in play - OOTW - and yet still not used. This helps to explain
why any successful war activity is immediately, and loudly trumpeted
as an advertisement for the national security sub-culture (which
includes defense industry and other civilian constituencies) as
a whole. In the face of domestic disinterest, a world management
force must be sold to Americans on the basis of a carefully crafted
package that combines residual nostalgia for the Good War crusade
and a coded message about preserving American military superiority:
<P>
<ul><I>We must stay on top [in control] or we will lose.</I> </ul>
<P>
The unintended emphasis, strangely for the superpower, is on losing.
In order to get the current force levels it wants for management,
the ruling elite must insinuate the notion that any retreat from
these levels is an historic loss or retreat for the American nation.
And in order to send this message - <I>as untrue as it is </I>-
these same elites must strike a tone of pessimism, even defeatism.
<P>
This mental stance is the starkest contrast to the unbounded optimism
of the religionist bound for revolutionary war: <I>The future
belongs to me</I>.
<P>
<P>
<I><B>Why We Stay Stuck In Old Think</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Old Establishment Will Resist Big Change Everywhere</I>

</UL>

<P>
Defenders of the world <I>status quo</I>, the Cold War elite is
visibly hunkered down in its final <I>Plaine du Jarres</I> command
post. America's current national establishment was crowned in
crisis. Exigency equalled authority, so Cold War became the perpetual
crisis that demanded a perpetual imperial ruling class. And it
is a big, messy world out there. Even when the Big crisis - the
Cold War - died, there seemed so many out there to take its place.
Change was always out there, and always bad; which meant, always
good, for the elite.
<P>
But the onset of Big Change within the US is like &quot;The World
Turned Upside Down&quot; <I>[The denouement-tune Cornwallis let
play at Yorktown]. </I>Elites have no authority to defend against,
let alone even define, domestic change as a threat to national
security. It is simply a threat to their own security: the security
of their position.
<P>
It is an overclass in need of a rescuing world crisis - not a
<I>real</I> crisis, but an emotional situation that renews their
authority - that limits our imagination: our ability even to prepare
for the next <I>[real]</I> war. But this would not matter for
those charged with America's defense. Except for one thing. They
too are part, an indissoluable part, of that same elite. How did
this happen? With the coming of Cold War, the Brass moved into
their big building in the Imperial City complex. Theirs was the
point of the Free World spear, but they were also allowed into
The Mandarin Club as the American Empire's warrior-diplomats.
And most important: they gained real political influence in support
of a real political constituency - one-third of the Federal workforce!
They got sucked into Free World rule.
<P>
So responding to world change, and a world revolution that is
American-made, is channeled by Washington's <I>ancien regime</I>
into rigid, familiar paths, with the unconscious complicity of
America's military societies. The leading corps of these societies
see a dense and dangerous thicket for their people, but one they
must enter and none the less. And they seek, with all the nature
and honor embedded in their ethos, to bring everyone out on the
other side.
<P>
Their watch has marked the beginning of that dense and dangerous
peacetime. So they have taken to cut for themselves three characteristic
paths through the thicket: footpaths to the future. Call them
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Readiness, Reform, (r)evolution</I> 
</UL>

<P>
<CENTER><b>Readiness: </b></CENTER>
<P>
Readiness is a world view that believes in the robustness of control.
Things can be managed, and change can be held down, as long as
the we have the means. Readiness is the predominant peacetime
ethos of the Defense world.
<P>
One good opinion gives us the flavor of a true on-top, <I>status
quo</I> mind-set:
<P>
<blockquote>
The lessons and revelations ... of the Persian Gulf War victories
... mandate that a new style of warfare will be employed in future
elective wars. Technology offers the leverage that facilitates
the accomplishment of the new expectation imposed by the American
public. Our military can win decisively anywhere in the world.
It can defeat an adversary anywhere in world [sic!] in reasonable
amounts of time. The day of long drawn out warfare has past [sic!].
It can take battle to an enemy and with the proper technology
minimizes [sic!] our own casualties. It can destroy an enemy on
the battlefield while preserving, should it choose, the country,
national treasures and way of life of that enemy. [from a 1993
draft chapter, <I>Directed Battle, A Vision of the Future</I>]
</blockquote><P>
This quote was chosen because it represents, errors and all, an
authentic attitude rather than a massaged, politically disinfected,
nearly meaningless official statement.
<P>
Readiness defines the current enemy as the always-enemy, because
within its reasoning-loop, no big enemy could arise as long as
the superpower manages world conflict. &quot;Deterrence&quot;
migrates in this mind-set from a relationship designed to maintain
a permanent nuclear <I>status quo</I>, to a relationship where
vicious, but smaller regimes and bigger, but more benign regimes,
are both &quot;deterred&quot; from challenging a permanent American
world <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
The quote's emphasis on the Persian Gulf War as model is also
a feature of the predominant path. It implicitly freezes war by
codifying modern war as the last victorious engagement. This has
the benefit of freezing as well the institutions, relationships,
and force structure that fought that engagement. Modernity is
carefully contained within the realm of things that don't threaten
either institution, relationship, or force structure. So new technology
- and by extension, R&amp;D - is channelled into the development
of high-tech badges, refinements, or appliques to existing weapons'
phyla.
<P>
<CENTER><b>Reform:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Reform's urge follows cherished American tradition. American military
reform - to some extent mirroring contemporary reform movements
in American society - seeks to improve bureaucratic performance
by improving efficiency. Intrinsic to its goal is the demonizing
of corruption and inefficiency. The core belief is that efficiency
is the <I>desideratum</I>: the thing most wanted. Efficiency solves
peacetime problems. It allows us to fight future battles without
increasing today's budgets. It is progressive in the sense that
it brings military society in-sych with what is considered better
and more modern in the current American spirit of the age. Admiral
Owens thus belongs to the lineage of all American reform, and
symbolizes military society's harmony with all of American society,
just as Root or Sims brought their services in tune with the Progressive
spirit of their day.
<P>
But this path is more of a response to domestic change than it
is preparation for future war. And it creates its own cultural
backlash. The example this time is from a former Defense Official's
reform briefing. The chart is entitled &quot;Achieving a Common
Futures-Oriented Framework For Defense Decision-Makers.&quot;
[<I><B>Chart 1</B></I>] The chart correctly - even powerfully
- identifies one of the deepest elements of corruption in the
DOD: the swarm of interest groups whose competing needs must be
resolved before any policy or budget can be made. The chart shows
the thick alphabet soup that must be adjudicated before even <I>thinking</I>
about the future can happen. He was fired for trying to do something
about it.
<P>
But reform, far from simplifying and sorting out the mess, often
only adds to it. The Joint Staff should have replaced several
layers in the bureaucratic pastry, like the service secretariats.
Instead, it is now yet another layer. Unless reform is the central
agenda of the highest authority, executed ruthlessly from above,
and responding to a widespread sense of crisis, indeed, a public
outcry for change, it only succeeds in creating yet another internal
interest group to be fed.
<P>
So reform's fulfillment waits, often until peacetime's end, for
crisis to make it so.
<P>
<CENTER><b>(r)evolution:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Military &quot;revolutionaries&quot; within a peacetime status
quo elite tend to focus on new weapons. It was for true ninteenth
century French, it is true for the RMA guys today. Why?
<P>
For one thing, they can't even think about bucking the dominant
paradigm: preserving the <I>status quo</I>. They would quickly
be punished, or banished to the most terrible hell imaginable
for thinkers - obscurity - if they even suggested that military
change means deconstructing the old paradigm itself.
<P>
But then, even in obscurity, they could at least call themselves
<P>
(<B>R</B>)evolutionaries.
<P>
So focusing on weapons is politically safe. And if technology
change, which surely accompanies revolution, is big enough, <I>then
it actually looks like the technology change</I>. And the new
weapons it brings ... <I><B>are</B></I> the revolution.
<P>
A public example (because he now publishes openly) of this phenomena
is Andy Krepinevich's &quot;Funding Innovation: Low-Cost Operations
for Leveraging The Military Revolution:&quot;
<P>
<blockquote>
... in the 1920s, the U.S. military successfully laid the foundation
for success in the next great power competition by &quot;reinventing&quot;
itself in response to the geopolitical and military-technical
revolutions then under way. During the 1920s and 1930s, the military
services positioned themselves to engage in new and different
kinds of military operations - strategic aerial bombardment, amphibious
assault against stoutly defended positions and carrier-based air
strikes. And they did it on shoestring budgets. Denied the opportunity
to think &quot;richer&quot; about defense, the military services
thought &quot;smarter.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
He is right about one thing. They did think smarter. About stuff
that was already in play. There was no revolution during the 1920s
and 30s. The stuff that was introduced in the Great War just got
worked on. Airborne assault, armored maneuver, carrier task forces,
aerial bombardment, wolf packs - the whole repertoire of the second
war was rehearsed in the world's collective military mind after
the first; year after year, <I>for twenty years</I>. It was just
that some thought more efficiently than others.
<P>
But as real war, the second differed from the first merely in
embellishment and in efficiency. It was better theater. But there
had been no revolution.
<P>
Yet how advantageous to say that cruise missiles or stealth technology
or microprocessors have &quot;revolutionized&quot; war! Self-styled
(r)evolutionaries can appear to take on the Col. Blimps of the
readiness mind set, saying they're cutting R&amp;D and merely
building the forces of yesterday, <U><I>while in reality never
threatening either their position or their mindset. </I></U>
<P>
(r)evolutionaries are in this way much like reformers: they want
to make the current system better. To the reformer, corruption
translates into the sloth and obesity of the system. To the (r)evolutionary,
corruption translates into &quot;old think&quot; about fighting
war.
<P>
But the system, meaning the prevailing paradigm that encompasses
both the physical, the institutional, and the ideational aspects
of a war society: the system escapes all re-thinking.
<P>
<I>None of this presumes that those defending any of these three
paths to the future are moral invertebrates, corrupt of mind,
or alien to honor.</I> They are serious people, the finest we
have, whose thinking is leashed by a system that permits them
to address only part of a problem, to analyze these pieces in
strict mental compartments, and to assemble them at their peril.
And the system that controls thought is neither conscious nor
deliberate; but it is enfolding. It is a complete belief system,
the reality-defining component of culture itself.
<P>
So when the rhetorician asks
<P>
<I>But where is (<B>R</B>)evolution?</I> 
<P>
We must answer:
<br>
<I>It simply cannot exist.</I> 
<P>
[At any level ... until the larger revolution spends itself sweeping
our old way of life away.]
<P>
Here the French analogy, full circle, holds little historical
comfort. The French too, like us, had their military trajectories
of mind. They had their predominant path to the future, and it,
too, was <B>readiness</B>. They had their <I>jeune ecoles</I>,
fighting for <B>reform</B>, efficiency, purity of command and
operation. And they had <B>(r)evolutionaries</B>, engineers whose
visionary weapons promised to hold the key to future battle.
<P>
And none of the paths were wrong. An ethos of <B>Readiness</B>
made the French army the most combat-honed force on earth; an
ethos of <B>Reform</B> pushed France at last to respond to the
Prussian threat; and an ethos of <B>(r)evolution</B> gave the
<I>armee</I> of the <I>grande nation</I> the techiest tools of
war.
<P>
But as separate mental footpaths to the future, they would meet,
finally, only at the place of defeat. Reform bested readiness
too late; and the big army reforms that followed the shock of
Sadowa, and Austria's stunning defeat in 1866, only served to
throw the French army into confusion. It went into battle in 1870
not knowing itself.
<P>
And it could not possibly know itself in time, because it had
not taken the time to know war: how war was really changing, how
the new world was machining it, re-engineering it, so that it
became something new.
<P>
We have several steps to take before we can begin to know this.
The first is seeing the real change, and accepting the irony that
<I><B>we</B></I> are making the revolution that will transform
the world. The second step is connecting a transformation in life
to a metamorphosis of culture itself, and then of war, which is
culture's creature. The third step is confessing that, even though
we begin the revolution in life, that others - their red dreams
not yet imagined - will begin the revolution in war. Because war
will be both their celebration of birth and its <I>realization</I>.
<P>
But if these recognitions were all we needed to begin the road
to the next war, we would already be into the journey. But there
are other obstacles, the <I>anti-recognitions</I> of denial, that
are more intractable, that hold us in place like little trees
with long roots.
<P>
<ul>
There is our hallowed record of historical success: W<I>hy question
it?</I> 
<P>
So long since we met a real competitor: <I>Who is this upstart?</I>

<P>
The comforting feel of ongoing &quot;reform&quot;: <I>Been there.
Did that.</I> 
<P>
The power of our national myth: <I>We will always rise to crisis.</I>

<P>
The talisman of triumphant technology: <I>But we have the Death
Star!</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
So we await our Sedan. To dismiss this prospect, we must dismiss
the possibility of a future foe: an equal challenger with evil
intent. And to dismiss this possibility, we must dismiss the transformative
power of Big Change, and assert that we can keep control not only
of our world system, <I>but what happens to it</I>, forever.
<P>
But no one can do this.
<P>
So we await our Sedan.
<P>
This much is certain.
<P>
The only uncertainty is in its outcome.

<h2>Republican Dreaming</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
<P>
 Today, two zealous camps dominate public discourse over our future.
Techno-utopian Pollyanna's are busy proclaiming the unadorned
good of information technology while the neo-Luddites oppose the
same technological change.
<P>
 Between these two groups are the vast majority of Americans,
who do not quite understand all the hype over the Internet, know
that ATM machines are convenient, but do not want their jobs automated
away.  The message Americans are waiting to hear is that through
all the dislocation and turmoil caused by the coming of the Knowledge
Age are tremendous opportunities for better lives, and that the
ideas which made this nation great can still work in the future.
<P>
 This may explain the amazing number of Republicans one encounters
these days who have basically written off the 1996 Presidential
election, conceding a second term to a man who by almost all measures
does not merit one.  Clinton's poll numbers may be up and he threw
effective tactical roadblocks in the budget battle, but why this
sense of defeatism?
<P>
Republicans should be excited and full of anticipation at completing
what they began in 1994:  the destruction of the Democratic party
as the governing majority in American politics. To do deliver
a knock-out punch in 1996, Republicans need to offer as a challenger
to Bill Clinton a candidate who addresses Presidential - not Congressional
- issues.  Dick Lugar was exactly right when he said that all
the candidates for the GOP nomination want to balance the budget,
restore the 10th Amendment and overhaul the tax code.  The problem
is, these are <I>not</I> the issues with which to win the Presidency.
<P>
 What won Ronald Reagan the White House in 1980 was not his list
of top three public policy priorities (stronger defense, lower
taxes and balanced budget), but the sense that he could make America
stand tall again.  He offered the hope and optimism for a better
future to a nation suffering, as Carter put it, the malaise of
the 1970s.
<P>
 The leadership Americans want from the Presidency is one which
transcends the public policy debate and from a moral high ground
offers America a principled vision on how to build a better future.
 Many Republicans respond that they do have a national figure
offering just such leadership:  Newt Gingrich.  Yet Newt Gingrich
is Speaker, and although he amazingly used that office during
the past year to become, in essence, America's head of government,
his job is still necessarily partisan and deals primarily with
tactical public policy issues.  Only a President with the skills
and - Clinton's weakness - moral authority, can don the mantle
of Head of State, transcend partisan politics and lead the majority
of Americans.
<P>
 Republicans who say &quot;we just need to nominate someone who
won't stop the Revolution and let Newt continue to supply the
vision&quot; are handing Bill Clinton the election.  The Republicans'
dilemma is a Speaker who talks like a President and Presidential
candidates who talk like Congressmen. Only a candidate whose message
is of Presidential caliber stands a chance of beating Clinton
- and saying &quot;Newt's the leader of the Revolution and I'm
with him&quot; is not of that level.
<P>
 Lost last fall amongst all the uproar over Clinton's national
&quot;funk&quot; gaffe was a theme to which he returned in his
State of the Union address and that comes close being a full-fledged
vision.   In September he said that it is the President's job
to lead Americans through the &quot;tumult and upheaval&quot;
of the information-saturated 1990's.  In the seventh paragraph
of the State of Union - before he said the era of big government
is over - Clinton said:  &quot;We live in an age of possibility.
A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move
to an age of technology, information and global competition. 
These changes have opened vast new opportunities, but they also
present stiff challenges.&quot;  Alvin Toffler or Newt Gingrich
could not have said it better.
<P>
 Yet none of the candidates for 1996, including Clinton, are offering
a realistic vision of America in the Knowledge Age.  Through his
veneer Clinton is as obsessed with stagnating real wages as Bob
Dole is with the fact that it's &quot;his turn,&quot; as Phil
Gramm is with economics, as Dick Lugar is with nuclear terrorism,
and as Steve Forbes is with &quot;Voodoo II.&quot;
<P>
 All these messages fail to adequately address the disquiet Americans
feel about their nation's future in the Knowledge Age.  Does Windows
'95 herald an information driven renaissance, or are millions
of people going to be driven out of work by increased computerization?
 Pat Buchanan is the only GOP candidate remotely addressing these
issues; he is tapping into a true vein of anxiety among voters.
 Unfortunately, Buchanan is offering up neo-Luddite solutions
that are merely a reaction at being left behind as the future
arrives.
<P>
Americans aren't sure where their nation is headed, and are looking
for a Presidential candidate to honestly describe the nature of
our times.  The New Deal era provided us with a vision -- interstate
highways, television, moon landings -- that to a stunning degree
was realized.  Yet this success was bittersweet, because once
we achieved its promises, we had no replacement vision and consequently
lost our sense of direction.
<P>
 This calls for reinventing the American Dream for a new century,
which is tricky business. Irving Kristol recently identified one
reason:  &quot;America has come of age, the American dream has
been fulfilled to the degree that any dream ever is&quot;.  When
you've fulfilled your dreams, it is tempting to sit back and dream
no more.  The dream Kristol believes fulfilled -- and thus no
longer useful -- is one created for 20th century industrial America.
What we need now is a Dream for 21st century Knowledge-Age America.
<P>
 Currently none of the Presidential candidates is offering America
a new Dream. Democrats dream about high wages and universal health
insurance whereas Republicans dream of making a bundle. &quot;Necessities
or securities, but hardly the stuff of dreams,&quot; said <I>The
Nation</I>. The problem with both parties is that they are pecuniary.
<P>
 Yet, when all is said and done, Americans are Americans for reasons
larger than a dollar. Yes, we all want to be prosperous.  Yes,
we all want a less burdensome tax code.  But we hold other ends
in higher esteem.  Americans enjoy the sense of meaning that comes
from belonging to causes outside themselves, whether a revolution,
settling the frontier or racing to the moon.
<P>
 The great challenge for us today, something worthy of a Dream,
is to take all the new tools of the Knowledge Age and use them
to build a better society while minimizing the disruption and
dislocation these same tools will engender as we replace the ways
of the industrial world.
<P>
 It is this void which is driving the radical middle in American
politics.  Our nation is searching for a new Dream, for a new
goalpost toward which to strive.  Americans are looking for a
President who talks about more than just the public policy issues
of balanced budgets, states' rights and tax code reform.  Americans
want someone to show them that through all the confusion and seeming
chaos, the electronic frontier beckons us toward ever greater
freedom, creativity, individuality, community and progress.  If
the Republicans want to win the Presidency this year, their nominee
must, in addition to discussing the proper size and scope of government
in society, engage Americans in a discussion about the future
of their society itself.

<h3>COMPULSORY UNION DUES PAY FOR POLITICS </h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 1, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Democrat Ron Wyden's victory in the Oregon special election is sure to spark speculation about which party will win big this November, it also shows how the money of average Americans can be used against their wishes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After all, the AFL-CIO and other labor unions provided tremendous support for Wyden's candidacy. And all too often labor union officials rely on compulsory dues to finance political activism. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The pro-Wyden effort provides a glimpse at organized labor's plans for the 1996 elections. The AFL-CIO recently announced a plan to spend more than $35 million this year -- seven times the usual amount -- on electioneering. Unfortunately, many of these activities will be financed involuntarily by rank-and-file union members who may disagree with the agendas of union officials. Republican and Democratic unionists alike are compelled to pay dues to the labor officials; these dues are then used to pay for many political activities.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Congress may soon debate campaign finance reform legislation. Ending this unjust abuse of hard-working men and women should be a part of any true reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the past few months, a sleeping giant awoke when the AFL-CIO elected a new  leadership dedicated to advancing a far-left political agenda.  When John Sweeney took over the union's leadership late last year he pledged greater political involvement by the organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After his installation as AFL-CIO president, Sweeney swiftly moved to put a new face in charge of election activities by naming former Clinton administration Labor Department official Steve Rosenthal as the union's political director. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich declared, "Steve Rosenthal will be a valuable asset in the new leadership's mission to revitalize the nation's union movement." Sweeney said Rosenthal's task would be "building a powerful, progressive national movement of working people."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The just-completed special election in Oregon to fill the seat of former Sen. Robert Packwood provided the new leaders a chance to flex their partisan muscles. According to AFL-CIO documents, there were more than 25 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) devoted full-time to the efforts to elect a Democratic senator. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Political director Rosenthal bragged, "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to an estimated 40,000." The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces with at least 11 other unions, organized labor was able to mount a considerable presence in this one race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Letter Carriers, and the Teamsters. The considerable firepower these organizations mustered resulted in more than $183,000 in political action committee (PAC) donations to the democratic candidate. Not a single dollar of union donations went to the GOP nominee. Are all union members Democrats? We doubt it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, these direct donations were only a small part of the picture. No doubt many of the organizers, mailings and phone banks were financed directly by the unions at substantially more than the cost of the PAC donations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics came under scrutiny by the media and the voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for ads they ran blaming the death of a teenage worker on the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it off the air. Fair-minded union members of either party could strongly object to such tactics. Yet, their dues more than likely paid for them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politicking is nothing new. There is no question that labor unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. But as the clamor for campaign finance reform continues, it behooves members of Congress to consider whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities whether they agree with those activities or not. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate support and neither should their organized labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions are used for politics.  Aggressive political activities by labor unions must not be funded by coercion. Congress should end these corrupt practices.

<h2>
In Civilized Society, Shame Has Place
</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 26, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 

<p>
A few months ago, Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn. ), Sam Nunn (D-Ga. ) and I began a campaign to focus public scrutiny on certain daytime television talk shows and their sponsors. The objects of our criticism are not close calls. They are shows that typically cross way over the line. We have described their content as cultural rot. How else could one describe shows whose typical subjects include a 17-year-old girl boasting of having slept with more than 100 men, a 13-year-old talking about sexual experiences that began when she was 10 and "Women Who Marry Their Rapists."
<p>
A number of commentators have defended these talk shows for "reflecting reality," arguing that our campaign won't succeed and that sponsors are within their "rights" to advertise on their programs. It is useful, then, to explain what we are attempting to do and what we are not.
<p>
First, our campaign is not about rights. We are not trying to curb-free speech. I am a virtual absolutist on the 1st Amendment and we have been emphatic about not arguing for censorship. Nor is our goal to remove every last vestige of garbage from our social landscape; this is impossible in a free society.
<p>
But we are asking talk show hosts and advertisers to reconsider their support of some of this daytime television fare. If they continue their support, we are asking that they be able to justify publicly what they are doing, which is to "mainstream" trashy behavior.
<p>
Almost every society has its red-light districts. That is part of reality, and we all understand that. A free society can tolerate such districts. But society should also do what it can to discourage them and contain them. And so, too, with the popular culture version of red-light districts. They ought to remain on the periphery, away from Main Street, our living rooms, our schoolyards.
<p>
Recent postgame interviews with athletes help illustrate a similar point: NFL players feel free to curse on the field and in the locker room. Not many people object to that. But it is nonetheless true that what you have a right to do is not always right to do. And it is wrong for people, even athletes, to curse on camera for national television.
<p>
The aim of our campaign is to use nongovernmental means to make the case that such cultural trash should be less pervasive. We believe that a sense of shame still exists in the highest reaches of corporate America and in the entertainment industry. We believe, too, that progress can be made, through moral suasion, not government intervention. And we intend to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural guardrails, certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and consensus.
<p>
All of this requires that we make normative judgments. Of course, some people balk at any attempt to do this, even as they balk at any effort to declare some things worthy and some things unworthy of human consumption. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he wrote in his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" that something that uplifts human personality is just and some thing that degrades human personality is unjust.
<p>
Instead of simply lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need to do something about it. After all, we are witnessing the pollution of the human environment. Cleaning out our cultural air ducts won't happen by itself; it requires concerted effort and specific action. Five years ago, our effort would not have resonated nearly so much with the public. But we have hit a cultural nerve. What we are seeing, here and elsewhere, is the shock of recognition that in too many places, not just in back alleys but in the main thoroughfares, America has been cheapened. We, the American people, have allowed this desecration to occur. It is past time that we do something about it.

<h2>Shut the Criminals' Revolving Door</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 16, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 
<i>Influenced by those opposed to punishment, government has failed to keep citizens safe from known repeat violent offenders.</i><P>

<P>
During the past 25 years, much of the crime debate has been dominated by criminologists who are philosophically opposed to punishment. In an attempt to advance their agenda, they have perpetrated a wide array of myths. The recently released report of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America is an attempt to provide an alternative: a rigorous, empirical, real-world analysis of the current state of crime and punishment.

The report tells us that the nation faces at least three distinct but related crime challenges: preventing at-risk children from becoming criminals, protecting innocent people from becoming crime victims and restraining convicted criminals who are under the "supervision" of the criminal justice system (on probation, parole or pretrial release) from committing additional crimes.
<P>
<b>Prevention.</b> We know that children born into poor families-- matter their race, region, religion, demographic stripe or socioeconomic status-- they have decent families and grow up with responsible, caring adults in their lives, are far less likely to become either victims or victimizers. We also know that not all children are born so lucky.
<P>
America is now home to nearly 70 million children 18 or under. As many as 15 million of them are growing up in relative poverty, often in places where the institutions of civil society--families, churches, schools, voluntary associations--are in near-complete collapse. The report argues that neither more spending by government nor the mere withdrawal of government can prevent today's at-risk 4- to 7-year-old boys from becoming next decade's 14- to 17-year-old predatory street felons or the next century's first big class of adult career criminals. The key to prevention is moral education. That, in turn, depends on reviving the character-forming institutions of civil society. But we know that there is no easy way to accomplish that.
<P>
<b>Protection.</b> The recent widely reported drops in serious crime in New York, Houston and other cities were due largely to innovative community policing strategies, citizen anti-crime initiatives and continued "target-hardening" or increased security and personal safety measures by individuals and businesses. But these drops in crime may be merely a lull. The storm is gathering in the form of a demographic bulge of highly crime-prone boys. During the next 10 years, enormous upward pressure will be exerted on crime rates. Redoubling crime protection efforts will not keep the storm offshore. But it can help to minimize the damage and reduce the human and financial cost.
<P>
<b>Restraint.</b> The criminal justice system imprisons only one criminal per 100 violent crimes. Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before being released. In 1993, there were 43.6 million criminal victimizations in America, more than 10 million of them violent. Between 1985 and 1993, the rate at which boys 14 through 17 committed murder increased by about 50% for whites and 300% for blacks. A third of all violent crimes, including murders, are committed by felons out on probation, parole or pretrial release. What is involved here is more than a failure of public safety; it is a massive failure of governmental obligation. Citizens should not have to accept their government's prolonged, persistent failure to restrain violent and repeat criminals. A government incapable of restraining known, violent, repeat criminals within its custody cannot be trusted to take on more complicated and costly public functions.
<p>
There is also the matter of eroding public trust in our political institutions. A government that, amid much fanfare, passes wave after wave of get-tough anti-crime laws but proves toothless in the execution of those laws eviscerates pubic confidence in the integrity of lawmakers and the criminal justice system. Indeed, in 1993 and again in 1994, there was only one public institution in which the American people had less confidence than in Congress: the criminal justice system. No representative democracy can long survive this deep and disheartening lack of public trust. And the only way to restore public trust is to shut the revolving door.
<p>
A final point: A society tells as much about itself by what it punishes as what it praises, by what it condemns as well as what it encourages, by what receives reprobation as what receives approbation. The message of our justice system is all too clear to criminals and victims: Too often, for too many, it says "nobody cares" and "nothing matters." That has to change soon or the carnage and violence that have become almost permanent features of America's landscape will worsen.

the great railroad job</FONT></CENTER><P>When Bill Clinton says he &quot;feels
your pain,&quot; he means it. He wants to spread the pain around so that he can
feel everybody's.<P>Last week he made a good start.<P>You could ask Billy Dale.
You could ask David Kendall, his lawyer for financial felonies, now in the toils
of a grand jury himself. You could ask Bob Bennett, his lawyer for bimbo
misdemeanors. You could ask Mike McCurry, his press agent.<P>You could even ask
Hillary, but she's still taking pills for her amnesia.<P>Mr. Dale is entitled to
laugh last, if he feels like laughing through his pain. Never has a railroad job
failed so deliciously.<P>Mr. Dale is going to get back a lot of the money he was
forced to borrow to pay for the lawyers to help him defend himself against
Hillary's false witness. (Miss Hillary, who wants us to believe that she went to
Sunday school between the beatings she got at the hands of the roving gangs of
5-year-olds then terrorizing her Republican neighborhood, might spend a few hours
between grand jury appearances to reflect on what the Bible says about bearing
false witness. She could start with the 20th chapter of the Book of Exodus and
look in on Proverbs 19:05 and 21:28.)<P>Mike McCurry is not laughing, but neither
is Bob Bennett. Mr. Bennett was assigned by the president to get on TV to trash
Billy Dale, to ruin his reputation in retaliation for his having humiliated the
Clintons in court, and in his zest for the assignment poor Uncle Bob revealed
himself to be not only a great pleader - he's a member of that mighty fraternity
of Blackstones whom the innocent cannot afford - but almost as factually
challenged as his famous client.<P>He said, OK, Mr. Dale might have beaten the
rap, but it was not a knockout, only a TKO: Mr. Dale had offered to plead guilty
to embezzlement in return for a four-month prison sentence. This was great
breakfast theater, suggesting that just because Billy Dale was not a felon that
didn't mean he wasn't a bum. But it wasn't so. He never agreed to say he had done
something he hadn't. When he was called on it, Mr. Bennett was revealed to have
gotten his facts, such as they were, all wrong. (He also violated the confidence
that parties to plea-negotiating have a right to expect, if the ethics committee -
please do not laugh - of the bar association is listening.) What also was not
clear was why anyone would believe anything any mouthpiece, $500 an hour or not,
would say in such a situation. A lawyer's declamation in defense of his client is
about as useful as calling your mother as a character witness.<P>At the next press
briefing, a reporter started to ask Mike McCurry a perfectly reasonable question
about Uncle Bob and Billy Dale, but before the reporter could get to his question,
Mr. McCurry cut him off: &quot;People have said some things and, frankly, the
president finds some statements that have been made objectionable. I am referring
specifically to comments on plea bargaining. ... We didn't put Bennett out to say
anything bad about Billy Dale, that's the bottom line. We made it pretty clear
after that happened that we didn't appreciate that type of
commentary.&quot;<P>Nothing ambiguous about who and what Mike was talking about.
Bob Bennett read it that way, too, and he used up a pocketful of a luckless
client's quarters calling the White House until he finally got to the president,
who felt his pain at once. The president told him that he had done &quot;a great
job&quot; on Billy Dale.<P>By the end of the next day, Mike was feeling pain. He
was sent out to retract all the honorable stuff he had said about Mr. Bennett's
treatment of Billy Dale. &quot;It is not objectionable for the president's
attorney to defend the president once he is under attack during some of these
television talk-show programs. ... And it is not objectionable for Mr. Bennett
simply to repeat something that has been published. ... There was a notion ...
that the White House has a campaign out there to tar and feather Billy Dale. I'm
satisfied that's not true. I'm satisfied that the president would find that
objectionable if that were true.&quot;<P>This is now all so familiar. Depending on
who Mr. Clinton was talking to, he thought that (a) Bob Bennett had done &quot;a
great job&quot; trashing Billy Dale; (b) Mike McCurry had done &quot;a great
job&quot; telling Bob Bennett what a jerk he was for trashing Billy Dale; and (c)
Billy Dale had done &quot;a great job,&quot; too.<P>Attorney General Janet Reno
also did &quot;a great job,&quot; putting out a Justice Department report saying
that the White House did not pressure the FBI to investigate the travel-office
employees. This has infuriated some people at the FBI who understand that the only
people who did &quot;a great job&quot; were the railroad men: The director of the
FBI works for Janet Reno, who works for President Clinton, who works for the first
lady.<P>The job Hillary did, however, was not so great.<P>Copyright &#169 1996,

</CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I><P>&quot;Character is the most effective means of
persuasion.&quot;<BR>-- Aristotle's
&quot;Rhetoric.&quot;</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No one studies rhetoric for the sake
of rhetoric any more. It's a politically incorrect discipline better left to those
funny men in togas in ancient Athens.<P>So why shouldn't Bill Clinton's State of
the Union speech and Bob Dole's response lack rhetorical flights of inspiration
and persuasion?<P>Most of the pop commentators gave Bill Clinton the usual edge,
but Bob Dole's remarks - not the unaccountably awkward delivery - actually had
more to say to the collective consciousness of a nation that is just now beginning
to listen to the men who want to be president in 1996.<P>Bob Dole was more clearly
focused, sharper with the points of criticism of Mr. Clinton's failed liberal
policies after the president had recited his new conservative agenda. But he
talked too fast from an empty room. He should have insisted on speaking from a
school or a courthouse in a small town in Kansas, or even Iowa or New Hampshire.
The contrast with the pomp and bombast of Washington would have been
exquisite.<P>We can take Aristotle's word for it. &quot;Persuasion,&quot; he wrote
2,500 years ago, &quot;is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the
speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. His character may almost be
called the most effective means of persuasion.&quot;<P>Bill Clinton lacks that
most effective means of persuasion, credibility and character. He's the
quick-change artist, constantly challenging himself on the tight rope. He knows
how to talk the talk of conservatives when he's in the campaign mode, how to walk
the walk with veto pen in hand when he's with his fellow liberals.<P>Now in the
campaign mode, the president echoes Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and his merry band
of followers in the House, as well as Bob Dole, and his considerably less-merry
campers in the Senate. The president now seeks a welfare program that supports
families, unlike the present one which undermines families (and a lot like the one
he vetoed last month). He calls for smaller government, accepting the voters'
message in the 1994 elections, but thwarts attempts to cut the government we've
got down to size.<P>He pleads with the pop culture creators to produce movies,
television shows and CDs that &quot;you would want your own children and
grandchildren to enjoy.&quot; He could tell that to his Hollywood cronies, since
they're the ones who produce many of the very shows he affects to criticize.
They're also the ones who have contributed a significant portion of his $30
million campaign chest, and pols rarely want to offend big contributors. He
affected graciousness to Bob Dole, drawing attention to his service in World War
II, which also drew attention to Mr. Dole's age, like Mark Antony affecting praise
of Brutus at Caesar's funeral.<P>And Bob Dole is, as we all know, an honorable
man. He had the better lines but he didn't deliver them well. He hadn't quite
mastered the teleprompter and demonstrated a need for lessons in emphasis. By far
the most powerful sentence in his whole speech fused rhythm, thought and
conviction: &quot;Every political movement, and every public official, must locate
a place in his heart where compromise ends, a core of conviction where we keep our
conscience.&quot;<P>He tossed that sentence to the right wing of his party to let
them know he is more than the Washington deal-cutter, reinforcing the larger theme
that he intends to mock Bill Clinton on the issues of character and an authentic
political point of view.<P>The senator must find a way to turn wisdom, experience
and age to his advantage. It won't be easy. A young TV comedienne says Bob Dole
reminds her of her father, and why on earth would she vote for him. (But why would
she want to vote for her bumpkin uncle?) Bob Dole's not the kind of guy whose
briefs or boxers fascinate the MTV generation.<P>Despite his age, Bob Dole was hip
enough last month to board a flashy MTV bus in New Hampshire for a taped political
interview. He also talked to members at the Alpha Delta fraternity at Dartmouth
College, which was the model for the movie &quot;Animal House.&quot; He competed
with James Brown's shouting from boom boxes, amiably recalling his college days at
the University of Kansas, where pranksters at Kappa Sigma fraternity once carried
a brother's motorcycle to the third floor of the frat house.<P>&quot;Every
generation has its own set of problems, its own temptations,&quot; Mr. Dole told
them. &quot;We're not an old America, we're not a young America. We're one
America.&quot;<P>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is

<title>Gary Bauer's February, 1996 Letter</title>
<body>
<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>
<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>
February 7, 1996
<p>
Dear Friend:
<p>
Hillary Rodham Clinton has written a new book.  It isn't supposed
to be about herself, but in one disturbing sense it is a biography.
Mrs. Clinton's book -- <i>It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children
Teach Us</i> -- attempts to write the biography of the next generation
of America's children.  I disagree with her message, and I want
to tell you why.
<p>
The book's title comes from an African proverb, &quot;It takes
a village to raise a child.&quot;  An article about the book in
<I>Newsweek</I> magazine helps make the proverb's meaning perfectly
clear.  One of  Mrs. Clinton's favorite expressions, the article
says, is, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
After reading just a few chapters of <I>It Takes a Village</I>,
it becomes obvious that what she means by &quot;village&quot;
is really <b>more</b> Big Government.  What she means by &quot;family
values&quot; is the mush that's left over after the time-honored
traditions of men and women of faith have been driven from the
public square.
<p>
I believe that our problem today is that too many parents are
looking to the so-called village to care for their children, instead
of meeting this precious responsibility themselves.  Many other
parents are struggling to meet this responsibility themselves,
but they are overwhelmed by crushing taxes, stagnating incomes,
the relentless encroachment on parental rights by government,
and the destruction of values by an amoral culture.  From Calvin
Klein ads to the studios of Hollywood, there is indeed a &quot;village&quot;
seeking to raise our children -- a Greenwich Village of sexual license
and crass materialism.  I don't want my children raised this way,
and I am confident you don't want it for your children or grandchildren
either.
<p>
Kay Coles James, a former Vice President at the Family Research
Council, knows this African proverb well.  Kay, a black American who was 
born in the slums of Portsmouth, Virginia, has risen to prominence
in our national political life.  She has written how Mrs. Clinton's
slogan has made the rounds and how deeply wrong it is:
<p><blockquote>
<i>It is really quite simple, we are told, if only we would cede parental 
control to the village, all would be well.  Children would no longer grow 
up insecure or worried; they would be well-adjusted, well-developed,
and full of healthy self-esteem.  What a wonderful world it would be .
. . .</i>
<p>
<i>But the village cannot raise a child.  Children don't belong to the 
community. Children belong to the parents who tuck them in at
night, wipe away their tears, feed them their meals, and answer their 
questions. If the past thirty years have taught us anything, it is that 
stable, intact, two-parent families are the foundation of a healthy 
village.</i>[1]
</blockquote><p>
Kay is right.  The village <b>cannot</b> raise a child.  Increasingly,
the &quot;village&quot; is taking our children away from us.  And as I told you 
last month, that is why I have written a new book of my own, <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams:  A Vision for America</I>. Like Mrs. Clinton's, my book is about 
families and children -- but there the similarity ends.
<p>
In fact, it would be difficult to imagine two books more diametrically
opposed on the major issues facing our families and our nation.  Mrs. 
Clinton writes with admiration of Western Europe's &quot;openness about 
sexuality&quot;[2] and wishes we were similarly enlightened.  <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams</I> ponders how our sex-saturated society can restore the virtues 
of fidelity and chastity. (I wonder if Mrs. Clinton has watched any cable t.v. 
lately or checked the tabloids as she walked through a grocery check-out lane?)
<I>It Takes a Village</I> deplores abortions <b>only</b> if they
are &quot;unsafe&quot;[3] and argues that the &quot;village&quot;
should promote contraception to young people to &quot;help them
deal responsibly with the consequences of their actions.&quot;[4]
My book questions the future for a nation that has abandoned
the sanctity of human life and lost the meaning of holy matrimony.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, <I>Newsweek</I> says, champions a government
&quot;program for every problem&quot;[5] and accuses conservatives
of opposing Big Government because we desire &quot;to advance
narrow religious, political and economic agendas.&quot;[6] My book
yearns for a rebirth of family and community that restores the
federal government to its limited constitutional role.  Mrs. Clinton
believes that &quot;everyone should wait until the age of 21 before
having sex.&quot;[7] Not only should sex be within the bonds of
marriage, but I believe that the virtue of an action does not
depend on one's age.
<p>
Hillary Clinton believes that out-of-home child care is controversial
because, she says, &quot;Americans have never sufficiently valued
the work of caring for children&quot; and have long been ambivalent
&quot;about whether surrogate child care is acceptable.&quot;[8]
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> argues, instead, that America's
families place the highest value on caring for children.  Families
have told pollsters time and again that they not only favor parental
care of children, but also want public policies that support that
choice.
<p>
The first lady's book is receiving tremendous attention in the
national liberal media.  She has also been interviewed by the
major news magazines.  The best-seller lists will no doubt track
her book's sales with enthusiasm.  As you know, however, those
lists completely ignore books like mine which come from Christian
publishers such as Focus on the Family.  The media will try to
ignore our pro-family message, too.  In some ways the outcome
of the family policy debate in 1996 will be determined by whether
more Americans support Hillary Clinton's message of Big Government
and liberal values or whether they accept and embrace the message
of renewal and faith contained in <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>.
With your help, we can win this first &quot;debate&quot; of 1996
by making sure <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> reaches as many Americans
as possible.  I hope you will choose to read this pocket-size
paperback and then help distribute it to your friends, neighbors,
co-workers, sunday school class and anyone else interested in
America's future.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, however, is not the only public figure tossing
around adjectives like &quot;extreme&quot; these days.  If you've
watched the long-running budget battle between the Congress and the 
White House, you've heard some of the nastiest descriptions ever
applied to elected legislators by the sitting president and his
staff.  Specifically, they've described the congressional freshman
class as everything from &quot;the far right&quot; to &quot;inflexible
extremists.&quot;
<p>
Listening to the president, you would think that these first-term
legislators hate the elderly, intend to starve the poor, abandon
children, trash the environment, and close schoolhouse doors.
The budget deadlock that gripped this city was even blamed on
these newcomers.  Last  March, I wrote to you that these very
same members of Congress &quot;bring to Washington a spirit of
service that is truly rare.&quot;  In the aftermath of the recent
government shutdown, has my opinion changed?
<p>
Not at all!  If anything, I hold the congressional freshman class
in even higher regard now than I did a year ago.  The reason is simple: 
they have kept their word. The vast majority of these members came to 
Washington as citizen-legislators. That is, they did not see themselves 
as part of a permanent governing class. They supported term limits. They 
promised to rein in runaway government.  They promised to cut taxes
on families with children.  They pledged to balance the budget
and eliminate useless bureaucracies.
<p>
I have often prayed with these deeply faithful new members, and
I wince as I see them daily attacked in the liberal press.  The
media have been an echo chamber for the White House, unfairly
charging the freshmen with denying funds for everything from Meals
on Wheels to school lunch programs.  Medicare is the primary example.
Throughout the budget battle, Bill Clinton accused these men
and women of seeking &quot;to strip our government and our country&quot;[9]
of its rightful role.  Clinton huffed that the Congress has held
some 40+ hearings on the Whitewater scandal, but only one on the
Medicare bill he was asked to sign.
<p>
Actually, Congress held over 50 hearings on Medicare, but
Bill Clinton &quot;counted&quot; only the one hearing
held on the actual bill.  Where was our adversary press on this
one?  Furthermore, Medicare spending under the GOP seven-year
balanced budget plan will increase by 89%.  Per-person spending
will also increase from just over $4,800 per year now to over
$7,000 in the year 2002.  To keep Medicare from going bankrupt,
seniors would pay an additional $7 per month, an &quot;increase&quot;
that happens only because the GOP plan keeps the beneficiaries'
share of the premium right where it is now at 31.5%.  The President's
alternative was to shift more of the costs of the program to taxpayers
who do not receive any of the benefits.  Moreover, the House-backed
plan provided the elderly with a new freedom, medical savings
accounts, to help them take charge of their own coverage and avoid
the threat of rationing posed by the Clintons' health reform model.
<p>
Watching the president's January press conference, this thought
occurred to me, too.  He pointed out that he has halved the budget
deficit in three years.  That's true -- even if you believe, as I
do, that the administration's policies are not the primary cause
of the decline.   Much of the additional revenue necessary to
reduce the deficit came as a result of Clinton's tax increase,
$280 billion over five years[10], the largest in our nation's history!
My question is this:  If Bill Clinton could cut the deficit in
half in three years, how can it be &quot;extremist&quot; for congressmen
to advocate wiping out the <i>other</i> half of the deficit in
seven years?
<p>
Let me share with you just a few of the House conservatives'
other extraordinary accomplishments for the family:
<p><ul>
<li>Passed a $500 per child tax credit for all families with
dependent children under the age of 18.  Insisted on the full amount
of this credit in tough negotiations with the Senate, and held their
ground during the federal shutdown when Clinton vetoed the budget bill.
<p>
<li>Passed a $5,000 credit for adoption expenses to facilitate
the placement of children in permanent homes.
<p>
<li>Restored the ability of the states to deny taxpayer funds
for abortions; denied federal funds for human embryo research;
adopted language to deny foreign aid funds to agencies like International
Planned Parenthood that promote and perform abortion overseas;
protected the accreditation of teaching hospitals that refuse
to participate in abortion training; restored the ban on use of
taxpayer funds to subsidize abortions under federal employee health plans; 
reimposed limits, lifted in 1993 by President Clinton, on the performance of 
abortions in U.S. military hospitals; passed a ban on partial-birth abortions. 
The first four items have been bottled up in the Senate, but none of these 
actions would have been possible without the pro-life members added to the House 
in 1994.
<p>
<li>Passed the first major welfare reform in a generation, designed to curb 
illegitimacy, encourage work and discourage the formation of single-parent 
households headed by teenagers.
<p>
<li>Forced a sharp reduction in funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts, leading to its elimination in two years, thereby putting
out of business this elitist agency that has been unable to distinguish art
from obscenity.
</ul><p>
In the coming year, these members are likely to endure even more
media abuse as they strive to deliver on their promises to protect
religious liberty and parental rights.  Rep. Steve Largent's (R-Okla.) 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act and religious liberty protections 
championed by Reps. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will 
be FRC priorities in 1996.  These are just some of the many ideas
we advocate to ensure that when it comes to our children, Mom
and Dad are village chiefs!
<p>
In closing, let me thank you for the support you have provided
to FRC during the past year.  Your encouragement and financial
gifts will keep us fighting hard for the values we share.  <b>I
hope you'll take a moment to review the enclosed reply card and
that you will choose to help us distribute <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
to every American home.  Also, please ask your local Christian
Book Store to carry this important book.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,
<p><br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President
<p>
P.S.  I am thankful for your faithful friendship and support.
My family joins me in praying that God will richly bless you
and yours during this tumultuous time.

<h3>Remember the Victims of Communism</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

January 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	In America we have memorials commemorating those who died in the Civil War, both 
World Wars, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, the holocaust, and the civil rights movement.  But 
we have no memorial to the 100 million casualties of the most brutal genocide ever visited upon 
the human race:  communism.
<p>	Fortunately, this glaring oversight is about to be rectified.  In 1993 -- more than 75 years 
after the Bolsheviks first embarked on their glorious revolution -- Congress approved and 
President Clinton signed legislation authorizing a memorial to the victims of communism.
<p>	It's long overdue.  In all of world history, no political ideology has sent more people to 
the slaughterhouse than Karl Marx's utopian pipe-dream.  Even Hitler, certainly one of history's 
most demented butchers, killed only one-tenth the number of people that Marx's disciples killed. 
Yet, most Americans have no idea just how bloody communism's legacy is. 
<P>	How many Americans, for example, know that between 1917 and 1987 the communist 
dictators in the former Soviet Union murdered 62 million people? How many know that China, 
has killed more than 38 million people?  These two communist regimes alone have stamped out 
100 million human lives -- 25 million more than died in the Black Plague, formerly the world's 
deadliest disaster.
<p>	And this doesn't even include the body count from the smaller communist regimes:  
Cambodia, 2 million dead at the hands of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge; Vietnam, 850,000 sacrificed 
to the greater glory of Ho Chi Minh; Ethiopia, tens of thousands slaughtered during Mengistu 
Haile Mariam's "Red Terror"; and Cuba, whose death toll, while certainly in the tens of 
thousands, only Fidel Castro knows for sure. 
<p>	As much as some would like to downplay the horrors of communism (frequently because 
they viewed the United States as a threat to mankind equal to the regimes committing these 
horrors), communism's signature has never changed: death.
<p>	Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it, the philosopher George Santayana 
said.  That's why a memorial to the victims of communism in the nation's capital is necessary 
and proper.  
<p>	Future generations must know that when you impose a ruthless ideology by force -- no 
matter how "well-intentioned" -- the result is human carnage.  So it is with a deep sense of honor 
that I've accepted an invitation to serve on the memorial's advisory board.  
<P>	Fittingly, the memorial also will celebrate those heroes who made possible the West's 
victory over tyranny. As observed by my colleague and long-time Cold Warrior Hugh Newton -- 
to whom credit goes for the idea of an anti-communist Hall of Heroes -- without the likes of 
Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Lech Walesa and Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn, among others, we'd still be worried about trading missiles with Russia, rather than 
trading goods.
<p>	As befits a memorial to the victims of government-sponsored violence, the project will be 
funded entirely with private money.  The goal is to raise $100 million -- one dollar for each of 
the 100 million victims of Marx and Mao.  
<p>	In addition to a roll call of every victim of communism that can be identified and the Hall 
of Heroes, the memorial also will feature a Hall of Infamy -- artifacts of communism's 
inhumanity to man, including a section of the Berlin Wall, a re-creation of a barracks from the 
Soviet Gulag, a "room" at the Hanoi Hilton and a cell at Castro's infamous Isle of Pines.
<p>	If you would like to join many of us and contribute to the creation of this memorial, I 
encourage you to do so.  Just write to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, P.O. 
Box 1997, Washington, DC 20013-1997.  Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao will never be forgotten, 
and neither should their victims.

<h3>Chic Prejudice</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	Each year in homes across America anxious parents and high school students undergo the 
familiar ritual of trying to decide which college or university to attend. In recent years, several 
widely-respected national magazines have helped spawn a small cottage industry that rates the 
best of the nation's institutions of higher learning.
<P>	One of the most widely-read of these surveys is the one compiled by the <i>U.S. News & 
World Report</i>. Another is a survey offered by <i>Money Magazine</i>. While <i>U.S. 
News</i> offers what I think is a rather objective analysis, the same cannot be said for 
<i>Money Magazine</i>'s recently published 9th annual college survey. 
<p>	I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to find explicit anti-religious bias in the Money survey. 
 After all, the magazine is owned by Time Warner, Inc., whose corporate leaders take a long time 
to learn why they shouldn't publish murderous song lyrics by hoodlum "artists." And the U.S. 
media in general have been under fire for years for religious bias they apparently consider 
permissible, even chic.
<p>	But I was outraged when I heard <i>Money</i>'s response to a complaint from Thomas 
J. Savage, president of Jesuit-run Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo., which was 
purposefully excluded from the 1996 <i>Money</i> survey, having been included in 1995. As 
Jillian Kasky, <i>Money</i>'s associate editor for statistics, wrote back to Savage: "We exclude 
colleges whose primary purpose is to turn out members of the clergy, colleges that require an 
affirmation of faith from students, colleges where the curriculum or extracurricular activities 
significantly reflect the ideology of a specific faith, and colleges where religious study of any 
nature is a significant academic requirement."
<p>	On its face, this is a perplexing standard. Why should a college -- any college -- that 
seeks to produce people of high moral character and fortified personal religious beliefs be  left 
out of such an important survey? How is it that other Catholic schools such as Georgetown 
University -- also run by the Jesuits -- and the University of Notre Dame made the survey while 
Rockhurst and other lesser-known schools did not? 
<p>	This begins to look like prejudice of the worst kind: the kind that falsely bows and 
scrapes before the high and mighty while sticking it to the little guy. 
<p>	Such prejudice is also ignorant, both of the place of religion in education and of its 
history in the United States. After all, all education used to be religious education -- run by 
clergy, the most highly educated class in any Western society. Many of America's best-known 
colleges, Harvard University among them, began with the sole purpose of educating men for the 
clergy. None of this was seen as inconsistent with the highest intellectual standards. Why? 
Because it wasn't. 
<P>	A fact unknown in the chic salons of Time Warner and the high and mighty media 
newsrooms is that today many scientists see a lot more room for belief in a Creator -- as a result 
of 20th-century discoveries in quantum physics, astrophysics, molecular biology and many other 
disciplines -- than did their 19th-century counterparts.  As Henry Margenau, retired Yale 
professor of  physics and natural philosophy and a colleague of Albert Einstein, told a friend of 
mine a few years ago, "High school science teachers, Carl Sagan, people like that -- they still 
carry around the old bias against religion. But to the real scientists -- the ones making the 
discoveries -- religion no longer poses a problem for them."  
<p>	There are still a few parents and students in this country who choose a college for reasons 
other than its proximity to pubs, beaches, malls or nightclubs. With the frightening decline in 
standards, values and civility ripping at America's moral and social fabric, colleges that offer 
students moral, as well as practical instruction still rank high on many families' lists.
<p>
	Too bad they don't even show up on <i>Money Magazine</i>'s list.

<TITLE>Broadcast Spectrum: Putting Principles First -- PFF
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<i>January 31, 1996</i><P>
<h2>Broadcast Spectrum: Putting Principles First</h2>
by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's <a href="#board">FCC Working Group</a>
<P>
For the last several months, House and Senate conferees have worked
diligently to iron out differences between the telecommunications
bills passed by their respective bodies.  They have reached apparent
closure on a compromise that would begin the process of creating
a new telecom &quot;playing field&quot; based on policies of competition,
open entry and market forces.
<P>Recently, disagreements have arisen
on one of the bill's major provisions, which addresses the allocation
of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for use by broadcasters.
 These disagreements threaten to delay or even derail final action
on a bill which has the potential to generate tremendous benefits
for consumers.
<P>
As background, the FCC is proposing to allocate
6 MHz licenses in today's UHF TV band  for the development of
so-called &quot;Advanced Television&quot; (ATV)(1), a new digital
technology that has indeed shown great promise.  Enormous controversy
exists over how these licenses should be assigned.  The current
legislation would require the FCC to limit eligibility for these
licenses to existing broadcasters who would, at some unspecified
time in the future, return their current spectrum to the government
following a transition to the new digital system(2).  Others,
most notably Senator Dole, contend that the licenses should be
assigned on the basis of competitive bidding or auctions among
all comers, a move the FCC believes could generate $10 to $70
billion in revenues. 
<P>
What's gotten lost in this debate is principle,
and the principle is property.  The paramount goal of spectrum
reform should be to channel existing broadcast spectrum -- and
new, so-called ATV spectrum - to its highest and best use.  Auctions
are one of several necessary reforms.  Far more important is the
need to give spectrum users the marketplace freedom and incentives
to deploy spectrum and new digital technologies efficiently. 
Giving existing and new spectrum users more flexibility to use
their spectrum as they see fit (as long as they do not interfere
with their spectrum &quot;neighbors&quot;) will create strong
economic incentives for spectrum users to weigh the relative merits
of possible uses.  Such flexibility and incentives are best achieved
through property rights. 
<P>
Government ownership and micromanagement
of the broadcast spectrum dates to Herbert Hoover's decision in
1927 to expropriate the spectrum on behalf of the Federal government.
 Since that time, the government has meted out  limited duration
&quot;licenses&quot; allowing use of the spectrum only under the
tightest of government controls.  The centrally-planned FCC system
typified by the current approach to ATV lacks the market flexibility,
incentives and information necessary to direct spectrum to its
highest and best use.  Time and again,  the FCC has made overly
rigid spectrum allocations and impeded new technologies.  Indeed,
the administrative process has been used as a weapon against consumers
by existing competitors to disadvantage new entrants and innovative
technologies.
<P>
The solution to the current broadcast spectrum conundrum
is to recognize the error of Herbert Hoover's ways -- or at least
their obsolescence -- and return to a property rights regime for
the broadcast spectrum.
<P>
Specifically, broadcasters' rights to their
current spectrum should be recognized as property, pure and simple.
 They should be given, in effect, fee simple title to the spectrum
they now hold and be allowed to use it for any technology or service
customers want; or, if they prefer, to sell it to new owners.
<P>
As
for the new spectrum, it too should be relieved from government
control and returned to the private sector.  Auctions -- properly
constructed and without the myriad of special interest preferences
that have characterized previous auctions -- should be held as
soon as possible.  Winning bidders should also receive fee simple
title to their property, without restrictions on use.
<P>
Is such a
proposal politically viable?  Only the politicians can decide.
 But it would accomplish three important objectives.
<P>
Broadcasters
would be given something they do not now have -- an asset they
could use, borrow against or sell.  They would be able to use
their current spectrum for new technologies in entrepreneurial
ways currently prohibited by the FCC's licensing restrictions.
 And, if they decided they really do need the new spectrum to
make the transition to some new form of digital television, they
could borrow against the value of their current spectrum to capitalize
their participation in the auctions.
<P>
Deficit hawks would also get
their wish -- the near-term auction of the new spectrum.  And,
since the auction would now offer fee simple title, rather than
the government-limited licenses envisioned by the FCC, there is
every reason to believe it would generate even more money than
currently estimated.
<P>
Finally, and most important, the American
people would get back a small piece of what Herbert Hoover took
away in 1927, and take an important first step toward restoring
ownership of the entire electromagnetic spectrum to America's
entrepreneurial, innovative private sector, where it can contribute
to the prosperity potential of the information revolution.   Such
a step is essential to maintaining America's advantage in the
worldwide digital marketplace -- the fastest growing segment of
the global economy.<P><br>

<ol><small><li>Tentative Decision and Further Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 87-268, 3 FCC Rcd 6520 (1988).
<br>*Members
of  the Working Group participated with the project solely in
their individual capacity and do not necessarily represent the
views and/or position of their respective institutions and/or
telecommunications affiliations.  Greg Sidak, who was unable to
review this work, and  Tom Hazlett, both of AEI, are members of
the Working Group but have not approved this commentary.
<li> The transition would involve not only the construction of digital broadcasting facilities but also the purchase by consumers of digital receivers (new TV sets, or converters for their current sets).  Such a transition could easily take a decade or more during which broadcasters would retain licenses to their current spectrum, so long as they continue broadcasting analog television signals.

<b>INTRODUCTION<sup>2</sup></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By extolling freedom of religion in the schools, President Bill Clinton has raised the level of debate on the importance of religion to American life.<sup>3</sup>  The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America has always been a religious country. "Its first Christian inhabitants were only too anxious to explain what they were doing and why," explains historian Paul Johnson. "In a way the first American settlers were like the ancient Israelites. They saw themselves as active agents of divine providence."<sup>4</sup>  Today, he adds, "it is generally accepted that more than half the American people still attend a place of worship over a weekend, an index of religious practice unequaled anywhere in the world, certainly in a great and populous nation."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of religious practice is prayer: Americans pray even more than they go to church. According to a composite of surveys, 94 percent of blacks, 91 percent of women, 87 percent of whites, and 85 percent of men regard themselves as people who pray regularly. Some 78 percent pray at least once per week, and 57 percent pray daily. Even among the 13 percent of the population who call themselves agnostics or atheists, some 20 percent pray daily.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When policymakers consider America's grave social problems, including violent crime and rising illegitimacy, substance abuse, and welfare dependency, they should heed the findings in the professional literature of the social sciences on the positive consequences that flow from the practice of religion.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, there is ample evidence that:<p><ul><li> The strength of the family unit is intertwined with the practice of religion. Churchgoers<sup>8</sup> are more likely to be married, less likely to be divorced or single, and more likely to manifest high levels of satisfaction in marriage.
<p>
<li> Church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability and happiness.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion helps poor persons move out of poverty. Regular church attendance, for example, is particularly instrumental in helping young people to escape the poverty of inner-city life.
<p>
<li>Religious belief and practice contribute substantially to the formation of personal moral criteria and sound moral judgment.
<p>
<li> Regular religious practice generally inoculates individuals against a host of social problems, including suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, and divorce.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion also encourages such beneficial effects on mental health as less depression (a modern epidemic), more self-esteem, and greater family and marital happiness.
<p>
<li> In repairing damage caused by alcoholism, drug addiction, and marital breakdown, religious belief and practice are a major source of strength and recovery.
<p>
<li> Regular practice of religion is good for personal physical health: It increases longevity, improves one's chances of recovery from illness, and lessens the incidence of many killer diseases.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overall impact of religious practice is illustrated dramatically in the three most comprehensive systematic reviews of the field.<sup>9</sup>  Some 81 percent of the studies showed the positive benefit of religious practice, 15 percent showed neutral effects, and only 4 percent showed harm.<sup>10</sup>  Each of these systematic reviews indicated more than 80 percent benefit, and none indicated more than 10 percent harm. Even this 10 percent may be explained by more recent social science insights into "healthy religious practice" and "unhealthy religious practice."<sup>11</sup>  This latter notion will be discussed later -- it is seen generally by most Americans of religious faith as a mispractice of religion. Unfortunately, the effects of unhealthy religious practice are used to downplay the generally positive influence of religion.<sup>12</sup>  This both distorts the true nature of religious belief and practice and causes many policymakers to ignore its positive social consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Religious practice appears to have enormous potential for addressing today's social problems. As summarized in 1991 by Allen Bergin, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, considerable evidence indicates that religious involvement reduces "such problems as sexual permissiveness, teen pregnancy, suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism, and to some extent deviant and delinquent acts, and increases self esteem, family cohesiveness and general well being.... Some religious influences have a modest impact whereas another portion seem like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy.... More generally, social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>13</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor Bergin's summary was echoed two years later by nationally syndicated columnist William Raspberry: "Almost every commentator on the current scene bemoans the increase of violence, lowered ethical standards and loss of civility that mark American society. Is the decline of religious influence part of what is happening to us?  Is it not just possible that anti-religious bias masquerading as religious neutrality is costing more than we have been willing to acknowledge?"<sup>14</sup>  Other reviews<sup>15</sup> also list the positive effects of religious belief and practice in reducing such problems as suicide, substance abuse, divorce, and marital dissatisfaction. Such evidence indicates clearly that religious practice contributes significantly to the quality of American life.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given this evidence, <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress should:</b><ul>
<p>
<li> Begin a new national debate to help renew the role of religion in American life;
<p>
<li> Ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the evidence on the beneficial effects of religious practice in the relevant social science literature and report its findings to a national commission formed to promote the consideration of religious practice among U.S. citizens;
<p>
<li> Fund federal experiments with school choice that include religiously affiliated schools;
<p>
<li>Pass a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that data on religious practice are useful for policymakers and researchers as part of the public policy debate; and
<p>
<li> Mandate a census question on religious practice. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious practice in America.
<p>
</ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The President should:</b>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Appoint judges who are more sensitive to the role of religion in public life, with the Senate ensuring that such is the case by ascertaining the stand of judges on matters of religion and its relationship to the Constitution;
<p>
<li> Direct the Bureau of the Census to record levels of religious practice in the census for the year 2000 (time is running out for preparation of the census questionnaire); and
<p>
<li> Issue a directive to all federal agencies making clear that cooperation between government entities and the social, medical, and educational services of faith-based organizations does not violate separation of church and state.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The U.S. Supreme Court should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Review the decisions in which it has changed the laws of the land by changing commonly held beliefs regarding the Constitution and religion and send to Congress those that should have been the object of legislative action rather than judicial reinterpretation.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>America's religious leaders should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Be much more assertive in emphasizing the contribution of religion to the health of the nation and in resisting efforts to minimize religion in public discourse;
<p>
<li> Make clear to their congregations that they are contributing not only to their own welfare, but also to the well-being of the nation by their regular attendance at religious worship;
<p>
<li> Take special care of the religious formation of children, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence, when they are most likely to lose their religious faith;
<p>
<li> Recognize that the church in the inner city, especially the black church, has a vital role to play in helping its people escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty; and
<p>
<li> Encourage education leaders, social scientists, and social policy practitioners to rely more on religious belief and worship to achieve social policy and social work goals.
</ul><p>

<b>RELIGION AND HAPPINESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since Aristotle outlined the goal of a sound civil order in his <i>Politics</i>,<sup>16</sup> social and political scientists and social psychologists have been particularly interested in what makes human beings happy. Happy people tend to be productive and law-abiding. They learn well, make good citizens, and are invariably pleasant company. It turns out that the practice of religion has a significant effect on happiness and an overall sense of personal well-being. Religious affiliation and regular church attendance are near the top of the list for most people in explaining their own happiness<sup>17</sup> and serve as good predictors of who is most likely to have this sense of well-being.<sup>18</sup>  Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who attend religious services regularly.<sup>19</sup>  Those pursuing a personal relationship with God tend to have improved relationships with themselves and with others.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A large epidemiological study conducted by the University of California at Berkeley in 1971 found that the religiously committed had much less psychological distress than the uncommitted.<sup>21</sup>  Rodney Stark, now of the University of Washington, found the same in a 1970 study: The higher the level of religious attendance, the less stress suffered when adversity had to be endured.<sup>22</sup>  Similarly, in a longitudinal study of 720 adults conducted by David Williams of the University of Michigan, regular religious attendance led to much less psychological distress.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, David Larson, adjunct professor at the Northwestern and Duke University Schools of Medicine and president of the National Institute of Healthcare Research, completed a systematic review of studies on religious commitment and personal well-being. He found that the relationship is powerful and positive; overall, psychological functioning improved following a resumption of participation in religious worship for those who had stopped.<sup>24</sup><p>
<b>RELIGION AND FAMILY STABILITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a growing consensus that America needs to pursue policies aimed at re-strengthening the family. The beneficial effects of religious worship on family stability clearly indicate one way to help accomplish this. Professors Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry of Brigham Young University's Department of Sociology sum up earlier research<sup>25</sup> on the quest by young people for meaning and love: "Research on love clearly indicates that for many, love in the social realm cannot clearly be separated from love that contains a vertical or a divine element.... Young people see love as the central aspect of the meaning of life; they believe that religion is still important in helping form judgments and attitudes."<sup>26</sup>  Their conclusion: "Family and religious institutions need to be studied simultaneously in our efforts to understand the human condition better."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Middletown," one of the century's classic sociological research projects, studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and for the third time in the 1980s. Based on the latest round of follow-up research, Howard Bahr and Bruce Chadwick, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, concluded in 1985 that "There is a relationship between family solidarity -- family health if you will -- and church affiliation and activity. Middletown [churchgoing] members were more likely to be married, remain married and to be highly satisfied with their marriages and to have more children.... The great divide between marriage status, marriage satisfaction and family size is... between those who identify with a church or denomination and those who do not."<sup>28</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Four years later, Professor Arland Thornton of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan likewise concluded from a Detroit study of the same relationship that "These data indicate strong intergenerational transmission of religious involvement. Attendance at religious services is also very stable within generations across time."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"With striking consistency, the most religious among us [as Americans] place a greater importance on the full range of family and friendship activities," concluded a Connecticut Mutual Life report in 1982.<sup>30</sup>  A group of Kansas State University professors reached the same conclusion: "Family commitment is indeed a high priority in many American families and it is frequently accompanied by a concomitant factor of religious commitment."<sup>31</sup>  In yet another study conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, professors Nick Stinnet of the University of Alabama and John DeFrain of the University of Nebraska sought to identify family strengths. From their nationwide surveys of strong families, they found that 84 percent identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.<sup>32</sup>  It should be noted that the same pattern appears to hold for African-American families: Parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidelines.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Marital Satisfaction.</b> Couples with long-lasting marriages indicate that the practice of religion is an important factor in marital happiness. Indeed, David Larson's systematic reviews indicate that church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability.<sup>34</sup>  Others have found the same result.<sup>35</sup>  Twenty years ago it was first noted that very religious women achieve greater satisfaction in sexual intercourse with their husbands than do moderately religious or non-religious women.<sup>36</sup>  The <i>Sex in America</i> study published in 1995, and conducted by sociologists from the University of Chicago and the State University of New York at Stonybrook, also showed very high sexual satisfaction among "conservative" religious women.<sup>37</sup>  From the standpoint of contemporary American media culture, this may appear strange or counter-intuitive, but the empirical evidence is consistent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Divorce and Cohabitation.</b> Regular church attendance is the critical factor in marital stability across denominations and overrides effects of doctrinal teaching on divorce. For instance, black Protestants and white Catholics, who share similarly high church attendance rates, have been shown to have similarly low divorce rates.<sup>38</sup>  Furthermore, when marital separation occurs, reconciliation rates are higher among regular church attendees, and highest when both spouses have the same high level of church attendance.<sup>39</sup>  Findings on the other end of the marital spectrum reinforce the point: A 1993 national survey of 3,300 men aged 20-39 found that those who switch partners most are those with no religious convictions.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, cohabitation before marriage poses a high risk to later marital stability,<sup>41</sup> and premarital cohabitation is much less common among religious Americans. "The cohabitation rate is seven times higher among persons who seldom or never attend religious services compared to persons who frequently attend," writes David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research. "Women who attended religious services once a week were only one-third as likely to cohabit as those who attended church services less than once a month."  Furthermore, "If the mother frequently attended religious services, both sons and daughters were only 50 percent as likely to cohabit as adult children whose mothers were not actively religious."<sup>42</sup>  Rockford Institute President Allan Carlson summarizes the pattern: "Social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>43</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is that too many social scientists have failed to appreciate the significance of research on the relationship between family and religion. As another researcher of the same period concludes, "We may have underestimated this 'silent majority' and it is only fair to give them equal time."<sup>44</sup>  The centrality of stable married family life in avoiding such problems as crime,<sup>45</sup> illegitimacy,<sup>46</sup> and welfare<sup>47</sup> has become indisputable. If such a stable family life is linked closely to a lively religious life, as these studies indicate, then the peace and happiness of the nation depend significantly on a renewal of religious practice and belief.
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In public health circles, the level of educational attainment is held to be the key demographic predictor of physical health. For over two decades, however, the level of religious practice has been shown convincingly to be equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As early as 1972, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health found that cardiovascular diseases, the leading killers of older people, were reduced significantly in early old age by a lifetime of regular church attendance. By contrast, non-attendees had higher mortality rates for such other diseases as cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, and arteriosclerosis, in addition to other cardiovascular diseases and even suicide.<sup>48</sup>  Research on mortality patterns among the poor confirmed a decade later that those who went to church regularly lived longer.<sup>49</sup>  Since then, other studies have reinforced this general finding.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Blood pressure, a key factor in cardiovascular health, is reduced significantly by regular church attendance, on average by 5mm of pressure.<sup>51</sup>  Given that reducing blood pressure by 2 to 4 mm also reduces the mortality rate by 10 to 20 percent for any given population,<sup>52</sup> a reduction of 5 mm is a very significant public health achievement by any standard. For those over 55 years of age, the average decrease was 6 mm. Among those who smoked -- a practice that increases blood pressure -- regular church attendance decreased the risk of early stroke by 700 percent.<sup>53</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor are the health benefits of religious commitment confined to the cardiovascular system. In 1987, a major review of 250 epidemiological health research studies -- studies which examined the relationship between health and religion and measured such additional outcomes as colitis, cancers of many different types, and longevity measures -- concluded that, in general, religious commitment improves health.<sup>54</sup>  A 1991 study of two national samples<sup>55</sup> also concluded that the degree to which people prayed and participated in religious services significantly affected their health status, regardless of age.<sup>56</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In what must be one of the most unusual experiments in medical history, Dr. Robert B. Byrd, a cardiologist then at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School, conducted a random-sample, double-blind study of the effects of prayer -- not <i>by</i> the patients but <i>for</i> the patients -- on the outcome of cardiac surgery. The study was published in 1982. None of the patients knew they were being prayed for, none of the attending doctors and nurses knew who was being prayed for and who was not, and those praying had no personal contact with the patients before or during the experiment. Outcomes for the two sets of patients differed significantly: Those prayed for ha
d noticeably fewer post-operative congestive heart failures, fewer cardiopulmonary arrests, less pneumonia, and less need for antibiotics.<sup>57</sup>  To date, this study has not been replicated, though the intriguing results challenge the academic and medical community to verify or disprove them.<p><b>RELIGION AND SOCIAL BREAKDOWN</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion has beneficial effects on behavior and social relations: on illegitimacy, crime and delinquency, welfare dependency, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, depression, and general self-esteem.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Illegitimacy.</b> One of the most powerful of all factors in preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief. Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births, their effects,<sup>58</sup> and the huge social and economic costs to national and state budgets, this should be of major interest to policymakers.<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has long been known that intensity of religious practice is closely related to adolescent virginity and sexual restraint and control. This general finding, replicated again and again,<sup>59</sup> also holds true specifically for black teenage girls,<sup>60</sup> the group with the highest teen pregnancy rates among all demographic subgroups.<sup>61</sup>  Reviews of the literature demonstrate that, nearly without exception, religious practice sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse.<sup>62</sup>  The reverse is also true: The absence of religious practice accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex. This is confirmed in numerous studies,<sup>63</sup> including a 1991 analysis of the federal government's National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.<sup>64</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The impact of religious practice on teenage sexual behavior also can be seen at the state level: States with higher levels of aggregate religiousness have lower rates of teenage pregnancy.<sup>65</sup><p
>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an important study published in 1987, a group of professors from the Universities of Georgia, Utah, and Wyoming found that the main cause of problematic adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes is not only family dynamics and processes, as previously thought, but the absence of religious behavior and affiliation. They further concluded that healthy family dynamics and practices are themselves caused to a powerful degree by the presence or absence of religious beliefs and practices.<sup>66</sup>  The same results also hold true in international comparisons.<sup>67</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with drugs, alcohol, and crime, the religious behavior of the mother is one of the strongest predictors of the daughter's sexual attitudes.<sup>68</sup>  It also has long been known in the social sciences that daughters of single mothers are more likely to engage in premarital sexual behavior during adolescence.<sup>69</sup>  These mothers are more frequently permissive in their sexual attitudes, and religion for them has less importance than it has for mothers in two-parent families.<sup>70</sup>  These findings also have been replicated.<sup>71</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The religious practices of parents, particularly their unity on religious issues, powerfully influence the behavior of children. Thus, for policymakers interested in reducing teenage (and older) out-of-wedlock births, the lesson is clear: Religious belief and regular worship reduce the likelihood of this form of family breakdown. One faith-based sex education course that included both mothers and daughters, for example, was aimed specifically at reducing the teenage pregnancy rate. The results were notably successful: Out-of-wedlock births among the at-risk population were almost eliminated.<sup>72</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime and Delinquency.</b> A review of the small amount of research done on the relationship between crime and religion shows that states w
ith more religious populations tend to have fewer homicides and fewer suicides.<sup>73</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A four-year longitudinal, stratified, random-sample study of high school students in the Rocky Mountain region, published in 1975, demonstrated that religious involvement significantly decreased drug use, delinquency, and premarital sex, and also increased self-control.<sup>74</sup>  A 1989 study of midwestern high school students replicated these findings.<sup>75</sup>  Similarly, young religious adults in Canada were found in a 1979 study to be less likely to use or sell narcotics, to gamble, or to destroy property.<sup>76</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What is true for youth is also true for adults.<sup>77</sup>  Religious behavior, as opposed to mere attitude or affiliation, is associated with reduced crime.<sup>78</sup>  This has been known in the social science literature for over 20 years.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In research conducted in the late 1980s -- controlling for family, economic, and religious backgrounds -- a research team from the University of Nevada found that black men who eventually ended up in prison and those who did not came respectively from two different groups: those who did not go to church, or stopped going around ten years of age, and those who went regularly.<sup>80</sup>  This failure of faith at the onset of adolescence parallels the pattern found among those who become alcoholics or drug addicts. Clearly, the family's inability to inspire regular religious worship among emerging young adults is a sign of internal weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare Dependency.</b> In his classic study <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Max Weber, the preeminent German sociologist of the first half of the 20th century, demonstrated the connection between religious practice and financial well-being among Protestants. Other work on the same theme shows that this is not confined to Protestants, but that it applies across a longer period of history and across denominational lines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This link between religion and prosperity has important implications for the poor. In 1985, for instance, Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that:
<p><blockquote>
	[Church attendance] is associated with substantial differences in the behavior of [black male youths from poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhoods] and thus in their chances to "escape" from inner city poverty. It affects allocation of time, school-going, work activity and the frequency of socially deviant activity.... It is important to recognize that our analysis has identified an important set of variables that separate successful from unsuccessful young persons in the inner city. There is a significant number of inner city youth, readily identifiable, who succeed in escaping that pathology of inner-city slum life.<sup>81</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ongoing studies by Professor Ranald Jarrell of the Department of Education at Arizona State University West show the power of religious belief and practice in encouraging a spirit of optimism among socially at-risk but advancing children. The subjects are students at the De La Salle Academy, an independent school in the upper west side of Manhattan serving primarily poor inner-city black and Hispanic middle school children who show substantial academic promise. Within this group, the highest concentration of pessimists is found among students with the lowest attendance at church. Those who attend church weekly or more frequently, on the other hand, exhibit the following profiles:
<P><ul>
<li> They are more optimistic about their futures;
<p>
<li> They have better relationships with their parents;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to have serious and realistic goals for their futures;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see the world as a friendly place in which they can achieve, rather than as a hostile world with powerful forces arrayed against them; and
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see themselves as in control of their own futures, whereas those who do not attend church are more likely to see themselves as victims of oppression.<sup>82</sup></ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the best national sample for tracking the development of America's youth from the late 1970s, clearly indicate the difference regular religious practice makes for those who grew up in poverty in the 1970s and 1980s. Among those who attended church weekly in both 1979 and 1982, average family income in 1993 was $37,021; among those who never attended church in 1979 or 1982, however, average family income in 1993 was $24,361 --  a difference of $12,660.<sup>83</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other studies also show that growing up in an intact family correlates significantly and positively with future earnings.<sup>84</sup>  However, the NLSY data show that regular religious practice benefits both those who grow up in intact families <i>and</i> those who grow up in broken families. The other differences remain, but the positive impact of religion on both groups is evident.<sup>85</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Alcohol and Drug Abuse.</b> The relationship between religious practice and the moderate use or avoidance of alcohol is well documented,<sup>86</sup> regardless of whether denominational beliefs prohibit the use of alcohol.<sup>87</sup>  According to general studies, the higher the level of religious involvement, the less likely the use or abuse of alcohol.<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Persons who abuse alcohol rarely have a strong religious commitment.<sup>89</sup>  In their study of the development of alcohol abuse, David Larson and William P. Wilson, professors of psychiatry at Northwestern University School of Medicine, found that nine out of ten alcoholics had lost interest in religion in their teenage years, in sharp contrast to teenagers generally, among whom interest in religion increased by almost 50 percent and declined by only 14 percent.<sup>90</sup>  Robert Coombs and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine found that alcohol abuse is 300 percent higher among those who do not attend church.<sup>91</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Drug and alcohol use is lowest in the most conservative religious denominations and highest in non-religious groups, while liberal church groups have use rates just slightly lower than those for non-religious groups. But for all groups, religious commitment correlates with absence of drug abuse.<sup>92</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, involvement in any religious denomination or group generally decreases the level of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance. Among traditional American religions, Mormons have the highest denominational association between religious doctrine and drug avoidance; they also have the most restrictive proscriptions against drug use. On the other hand, Roman Catholics have the highest alcohol use rate; their religion condemns the abuse of alcohol but does not proscribe its use.<sup>93</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Attendance at church and related religious activities has special significance for drug use among teenagers. In a 1985 study of young girls aged between 9 and 17, less than 10 percent of those who reported attending religious services weekl
y or more often indicated any drug or alcohol use, compared with 38 percent of all those studied.<sup>94</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The parental attitude to religion also is important in dealing with alcohol use. A 1985 study indicated that if the mother and father have deep, competing differences toward religious belief and practice, their children are more likely to use or abuse alcohol than are children whose parents do not differ on matters of religion. Conversely, if their parents' religious beliefs and practices are similar, children are far more likely to abstain from alcohol or to drink with moderation.<sup>95</sup>  Almost three decades before these findings, Orville Walters, then a research fellow at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas, found that alcoholics who came from religious backgrounds tended to have mothers who were highly religious but fathers who were more non-religious.<sup>96</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For over four decades it has been known,<sup>97</sup> and replicated,<sup>98</sup> that alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are much more likely to seek help and treatment. Indeed, Alcoholics Anonymous, the major organization combating alcoholism in America, has known for over half a century that the most effective element in its program is its religious or spiritual component.<sup>99</sup>  David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research notes: "Even after alcoholism has been established, religion is often a powerful force in achieving abstinence. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) uses religion, invoking a Higher Power to help alcoholics recover from addiction."<sup>100</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Paralleling the research on alcohol addiction, an early review of studies of drug addiction found a lack of religious commitment to be a predictor of who abuses drugs.<sup>101</sup>  Many more recent studies replicate this finding.<sup>102</sup>  As in so many other research studies, the best 
measurement of religious commitment is frequency of church attendance: "Overall church attendance was more strongly related to [less] drug use than was intensity of religious feelings."<sup>103</sup>  This is true for both males and females. According to Jerald G. Bachman of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, "Factors we found to be most important in predicting use of marijuana and other drugs during the late 1970's remained most important during the early 1980's. Drug use is below average among those with strong religious commitments."<sup>104</sup>  The more powerfully addictive the drug being considered, the more powerful is the impact of church attendance in preventing its use.<sup>105</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In results almost identical to those for alcoholics, researchers at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a section of the National Institutes of Health and the nation's premier drug abuse research facility, found in their interviews of narcotic addicts that "the addict had neither current religious preference nor a history of attending religious services.... In addition... the addicts' fathers were much less involved in regular or frequent religious practices, than were a parallel group of control fathers.... Religiously, the mother was far more involved than her husband, the difference in regular religious participation between the addict's parents being twice that for the control's parents.... Religiously, the addicts were significantly less involved in reading the Bible, and praying."  They also had far more frequent loss of interest in religion during adolescence.<sup>106</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Louis A. Cancellaro of the Department of Psychiatry at the Veterans Administration in Johnson City, Tennessee, writes that, "Like their fathers, addicts are less religiously involved than their normal peers, and during adolescence, less frequently make decisions either to become more interested in religion or to commit themselves to a re
ligious philosophy to live by."<sup>107</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992: "[The] role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>108</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Suicide.</b> The practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide, both in the United States and abroad.<sup>109</sup>  In fact, the rate of church attendance predicts the suicide rate better than any other factor (including unemployment, traditionally regarded as the most powerful variable). Those who attend church frequently are four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend. Conversely, the national decline in church attendance is associated with a heightened suicide rate; fluctuations in church attendance rates in the 1970s paralleled the suicide rates for different subgroups: whites, blacks, men, and women.<sup>110</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steven Stack, professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University, in a landmark 1985 study on the demography of suicide has found that "Families and religion change together over time.... As the importance of the domestic-religious institutional complex declines, the study finds a rise in the rate of suicide, both for the general population and for the age cohort at the center of the decline, the youth cohort."<sup>111</sup>  In another, earlier study, Stack broke new ground in finding that the effect of unemployment in causing suicide is greatl
y diminished when religious behavior is factored into the equation.<sup>112</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In inter-state comparisons, higher levels of church attendance are associated with lower rates of suicide.<sup>113</sup>  The same holds true in international comparisons.<sup>114</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Depression.</b> Religion appears to reduce the incidence of depression among those with medical problems. For instance, University of Michigan Professor of Sociology David Williams conducted a randomized survey of 720 adults suffering from leg and hip injuries in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1990. Those who attended religious services regularly were less depressed and less distressed by life events than those who did not. This finding held across age, race, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and religious affiliation. Religious affiliation alone did not have these effects, but religious behavior did.<sup>115</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Younger people also tend to experience fewer of the anxieties of growing up if they are religious. For instance, both male and female Texas high-schoolers found that religious beliefs gave meaning to their lives and reduced the incidence of depression among them.<sup>116</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Self-esteem.</b> The absence of self-esteem weakens the personality and puts the person at greater risk for crime, addictions, and other social maladies.<sup>117</sup>  In all religious denominations, psychological weaknesses decrease as religious orthodoxy increases.<sup>118</sup>  Among college students, for instance, the practice of religion was shown in 1969 to have a positive effect on mental health;<sup>119</sup> students involved with campus ministries were much healthier and made much less use of mental health services.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, self-esteem is linked to a person's image of God. Those with high self-esteem think of God primarily as loving, while those 
with low self-esteem think of God primarily as punitive.<sup>120</sup>  This was observed by Carl Jung, one of the most influential pioneers of modern psychology and psychotherapy: "Among all my patients in the second half of my life... there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given their followers and none of them has been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook."<sup>121</sup>  Other evidence exists that people with a religious commitment, whether young or old, who become emotionally or psychologically distressed are much more likely to seek help.<sup>122</sup><p><b>UNDERSTANDING "INTRINSIC" AND "EXTRINSIC" RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent advances in the investigation of religious behavior have led social scientists to distinguish between two distinct categories or orientations: "intrinsic" and "extrinsic."  Intrinsic practice is God-oriented and based on beliefs which transcend the person's own existence. Research shows this form of religious practice to be beneficial. Extrinsic practice is self-oriented and characterized by outward observance, not internalized as a guide to behavior or attitudes. The evidence suggests this form of religious practice is actually more harmful than no religion: Religion directed toward some end other than God, or the transcendent, typically degenerates into a rationalization for the pursuit of other ends such as status, personal security, self justification, or sociability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The difference between these two forms of religious practice have implications for future research and for the interpretation of all research on religious practice. There is a radical difference between what religious people know to be conversion of the spirit or heart and simply conforming external behavior for its own sake, or for benefits derived from religious behavior.<sup>123</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;William James, professor of psychology at Harvard University in the early 1900s and a pioneer in the psychological study of religious behavior, was the first to make the social science distinction between the two forms of religious practice. Gordon Allport, his successor at Harvard in the late 1960s, concluded: "I feel equally sure that mental health is facilitated by an intrinsic, but not an extrinsic, religious orientation."<sup>124</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The two orientations lead to two very different sets of psychological effects. For instance, "intrinsics" have a greater sense of responsibility and greater internal control, are more self-motivated, and do better in their studies. By contrast, "extrinsics" are more likely to be dogmatic, authoritarian, and less responsible, to have less internal control, to be less self-directed, and to do less well in their studies.<sup>125</sup>  Intrinsics are more concerned with moral standards, conscientiousness, discipline, responsibility, and consistency than are extrinsically religious people.<sup>126</sup>  They also are more sensitive to others and more open to their own emotions. By contrast, extrinsics are more self-indulgent, indolent, and likely to lack dependability. For example, the most racially prejudiced people turn out to be those who go to church occasionally<sup>127</sup> and those who are extrinsic in their practice of religion.<sup>128</sup>  These findings have been replicated<sup>129</sup> in a number of different forms.<sup>130</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;T
he contrasting effects show up in college students. Intrinsically religious students tend to have internal locus of control, intrinsic motives, and a higher grade point average.<sup>131</sup>  By contrast, a 1980 study indicated that extrinsically religious students were more dogmatic and authoritarian, less responsible and less motivated, had less internal locus of control, and had a lower grade point average. Intrinsically religious students were found to have a greater concern for moral standards and to be more conscientious, disciplined, responsible, and consistent, while the extrinsic were more self-indulgent, more indolent, and less dependable.<sup>132</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, intrinsics are less anxious about life's ups and downs, while extrinsics are more anxious. Further, the religious beliefs and practices of intrinsics are more integrated; for instance, they are more likely to worship publicly as well as pray privately. By contrast, those who pray privately but do not worship publicly tend to have a higher level of general anxiety -- a characteristic of extrinsics generally.<sup>133</sup>  In an ironic set of findings on anxiety about death, extrinsics fared worst of all: worse than intrinsics and worse than those without religious beliefs.<sup>134</sup>  From a purely social science standpoint, the intrinsic form of religion is thus good and desirable, and the extrinsic form is harmful. Religious teachers, without being utilitarian, would agree.<sup>135</sup>
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a tension between practitioners of social science and religious belief.<sup>136</sup>  Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, write: "From the work of Freud and others, much of the early history of the social sciences is characterized by the expectation that involvement in and reliance upon the religious institution will be associated with people who have a low sense of personal well-being."<sup>137</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is repeated evidence that much the same hostility to religion -- a hostility at variance with the attitude of the vast majority of Americans -- persists among members of America's professional elites.<sup>138</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen L. Carter, professor of law at Yale University, points out that "One sees a trend in our political and legal cultures toward treating religious beliefs as arbitrary and unimportant, a trend supported by rhetoric that implies that there is something wrong with religious devotion. More and more, our culture seems to take the position that believing deeply in the tenets of one's faith represents a kind of mystical irrationality, something that thoughtful, public-spirited American citizens would do better to avoid."<sup>139</sup>  However, the available evidence renders such opposition unreasonable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor David Larson of Duke University Medical School draws attention to similar biases in the mental health professions. Consider <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, the standard reference manual for the classification of mental illnesses, which essentially defines the practice of psychiatrists, clinical psychology, and clinical social work and is central to the practice, research, and financing of these professions. In the third edition, religious examples were used only as illustrations in discussions of mental illness, such as delusions, incoherence, and illogical thinking. The latest edition has corrected this bias.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider also the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, one of the most widely used of all psychological tests. In the MMPI, all the positive religion-connected traits -- self-discipline, altruism, humility, obedience to authority, conventional morality -- are weighted negatively. Thus, to choose the self-description "I am orthodoxly religious" is to detract from one's mental health standing. Conversely, several traits that religious people would regard as diminishing themselves, at least in some situations -- self-assertion, self-expression, and a high opinion of oneself -- are weighted positively.<sup>140</sup>  The latest editions of the MMPI have removed the biased items.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite this general hostility among social science and mental health professionals, the empirical evidence shows religion to be a very powerful and positive part of everyday life. Patrick McNamara, professor of sociology at the University of New Mexico, explains the difference between social scientists and religiously affiliated people generally: "Sociologists tend to see concern for personal challenge -- e.g. to get one's own moral life in order -- as somehow secondary to social challenge or the effort to identify and criticize those socioeconomic structures that inhibit the individual's own group from attaining a fuller human existence."<sup>141</sup>  McNamara continues: "In [the] typical social science analysis, the demands of the inner life are neglected and personal agency and autonomy exercised in the choice to examine one's own life and put it in order according to an internalized ethic of repentance... is not acknowledged."<sup>142</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the attitude of many professionals, Gallup surveys continue to indicate that one-third of the American people regard religious commitment as the most important dimension in their lives. Another third regard religion as a very important, though not the single most dominant, factor in their lives.<sup>143</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Totally secular approaches to many issues -- public policy, psychotherapy, and education -- use an alien framework for this two-thirds of the population. The plain fact is that religion plays a powerful role in the personal and social lives of most Americans. It is a role that should be understood clearly by the professions, by policymakers, and by the media.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From many other areas of social science research -- family dynamics, group dynamics, marital dynamics -- positive reciprocal relationships with others are known to be powerful across a host of areas similar to those reviewed in this paper: stress, ability to relate with others in general, productivity, and learning, to name just a few. The core of the religious commitment is an intention to have a positive relationship with another Being, a transcendent and therefore all-available Being. Viewed in this fashion, the documented effects of religious commitment are not mysterious, but an extension of the effects which we know arise from positive relations between human beings. Thus, the findings on religion fit with the general corpus of what is known about relationships from the existing body of social science research.
<p>

<b>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The evidence indicates strongly that it is a good social policy to foster the widespread practice of religion. It is bad social policy to block it. The widespread practice of religious beliefs is one of America's greatest national resources. It strengthens individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol addiction, crime, and delinquency. No other dimension of the nation's life, other than the health of the family (which the data show also is tied powerfully to religious practice) should be of more concern to those who guide the future course of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original intent of the Founding Fathers was to bar the establishment by the federal government of a state-approved religion, not to bar religion from the operations of the state. Thomas Jefferson made this distinction very clear in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (January 16, 1786):
<p><blockquote>	
We, the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief: but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.<sup>144</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;George Washington summed up the importance of religion to the new nation with particular eloquence in his farewell address:
<p><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness -- these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice?  And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;'Tis substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?<sup>145</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A policy can be friendly to the general practice of religion, and to the many different faiths in a pluralistic society, without in any way implying the establishment of a particular religion. Federal policies encourage many other institutions: the marketplace, education, medicine, science, and the arts. Even religion itself is explicitly encouraged by the tax treatment of contributions to religious institutions. It makes no sense, therefore, not to encourage the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation. Congress and the President can help to accomplish this by acting decisively in at least six specific areas:
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the Senate in particular, should lead a new national debate on the renewed role of religion in American life. With his recent guidance to school administrators on prayer in school, President Clinton has opened the national discussion. The Senate once was the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It is time for it to take up that role again on the relationship between the practice of religion and the life of the nation, on the health of America's families and the content of its culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America needs a major national debate on the true role of religion in a free and pluralistic society. For many decades, the once-prominent place of religion in society has been eroded. Religious leaders, who should be in the forefront of moral and spiritual renewal, have been cowed into a strange timidity. Americans of religious belief should not be bullied into believing that in all things related to the public good, religion is to remain off limits. The constitutional freedom of religion does not mean the constitutional barring of religion from the public square.
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that data on religious practice are important to the nation, to policymakers, and to the research needed to inform the public debate. The gathering of data that touch on religious practice often is blocked in research on social issues funded by the federal government.<sup>146</sup>  Because government funds a huge proportion of the nation's funded social research, this has a chilling effect. But the relationship between religious practice and the social issues under investigation by government, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime and delinquency, addiction, economic dependency, medical and psychiatric problems, and learning capacity, should be explored. A sense-of-the-Congress resolution would remove the excuse that it is not permissible for federally funded research to touch on this aspect of life.
<p>
<li> Congress should mandate a census question on religious practice. The census for the year 2000 ought to ask about frequency of attendance at church or synagogue. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious worship in the United States. Also, many of the annual sample surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census would be significantly better informed if similar information were gathered in those surveys.
<p>
<li> Congress should commission research on the relationship between regular church attendance and social issues. This research should focus on the social issues which continue to increase the burden borne by the American taxpayer, including crime, drug use, health of the elderly, out-of-wedlock births, and poverty.
<p>
<li> Congress should fund federal experiments with school choice that include choice of religiously affiliated schools. To deny financial support to parents who cannot afford to send their children to religiously oriented schools is to deny such education to those children who may need it most and confine it to those rich enough to afford it. The United States of America and the now-defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the only major modern states to deny funding to faith-based schools.
<p>
<li> The President should appoint, and the Senate should confirm, judges who are sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Religion should not be crowded out of every activity in which government is involved. And yet, this is precisely what has been happening for the last 30 years as government has encroached more and more on virtually every area of American life: family, school, and marketplace. This does not make sense for any society -- and it has weakened ours.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Columnist William Raspberry has put his finger on the problem. In his historic majority opinion in the 1947 <i>Everson v. Board of Education</i> case (330 U.S. 1), notes Raspberry, Justice Hugo Black wrote that government is forbidden to "pass laws which aid any religion, aid all religion, or prefer one religion over another." 
<p><blockquote>
	The first and third elements in the Black proscription seem to me to jibe with the "establishment" clause of the Constitution. The middle one suggests that the only proper position of government is hostility to religion -- which seems to be the prevailing view among civil libertarians and a majority of the Supreme Court.<sup>147</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This calls to mind the words of the late William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal of Supreme Court Justices, who wrote in the 1950s:
<p><blockquote>
	We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. [When] the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, [it] respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.<sup>148</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate should ask all future candidates for federal court appointments to clarify their opinions regarding both the role of religion in the life of the body politic and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this problem is far too important to be left to government. America's religious leaders and individual citizens also must act:
<p><ul>
<li> They must draw attention to the enormous and beneficial effects on society of the true practice of religion. As leaders of the nation's religious communities, they should assert their right to be regarded as critical in the nurturing of stable marriages and healthy families. Religion performs the foundational work that ensures the success of secular society's other four basic institutions: family, school, marketplace, and government.
<p>
<li> They must emphasize the need for religious formation. While the social works of mercy carried out by religious congregations will be needed more and more to repair the damage from the breakdown of the family, only a religious institution can give a religious orientation to those who are searching for answers to the mysteries of human life: love and suffering in birth, marriage, family life, and death. Religious beliefs help the individual acquire central organizing principles for life and an understanding of God. Aided by this sense and these principles, an individual can avoid the unnecessary suffering that stems from bad choices and attain the benefits that flow from good choices followed steadily through life. Today, schools are forbidden to participate in this critical work. Only religious leaders can provide this all-important service to society.
<p>
<li> They must take special care of the religious formation of children at risk of losing their faith in God, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence. The empirical research indicates that there is a critical stage in the development of young adults, from around ten years of age through later adolescence, during which they decide whether they will engage in the religious dialogue of searching for ultimate truths and meaning. The young adolescent who turns away from religion at this stage may well lose his anchoring in the community and is at greater risk for a host of problems that can subvert his personal happiness for a lifetime. Increased attention to this aspect of religious ministry will yield great benefits to the nation. Of particular concern to public policy leaders are the problems that plague America's inner cities: out-of-wedlock births, addiction, and crime. These neighborhoods need the benefits of religious belief and practice. They are "mission" territories that beckon loudly.
<p>
<li> They must use the ability of inner-city churches, especially black churches, to help low-income African-Americans escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty. Many religious leaders, with the best of intentions, have concentrated on the material aspects of their work, forgetting that the most powerful help they can give is in the spiritual dimension, and that this has a significant effect on material well-being. Regular church attendance will do more to help a child get out of poverty than anything else the religious leader can provide. And it will transform the community if most people can be persuaded to become church members.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The available evidence clearly demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most significant social problems, some of which, including out-of-wedlock births, have reached catastrophic proportions. Furthermore, it is available to all, and at no cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America is at a crossroads. Political leaders as diverse as President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich all have articulated popular concerns and fears about the level of the breakdown of American society.<sup>149</sup>  Almost simultaneously, Americans are becoming aware of the fundamental contribution that married family life and regular religious practice can make to preserving that society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the sake of the nation's future health, it is time to redirect public policy so that these two vast resources, instead of being weakened further, can be rejuvenated and encouraged. Many of the goals of social policy and social work can be attained, indirectly and powerfully, through the practice of religion. None of this invalidates education or social work, which operate at a different level of the human condition. However, as demands for social work outstrip (and give every indication of far outstripping) social work resources, it is good to know that the practice of religion is a powerful ally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion is good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency, drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Founding Fathers, in their passionate love of freedom, promoted the freedom of all Americans to practice their religious beliefs, but Congress and the courts have crowded religion out of the public square. It is time to bring it back. Religious practice can and should be factored into the planning and debate on the nation's urgent social problems. Americans cannot build their future without drawing on the strengths that come to them from the practice of their religious beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The widespread practice of religious beliefs can only benefit the nation, and the task of reintegrating religious practice into American life while protecting and respecting the rights of non-practice -- rights that, despite persistent demagoguery on the subject, remain totally unthreatened -- is one of the nation's most important tasks. Academics of good will can do much in this area, and history will look kindly on those who help America achieve this wonderful balance.

<li>The benefit of the intrinsic practice of religion certainly be obvious to most ordinary Americans. But in research results, many of the deleterious effects of the extrinsic practice of religion wipe out many of the benefits of intrinsic practice when adherents of both are mixed together in the same piece of research. Most religious research to date does not measure or differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic practice of religion. Despite this shortcoming, the studies cited up to now do not distinguish between these types of religious practice, yet show a very positive outcome. This poses a number of important research issues, chief among them whether this is because there are only a few extrinsics among those who go to church most frequently. For researchers and those who commission research, there is an obvious need to measure whether the person's practice of religion, when it is present, is more intrinsic or extrinsic. Fortunately, a simple validated scale has been developed to measure the person's religious motivation. See Dean R. Hoge, "A Validated Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale," <i>Journal for Scientific Study of Religion</i>, Vol. 11 (1972), pp. 369-376.
<li>    In the view of this author, that tension arises from the effort of the social sciences to contain religion within the canons of the social sciences. However the canons of religion transcend these canons, and therefore cannot be reduced to the dimensions of any of the social sciences, though every social science can describe some facets of religious behavior.

<li>The Gallup survey (Religion in America 1985) continues to indicate that religious commitment is avowed by one-third of Americans as the most important dimension in their lives and that, for another third, religion is considered to be very important (but not the single most dominant) factor. <i>Religion in America: The Gallup Report, Report No. 236, 1985</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Religion Research Center, 1985) quoted in Alan E.

<P><H2>Forbes and term limits' enduring appeal</H2>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
 </CENTER>

<P>To hear the reports about Steve Forbes' prospects in the Republican presidential race in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's a Johnny-One-Note: the flat tax. In fact, Mr. Forbes is a Johnny-Two-Note: He has also been crusading for term limits for the U.S. Congress.

<P>While the media are generally known to be disdainful of term limits, the public has consistently expressed overwhelming approval for virtually every single one of the various proposals to limit the amount of time elected representatives may serve. Whether in the form of state laws that unilaterally limit their own representatives' terms in Congress or a constitutional amendment that would limit the federal terms of all elected officials, public support for term limits is extraordinarily consistent and extensive. One poll last year found 76 percent declaring that they would favor term limits even &quot;if limiting the terms of Congress meant that you would never be able to vote for your current member of Congress or for your senator.&quot;

<P>Before the U.S. Supreme Court last May declared unconstitutional all term-limit laws applying to the U.S. Congress, virtually every state where the issue came to a vote had passed term-limits referenda. By then, 23 states had term-limit laws, including 14 of the 17 contiguous states west of the Mississippi. The historic 5-4 Supreme Court decision, in which both of President Clinton's appointees voted with the majority, means only a constitutional amendment will suffice to impose restrictions on Congress.

<P>Not since the tax revolt issue erupted in 1978 in California with the passage of Proposition 13, which reduced and then limited property taxes, has a political issue gained such resonance among voters. Mr. Forbes' appeal undoubtedly arises from the popularity of both his major issues: tax reform and term limits.

<P>Less than two months before the Supreme Court's decision, the House failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds approval to pass a term-limits constitutional amendment. Many Democratic opponents had hoped - indeed, some of them may have even prayed (in private, of course) - that the court's subsequent decision would make the issue moot for 1996. Well, they had better pray a little harder. The issue is certain to come to the fore in the fall campaign.

<P>At the time the amendment went down in the House last March, a Gallup poll revealed that more of the public held Republicans responsible for the failure than Democrats. No doubt this was a result of the media's spin, gloating about Newt Gingrich's failure to pass a term-limits amendment. In fact, although the idea is not universally endorsed by Republicans, 82 percent of them did vote for the constitutional amendment in the House. Had a mere 50 percent of Democrats supported the amendment, instead of only 19 percent, it would have passed. By the time November rolls around, it is extremely unlikely that the public will be as misinformed about apportioning blame as it was in the immediate aftermath of the March House vote.

<P>In terms of effectiveness of independent efforts, this issue has great potential. Already, term-limit proponents, such as the U.S. Term Limits organization, have said they will exert pressure on 1996 congressional candidates to pledge themselves to vote for a constitutional amendment. These same organizations no doubt will again actively intervene in various races, as Americans for Term Limits did in 1994, helping to defeat then-Speaker Tom Foley, Democrat of Washington, and then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas. And they will be joined by Ross Perot's United We Stand America.

<P>In fact, a Newsweek poll recently found that 68 percent of respondents said Mr. Perot's new Independence Party should work toward passing term limits as either its most important goal (17 percent) or one of several important goals (51 percent). Last April, 40 percent of adults questioned by Gallup said they would be &quot;very likely&quot; and another 29 percent said they would be &quot;moderately likely&quot; to vote for an independent presidential candidate if they believed that only he or she would support term limits for members of Congress. Talk about single-issue dominance. On the margin, these kinds of numbers have landslide potential.

<P>So, how prominently do you think Republicans will feature term limits in their platform? And how vulnerable will the 81 percent of Democrats who voted against a term-limits constitutional amendment be? With numbers like this, it might just be enough to get Bill Clinton to try to steal the issue.

<B>The Budget That Won't Go Away, Tax System Overhaul Gets Another Boost</B></center>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

<P>If Bob Dylan were to wet his finger and wave it above his head to measure which way the wind is blowing, he'd change the lyrics: &quot;The times, they are a'changin' - and changin' back.&quot;

<P>Cultural conservatives are finally feeling their influence at work in the mainstream culture. Cultural indicators for the boomers, now turning gray and 50, are changing, too.

<P>Not so long ago, a liberal was said to turn conservative when his daughter reached junior high. And why not? She enters a public junior high through a metal detector, and her boyfriend gets free condoms from the school nurse.

<P>Grade school has lesser but still troublesome risks. The younger kids might spend half the day learning their lessons in English and half of the day learning the lessons again in Spanish. The alternative, for those who can scrape up the money, is a private school at $12,000 a year, but even they have to be careful not to choose a private school where equally goofy ideas thrive.

<P>Neo-liberals often turn reactionary when their sons and daughters arrive at the elite campuses, such as Yale or Stanford, where &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; studies push out the great books. Chaucer, Milton and Shakespeare are too white, too male, and too dead. Columbus is demoted as a cultural hero because he set out for the New World without having filed an environmental-impact statement.

<P>Cultural conservatives still must climb several steep mountains, but they're on firmer footing than ever.

<P>Sponsors of several trashy daytime shows have cancelled their sponsorship, or are planning to, of the worst offenders. Crusaders William (&quot;Virtues&quot;) Bennett and Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Sam Nunn of Georgia, both Democrats, cite Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Sears and Mars as examples of sponsors taught to have a public conscience. The objects of their ire are shows &quot;that harm our country and our kids.&quot;

<P>The Lieberman/Bennett/Nunn coalition is taking out after the 16,000 buyers of local programming, who met last week in Las Vegas for the annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. They're especially targeting talk trash produced for broadcast during the after-school daytime hours.

<P>Although such cultural polluters are among the most damaging to our children, adults are getting a respite from some of the soft, gauzy &quot;gender&quot; liberalism spawned in the media. The New York Times Sunday magazine has cancelled its &quot;About Men&quot; and &quot;Hers&quot; columns which described emotions such as a mother's frustration in getting her son to play with teacups and her daughter to play with trucks (not guns, of course), or the embarrassment two lesbians felt at the raised eyebrows they provoked when they checked into a motel room for a night together.

<P>When feminists complained of a macho sensibility creeping into the &quot;About Men&quot; confessional columns, the editors moved into &quot;a tender phase,&quot; and published pieces in which men proclaimed: &quot;I do the dishes and love it.&quot; No equal time at the Times.

<P>We've come a long way from Alan Alda's oh-so-sensitive man now. (Alan who?) Even Phil Donahue, who once wore a skirt on his television talk show to show gender solidarity and introduced such sexually titillating topics as male strippers who performed live before his audience and mother-daughter strippers who didn't, is retiring from his show at the end of its 29th season in May.

<P>Even the first lady, a card-carrying liberal, looking for ways to express her tougher inner child, sounds like a cultural conservative - at least some of the time - in her book, &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;

<P>She prescribes &quot;character education&quot; in the public schools, rejects &quot;permissiveness&quot; in raising children, rails against the lyrics of &quot;gangsta rap.&quot; She wants girls to remain chaste until 21, and celebrates the two-parent family over the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; model.

<P>Whether the first lady is being disingenuous or hypocritical, she nevertheless senses what the maturing public wants to hear. You might say she knows which way the wind is blowing.

<H1>The brutal assault on a good reputation</H1></CENTER>

<P>There's an axiom of Arkansas politics that it takes two generations for a family to get back its reputation after someone in the family gets himself elected governor.

<P>Poor Arkansas. The state may never regain its reputation for square dealing and straight shooting - which is actually how most of its sons and daughters, among the most honorable and decent people on earth, deal with one another.

<P>The stereotype of the barefoot hillbilly, with his jug of corn whiskey slung over one shoulder and his long rifle (with which he could put out the eye of a panther at a hundred yards) over the other, has been succeeded by the stereotype of the country lawyer/banker/chickenplucker who could and would pick his neighbor's pocket at a hundred feet.

<P>Many Arkansawyers will tell you, almost tearfully, that if Bill Clinton's reckless personal behavior and irresponsible abuse of the facts has embarrassed the nation, he has humiliated his home state. Hillary has done her part, too, though she gets an asterisk beside her name because she's from Illinois, not Arkansas.

<P>Only last week, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the one-time Arkansas securities commissioner who Mrs. Clinton didn't remember talking to about the troubles Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was having with the state, testified that well, yes, they did have a conversation and it lasted fully five minutes.

<P>Naturally nobody did anything wrong or said anything inappropriate. But we know enough now about how the first lady operates - &quot;there's hell to pay when she doesn't get her way&quot; - that we can guess how that conversation went. Mrs. Schaffer, who was then Miss Bassett, understood that Hillary was the wife of the governor - or &quot;Bill,&quot; as she referred to him in the correspondence telling an assistant to warn the governor that the feds were closing in on Madison S&amp;L -and she was in no position to do anything more than salute the wife. Madison, of course, was the reliable Clinton family piggy bank.

<P>If the rest of the country is getting a little weary of it all, we saw the strain begin to show on the Clintons and their entourage, and their paid pleaders, last week.

<P>Some of the dwindling band of Clinton acolytes among the reporters and commentators, yearning for one more invitation to sup at the White House, naturally went gaga over the president's tribute to the first lady before his State of the Union address at the Capitol. But not all. One of the exceptions, Mark Shields, the PBS commentator, observed that the salute to Hillary was a tribute that the president owed the first lady because she had swallowed hard and stuck by him at the first insinuations that his character was not all that it should be. Now that insinuations have been made against Mrs. Clinton's moral and ethical reputation, payback is only fair.

<P>You didn't have to be Sigmund Freud to detect and understand that icy stare that Mrs. Clinton shot back at her husband after he paid tribute to her as &quot;a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great first lady.&quot;

<P>But unless Mrs. Clinton is unique as an American wife, a woman merely amused by the tales of her husband's heroic sexual adventuring, cutting a swath a mile wide through their friends and employees, she is particularly annoyed now when the tsunami of ethical and moral questions rolls toward the White House and it is she, and not he, who may be asked to drown and to be cheerful about it. She's entitled to wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning to wonder why the faithful wife must sacrifice herself to protect the pact made 25 years ago at Yale Law School to experiment on a guinea pig called Arkansas en route to important things in Washington.

<P>How galling now that she, who has taken such pride over the years in her part in the destruction of Richard Nixon, punishing him for covering up a third-rate political burglary, should now see similar punishment looming for covering up a third-rate bank robbery in a place no longer of any consequence to the Clintons.

<P>The White House, and Democrats generally, get red in the face at comparisons of Whitewater (or &quot;Wifewater,&quot; as the Economist calls it) to the Watergate scandals of nearly a quarter of a century ago. Such comparisons sting because they are so exquisitely apt. Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, perhaps the most faithful of all the Clinton liege men, sneers that comparing Whitewater to Watergate, the Clintons to Nixon, is &quot;like comparing a jaywalker to the Boston Strangler.&quot;

<P>Then Mr. Hunt reaches for the analogy himself: Susan Thomases, he writes, has dispensed &quot;more bad advice to a White House than anyone since Chuck Colson.&quot; Mr. Colson, of course, was convicted of Watergate cover-up crimes. He repented and found forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Any Methodist in Arkansas could explain the difference.

F.Y.I. No. 84<br>
January 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the past year, House and Senate Republicans have been working tirelessly to enact a balanced budget plan that gives America's families much-needed tax relief.<sup>1</sup>  Simultaneously, they have devised a plan to deregulate the U.S. telecommunications industry, freeing it from over six decades of regulatory red tape.<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, these efforts 
have come into conflict because the telecom bill potentially would cheat American families and 
taxpayers out of tens of billions of dollars of tax relief merely to appease special interests within the 
multibillion-dollar broadcast industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Buried deep in the almost 300-page telecom bill, which stalled after a tentative conference  agreement was reached, is a clause requiring that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) carry out an ill-conceived plan giving America's broadcast industry additional licenses to use part of  the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast digital television services. Broadcasters already possess licenses which allow them to provide the traditional analog television programming with which 
most Americans are familiar; now they have convinced Congress and the FCC to give them 
additional licenses to make the transition to superior resolution digital television free-of-charge 
until they can give back their old spectrum licenses for auctioning some time in the future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) has intervened at the last minute and raised serious questions about the fairness of such an enormous giveaway of federal spectrum property without taxpayer compensation. As he told <i>The New York Times</i> recently, "This is a big, big corporate welfare project. Here we're cutting Medicaid and doing all the painful things while we lend [broadcasters] the spectrum for 12 years. Why shouldn't they pay for it?"<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, at a time when Congress is working to balance the federal budget while providing families 
and investors with tax relief, it is ironic that it should give away such a valuable asset to some of the 
wealthiest companies in the country. Experts at the FCC have estimated that auctioning the 
spectrum that broadcasters are demanding could raise as much as $70 billion. To put this into 
perspective, $70 billion would pay for:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Three years of the congressionally approved $500-per-child tax credit that benefits 28 million 
families raising 51 million children.
<p>
<li> The entire economic growth tax package proposed by Congress, including the capital gains tax 
cut.
<p>
<li> $70 billion in debt reduction that would save taxpayers nearly $3 billion each year in interest 
payments on the national debt.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With agreement almost reached on the House and Senate telecommunications bills (H.R. 1555 and 
S. 652), this represents what may be the last chance to alter a disastrous policy which combines the 
worst elements of corporate welfare and industrial policy at the expense of American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>A Misguided and Costly Plan.</b> Many things are wrong with this plan. First, it represents 
arrogant industrial planning on the part of the federal government. Legislators and FCC bureaucrats 
are arguing in essence that a single digital broadcast television channel should emerge to replace the 
current analog channel Americans are used to receiving from major networks. This is the equivalent 
of industrial planning, since federal policymakers in effect are attempting to determine a specific 
outcome within the highly innovative telecommunications industry. No one knows what type of 
video services will be demanded or even viable in the future. But, instead of letting the market 
decide, policymakers are trying to pre-determine the shape of competition within the broadcast 
video marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, broadcasters have justified this giveaway by appealing to false fears and technological 
misperceptions. The truth is, broadcasting can survive without a handout. Someone always will find 
a way to deliver television video programming to consumers at affordable rates. If incumbent 
broadcasters feel they really need additional spectrum to compete with their many new rivals 
(cable, satellite television, on-line computer services, for example), they can purchase it on the open 
market in an auction like everyone else. It is difficult to sympathize with firms like the Walt Disney 
Co. (which just spent $19 billion to acquire ABC) and Westinghouse Electric Corp. (which spent 
$5 billion for CBS) when they plead impoverishment as a defense.<sup> 4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, broadcasters also argue that failure to give them a handout will mean the death of "free over 
the air television."  They apparently want legislators to believe that Americans would rather shell 
out billions more in taxes for deficit reduction than spend the small amount that may be required to 
purchase certain video services from competing providers. The idea that television service will be 
too expensive for Americans to afford without a giveaway is a straw man; competition, not 
corporate handouts, will provide more and better quality television programming at extremely 
affordable rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leads to the fourth and most outrageous broadcast industry justification for the spectrum 
giveaway: that without it, they will not be able to continue to deliver a host of quality "public 
interest" services to the consumer. In other words, they can continue to air quality children's 
programming and other educational fare only if the government gives them additional free licenses. 
This is a questionable justification for free additional spectrum licenses, however, given that 
broadcasters have been criticized so severely in the past precisely for the mediocre quality of their 
television broadcasts. Apparently, they now expect Congress and the American people to ignore 
just how poorly they have lived up to their "public interest" obligations and instead give them just 
one more chance to prove themselves, albeit at substantial cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, other spectrum users are justifiably angry at being forced to spend billions in recent 
auctions of other spectrum licenses for non-broadcast services. Cellular firms, telephone 
companies, the cable industry, and other communications companies are asking why broadcasters 
are receiving free spectrum properties from the government when they have been forced to pay on 
the open market in recent auctions for additional spectrum. To date, these auctions have raised 
almost $10 billion for the U.S. Treasury. This is $10 billion less that American taxpayers and 
families will have to pay to help reduce the deficit. Yet the broadcasters, using specious arguments 
and blatant political influence, have convinced Congress to forgo an additional $10 billion to $70 
billion in spectrum revenues and just give this spectrum away to their industry without taxpayer 
compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Overwhelming Opposition to Multibillion Dollar "Rip-Off."</b>  Although this giveaway 
has gone largely unnoticed by the public, many critics on both the left and right have voiced their 
opposition. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> labeled it "a multi-billion dollar handout for wealthy 
TV-station owners," and warned that Republican capitulation on the issue would be "wildly at odds 
with their anti-entitlement ideology."<sup>5</sup>   The <i>Journal</i> also remarks that this giveaway is all the more remarkable since this is a Congress "desperately scrambling to balance the budget, making 
its job harder by voluntarily forgoing billions in spectrum auction revenues."<sup>6</sup>  Karen 
Kerrigan, president of the <a href="/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, also refers to 
the plan as "one of the greatest government giveaways in history," and notes that it "reflects 
wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset."<sup>7 </sup>  Liberal public-interest groups such as the 
Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way, and the Media Access Project 
also have expressed opposition.<sup> 8</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to <i>Time</i> magazine, "The spectrum handout is a classic example of how 
government subsidies live on after their rationales have expired."<sup>9 </sup>  The editorial page 
of <i>The New York Times</i> also sides with Senator Dole in his effort to stop the "big 
giveaway," arguing that "Mr. Dole is taking the right action to protect taxpayers."<sup>10</sup>  
And <i>Times</i> columnist William Safire calls the giveaway "an outrageous taxpayer rip-
off."<sup>11</sup>  "This rip-off is on a scale vaster than dreamed of by yesteryear's robber barons. 
It's as if each American family is to be taxed $1,000 to enrich the stockholders of Disney, G.E. and 
Westinghouse."<sup>12 </sup>  That is exactly what is about to take place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Families and Investors Will Pay the Price.</b> As mentioned above, it is unlikely that 
broadcasters will be put out of business if forced to bid on spectrum rights through competitive 
auction. However, if taxpayers are cheated out of a significant portion of the tax cuts promised 
them as an element of the balanced budget, they will be hurt significantly. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi83.html">Economic analysis</a> 
conducted by Heritage Foundation economists shows that the tax cut element of the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1995 would add some $1,500 per household in higher GDP than the same plan 
without tax cuts. Also, household income would be increased on average by nearly 
$2,000.<sup>13</sup>  There is no justification for forcing individual families and the economy in 
general to lose these benefits while a few well-connected companies benefit from free spectrum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Answer is to Auction.</b> Even if the auctions did not pull in the full $70 billion, 
anything raised to offset the deficit and lower the burden on American taxpayers and families 
would be worth the effort. But it is very likely an auction of this taxpayer property would generate 
such revenues. The spectrum being given away is among the most valuable in the government's 
possession, since it can be used for multiple applications, not just television broadcasting. William 
Safire has even noted that these numbers may be too low, arguing that the sale of additional 
spectrum eventually could raise a staggering half-trillion dollars for the U.S. 
Treasury.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Equally as important will be the effect of an auction on competition within the entire 
telecommunications industry. Selling off the spectrum will ensure it is put to its most highly valued 
use and mean more competition throughout the industry. As Peter C. Cramton of the University of 
Maryland notes: "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, 
consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which 
are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative 
hearings."<sup>15</sup>  Like lotteries and comparative hearings, which have been used by the 
FCC to distribute TV licenses in the past, this current giveaway would sacrifice market efficiency 
to special-interest influence. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clearly, however, the most important aspect of such an auction would be what it would do for 
American taxpayers and families -- lower the burden the federal deficit places upon them. Again, as 
Cramton argues, "The auction outcome is compelling to taxpayers. So long as budget deficits 
remain a problem, it is hard to imagine that Congress would be able to reverse the auction decision 
without setting off a grass-roots rebellion among taxpayers."<sup>16</sup>  Yet this is exactly 
what is about to occur. If policymakers want to do what is in the best interests of American 
taxpayers and families, they must look beyond the self-interested motivations and misperceptions 
being put forward by the multibillion-dollar broadcast industry, which has nothing to lose and 
everything to gain by taking valuable taxpayer property without compensation.

<title>Wrong Way to Honor Reagan -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3><i>Wrong Way To Honor Reagan</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	What's the best way to pay tribute to a former president?  
<p>
	Well, some have had their faces chiseled into the sides of a famous mountain. A few have 
earned -- pardon the pun -- a stamp of approval, with their likeness adorning stamps issued by the 
U.S. Postal Service. Others appear on our dollar bills and coins. And some even get buildings 
named after them. Usually this makes a good deal of sense. Usually -- but not always. 
<P>
	Consider what's happening in Washington. A soon-to-be-famous building -- or maybe I 
should say, infamous -- now called the Federal Triangle Project needs a name.  
<p>
 	Located two blocks from the White House, this half-a-billion dollar government colossus is 
millions and millions of dollars over budget, lavish beyond compare, and almost four years behind 
schedule.  
<p>
	The building has 3.1 million square feet of space -- second in size only to the huge 
Pentagon complex, which has 3.9 million square feet. It sprawls across 11 acres and rises 10 stories 
high, with five more levels underground. When the complex opens in December 1996, it will have 
85 elevators, eight escalators, a six-story atrium, 13,000 doors, limestone exteriors, a limestone 
rotunda, 904 windows, several live-performance theaters, a health club, an elaborate food court, 
storefront offices, and plans for a 620-seat auditorium and movie theater. Now the bureaucrats can 
enjoy a movie during their extended coffee breaks! 
<p>
	As the most grandiose government building ever erected, the Federal Triangle Project 
represents the ultimate monument to government waste. 
<p>
	So whose name do you think they want to put on this monstrosity? Lyndon Johnson, who 
launched the government's failed $5.4 trillion War on Poverty? Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., 
maybe? He's long been known as Mr. Pork Barrel on Capitol Hill.  
<p>
	Nope. Actually official Washington has proposed naming the building after the man who 
tried hardest to stop wasteful government spending, the anti-waste crusader himself: Ronald 
Reagan. 
<p>
	Incredible, but true. Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan. and Sen. Daniel P.  
Moynihan, D-N.Y., want to honor the former president by naming the structure the Ronald 
Reagan Building and International Trade Center. 
<p>
	They ought to know better. Reagan is the one president in recent memory most identified 
with fighting big government. In his eight years in the White House, he waged a relentless battle to 
bring big government to heel. Now they want to honor this valiant effort with a building costing 
$656 million: the most expensive government building ever.
<p>
	Someone needs to stop this travesty. Ronald Reagan wanted to reduce the size of 
government, not expand it. He wanted to get the bureaucracy off the backs of the American people, 
not house it in palatial splendor. Naming this bureaucratic Taj Mahal in his honor seems the least 
fitting tribute I can think of.
<p>
	Ironically, some of the agencies hand-picked by Clinton administration officials to move 
into the complex would have been eliminated during the Reagan era if Congress would have gone 
along.
<p>
	There are lots of  better ways to honor President Reagan than by putting his name on this 
government monstrosity. As his son, radio talk-show host Michael Reagan, said recently, Ronald 
Reagan should be on Mount Rushmore. Not Mount Wastemore.

<h3><i>Revolution Makers</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
Washington's big-government establishment was stunned in November 1994 when 
conservatives took over Congress. Their surprise, I think, is testimony not 
only to their arrogance -- but to their ignorance as well.
<p>
For years, liberals have dismissed conservatives as kooks, cranks and crazies. 
Rather than debate our ideas -- and defend their own -- they have preferred to 
rest on their (rapidly decaying) laurels. And while they were busy calling us 
names and ramming their costly utopian schemes down our throats -- schemes that 
didn't work, of course -- we were organizing, networking, writing, thinking, 
debating and refining our ideas and institutions.
<p>
A good example of the conservative movement's commitment to grassroots 
mobilization is the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, the <a 
href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a> (ACU) -- which recently 
celebrated its 30th anniversary.
<p>
The ACU started when Sen. Barry Goldwater lost to Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 
presidential race. Instead of knuckling under to what looked like a liberal 
tidal wave, a small group of concerned conservatives met to rally and 
re-energize. That core group formed the ACU, which now boasts a membership 
topping 1 million. The ACU was one of the first groups to encourage Ronald 
Reagan to seek the presidency in 1976. After Reagan announced he would run, the 
ACU began one of the first independent, non-party-affiliated campaigns on 
behalf of a presidential candidate. Since then, other grassroots organizations 
like the Christian Coalition and the Traditional Values Coalition have launched 
similar campaigns that have established indispensable networks of support for 
conservative ideas and candidates.
<p>
The ACU has kept busy, year in and year out, drumming up support for 
conservative causes such as a balanced budget, the creation of a national 
missile-defense system, curbing the growth of the federal bureaucracy, a 
free-market economy, a belief in limited government, a confidence in 
traditional moral values and a commitment to a strong national defense.
<p>
Today, the ACU is best known for its annual ranking of congressmen based on how 
they vote on a representative sample of key political issues. A good 
conservative ranking with the ACU is often touted in campaigns and worn as a 
badge of merit among members of Congress. Of course, a negative ACU ranking 
also has its uses ...
<p>
Groups like the ACU and <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have 
always stood up for the ideals that led the way to victory in 1994 and are 
still transforming Washington -- ideals the liberal left  still treats as "new" 
and unpalatable. And we are not alone in the struggle against the liberal 
establishment.
<p>
In 1995, a number of conservative organizations celebrated significant 
anniversaries, providing further evidence that the 1994 elections were no 
accident. <a href="/nationalreview/">National Review</a>, that lively "bible" 
of conservative opinion, reached a milestone: its 40th anniversary. With 
profound insight and humor, National Review and its founder and editor-at-large 
William F. Buckley Jr. have introduced several generations to an intellectual 
tradition based upon prudence, respect for the past, religious belief and 
common sense.
<p>
Commentary magazine, the important "neoconservative" monthly edited for 35 
years by Norman Podhoretz, observed its 50th anniversary just recenly. It 
remains an intellectual joy, hosting on its pages the incisive observations of 
America's best minds under Podhoretz's hand-chosen successor, Neal Kozodoy. 
Looking slightly ahead, Heritage will celebrate its 25th anniversary in 1998 -- 
just a neophyte in comparison to our colleagues. 
<p>
Prior to the 1994 elections, the left underestimated the intellectual vigor and 
tenacity of the conservative movement, and its ability to mobilize support. Not 
anymore. Liberals now realize we can win Washington back; or, if we have to, 
dig in for the long war and fight in the trenches until we get our next chance. 
Groups like the ACU have built this legacy.

<title>Special Interests Still Get Your Money -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>SPECIAL INTERESTS STILL GET YOUR MONEY</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

	Washington loves to wring its hands over a complex problem few people understand, 
enact reforms that don't really solve it, and then crow about having made the world a better place 
when election time rolls around. This is exactly what will happen as a result of a "reform" 
enacted last year ostensibly to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and political activity.
<p>	The problem, in a nutshell, is this: There are many special-interest lobbying groups that 
get much of their funding from you, the taxpayer. Instead of finding out whether you agree with 
their cause and asking for a contribution, these groups take the lucrative shortcut of going to 
Congress. They convince lawmakers to grant large sums to certain programs and then sign up to 
receive funding through those same programs. In effect, they've found a way to get your money 
whether you agree with their cause or not.
<p>	It's easy to muddy debate over such a problem with dire predictions of suffering and 
mayhem if this or that group is no longer able to raid the public trough. So, the public is rarely 
permitted to see the real issue clearly. But this time around, the debate became clear enough that 
even lawmakers -- and lobbyists -- worried about a backlash. They enacted a reform that seemed 
to do something about taxpayer-funded lobbying. Only problem is, they left open a loophole 
wide enough to drive a busful of lobbyists through. 
<p>	Under the new law, big lobbying groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens 
(NCSC) and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), known by their tax-code 
designation of 501(c)4, may no longer receive federal grants or contracts, since the Internal 
Revenue Code states that these groups may engage in an unlimited amount of lobbying. Both the 
NCSC and AARP currently benefit from $70 million to $80 million in taxpayers' money each 
year, amounting to 96 percent and 20 percent of their budgets, respectively.
<p>	But the measure doesn't prevent these groups from simply forming 501(c)3 charitable 
organizations which can accept federal money. In fact, both the AARP and NCSC already have 
such affiliated groups. No wonder the defenders of welfare for lobbyists launched no opposition 
to the new lobbying reform provision. They understood it was not a threat. 
<p>	Unfortunately, this isn't the only problem with the new law. For example, the reform 
focused solely on 501(c)4 lobbying groups, while ignoring labor unions and other big taxpayer-
funded groups such as Planned Parenthood, which represent a significant share of the existing 
abuse. The simple fact is that no special-interest group that engages in lobbying or political 
activity should be subsidized by the taxpayers. The question isn't whether or not the causes these 
groups espouse are just, or whether or not you agree with them. The question is whether all 
Americans should be forced to pay for them, whether they want to or not.
<p>	This isn't a liberal vs. conservative issue. The American people are a diverse population 
with differing political views. To force hard-working taxpayers to contribute to political causes 
they may abhor is wrong. It is just as bad to fund the NCSC, the AFL-CIO, or Planned 
Parenthood -- three major offenders --  as it would be to send grants to the National Rifle 
Association or Christian Coalition.	
<p>	The new year brings new opportunities for Congress to end these abuses. For example, 
the appropriations committees should examine programs like the Labor Department's Senior 
Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) that serve as slush funds for lobbyists. The 
SCSEP provides $320 million (out of a $400 million allotment) to just nine lobbying groups like 
NCSC and AARP to subsidize their operations.
<p>	Congress should compel witnesses testifying before congressional committees to divulge 
any federal funding they receive. In addition, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., has suggested a "Let 
America Know Amendment" that would force taxpayer-subsidized groups to disclose the extent 
of their political advocacy. Both of these reforms would go a long way toward increasing 
awareness of this vitally important issue.
<p>	But most important, Congress should close off any and all avenues and loopholes by 
which lobbying groups can receive taxpayer funding. This should be high on the list of 
unfinished business this year.

<title>Guess Who's Getting Your Campaign Contribution? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>GUESS WHO'S GETTING YOUR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION?</h3>
By Corinne Coldwell<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	You know that voluntary check-off box on your federal income-tax form for contributing 
to presidential campaigns? Who do you think is collecting all that money? President Clinton, 
maybe? Or Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., and the other GOP contenders for the nation's highest 
office? 
<p>	As a matter of fact, many legitimate presidential contenders have collected "presidential 
matching funds" this year. But so has a candidate whose platform includes a provision to 
colonize Mars.
<p>	Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was released from prison two years ago after duping his 
supporters out of $34 million for a 1988 presidential bid, is among the many candidates who 
have applied for matching funds to finance his latest campaign.
<p>	LaRouche began his perennial bids for the presidency when public money became 
available 20 years ago. In fact, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) decision to deny LaRouche 
public funds in 1992  -- when he was running his presidential campaign out of prison -- was 
overturned in court last year, granting him $568,534 in taxpayer dollars. 
<P>	With such lavish funding, he is able to promote his paranoid suspicions, for example, that 
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has spied for the Russians, and that Queen Elizabeth II 
is involved in the international drug trade. 
<p>	Since 1976 millions of Americans have designated some of their tax dollars to fund 
presidential campaigns, unaware that this setup allows people like LaRouche to tap into the 
public trust fund. The money becomes available to "qualified" candidates through the FEC.  
<p>	But since the FEC is a government body, it is not allowed to make political judgments. 
And since the public funds are not guided by taxpayers' philosophical commitments to particular 
candidates, tax dollars inevitably wind up going to political extremists attracted by government 
subsidies.
<p>	For example, last November LaRouche submitted a request for matching funds to the 
tune of $261,235, outpacing legitimate presidential contenders Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
($240,524), Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., ($157,553), Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn.,  ($71,039), 
former Tennessee Governor and Education Secretary Lamar Alexander ($205,471) and 
California Governor Pete Wilson, ($71,571), who subsequently dropped out of the race.  
<p>	There's more. Take the case of Lenora Fulani, the New York City psychologist who 
inexplicably calls herself a "major-minor" candidate. Calling for free medicine, free housing, and 
free education, this perennial leftist candidate has never explained how she would pay for these 
services. But she's found a convenient way to pay for her campaigns: the taxpayer. From 1984 to 
1992, she received $3.5 million in taxpayer funds, even though her support never has reached 1 
percent. She is expected to run in 1996 as well.  Given her history, she will be certified to receive 
matching funds once again.
<p>	One would think Congress would be working to change the situation. Yet, a bipartisan 
campaign-finance measure currently making its way through the Senate (with a companion bill 
being drafted in the House) does not deal with public financing.  
<p>	Fewer and fewer Americans are checking the matching-funds box. While 28.7 percent of 
taxpayers designated $1 to campaigns in 1980, only 14.5 percent checked the box in 1993. In 
fact, participation has fallen off so dramatically that Congress increased the check-off to $3. By 
trebling the check-off in 1993, receipts rose by $43.7 million despite participation being halved. 
<p>	The public no longer supports taxpayer-subsidized political campaigns. While public 
financing supporters say it will help tomorrow's Lincoln shoot for the moon, in reality it is 
helping today's LaRouche reach for Mars.

<title>Virtuous Reality: Character Building in the Information Age -- Policy 
Review --Jan/Feb 96 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Virtuous Reality:</h2><br>
<h3>Character-Building in the Information Age</h3>
by <b>Jeb Bush</b> & <b>Brian Yablonski</b>
<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

	The Founding Fathers of this country understood that the survival of our democracy depends 
on the good character and virtue of the American people. George Washington declared in his 
Farewell Address that "virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government."
<p>
	Today our political system is threatened by a cultural decline unprecedented in our nation's 
history. The growth of crime, the collapse of the family, the failure of education, and the loss of 
hope for the future are all symptoms of a broader moral crisis. Americans have relinquished 
responsibility for governing ourselves, expecting government to solve our problems. The 
betterment of society starts from the bottom up, through virtuous individuals and families and 
communities, not from the top down through more government. 
<p>
	Over the past 30 years, government has assumed more and more responsibility for the welfare 
of our children and families. Despite the best of intentions, the governmental response has been 
more laws, more regulations, and more programs to protect children from the parents and adults 
who have let them down. Social legislation in this area now includes welfare, no-fault divorce, 
child protective services, the juvenile justice system, centralized education, and government 
programs for child support, foster care, and adoption.

<p>
	Yet the institutions that have evolved from this social legislation have presided over an 
increasing number of divorces and out-of-wedlock births. They have watched as AFDC benefits 
have become an attractive alternative to marriage. State regulations have made it more difficult 
for adoptions to occur. The foster-care system often does more harm to the child than good. 
Child-support enforcement has been a disaster. Parents have less and less say in the education of 
their children. On top of all this, the average family now pays 40 percent of its income to 
government at all levels. 
<P>
	We have abdicated to government our responsibilities in increments not discernible to the 
naked eye, but so consistently that it has become the greatest threat to our freedom in modern 
times.
<p>
	We often forget that the original purpose of democratic government was to <i>protect the 
rights of individuals and to provide for things which we could not possibly provide for on our 
own</i>. Abraham Lincoln said it best when he wrote that the legitimate object of government is 
"to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or 
cannot do so well for themselves. In all that the people can individually do as well for 
themselves, government ought not to interfere." As examples of legitimate government 
functions, Lincoln listed maintenance of roads and bridges, disposal of deceased men's property, 
and support of the helpless young. Lincoln knew that government is no substitute for a virtuous 
citizenry that takes care of families and communities.
<p>
	James Q. Wilson, one of the foremost modern scholars on the subject of cultivating virtues, 
has written that having good character means at least two things: empathy and self-control. 
Empathy is the ability to take into account the rights, needs, and feelings of others. Self-control is 
the practice of deferred gratification or being more concerned with the long-term impact of 
conduct than with the "here and now."
<p>
	Thus, character is of primary importance in that it determines whether individuals will be 
selfish or selfless. When we act, do we only take into account our own personal good or do we 
have in mind the common good and the effects our conduct will have on the welfare of others? 
Many of our cultural pathologies are a simple reflection of character, of placing the self at the 
center of one's life. How we ensure a healthy supply of citizens committed to the common good? 
How do we cultivate virtue and persons of strong character into the next generation?
<p>
	The moral education of our children has traditionally been left in the hands of parents, 
extended family, the neighborhood, the school, the church or synagogue, and to some extent 
other civic associations. But look at the condition of each of these institutions. Our children are a 
reflection of our ailing social institutions, families, and communities. The indicators show that 
those character-forming institutions traditionally charged with a youngster's moral development 
have suffered their own disintegration.
<p>
<b>Virtues, Not Values</b>
<p>
	Some of the difficulty can be traced to an overreliance on government and a willingness to 
step back from our own character-building responsibilities. But this is only part of problem -- 
and, hence, only part of the solution. The trouble goes deeper than a simple surrender to 
government. Unfortunately, these character-building institutions have lost the language of virtue.
<p>
	Our complex and diverse society now functions not under a universal set of moral principles 
but rather under competing personal and group value systems. Values -- embodied in personal 
beliefs, opinions, and preferences -- have replaced virtues as our moral beacons, and there are 
many different value systems present in our culture. Our character-building institutions have 
bought into the idea that we have to recognize any and all value systems. Instead of providing us 
guidance, they now provide us with the tools to justify a wide variety of deviant behaviors. In 
other words, they do not teach our children right from wrong, but rather how to make informed 
choices. As one prison chaplain recently observed, our young children need direction, not 
choices.
<p>
	The distinction is critical. Virtues, grounded in universal moral absolutes, represent standards 
of behavior that are fixed and firm in any civilized society. Who would argue that fortitude, 
prudence, justice, temperance, discipline, responsibility, honesty, honor, and compassion are not 
good things? Listen to William Bennett: "Teaching virtue to our children need not be a 
controversial undertaking. Forming good character in young people does not mean having to 
instruct them on thorny issues like abortion, creationism, homosexuality, or euthanasia. . . . 
People of good character are not all going to come down on the same side of difficult political 
and social issues."
<p>
	Values, on the other hand, refer to a system of individualized beliefs and preferences. 
Everyone has values -- even Nazis and street gangs. Overemphasizing values accentuates our 
differences, so that the values of self-expression and individualism now trump the virtues of 
deferred gratification, responsibility, and commitment to family.
<p>
	While public policy over the last three decades focused more on recognizing the differences 
between groups of people and their competing value systems, it did little in the way of 
reinforcing the common bonds between all peoples -- the moral absolutes that transcend politics, 
race, and gender. Virtues, and the moral imperatives implied by them, were either lost in the 
debate or they were mischaracterized as values -- subjective and relative, personal, and specific 
to a particular person or group.
<p>
	Recently, we conducted a simple, highly unscientific experiment designed to see how often 
we use the word "virtuous" in our popular culture. In Florida's major newspapers, we found only 
a few random uses of the word "virtuous," frequently out of context. For example, since 1989, 
the Orlando Sentinel has used the word "virtuous" to describe somebody or something on 92 
occasions, or slightly more than once a month. The <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> has used the 
word 140 times since 1987, or fewer than once a month. In most cases, "virtuous" was merely a 
term used to describe a character in a movie, theater, or book or, sometimes, a person in an 
obituary -- in other words, nonpeople and dead people. This is certainly not to say that the 
newspapers are not reporting on the good deeds of virtuous people. We just aren't calling them 
virtuous anymore.
<p>
<b>Quiet Acts of Compassion</b>
<p>
	Correcting our social pathologies will take time. It will require a renewal of virtue and 
character and a rejuvenation of those institutions that teach virtue and character. This means we 
must regain confidence in passing moral judgments, using the language of virtue, and teaching 
virtue to our children.
<p>
	We must also learn from everyday heroes. Our own state of Florida is blessed by an 
extraordinary number of men and women of character. It is important that we begin to discuss 
character in the context of those who exhibit it routinely. We must elevate the people who are 
redefining our culture for the good, for they are the profiles in character from whom we must 
learn.
<p>
	In Florida, you will find some of our greatest profiles in character in the places where you 
might least expect to find them. Take Delwyn Collins, a kitchen worker in Tampa General 
Hospital. On most days, you will find Delwyn mopping floors or washing dishes in a corner of 
the hospital's kitchen. But each year, Delwyn Collins devotes a large portion of his earnings 
from his $6-per-hour job to support the Angel Tree program, which provides toys for orphans 
and foster children in the Tampa area.

<p>	For years, Delwyn has pulled dozens of paper angels from the hospital's Angel Tree: 
Each angel bears the name of a orphan or foster child who does not experience a Christmas with 
family members, or the joys -- and toys -- that attend the holiday. They become Delwyn's 
children.
<p>
	Last year, Delwyn pulled 35 of the paper ornaments from the Angel Tree. Delwyn does not 
drive a car, so he brings toys to the hospital by pulling them on a flatbed wagon or loading them 
in his bicycle basket. His quiet acts of compassion caught the attention of many in his 
community. In 1995, Hillsborough County passed over several local politicians who were 
nominated to present its Moral Courage of the Year Award to the soft-spoken kitchen worker.
<p>
	Talk to some of the children who inhabit the Miami home of Dorothy Perry, dubbed "the 
Mother Teresa of public housing." For 20 years, Perry has been a surrogate mother to children 
whose parents were strung out on crack or alcohol, or worked three jobs and had no energy left 
for parenting. Her "Youths Progressing" program offers meals, clothes, and safe haven for more 
than 35 abused or displaced kids, ranging in ages from one to 21.
<P>
	"I think this program saved my life," says James Holley, 20. "My mother was having 
problems with drugs, and the state was talking about taking me from her. I didn't have anywhere

<h2>Reflections on the Revolution</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a>
</center><P>
<P>
<I>&quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are
in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going
to land.&quot;</I>
<br><I>       --Eleanor Roosevelt</I>
<P>
 As Americans prepare to vote in the forthcoming Presidential
election, our national politics is in turmoil.  The 1990s has
witnessed the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of the two
major parties in modern times.  George Bush went from stratospheric
approval ratings to losing the Presidency in a three-way race
in which Ross Perot received the largest percent of the popular
vote of any third party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt.  Yet
just two years later, the Clinton Presidency lay in shambles as
the Republicans took control of Congress for the first time in
40 years. The American electorate increasingly identifies not
with Republicans, nor with Democrats, but with a party that does
not (for all intents and purposes) exist -- the &quot;independents.&quot;
<P>
 As elected officials daily flee their membership in the Democratic
party, Americans are increasingly confused over whether the parties
stand for anything.  Is there such a creature as a &quot;New Democrat,&quot;
or is Bill Clinton's party still a high tax and spend coalition
of liberal interest groups?  Where are the Republicans heading,
toward the reactionary Buchanan or the futuristic Gingrich?  When
asked what percentage of promises they thought politicians typically
broke, Americans recently responded with the staggering total
of 78 percent.  During Ross Perot's mercurial Presidential challenge,
70 percent of the American people declared no confidence in either
political party.
<P>
 National politics during the 1990s is driven by the simple fact
that Americans believe, as Ross Perot so succinctly put it, &quot;the
government is broken and we need to fix it.&quot; Whether it is
the national debt, decaying inner cities or regulatory burdens,
 citizens feel that the Federal government is less an ally than
a threat to their making the good life.  Fewer than a third of
the American people believe that the government does the right
thing -- down from about 80 percent a couple of decades ago. 
The voters place the blame for this squarely on the seeming inability
of elected officials' from both parties to produce the necessary
changes.
<P>
Yet through all this confusion a new vision for the proper role
of government in society is emerging to replace the legacy of
the New Deal (the idea that centralization, bureaucracy and government
could solve every problem).  It is around the principles of the
information age that the vision of a New Majority coalition will
form and define a new era in American politics.
<P>
It is difficult to describe the new era because our political
discourse is still dominated by the language of the New Deal/Great
Society era.   Many political analysts still talk in terms of
stitching together a coalition of interest-based demographic groups.
 When Eleanor Roosevelt spoke the words above in 1932, the people
coming together to form the New Deal did not yet know where they
were going.  It took them a generation to develop the language
with which we today are so familiar.  Today's emerging New Majority
finds itself in much the same position as the First Lady --  they
know they are leaving the past behind and creating a new political
order, but they do not yet know where they will end up.
<P>
 Replacing an old political order is messy and confusing.  It
often seems as if the public is not sure exactly what it wants.
 On the one hand -- if you believe the results of the 1992 Presidential
election - the voters say they want an activist government.  Yet,
when they tried to create an  &quot;activist&quot; health care
system, President Clinton and the Democrats were rejected.  The
public then embraced a Contract with America that called for drastically
delimiting the power of the Federal government.  Taken as a whole,
these conflicting demands signal an era of change.
<P>
 American politics is no longer a fight over the size of New Deal
programs.  Since FDR, voters may have argued over how much should
be spent, but the majority of Americans never questioned the fundamental
principle of the New Deal:  that Federal government programs were
the appropriate way to solve America's problems, whether old-age
pensions through Social Security, the poor through welfare, or
pollution through the Environmental Protection Agency.  And the
truth be told, there was little reason for Americans to question
this principle because, by and large, the New Deal and its programs
<I>did </I>make the United States a better place to live.
<P>
 But today that is no longer so.  Social Security and Medicare
are near bankruptcy and will not be able to support the Baby Boomers
as they begin to retire early next century (now less than four
years away).  No longer is welfare helping widows and infants,
but instead facilitating an urban underclass that threatens to
tear apart America's social fabric.  And Federal regulations have
gone from the sensible to the absurd. The reason these programs
suddenly seem to be the problem rather than the solution is that
the world in which they were created no longer exists.
<P>
 American society is transforming itself away from the industrial
age that has dominated the past century just as surely as it moved
away from the agrarian age during the time of our nation's founding.
 &quot;Our age&quot; is yet to be determined.  We know that it
will be overwhelmingly influenced by the information technology
that is now upon us -- every day we hear something new about the
Internet, Cyberspace and virtuality.  This is already manifesting
itself in our politics.
<P>
The so-called Republican Revolution of 1994 occurred not on election
day but the moment President Clinton's bureaucratic and centralized
health care plan died in a Democratic Congress.  Americans rejected
an industrial age design being imposed upon them in the information
age.  Nothing demonstrated the death of the New Deal paradigm
more than President Clinton's recent balanced budget proposal.
 It was not the balanced budget per se that was important. It
was that the man who campaigned as a &quot;New Democrat&quot;
capitulated to the philosophical direction of the New Majority.
It was no longer a debate about increasing government spending,
taxation or centralization of programs (like health care) but
about a totally new political direction - smaller, less centralized
government.
<P>
Just as the election of Eisenhower did not mean the end of the
New Deal's philosophical hegemony, neither would Bill Clinton
or any other candidate's election in 1996 mean the end of the
emerging principles of the New Majority. As all successful revolutionaries
know:  There comes a time to stop the revolt, know you have destroyed
the old order, and begin building a new one.
<P>
<B>The Role of Government: Devolve, Diffuse and Connect Through Competition &amp; Community</B>
<P>
 The outlines of the principles on which to build the new political
age are becoming clear.  The bureaucratic, centralized government
design will be replaced because the information age demands a
new organization. As General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have learned,
decentralization and human capital are the hallmarks of the new
age.  While the private sector has been learning this lesson for
more than a decade, government and academia have been the last
to understand the new era.
<P>
The three major trends that will enable this to occur in the new
era will be devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution is
sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Within a few years it
will be a flood. The pioneering efforts of such states as Wisconsin
and Michigan will be recognized as the beginning. If Medicaid
and Welfare are returned to the states, this trend will have been
firmly established.
<P>
 Diffusion is relying on non-governmental organizations or individuals
to perform many of the functions government usurped during the
industrial era.  The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary
organizations, charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion.
Cities such as Indianapolis and Jersey City are building models
of diffusion.
<P>
I need to make one cautionary point about diffusion. Ronald Reagan
used to talk about how the &quot;dead hand of government&quot;
would stifle and cripple mediating institutions, and he was right:
Voluntary organizations' and charities' original social purposes
withered because of government's absorption of their functions
into the welfare state.  It is obvious that government cannot
immediately withdraw from these functions and expect churches
and charities to automatically fill the void. These &quot;charitable
muscles&quot; have not been exercised in a long time, and there
must be a transition period during which government gives over
these responsibilities while charitable institutions regain the
skills and knowledge to reclaim their original purposes.
<P>
 The final trend is connection. This has less to do with government
than with individuals. We must return to the sense of community
we once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help -- and feel a responsibility for --  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors. In this respect
I agree with Hillary Rodham Clinton's diagnosis of the problem:
It takes a village! I disagree totally with her prescribed cure:
 more intrusive government. Government cannot build villages;
it is more likely to raze them.
<P>
 To be able to devolve, diffuse and connect, America needs a serious
discussion about the role of government. As the disagreement with
Mrs. Clinton shows, this may be the definitive difference between
the evolving left and right in politics. It may take a Presidential
election as definitive as 1932 to cement the principles of the
New Majority as the reigning paradigm.
<P>
<B>The Ties that Bind: Our 21st Century Opportunity</B>
<P>
 The industrial era brought havoc to an unknowing and bewildered
populace.  Social norms and cultural promises were broken, the
economy shifted from one dependent on artisans and entrepreneurs
to one built by large-scale factories.  Workers moved from being
independent operators to cogs in assembly-line machines.  Individuals
lost control of their lives as it increasingly passed into the
hands of the experts, engineers and managers who determined the
rules of work.  These changes undermined people's  traditional
sense of order.  They scrambled for a new political paradigm that,
like the new factories, would emphasize mass programs, bureaucratic
control and order.
<P>
This order did not come to pass immediately. From the Progressives
at the turn of the century onward, an increasing number of Americans
began to coalesce around a conception of government and governance
that viewed centralized, bureaucratic programs as the appropriate
provider of solutions.  Yet it was not until the New Deal that
a majority of the electorate believed in this view of the role
of government, a conception that would dominate American politics
for the next 40 years.
<P>
The emerging majority realizes that the principles behind the
New Deal are dead, and voted for Republican control of Congress
in 1994 to bury its programs as well.  Yet this begs a question:
 What next?  If the animating spirit of the New Deal will not
work for this new information age, what will?  Is there a new
view about the role of the government in American life around
which a new political majority will form?
<P>
 The answers are still vague, but broad outlines seem to be coming
into focus.  Government, especially government in Washington,
will have a diminished, supportive role rather than the supreme
role it has enjoyed.  With the national government no longer seen
as the solution to all our problems, national politics will no
longer be a zero-sum game of who gets the next Federal program
enacted for their cause and who gets to impose their views on
whom.  Government will instead focus on empowering citizens and
the communities they form to solve their own problems.  Through
the use of vouchers and other tools, people will choose the best
means to achieve their goals, rather than be subject to the one-size-fits
all approach of today's government programs.  The vision of the
New Majority recognizes communities (mediating institutions) are
the strength and backbone of a healthy American civilization,
and pluralism the answer to competing values.

<title>Jacobs: Judge ideas by results, not intentions -- PFF</title>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>Judge Ideas by Results, Not Intentions</h2>
By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center>
<P>
 My friend Sidney Hook, in his transition from a Marxist to its
most vociferous and effective critic, articulated the double-standard
applied by the left when evaluating socialism and capitalism.
<P>
&quot;I was guilty of judging capitalism by its operations and
socialism by its hopes and aspirations; capitalism by its works
and socialism by its literature,&quot; he explained.
<P>
I was most fortunate to know Sidney Hook, the renowned philosopher,
well enough to have a number of discussions and arguments with
him. I rarely prevailed in any arguments. The only time I came
close was when I asked him define his, then, current politics.
He said, &quot;Suppose I would call myself a democratic socialist,&quot;
reflecting, I thought, his reluctance to go all the way to &quot;conservative.&quot;
The word oxymoron had not been invented then, so I said, &quot;But,
Sidney, that's inherently self-contradictory.&quot; His terse
reply, &quot;You may be right,&quot; was as close as I ever came
to winning a point with him.
<P>
The socialist theoreticians are so used to comparing their theory
to other theories that they cannot bring themselves to evaluate
their theories in light of reality. In its 75 years, the great
Russian empire dominated a large part of the world and its reduction
of socialist theory to practice failed miserably.
<P>
Ask the convinced socialist or the passionate advocate of central
planning why he persists in promoting a system which has been
a demonstrated failure and the likely answer will be: &quot;If
only the right people had been involved, it could have worked.&quot;
<P>
They insist that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the
system. It's just that the people in charge failed to implement
it properly. If only the right people (implied, &quot;such as
me&quot;) had been at the helm, things might have been different.
But that is the precisely the point. Men are imperfect - even
those that construct the most exquisite theories. Inevitably they
produce imperfect results.
<P>
The final test is always, in engineering terminology, reduction
to practice. Many wonderful things have resulted from well-intentioned
actions, but many harmful things have, too.  Equally, many great
things may not have been accomplished because of excessive caution.
<P>
It's tempting to describe these contracting impulses as mature
and immature, but that may be too judgmental.  We need the untrammeled
emotions to integrate ourselves from childhood to adulthood. 
But Having reached adulthood, must we lose our wonderment and
surrender to cynicism?
<P>
&quot;Maturity&quot; is the best balance btween the restrictive
obligations of the real world and the lack of restrain of our
youthful yearnings.  In phiosophic jargon, we have the classic
conflict between &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;order.&quot;
<P>
That segment of society which nourishes the childhood yearning
in us, I choose to call the art world.  Those I inlude are, of
course, the artists, the composers, the craftsmen, but also those
who write -- newspapers, books, poetry, plays.  Inlude as well
the performers, screen and television actors, the sportsmen, the
musicians, the magicians, the jugglers and the comedians -- in
short, those who successfully stimulate our emotions.
<P>
These people all appeal primarily to our childlike instincts --
those of us that are uninhibited by the restrictions of civilized
society.  They are constructive and important parts of our adult
life when filtering out the dark, destructive sides of our instinctual
youthful behavior -- the &quot;childishness,&quot; if you will.
 Along with our maturity and sense of responsibility we accept
with joy and gratitude what these wonderful people have to offer
us.  For they nourish our emotions without any boudaries of inhibition.
<P>
An important segment of the conservative world also possesses
this childlike quality to some degree.  Inventors, scientific
leaders and entrepreneurs all have a childlike longing for daring
innovation.  But scientists are, at the same time, conservative
in their willingness to test their intuitive leaps in the laboratory.
<P>
Of necessity, those who appeal to our hearts so effectively, must
themselves have a connection or a sensitivity to the child in
all of us.  How else can they be effective?  How can they know
what our hearts yearn for?  Yet even they must be bound by the
dimensions of the real world.
<P>
Most thoughtful people reject the mechanistic concept of &quot;maturity&quot;
and recognize that the full life demands both it and the childlike
impulses of which dreams are made.  Liberal thought is less inhibited.
 Conservative thought is more constrained.  But neither liberals
nor conservatives have a monopoly on wishing things were better.

<h2>Whose Values Mr. President?</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
</center><P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton has left the Republicans speechless.  For months
now, every time the President said he wanted a budget reflecting
and upholding American values, Republicans responded they wanted
a budget balanced in seven years with real numbers.  Clinton finally
met their demand, producing a plan that he says balances the budget
<I>and</I> reflects American values.
<P>
 Calling his plan too &quot;liberal&quot; every time the President
tells Americans he is protecting Medicare, education and the environment
is not going to win the GOP many points in the court of public
opinion.  As part of a winning public relations strategy, Republicans
must answer head on each of the President's claims.
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his Medicare proposals.  Are they the values of elderly
Americans relying on a healthcare program that even Clinton's
own advisers told him last spring faces bankruptcy without major
changes?  Are they the values of working Americans who will see
their payroll taxes continue to rise to unbearable heights to
fund an out-of-control cost spiral of a program? Or is Bill Clinton
still promoting the values of Ira Magaziner, who believes a one-size-fits-all
bureaucratic health care system directed from Washington is the
best way for millions of Americans' healthcare decisions to be
made?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his education proposals.  Are they the values of parents
desperately seeking empowerment to choose the finest schools for
the education of their children? Or is Bill Clinton promoting
the values of the educational guild of tenured-teachers and politically
correct professors who want to nationalize education - taking
decisions away from communities - and force on children a skewed
view of history that denigrates heroes and celebrates supposed
victims?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is upholding in
his environmental proposals.  Are they the values of farmers,
ranchers, hikers and nature lovers across America who daily interact
with, are a part of and intimately understand their ecosystem
and want their children to enjoy its benefits also?  Or is Bill
Clinton promoting the values of EPA bureaucrats who, from cement
towers in Washington, D.C., call humans unnatural and purport
to know more about the forests of Oregon or the shores of Cape
Cod or the wetlands of Missouri than people whose families have
lived there for generations?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked why he only wants tax relief for
working families.  Why not for job creators? Why not for investors
who take risks in creating new business ventures and growing the
American economy?
<P>
 In the lists of items the President says he wants to protect
is a significant omission:  welfare.  Although Clinton may hate
the GOP version of welfare reform, he knows the middle class wants
reform and the GOP has captured the moral high ground. Republicans
are protecting American values by replacing a system that discourages
work, forces people to live in housing fit only for rats and denies
generation after generation of our fellow citizens those rights
endowed to them by our Creator.
<P>
 Bill Clinton has been winning public sentiment because he is
claiming to protect and uphold the values of the middle class.
 Republicans should have reminded the President the past few months
that they want a budget balanced with real numbers because <I>they
too</I> are protecting American values:  those of thrift that
hold the government should balance its books, live within its
means and not mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future.
<P>
 It is time for the Republicans to ask Bill Clinton:  &quot;Whose
values are you protecting?  Those of normal Americans or those
of a politically correct, imperial elite with whom you communed
at Renaissance Weekend?&quot;  Such language will inflame liberal
journalists across the land, but the majority of Americans who
were <I>not</I> at Hilton Head will understand.
<P>
 The values Bill Clinton is claiming to protect are not those
of the middle class.  Americans are demanding the freedom to think
and choose for themselves how to live their lives without a bloated,
remote, debt-ridden government taxing and regulating them to death.
 This is what the '94 Revolution was all about.  These are Republican
values; they are nothing to be ashamed of and Republicans should
start defending them.
<P>
Republicans should not let Bill Clinton get away with claiming
he is protecting American values and they are not; it is time
for the President to be challenged and made to defend his values.
 This will assist in turning the debate away from the supposedly
&quot;mean spirited&quot; GOP efforts to reduce the size and scope
of government to why Bill Clinton is trying to preserve big, bureaucratic
government that does not represent the American people.

<title>Jacobs:  The Trap of "Entitlement" Thinking -- PFF</title>

<h2>The Trap of 'Entitlement' Thinking</h2>
 By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center><P>
If we are serious about tackling a problem that is leading our
country into ruinous debt, perhaps the best way to begin is by
redefining our terms.
<P>
Every responsible person in Washington - from President Clinton
to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and on down - now recognizes
that reining in the high costs of government means dealing with
the escalating costs of so-called &quot;entitlement&quot; programs.
<P>
Do Americans have a &quot;right&quot; to a certain standard of
living? Are they &quot;entitled&quot; to money earned by other
people? Does our society owe people happiness? Certainly we should
not let people starve. We should be charitable. But the difference
between charity and entitlement is vast.
<P>
For a generation, entitlements have been the &quot;untouchable&quot;
part of the federal budget - never subject to elimination, cuts
or even critical performance review, but automatically scheduled
for cost-of-living increases and authorized for &quot;such sums
as may be necessary&quot; to respond to changing economic conditions.
Entitlements have been funded by the federal government with something
of a blank check.
<P>
Spending on these &quot;mandatory&quot; programs comprise 47 percent
of the federal budget. Another 14 percent of the budget is earmarked
for interest payments -- another &quot;mandatory&quot; program.
Thus, the president and Congress have control over 39 percent
of the budget.
<P>
Social Security, which has been described as &quot;middle class
welfare&quot; is the most expensive entitlement program. Since
1965, annual expenditures have grown from $17.1 billion to $241
billion. Social Security costs have increased annually at a rate
of 8 percent since 1980. Medicare has grown even faster - at a
rate of 12 percent. And Medicaid costs have risen yearly at an
11 percent pace. With runaway spending like that, how long before
we no longer can bear the cost -- unless you believe in the myth
that we have unlimited resources.
<P>
If no changes are made in the Social Security and Medicare systems,
the government projects that Americans will be paying 30 percent
of their income in
<P>
 federal taxes just to support these two programs by the year
2030. Today, every American man, woman- and child owes $10,000
as their share of the national debt. By 2030, that share would
increase to $64,000.
<P>
Surely, something must be done - and soon. But is tinkering with
the current system the answer? I think not.
<P>
Entitlements by their very nature -- by definition - create new
rights for Americans never dreamed of by our founding fathers
and never held up for the scrutiny of a full and open public debate.
<P>
Think about it. What is the derivation of that word &quot;entitlement&quot;?
The dictionary suggests that it is a legal right to something
- it is something that has been earned.
<P>
Those in search of such services need only be a resident of the
country perhaps not even a citizen. Then the politicians, bureaucrats
or activists must discover that a need exists that has a strong
compassionate component.
<P>
Once these compassionately impelled needs are met by passing laws
and appropriating money, they become entitlements. The recipients
very rarely have done anything that should &quot;entitle&quot;
them to receive these benefits. Thus, compassionately motivated
help is converted by word manipulation to an &quot;Entitlement.&quot;
<P>
Most such entitlement programs start out modestly with the goal
of creating a &quot;safety net&quot; for the truly needy. But
they are quickly turned into &quot;rights&quot; and expanded almost
geometrically as the bureaucratic self-interest in growth takes
over.
<P>
The curious transition to the use of the word &quot;Entitlement&quot;
reflects the inherent power of words to affect emotions and frame
the terms of our national debate. To be &quot;entitled&quot; to
something, the government implies one has a right to it. In private
industry, however, these kinds of added payments are characterized
more accurately as &quot;benefits.&quot; Contrast &quot;Benefits&quot;
with &quot;entitlements&quot; and the emotional content is revealed.
Benefits are given, but entitlements are a collection of obligations.
<P>
The Declaration of Independence defined our rights as &quot;life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Happiness is not a
right, only the pursuit of it is. Our founders understood that
when government offers any more, it creates dependency rather
than freedom. Thus, we will never solve our &quot;Entitlement&quot;
problem until we understand that none of us is owed anything just
because we are here.

<center><h3>ATR'S Congressional Leadership Daily Update</h3></center>
<b>MEMO</b><br>
DATE:  November 24, 1995<br>
TO:  Taxpayer Activists and Radio Talk Show Hosts<br>
FROM:  Grover G. Norquist<br>
RE:  Balanced Budget and Lower Taxes or Status Quo<p>
<hr>
<P>
The present debate in Washington will decide whether America moves to a balanced budget with lower taxes, or continues the status quo of high debt, increasing deficits and government spending.
<P>
So that every taxpayer activist can be fully informed about the daily shifting tactical issues of debt ceiling limits, continuing resolutions and the budget reconcialiation budget, ATR is hosting a daily conference call at 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.  We will be joined by Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, or a key staffer for a daily briefing.
<P>
Please join us by calling <b>1-703-736-7238</b> and tell the operator that you are calling in for the Americans for Tax Reform's Congressional Leadership Daily Update.
<P><center><b>Daily Conference Call<br>
<h1><center>House Speaker Newt Gingrich</center></h1>
<b>Live at 5pm Eastern Time</b>, - Replayed at 6pm & 7pm<br>
The call will last about 15 minutes.<br></b>
</h3></center>
Share this notice and the phone number with other activists in your state.  The better informed our side is, the more effectively we can promote the fight for lower taxes and a balanced budget.
<P>
Our goal over the next two months will not change:  a balanced budget by 2002 with tax cuts, but the tactics of the White House and the advocates of the status quo necessitate our being up to date in the back and forth of the daily tactical fights.
<P>
Onward.  We're winning.

<h2>STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS</h2>
                          OF THE PRESIDENT
<P>
<B>Courtesy of:  THE WHITE HOUSE</B><br>

                    Office of the Press Secretary<P>

      January 23, 1996
<P>	     
	     </CENTER>
	     
	     
9:14 P.M. EST<P>
	     
<blockquote>	     
	     <B>THE PRESIDENT:</B>  Thank you very much.  <P>
	     
	     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th 
Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our 
land:  Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform 
around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in 
Bosnia and to their families, I thank you.  America is very, very 
proud of you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union 
-- not the state of our government, but of our American community; 
and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, 
to form a more perfect union.  <P>
	     
	     The state of the Union is strong.  (Applause.)  Our 
economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades.  We have the 
lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.  We 
have completed -- created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million 
of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles.  
America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 
1970s.  And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of 
new businesses started in our country.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing 
hope for new peace.  And perhaps most important, we are gaining 
ground in restoring our fundamental values.  The crime rate, the 
welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy 
rate are all down.  And as they go down, prospects for America's 
future go up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     We live in an age of possibility.  A hundred years ago 
we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move to an age of technology, 
information, and global competition.  These changes have opened vast 
new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them 
with stiff challenges.  While more Americans are living better, too 
many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and 
they are rightly concerned about the security of their families.<P>

	     We must answer here three fundamental questions:  First,  
how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality 
for all Americans who are willing to work for it?  Second, how do we 
preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future?  
And, third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?  <P>
	     
	     We know big government does not have all the answers.  
We know there's not a program for every problem.  (Applause.)  We 
know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less 
bureaucratic government in Washington.  And we have to give the 
American people one that lives within its means.  (Applause.)  The 
era of big government is over.  (Applause.)  But we cannot go back to 
the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.  
(Applause.)  	  <P>

	     Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation 
working together to meet the challenges we face together.  
Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have 
both.  (Applause.)  I believe our new, smaller government must work 
in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens 
through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, 
charitable and civic associations.  Our goal must be to enable all 
our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger 
families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer 
streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.  <P>
	     
	     To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of 
ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our 
challenges together.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with 
balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans.  
(Applause.)  There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent 
deficit spending must come to an end.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I compliment the Republican leadership and the 
membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this 
task of balancing the budget.  (Applause.)  And I thank the Democrats 
for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, 
which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of 
deficit reduction.  Lower interest rates have made it easier for 
businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs.  Lower 
interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car 
payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens.  Now, it is time 
to finish the job and balance the budget.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Though differences remain among us which are 
significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are 
common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your 
Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and 
to provide a modest tax cut.  <P>
	     
	     These cuts are real.  They will require sacrifice from 
everyone.  But these cuts do not undermine are fundamental 
obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by 
endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or education, or the environment, 
or by raising taxes on working families.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I have said before, and let me say again, many good 
ideas have come out of our negotiations.  I have learned a lot about 
the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us.  I 
have learned a lot about the good ideas have that we could all 
embrace.  
	     <P>
	     We ought to resolve our remaining differences.  I am 
willing to work to resolve them.  I am ready to meet tomorrow.  But I 
ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that 
both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced 
budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future.  We 
should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of 
today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday.  The challenges 
are significant.  But our nation was built on challenges.  America 
was built on challenges, not promises.  And when we work together to 
meet them, we never fail.  That is the key to a more perfect Union.  
Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we 
all face as a people.  Our first challenge is to cherish our children 
and strengthen America's families.  Family is the foundation of 
American life.  If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger 
America.  <P>
	     
	     Before I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank 
my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than 
anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and 
children -- a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First 
Lady.  Thank you, Hillary.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     All strong families begin with taking more 
responsibility for our children.  I've heard Mrs. Gore say that it's 
hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child.  So 
all of us, not just as parents, but all of us in our other roles -- 
our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches 
and synagogues, our businesses, our governments -- all of us have a 
responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most 
of their lives and their God-given capacities.<P>
	     
	     To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and 
television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to 
enjoy.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V chip 
in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are 
inappropriate for their children.  (Applause.)  When parents control 
what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is 
enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their 
children's upbringing.  And I urge them to do it.  The V chip 
requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now 
pending in this Congress.  It has bipartisan support, and I urge you 
to pass it now.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     To make the V chip work, I challenge the broadcast 
industry to do what movies have done -- to identify your program in 
ways that help parents to protect their children.  And I invite the 
leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to 
come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way 
on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television.  I 
am ready to work with you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I say to those who make and market cigarettes, every 
year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the 
law.  Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened 
as a result.  Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive 
marketing campaigns that appeal to our children.  We are simply 
saying:  Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the 
line on children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to 
those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time:  For too long 
our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, 
instead of supporting them.  The Congress and I are near agreement on 
sweeping welfare reform.  We agree on time limits, tough work 
requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement.  
But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are 
required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is 
happening to their children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan 
welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work 
and do the right thing by our children.  I will sign it immediately.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Let us be candid about this difficult problem.  Passing 
a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step.  The next 
step is to make it work.  I challenge people on welfare to make the 
most of this opportunity for independence.  I challenge American 
businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work 
force.  I applaud the work of religious groups and other who care for 
the poor.  More than anyone else in our society, they know the true 
difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help.<P>

	     Everyone of us should join them.  That is the only way 
we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the 
American people.  <P>
	     
	     To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to 
keep the teen pregnancy rate going down.  I am gratified, as I'm sure 
all Americans are, that it has dropped for two years in a row.  But 
we all know it is still far too high.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of 
prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an 
organization that will support grass-roots community efforts all 
across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.  
And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts. <P>
	     
	     I call on American men and women in families to give 
greater respect to one another.  We must end the deadly scourge of 
domestic violence in our country.  (Applause.)  And I challenge 
America's families to work harder to stay together.  For families who 
stay together not only do better economically, their children do 
better as well.     <P>
	     
	     In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country 
to love and care for their children.  If your family has separated, 
you must pay your child support.  We're doing more than ever to make 
sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit 
something about that, too:  A check will substitute for a parent's 
love and guidance.  And only you -- only you can make the decision to 
help raise your children.  No matter who you are, how low or high 
your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every 
American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the 
educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century.  In 
our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the 
information superhighway, with computers and good software, and 
well-trained teachers.  We are working with the telecommunications 
industry, educators and parents to connect 20 percent of California's 
classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in 
the entire United States by the year 2000.  (Applause.)  I ask 
Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we 
can make sure this national partnership succeeds.<P>
	     
	     Every diploma ought to mean something.  I challenge 
every community, every school and every state to adopt national 
standards of excellence; to measure whether schools are meeting those 
standards; to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers 
have more flexibility for grass-roots reform; and to hold them 
accountable for results.  That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is 
all about.<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to give all parents the right to 
choose which public school their children will attend; and to let 
teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they 
do a good job.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge all our schools to teach character 
education, to teach good values and good citizenship.  And if it 
means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer 
jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their 
students to wear school uniforms.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge our parents to become their children's first 
teachers.  Turn off the TV.  See that the homework is done.  And 
visit your children's classroom.  No program, no teacher, no one else 
can do that for you.<P>

	     My fellow Americans, higher education is more important 
today than ever before.  We've created a new student loan program 
that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have 
dramatically cut the student loan default rate.  That's something we 
should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few 
years ago.<P>

	     Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this 
year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their 
local communities to improve the lives of their friends and 
neighbors.  (Applause.)<P>

	     These initiatives are right for America and we should 
keep them going.  And we should also work hard to open the doors of 
college even wider.  I challenge Congress to expand work-study and 
help one million young Americans work their way through college by 
the year 2000; to provide a $1000 merit scholarship for the top five 
percent of graduates in every high school in the United States; -- 
(applause) -- to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and 
needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition 
tax deductible.  It's a good idea for America.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our third challenge is to help every American who is 
willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age.  
People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new 
economy.  They need education and training for a lifetime.  They need 
more support for families raising children.  They need retirement 
security.  They need access to health care.  More and more Americans 
are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last 
a lifetime.  <P>
	     
	     So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, 
antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 
for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for 
community college tuition or other training.  This is a G.I. Bill for 
America's workers we should all be able to agree on.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More and more Americans are working hard without a 
raise.  Congress sets the minimum wage.  Within a year, the minimum 
wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power.  Four dollars 
and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of 
Americans and their children are trying to live on it.  I challenge 
you to raise their minimum wage.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million 
hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work 
full-time would have to raise their children in poverty, and to 
encourage people to move from welfare to work.  This expanded earned 
income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of 
four living on $20,000.  The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed 
this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these 
people.  We should not do that.  We should not do that.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I also agree that the people who are helped under this 
initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to 
do a good job raising their children and at work.  I agree that we 
need a tax credit for working families with children.  That's one of 
the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on.  I know 
it is strongly supported by the Republican majority.  And it should 
be part of any final budget agreement.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I want to challenge every business that can possibly 
afford it to provide pensions for your employees.  And I challenge 
Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference 
on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and 
farmers to establish their own pension plans.  That is something we 
should all agree on.  (Applause.)  <P>

	     We should also protect existing pension plans.  Two 
years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both 
sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million 
working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more.  
Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers's 
pension funds.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of 
employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would 
raise money for the treasury.  But I believe it is false economy.  I 
vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in 
the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies 
that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their 
family gets sick.  Over the past two years, over one million 
Americans in working families have lost their health insurance.  We 
have to do more to make health care available to every American.  And 
Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance 
companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop 
denying coverage for preexisting conditions.  Let's all do that.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must 
have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of 
Medicare and Medicaid -- not just to the poor, but to people in 
working families, including children, people with disabilities, 
people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes.  <P>
	     
	     In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by 
fighting health care fraud and abuse.  We have all agreed to save 
much more.  We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund.  
But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who 
need Medicare and Medicaid.  America cannot become stronger if they
become weaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and 
child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health 
care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid -- these things, along 
with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 -- these things 
will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the 
most of their own lives.  <P>
	     
	     But employers and employees must do their part, as well, 
as they are doing in so many of our finest companies -- working 
together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term 
gain.  As workers increase their hours and their productivity, 
employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share 
the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad 
ones.  When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and 
so does America.<P>
	     
	     Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back 
from crime and gangs and drugs.  At last we have begun to find a way 
to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police 
forces to catch criminals and prevent crime.  This strategy, called 
community policing, is clearly working.  Violent crime is coming down 
all across America.  In New York City murders are down 25 percent; in 
St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32 percent.		      But we 
still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our 
people are free from fear. <P>
	     
	     The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of 
community policing.  It provides funds for 100,000 new police in 
communities of all sizes.  We're already a third of the way there.  
And I challenge the Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with a 
strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.  
(Applause.)
	     <P>
	     Community policing also requires bonds of trust between 
citizens and police.  I ask all Americans to respect and support our 
law enforcement officers.  And to our police, I say, our children 
need you as role models and heroes.  Don't let them down.<P>
	     
	     The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with 
criminal records from buying guns.  The assault weapons ban is 
keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent 
gangs.  I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on 
gangs the way we once took on the mob.  I'm directing the FBI and 
other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles 
and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults 
teenagers who maim and kill like adults.  <P>
	     
	     And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant 
associations:  Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying 
the lives of decent tenants.  From now on, the rule for residents who 
commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to match federal policy to 
assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of 
their sentence.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More police and punishment are important, but they're 
not enough.  We have got to keep more of our young people out of 
trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but 
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of 
our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to.  And I 
challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these 
grass-roots prevention efforts.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce 
the drug problem.  The challenge begins in our homes, with parents 
talking to their children openly and firmly.  It embraces our 
churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.  <P>
	     
	     I challenge Congress not to cut our support for 
drug-free schools.  People like the DARE officers are making a real 
impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength 
to say no when the time comes.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of 
drugs into America.  For the last two years, one man in particular 
has been on the front lines of that effort.  Tonight I am nominating 
him -- a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of 
the United States Military Southern Command -- General Barry 
McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two 
Silver Stars fighting for this country.  Tonight I ask that he lead 
our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad.  To succeed, he 
needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before.  He needs 
all of us.  Every one of us has a role to play on this team.  <P>
	     
	     Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your 
country one more time.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our fifth challenge:  to leave our environment safe and 
clean for the next generation.  Because of a generation of bipartisan 
effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's 
blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut 
in half.  Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource.  But 
10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic 
waste dump.  A third of us breathe air that endangers our health.  
And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink.  We still 
have much to do.  
	     <P>
	     Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement 
by 25 percent.  That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more 
smog in our air, more pesticides in our food.  Lobbyists for 
polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills 
to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children.  
Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and 
let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook.  I challenge 
Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     This issue has not been a partisan issue.  The most 
significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under 
a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon.  We can work 
together.  We have to believe some basic things.  Do you believe we 
can expand the economy without hurting the environment?  I do.  Do 
you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the 
environment up?  I know we can.  That should be our commitment.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     We must challenge businesses and communities to take 
more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it 
easier for them to do it.  To businesses this administration is 
saying:  If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than 
government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do 
it -- as long as you do it right.  To communities we say:  We must 
strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to 
disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work 
with business to cut pollution.  People do have a right to know that 
their air and their water are safe.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership 
in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world.  Because of 
American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at 
peace.  And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security. <P>

	     We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War 
II.  (Applause.)  I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all 
others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others 
on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our 
conflicts since:  I salute your service and so do the American 
people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     All over the world, even after the Cold War, people 
still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of 
peace and freedom.  But as the Cold War fades into memory, voices of 
isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities.  I 
say they are wrong.<P>
	     
	     The threats we face today as Americans respect no 
nation's borders.  Think of them:  terrorism, the spread of weapons 
of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and 
religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental 
degradation.  If we fail to address these threats today, we will 
suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Of course, we can't be everywhere.  Of course, we can't 
do everything.  But where our interests and our values are at stake, 
and where we can make a difference, America must lead.  We must not 
be isolationist.  We must not be the world's policeman.  But we can 
and should be the world's very best peacemaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where 
we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the 
risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for 
people here and around the world.  For the first time since the dawn 
of the nuclear age -- for the first time since the dawn of the 
nuclear age -- there is not a single Russian missile pointed at 
America's children.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons 
program.  In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, 
the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided.  Through 
tougher trade deals for America -- over 80 of them -- we have opened 
markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing 
faster than imports and creating good American jobs.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     We stood with those taking risks for peace:  In Northern 
Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their 
parents, violence must never return.  In the Middle East, where Arabs 
and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share 
knowledge and resources, and even dreams.  <P>
	     
	     And we stood up for peace in Bosnia.  Remember the 
skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and 
torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading 
war.  All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way 
to the promise of peace.  Now, our troops and a strong NATO, together 
with our new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, are helping 
that peace to take hold.  <P>
	     
	     As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan 
congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops 
were doing, but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing.  
They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were 
proud to be carrying it out.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of 
the American people.  But make no mistake about it:  important 
challenges remain.  <P>
	     
	     The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear 
stockpiles by another 25 percent.  I urge the Senate to ratify it 
now.  (Applause.)  We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons 
by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we 
can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical 
Weapons Convention this year.  (Applause.)  We can intensify the 
fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad 
if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after 
the Oklahoma City bombing now.  (Applause.)  We can help more people 
move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if 
Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just 
discussed are for all of us.  Our seventh challenge is really 
America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight:  to 
reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them.  <P>
	     
	     Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it 
applies to everyone else.  (Applause.)  This Congress banned gifts 
and meals from lobbyists.  This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose 
who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill.  
This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb 
special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly 
bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation.  (Applause.)  You, 
Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we 
can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you 
promised the American people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our administration is working hard to give the American 
people a government that works better and costs less.  Thanks to the 
work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of 
unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decision-making out 
of Washington, back to states and local communities.<P>

	     As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller 
government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the 
most of their own lives.  We are helping America's communities, not 
with more bureaucracy, but with more opportunities.  Through our 
successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're 
helping people to find jobs, to start businesses.  And with tax 
incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, 
we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need 
them.<P>

	     But there are some areas that the federal government 
should not leave and should address and address strongly.  One of 
these areas is the problem of illegal immigration.  After years of 
neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the 
protection of our borders.  We are increasing border controls by 50 
percent.  We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of 
illegal immigrants.  And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive 
order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal 
immigrants.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Let me be very clear about this:  We are still a nation 
of immigrants; we should be proud of it.  We should honor every legal 
immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to 
become a new citizen.  But we are also a nation of laws.<P>

	     I want to say a special word now to those who work for 
our federal government.  Today our federal is 200,000 employees 
smaller than it was the day I took office as President.  (Applause.)
Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, 
and it's getting smaller every day.  Most of our fellow Americans 
probably don't know that.  And there's a good reason -- a good 
reason:  The remaining federal work force is composed of hard-working 
Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever 
before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I'd like to give you one example.  His name is Richard 
Dean.  He's a 49 year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social 
Security Administration for 22 years now.  Last year he was hard at 
work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 
169 people and brought the rubble down all around him.  He reentered 
that building four times.  He saved the lives of three women.  He's 
here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and 
applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal 
heroism.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there.  This last 
November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut 
down.  And the second time the government shut down he continued 
helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. <P>
	     
	     On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the 
other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for 
the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber:  Never, 
ever shut the federal government down again.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need 
their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also 
challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the 
United States -- to honor the obligations of this great nation as we 
have for 220 years; to rise above partisanship and pass a 
straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America 
keeps its word.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, 
and even more from America.  But I am confident:  When Americans work 
together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their 
synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any 
challenge.  <P>
	     
	     I say again, the era of big government is over.  But we 
can't go back to the era of fending for yourself.  We have to go 
forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as 
one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide 
us -- the division, the discrimination, the rancor -- we have to 
reach across it to find common ground.  We have got to work together 
if we want America to work.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just 
that.  Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public 
school system.  A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help 
inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can 
believe in.  Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in 
Oklahoma City.  Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow 
citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy.  She 
reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of 
Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and 
community.  <P>

	     Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special 
Americans.  And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are 
the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to 
carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the 
centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer -- not 
because they are star athletes, but because they are star citizens, 
community heroes meeting America's challenges.  They are our real 
champions.  <P>
	     
	     Please stand up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship 
in our own lives.  None of us can finish the race alone.  We can only 
achieve our destiny together -- one hand, one generation, one 
American connecting to another.<P>
	     
	     There have always been things we could to together, 
dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own.  
We Americans have forged our identity, our very union, from the very 
point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, 
every different opinion.  But we must be bound together by a faith 
more powerful than any doctrine that divides us -- by our believe in 
progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common 
ground.  <P>
	     
	     America has always sought and always risen to every 
challenge.  Who would say that having come so far together, we will 
not go forward from here?  Who would say that this age of possibility 
is not for all Americans?  <P>
	     
	     Our country is and always has been a great and good 
nation.  But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts. <P>
	     
	     Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States 
of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<P>

<H2>Transcript of Bob Dole's response to the President's address</H2>

<P>January 23, 1996<BR></center>

<P>From the Associated Press
<blockquote>
<P>Text of the Republican response by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to President Clinton's State of the Union address. 

<P>Good evening. I'm Bob Dole, and I'm here to briefly reply to the president's message on the state of the union. But a reply need not be an argument. Instead, I want to present another view. Another way of thinking about the problems we face. 

<P>A few years back I met with a group of 100 high school seniors -- one young man and a woman from every state. During the meeting one young man stood up and said "Senator, everybody has somebody who speaks for them. But who speaks for us?" he asked me. "Who speaks for the future?" 

<P>That's what I want to talk with you about tonight -- the future and the values that will shape it. Those values are at the heart of our disagreements with the president. President Clinton says our differences are few, the budget numbers are close and that we should try to find common ground. We have tried and tried, again and again. But such a place appears to be elusive. 

<P>For while we share an abiding love of country, we have been unable to agree. Why? Because we have starkly different philosophies of government and profoundly different visions of America. So all the talk and fighting in Washington can seem very remote. And we political figures can seem detached and petty and far removed from the every day struggle of American citizens and families. 
<P>But the truth is we can not ignore the future. The point of our lives, after all, is to raise children who are smarter and healthier and nobler than we are; to contribute to a country that is better than today's America; to make a world that is better and finer for all of God's creation. 

<P>America's greatness -- all that we take such justified pride in today -- America's greatness was built by men and women who sacrificed ease and comfort and the joys of today, to build a better future for those who came after. How many pioneers faced a hostile and threatening frontier? How many immigrants gave their bodies to the mines? And how many soldiers lost their lives on the distant battlefields to secure a better future for their children and their children's children? 

<P>In every generation, Americans have made these sacrifices, and found in their making a purpose and a direction to life. Now we have to do that in this generation. And thanks to God and fortune and those who went before, we don't have to conquer a dangerous frontier. We don't have to fight another great war. What we do have to do is face the fact that we cannot give in to all of our own desires. As we have just heard, President Clinton and those who share his vision of America have chosen their ground. 

<P>The president chose to defend, with his veto, a welfare system that no one can defend -- for it is a daily assault on the values of self-reliance and family. He has chosen to defend an education establishment run by liberals whose goal is to operate every school in America by remote control from Washington. He has chosen to veto a defense bill because it provided for defending America against weapons of mass destruction. 

<P>He has chosen to defend the status quo in Medicare -- a system on which lives depend and a program in urgent need of rescue. President Clinton has chosen to defend and increase a tax burden that has pushed countless families into their own personal recessions. And unfortunately, he has chosen to veto the first balanced budget in a generation, offering only a fantasy in its place. 

<P>Now if you have a child asleep in your home tonight, you will probably check on him or her before you go to bed. As you bend over to tuck your child in, think about this: If we continue down this path we will place a tremendous burden of debt on every child in America. How can we betray them and their parents and grandparents? How can we fail to act? We cannot, and we will not. 

<P>Every political movement, and every public official must locate a place in his heart where compromise ends -- a core of conviction where we keep our conscience. There comes a time when even practical leaders must refuse to bend or to yield. For Republicans and countless Democrats and independents, we have arrived at that time. 

<P>America's troubles are real, but our choices are clear and our will is strong. We must rein in our runaway government, return power to the people, reduce the tax burden. Put parents back in charge of our schools. Untie the hands of our police. Restore justice to our courts and put our faith once again in the basic goodness, wisdom and self-reliance of our people. 

<P>Well, the president spoke with great eloquence about a future with unlimited possibilities. It is a vision we all share, for it is the story of America. 

<P>But while the president's words speak of change, his deeds are a contradiction. The president claims to embrace the future while clinging to the policies of the past. 

<P>For three years this administration has valued dependence on government over self-reliance. Federal power over community, federal planning over individual enterprise. It has tried to place government experts in charge of our economy and our health and our lives. 

<P>It has put liberal judges on the bench to war with our values and it questions the participation of religious people in public life, treating them as fanatics out of step with America. 

<P>President Clinton shares a view of America held by our country's elites. 

<P>A nation of special interest groups united only by a dependence on government, competing with each other for handouts and held back by outdated values. For those who hold this view, there is only one answer for our problems: 

<P>More government. 

<P>Bigger government. 

<P>More meddlesome government. 

<P>If you listened closely tonight, that's what President Clinton talked about. President Clinton may well be the rear guard of the welfare state. He is the chief obstacle to a balanced budget and the balanced budget amendment. He is almost the last public defender of a discredited status quo. We Republicans will not give up the struggle because America will round the corner to a brighter future if we prevail. 

<P>I come from Russell, Kansas -- there's not much money there, but the people are rich in many other ways. Life isn't always easy, but the values are durable -- love of God and country and family, commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility, and self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. 

<P>Those values made America the greatest nation on earth, and there is no doubt in my mind that we can get our country back on track if we reassert them again as a people, and if our government returns to them as a matter of national policy. 

<P>Now just like the debate over the budget this wither, our arguments this spring will seem a maze of conflicting numbers, assertions and high-sounding words. But what we're really arguing about are the values that will shape our nation, our government, and the future of that child sleeping down the hall. 

<P>Now some people try to make these matters complicated, but they're simple in my home town -- and probably where you are, as well. Americans know that handouts without responsibility destroy human dignity. 

<P>We know that the help of a neighbor is preferable to that of a bureaucrat. And we know that wealth is created by free individuals with their smarts and their sweat. Government programs can only spend it. 

<P>I'm a very practical man, but I believe in the miracle of America and I've never gone in for dramatics, but I do believe we have reached a defining moment. It is as if we went to sleep in one America and woke up in another. 

<P>It is as though our government and our institutions and our culture have been attacked by liberals and are careening dangerously off course. But we know the way back, but we must act now and my promise tonight is that we can, and we will. 

<P>If there is no agreement, we will send President Clinton another balanced budget with tax relief for American families, regulatory relief for small businesses, farmers and ranchers and real welfare reform. 

<P>We will always be mindful of the poor and disadvantaged, education and the environment. But we will begin the defunding of Big Brother by unfunding wasteful programs and meddlesome departments. We will send the president bill after bill, returning power and programs to the states and to the people. 

<P>We will challenge President Clinton again and again to walk the talk he talks so well. As we do, remember this: Our battles will not be about numbers. They'll be about the character of our nation. Yes, our country has problems. But we can handle them. 

<P>Whether it's deficit spending or the welfare bureaucracy or our liberal courts or the trouble in our schools, what's wrong is that the elites in charge don't believe in what the people believe in. That we can fix. We know what made America great. All we need now is the resolve to lead our country back to her place in the sun and the courage to speak for the future. 

<P>So when you close the door to your child's room tonight, remember, it's not too late. This is a great country. Our strength has always come from the truth, and from sacrifice and honor, and from the bottomless reservoir of hope and work and courage that is the American people. Always, we have built for the future with a half-silent consciousness that we were doing the work of the Lord. 

<P>Today, we feel ourselves beset by many difficulties: by violence and resentment, by racial and partisan divisions, by economic storms, by dizzying changes of every kind. 

<P>Yet, the blood of greatness, of noble forebears, of men and women of incredible achievement still runs through us all. That birthright is what it means to bear the name "American." 

<P>In this time, in this generation, in this year, we -- like they -- can and will overcome. We need only to rededicate ourselves to earning the name we have inherited. 

<P>Thank you very much. God bless America and good night.

<h2>Are We Reliving the 1850s?</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.htm#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
</center><P>
 <ul><blockquote>
The Big Election fanned The Talk.  Now everyone in town was asking,
is the realignment that comes every two or three generations really
upon us?  Is this the next Big Change in American politics?
<P>
And the next question was always:  Which realignment?  Is this
one more like 1932 or 1896?  Long wave theories trotted out. 
Names like Hanna and Bryan were heard again.
<P>
But with Oklahoma City and Waco, murmurs of the 1850s began to
lace The Talk.  On the evening of the Million Man March, the Speaker
of the House came right out and said it:  today is like the 1850s.
<P>
The 1850s were scary times.  People killed for ideology, called
the government corrupt and tyrannical, and dreamed draconian national
solutions.  
<P>
But it still looks like a pretty superficial stretch ... that
is, until I read Bill Gienapp's <I>Origins of the Republican Party,
1852-56.  </I>He tells a riveting story, a remarkable feat for
600-odd pages in micronic font, broken only by maps of county-by-county
voting.  Why is it so compelling?
<P>
Because even when you get down to details, the talk and feel of
another time:  it reads like today.
<P>
I wanted to put this historical deja vu to the test, so I sought
out Professor Gienapp.  I wanted to lay out all the leaping associations
and harmonic resonances, and see what the sober historian would
have to say.
<P>
Here, in thumbnail, is how it went.  I started by laying out the
case:
<ul><P>
<B>The Dem's in 1852.</B>
<P>
We like to talk about how Democrats have dominated politics since
the New Deal.  But the Democracy of the 1850's [as they liked
to call themselves] had run the show since America began.  In
1860, we could look back on slave-owning presidents for 50 our
our first 71 years.  The majority of Speakers of the House, of
Presidents <I>Pro Tem</I>;  and <I>always</I>, a majority of the
Supreme Court, was Southern.  The Southern Democrat vision of
American politics <I>was</I> American politics.
<P>
<B>The Economic Revolution.</B>
<P>
We are abuzz with an Information Revolution.  But Americans then
were laboring to adjust to something even more elemental:  an
Industrial Revolution.  The Big Change that would transform American
life was just starting its sweep in the 1850's, as the great urban
migration hit railroad stride.  City populations doubled and tripled:
 New York went from 20% urban in 1850 to 40% in 1860.  And the
yeoman farmer was being displaced by the factory worker.  In 1860,
wage laborers for the first time equaled the self-employed.  And
the new world was being built in the North.  The South was being
left behind ... along with its grip on political power.
<P>
<B>The Death of the Whigs.</B>
<P>
For decades the Whigs had been the second party:  the party of
economic growth.  But they had lived under the shadow of the Democrats,
and having made their compact with The Democracy, they dared not
challenge the arrangements that gave Democrats political sway.
 But the narrow fiscal issues around which they had crafted their
platform had all dried up.  Whigs had nothing to say to people
in the new world being made by railroad and mill.  Does this remind
us just a bit of our own Country Club Republicans?  Having nothing
to say, the Whigs crashed and burned in the election of 1992;
 I mean, 1852.
<P>
<B>The <I>Know Nothings</I>.</B>
<P>
From the wreckage of the Whigs came two new parties.  By far the
biggest, representing regular people in both North and South,
was the North American Party, who also styled themselves <I>Know
Nothings</I>.  These were people who saw their way of life eroding,
their hope for the future slipping away.  Economic revolution
was creating a new world of wage labor, of industrial slums, and
of job competition with the millions of immigrants pouring into
American life.  <I>Know Nothings</I> were anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic,
much the way workers today are anti-immigrant and anti-UN/NAFTA/WTO,
where the immigrant is the embodiment of large change threatening
their job, and where the foreign institution poking into American
life threatens liberty itself.  Their ranks are filled with Protestant
evangelicals, and their vision is full of nostalgia for a better,
truer, American Dream from a world gone by.
<P>
<B>The New Republicans.</B>
<P>
The Republicans, in contrast, come as the party of revolution.
 They looked to the future, and to a renewed American Dream. 
Their ranks were flush with old abolitionists, once marginal to
the political scene, who now saw their chance to bring sacred
principles to the center of politics [they acted a little like
some Libertarians we know].  And they have the support of new
money, the new entrepeneurs of the industrial age.  Money flows
in from the high technologies, the <I>parvenu</I> corporations
built on iron rails.  But Republicans have a problem: the <I>Know
Nothings</I> are a majority in the North.  How to woo them, how
to make a new national party - not like the old Whigs, built on
fiscal probity, nor like the <I>Know Nothings</I>, on nativism
- but on a new vision of American life?
<P>
<B>The Issue.</B>
<P>
We still think the issue was slavery ... getting rid of it, that
is.  The truth is  Republicans did something very different. 
They ditched whining, moralistic cries for abolition.  They said
instead:  <I>The ruling Old Order of Democrats and comprador Whigs
is a monster, slowly robbing Americans </I>[white male voters]<I>
of their liberty.  And because it is on the defensive, it has
turned aggressive, so it must be stopped now</I>.  And Republicans
called this Old Order, <I>The Slave Power</I>, the vested interest
of the past, European in its concept of hierarchy and rule, and
so inimical to American virtue and the American idea.  What this
meant is that Republicans took people's fears of change and uncertainty
about their future, which had fastened on a mix of neighborhood
scapegoats [immigrants] and ethereal tyrannies [the Catholic Church],
and turned them on the reigning political elite and its paradigm
of rule.  It took the Christian right of 1854 and said:  to get
to a better America, to renew the American Dream, we must first
destroy <I>The Slave Power</I>. 
<P>
Looking back, what will people say about us?  Can we frame the
battle as well as those first Republicans?
<P>
<B>The Talk.</B>
<P>
Paranoid politics?  Why, yes.  As Gienapp points out through his
narrative, it is the heart of American political tradition.  Our
first revolution made it so.  In the nineteenth century the big
conflicts in American politics were all conspiracies directed
against Liberty.  For the Jacksonians, it was the Banks.  For
the Whigs, it was the power of the Executive Branch.  For the
<I>Know Nothings</I>, it was the Catholic Church.  And for Republicans,
it was the Southern-dominated political system.  Conspiracies
against Liberty hearken back to our founding, and before our founding,
as the earliest Americans sought to escape European tyrants. 
It was inevitable that the main threat to Liberty would eventually
arise at home, from among our own.  People believed this ... <I>and
still do</I>:  it is an existential theme in America's Pilgrim's
Progress.  And set against a general backdrop of uncertainty and
upheaval in national life, the retro-look and feel of the Southern
political paradigm (and its manifest failure to lead nationally)
cried out for definition.  And define it the Republicans did.
   
<P>
The Democracy entered yet another administration in 1856, owning,
again, both houses of Congress and the Presidency.  But theirs
was a weak, pusillanimous Commander-in-Chief, whose venality and
corruption was exposed to all in 1860.  Republican success in
defining Democrats as an Old Order elite standing in the way of
progress, liberty, and America's future was there for everyone
to see in the mid-term election of 1858, when they swept Congress.
<P>
Here are some swatches from Gienapp on early Republican ideology:
<P>
At the heart of free labor ideology was the idea that every man,
as Abraham Lincoln phrased it, had a right to rise economically
and socially to the limit of his ability  ...  Upholding the reality
of the American dream, the free labor ideal represented the optimistic
side of the Republican appeal.
<P>
or,
<P>
As a heritage of the American Revolution ... the ideology of republicanism
... included the fear of concentrated power ... and the belief
that such power was the natural enemy of liberty and if unchecked
would eventually destroy it.
<P></ul>
Still<I> deja vu?</I>
<P><ul>
<I><B>What doesn't work.</B></I>
<P>
Well, not quite.  Uncompromising as historian, Gienapp restrained
this writer's rush to neatly tie things up.  He sees three dissonances
especially that should keep us from claiming immediate kinship
with Seward, Greeley, Chase, Sumner, and Lincoln. 
<P>
      
<P>
<B>The Voter and Voting.</B>
<P>
Who voted in the 1850's.  That's easy:  white men.  But there's
more.  These were very young white men, and they were deeply engaged
in politics.  They may not have had as much formal schooling,
but they knew the issues better than most of us today.  They lived
politics, chewed politics;  rallies and parades were their theater,
their TV.  It was cool to be hot and partisan, and these were
aggressive young men.  Look at their sacrifice in war just ahead.
<P>
Contrast that voter profile to today's.  The age pyramid is geting
stood on its head, and people who actually vote are much, much
older.  Hardly a revolutionary cadre.  And how we vote is different
too.  Government did not control voting:  in the 1850's, anyone
could print up a ballot and vote.  So it was easy for new parties
to emerge.  After 1900, the two parties have worked together to
control, to keep others out.  Gienapp puts it this way:  imagine
if Colin Powell, rather than slogging through the primaries, could
just hand out ballots!
<P>
<B>Party decomposition.</B>
<P>
And though the Whigs of 1852 could have stood in nicely for George
Bush, the debacle of 1992 did not lead to the party's fall.  It's
all still there,  Old Whigs, <I>Know Nothings</I>, and radical
Republicans, all under the same umbrella.  But keeping a lid on
means that instead of rollicking chaos, forcing creativity, and
then creating a new vision, Republicans shoulder on as the Grand
<I>Old</I> Party with three visions:  one Democrat-comprador,
one a nostalgia-mongering return to The Golden Age, and one of
revolution.  The old order Democrats, flat on their backs, thus
still survive.  In weak niches, like the presidency, they may
even flourish.
<P>
  
<P>
<B>The Issue as Talk.</B>
<P>
And where is slavery?  So many other features seem to be in place:
 the economic revolution, the fears of regular people, the obdurate,
grasping control of a dying elite.  But two things that make one
are missing.
<P>
The first is a driving vision of America's future.  True, the
first Republicans didn't have that at first.  They were all negative,
their issues all about stopping the power of government gone wrong,
dismantling the structures of that power itself.  But after 1856,
they became more positive.  Their slogan, <I>Free Men, Free Labor,
Free Soil</I>, had a message:  that economic change, however unsettling,
would offer more opportunity, more wealth, and more freedom to
all Americans.  They promised a renewal of the American Dream.
<P>
But that renewal would never happen as long as <I>The Slave Power</I>
stood in the way.  Its entire energy was intent on stopping change,
on cementing its control over American life and liberty.  <I><B>Progress</B></I>
and <I><B>Anti-Progress</B></I> were thus symbolically intertwined
as political message.
<P>
Some resonances to this message leaked out of the Great Health
Care Debate of 1994.  The Old Order was clearly painted as attempting
to aggressively extend its social-bureaucratic vision in order
to entrench its power.  People came close to politically visualizing
a contemporary counterpart to the old Slave Power in the form
of a national ruling class centered in Washington <I>[in one national
poll from November, 1994, Americans 2-1 said that Washington was
an imperial city ruled by an imperial class].</I> 
<P>
But since that election, the lines have blurred again.  The Democracy
was visited by, and made, huge mistakes in the 1850s, from Bloody
Kansas to the caning of Sumner.  Southern Democrats let the new
Republicans define them.  Today's old order is much more sly.
<P>
Perhaps it is too soon to talk loosely about the 1850s.  We may
be knee-deep in economic revolution, but it's not flood stage
yet.  But just wait until it threatens the brittle dikes of the
old politics, and its <I>ancien regime</I>. 
<P>
Then, on the [next] net, maybe we'll be printing our own ballots
again.

<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
This edition of <I>Headway</I> launches a new beginning for our
publication. As our readers know, since its inception in 1988
as a newsletter, our publication has been titled <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. Several months ago, our corporate board of directors,
including the publisher and editor, decided that, as a move toward
expanding the magazine's base and ensuring future growth, we would
change the Publication's name.
<P>
Why a name change and why now, some might ask. The reasons are
varied and numerous. First our name was simply too long for a
magazine title. One-word or two-word titles in the magazine industry
are the general rule, and we wanted to bring our publication in
line with industry standards.
<P>
Second, our name became too much of an issue for some potential
subscribers and advertisers. The term &quot;minority&quot; has
many connotations, most of which, for our purposes, carried more
cons than pros. For example, &quot;minority&quot; usually means
a member of a racial minority, but in today's era of micro-classification,
now almost everyone qualifies as a minority. From a political
standpoint, the term &quot;minority&quot; also implies a liberal,
big government ideology. Because of this, many potential readers
also mistakenly presumed that our publication has a liberal slant,
which it clearly does not.
<P>
Others thought we were a political organization, rather than a
magazine. Still others thought that the magazine was only for
minorities, which is certainly not the case. Our readership is
racially and ethnically diverse, and we have made an effort to
see that it remains so. Without discourse across racial and ethnic
lines, we have no hope of ever solving any of the problems our
nation faces.
<P>
Third, our name was too narrow and confining. Yes, we do primarily
discuss political issues, but not exclusively. Yes, the majority
of our writers are black or Hispanic, but, more importantly, they
are excellent, deliberative thinkers. Labeling them as merely
&quot;minority&quot; writers somehow seemed to diminish their
credentials.
<P>
Finally, we wanted a name which implied that we were looking toward
the future, that we were winning the philosophical battle, that
we were ahead of the curve in presenting ideas on the nation's
most vital issues, that ours is not a racial magazine, but an
ideas magazine. We believe the name <I>Headway</I> does just that.
<P>
But for those who have expressed their preference for our current
format and content, not to worry. There will be no substantial
changes in the format or content. We will be adding a few new
writers and sections, but our approach to the issues--and our
promotion of the ideals of strong families, individual responsibility,
free enterprise and limited government--will remain constant.
<P>
We would like to express our thanks to our staff and writers,
many of whom have been with us since our expansion to a magazine
format. We would also like to thank our committed readers for
their support and for spreading the word about <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. We hope you will continue to be ambassadors for
<I>Headway</I> as well.
<P>
We're looking forward to a successful 1996, and extend the same
wishes to all our readers.
<P>

<h2>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff</h2>

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>

</center><p>
<P>
	In recent years, two tragic events have fundamentally changed the way many Americans view 
federal law-enforcement agencies and jeopardized public confidence in the federal government 
itself. In August 1992, U.S. marshals sought to arrest white separatist Randy Weaver at his 
remote mountain cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. A confrontation resulted in the death of a federal 
marshal and Weaver's 14-year-old son. Special FBI teams were called in, and during the siege 
that followed, Weaver's wife was killed by an FBI sniper's bullet. At his subsequent trial, 
Weaver was acquitted of all but the most minor offenses.
<p>
	Since Ruby Ridge, federal law enforcement as a whole has come under intense congressional 
and media scrutiny. Even those normally supportive of the police ask: Should the federal 
government have risked this loss of life and expended $10 million to capture a hermit whose 
only alleged crime was selling two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover federal agent?
<p>
	In February 1993, a 51-day standoff first erupted when agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) tried to apprehend the leaders of the Branch Davidian cult at 
their compound in Waco, Texas, for the violation of federal gun laws. Four BATF agents lost 
their lives in the initial foray, and the subsequent siege ended in the deaths of 85 cult members, 
killed either by gunfire or by a suicidal fire that was ignited when FBI agents stormed the 
compound. Again, conflicting versions of events led to congressional hearings as well as public 
and media criticism. 
<p>
	Both these tragedies are the direct result of federal jurisdiction in crimes once considered 
wholly within the province of state and local police agencies. In neither incident did the 
underlying crime involve interstate activity or pose a threat to the federal government. Without 
the federalization of laws regulating firearms, a matter left to the states during most of our 
country's history, neither the BATF or FBI would have had jurisdiction at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, and any law-enforcement actions would have been handled locally, if at all.
<p>
<b>3,000 Federal Crimes</b>
<p>
	"We federalize everything that walks, talks, and moves," said Senator Joe Biden, Democratic 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1986 to 1994. 
<p>
	Unfortunately, this is not much of an exaggeration: Today there are more than 3,000 federal 
crimes on the books. Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the reach of 
federal criminal jurisdiction. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like 
carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo. President Clinton's 1994 
crime bill alone created two dozen new federal crimes. The bill federalized such crimes as drive-
by shootings, possession of a handgun near a school, possession of a handgun by a juvenile, 
embezzlement from an insurance company, theft of "major artwork," and murder of a state 
official assisting a federal law-enforcement agent. Although many of these crimes pose a real 
threat to public safety, they are already outlawed by the states and need not be duplicated in the 
federal criminal code.
<p>
	The federal judiciary, for its part, has imposed national standards on all state criminal 
proceedings. In cases like <i>Mapp v. Ohio</i> and <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>, the Supreme 
Court overruled state law and forced every state to exclude evidence under certain conditions. 
This massive federalization of the rules of evidence greatly increased the rights of criminal 
defendants and further burdened law-enforcement agencies throughout the nation. In addition, 
the federal courts have virtually taken over such vital state functions as the operation of prisons 
and mental hospitals. By 1993, the federal courts operated 80 percent of all state prison systems 
in America. Amazingly, federal judges determine virtually every detail of these prisons, 
including standards for food and clothing, grievance procedures, and cell space per convict.

<P>
	The nationalization of criminal law has included the criminalization of environmental and 
regulatory laws. Historically, these statutes contained only civil penalties and were often handled 
in an administrative rather than judicial forum. Environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act and 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, however, created an array of new federal crimes. 
Most of these federalized environmental offenses occur entirely within a state and bear no 
connection to the federal government. Worse yet, these statutes are often so vague and 
complicated that some "defendants" did not even realize that they had violated the law. Consider 
this: From our nation's founding until 1982, the federal government criminally prosecuted only 
25 environmental cases. Due to the recent trend toward federalization, the national government 
since 1982 has prosecuted and won more than 1,000 environmental cases. In 1993 alone, 135 
defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison for federal environmental crimes.
<P>
	The responsibility for the federalization of crime falls upon both political parties and all three 
branches of government. Although Democrats like Representative Charles Schumer and Senator 
Biden are among the most zealous advocates of the federalization of crime, Republicans must 
also share the blame. Two of the largest increases in federal criminal jurisdiction, the Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972, were products of the Nixon 
administration. In one fell swoop, Nixon's Controlled Substances Act gave the federal 
government jurisdiction over every drug crime in America, no matter how small or intrastate in 
scope. More recently, Republican senator Alfonse D'Amato proposed legislation that would have 
federalized virtually any crime committed in America if a gun was involved. To justify such a 
sweeping expansion of federal authority, D'Amato stated, "The national epidemic of gun-related 
homicides requires increased federal attention, expanded federal jurisdiction, and increased use 
of federal law-enforcement resources."
<P>
	Some of the usual defenders of constitutional limitations on the federal government seem to 
lose perspective when crime is the issue. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the Senate's most 
influential conservatives, has also expressed support for the federalization of crime: "I sincerely 
believe that all of us in the federal government must do more to fight violent crime. The security 
of persons and property must be a priority of every level of government, including the federal 
government." Senator Phil Gramm, an articulate proponent of limited government, once 
proclaimed: "When you have violent predators, the public doesn't care whether the local police 
or the FBI apprehends them. They want something done." Such statements superficially address 
the public's concern over crime, but they ignore the profound constitutional and practical 
implications of this dangerous course, as well as the potential threat to individual liberty.	
<p>
	Clearly, a major cause of the federalization of criminal law is the desire of some members of 
Congress to appear tough on crime, though they know well that crime is fought most effectively 
at the local level. Others, however, offer more legitimate reasons for extending federal 
jurisdiction. They note that prosecuting defendants in federal court leads to longer prison terms, 
due to the federal sentencing guidelines enacted during the Reagan administration. Inmates 
convicted in federal court serve on average 85 percent of their sentences, while inmates 
convicted in state courts only serve about 40 percent of their terms.

<p>	Understandably, public officials who are tough on crime choose the most advantageous 
forum to keep criminals off the street. These longer federal sentences are one of the driving 
forces behind the federalization of crime. For example, the new federal "three strikes" law 
recently snared its first defendant. On August 14, 1995, Thomas Farmer was convicted of armed 
robbery and sentenced to life in prison plus five years. "If Farmer had been convicted in state 
court, he would have been eligible for parole in two-and-a-half years and would probably have 
served about eight years in prison," said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Rapp. "But because of the 
crime bill, we were able to remove him from society for the rest of his life."
<p>
	Another claimed advantage to the federalization of crime is the availability of the death 
penalty. If a criminal is convicted of a federal capital offense, he can be sentenced to death even 
if the crime occurred in a state that does not allow capital punishment. One impetus for 
D'Amato's bill to authorize the federal death penalty for all murders committed with a firearm 
was New York governor Mario Cuomo's annual veto of a capital punishment bill. This federal 
legislation would have enabled proponents of capital punishment in the 13 states without it to 
circumvent the state political process by simply prosecuting the defendant in federal court.
<p>
	These arguments for a greater federal role in law enforcement, while initially attractive, on 
closer inspection fail to justify such a massive federal usurpation of the police power. If longer 
sentences and the availability of the death penalty are needed to preserve public safety, state 
governments are equally capable of enacting such measures to the extent their constituents so 
desire. Indeed, some states had already adopted "three strikes" laws for habitual offenders before 
this policy became federal law. In New York, voters in 1994 elected a new governor who favors 
the death penalty. 
<p>
<b>The Case Against Federalization</b>
<p>
	Perhaps the most compelling reason to oppose nationalizing crime is that it contradicts 
constitutional principles. The drafters of the Constitution clearly intended the states to bear 
responsibility for public safety. The Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only three 
crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and offenses against the law of 
nations.
<p>
	As he wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 45, James Madison envisioned little or no role for 
the federal government in law enforcement: 
<p><blockquote>
	"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and 
defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The 
former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign 
commerce. . . . The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in 
the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and property of the people, and the 
internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the state."
</blockquote><p>
	Even Alexander Hamilton, the greatest proponent in his day of a strong federal government, 
saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. If Hamilton were alive today, he would be 
appalled at the use of the police power by federal agencies. To reassure the states that the federal 
government would not usurp state sovereignty, Hamilton wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 17 
that law enforcement would be the responsibility of the states:
<p><blockquote>
	"There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the state governments, 
which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean the ordinary 
administration of criminal and civil justice."
</blockquote><p>
	Unfortunately, the damage caused by the federalization of crime is not merely abstract or 
academic. The more crime that is federalized, the greater the potential for an oppressive and 
burdensome federal police state. As early as the 1930s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover warned of 
the dangers of a "national police force." In fact, Hoover was so fearful of an expansive federal 
role in law enforcement that he resisted efforts by his allies in Congress to make the FBI 
independent of the Justice Department and to expand the bureau's jurisdiction over additional 
crimes. As an alternative to a federal police force, Hoover instead created the National Academy 
as an adjunct to the FBI's own training facilities, where local law-enforcement officers could be 
trained and then return to lead their own forces. This greatly enhanced the quality of law 
enforcement nationwide without creating the federal police force that Hoover so feared. 
<p>
	Modern state authorities share Hoover's fears. Charles Meeks, executive director of the 
National Sheriffs Association, argues that with every additional federal crime, "we're getting 
closer to a federal police state. That's what we fought against 200 years ago -- this massive 
federal government involved in the lives of people on the local level." And far from being 
appreciative of federal prosecutorial support, one of the leading opponents of the federalization 
of crime is the states' National District Attorneys Association. Not surprisingly, many Americans 
are beginning to share this fear of the federal government. In a recent poll, a large sample of 
citizens was asked to respond to the statement, "There may be a time in the near future when the 
government might limit my rights or threaten my beliefs to the point where I would feel the need 
to disobey the law to protect my constitutional rights." An astonishing 51 percent agreed that this 
situation was very likely or somewhat likely to occur.
<p>
	Federal law-enforcement authorities are not as attuned to the priorities and customs of local 
communities as state and local law enforcement. In the Ruby Ridge tragedy, for example, would 
the local Idaho authorities have tried to apprehend Weaver in such an aggressive fashion? Would 
they have spent $10 million on a relatively minor case, as did the federal agencies? More 
fundamentally, would Idaho officials have even cared about two sawed-off shotguns? In the 
Waco situation, would the local sheriff's department have stormed the compound, or instead 
have waited to arrest David Koresh when he ventured into town for supplies, as he did 
frequently?
<p>
	We do not mean to question the character or competency of federal agents, the vast majority 
of whom are honorable and dedicated public servants. But it is important to remember that both 
of these tragedies resulted in part from the federalization of state gun laws. If the regulation of 
firearms had remained with the states, where it was customarily handled, these tragedies might 
never have occurred.
<p>
	Stephen Saland, a New York State senator with a strong interest in law-enforcement issues, 
puts the argument succinctly: "Generally, crime is best fought at the local level, with local police 
who know the community, with local judges who reflect the standards of the community, and 
with local understanding of which crimes most need the focus and resources of the community."
<p>
	<b>Violates double jeopardy.</b> Another unfortunate consequence of the federalization of 
crime is the danger it poses to our constitutional protections against double jeopardy. 
Federalization of penal laws often creates concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the same 
offenses. This concurrent jurisdiction grants prosecutors at both the state and federal levels the 
opportunity to prosecute the same case. Legally, the rules of double jeopardy generally do not 
apply when both state and federal courts are involved because these courts represent different 
levels of government. Nevertheless, the spirit of double jeopardy is violated when a defendant 
can be acquitted in state court and retried on essentially the same facts in federal court, or vice 
versa. 
<p>
	The best-known recent example of this was the case of the Los Angeles police officers 
accused of beating Rodney King; they were tried on federal charges after having been acquitted 
in state court. Reporters from the American Lawyer, a generally liberal magazine, concluded that 
the state-court verdict was not only reasonable but largely justified. Nevertheless, the federal 
government retried the acquitted officers on federal charges. In the second trial, what juror would 
not have been affected by the fear of additional riots and violence if they acquitted the officers? 
Would anyone argue this second trial was fair?
<p>
	<b>Incurs unnecessary expense.</b> Simply put, it is far more cost-effective to fight crime 
at the state and local level than at the federal level. Federal judges, prosecutors, and investigators 
often cost far more than their state and local counterparts. According to some reports, the annual 
total cost of each federal judgeship exceeds $1 million. Even more amazing, if they remain with 
their judge long enough federal law clerks can earn up to $100,000_more than many states' 
supreme court justices are paid. Similar disparities exist between federal and state prosecutors 
and investigators. So if D'Amato's bill (which attempted to federalize all gun crime) had passed, 
it would have cost the federal government an estimated $8 billion per year_far more than the 
costs of prosecuting these cases at the state level. (Perhaps the most humorous example of costly 
federal law enforcement is "McGruff," the Justice Department's cartoon crime dog. After 
spending $620,000 on the McGruff media campaign in 1993, the Justice Department spent 
another $300,000 for an extensive study that yielded no evidence that McGruff has reduced 
crime.)
<p>
	<b>Undermines state experimentation.</b> One of the worst consequences of the 
federalization of crime is a tendency toward national standardization and a corresponding 
reduction in state and local experimentation. States should be allowed to serve as "laboratories of 
democracy" and experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention and control of crime. 
Even the Great Centralizer Franklin Roosevelt once noted that when a state experiment fails, at 
least it has little effect on the rest of the nation. If one state wants to fight crime by building more 
prisons and another state wants to operate midnight basketball leagues, why not let them? As 
Abner Mikva, Clinton's former White House counsel has observed, some successful prison 
reforms originate with local government. Mikva recalled that in the 1960s, California governor 
Ronald Reagan provided county governments funding for each prisoner they handled locally and 
kept out of the state system. This experiment led to successful alternative programs like work 
release and halfway houses for those prisoners who could be safely controlled in this manner.
<p>
	<b>Shifts accountability.</b> With the possible exception of education, crime is the most 
important issue facing America on the state and local level. It is also the issue over which state 
and local officials exercise the most control. When federal elected officials promise to "crack 
down" on crime, they create the false public perception that crime is the responsibility of the 
federal government. This shifts accountability away from state and local officials who actually 
apprehend, prosecute, and imprison 95 percent of all criminals. The federalization of criminal 
law shields from scrutiny the state and local officials who are most responsible for fighting crime 
and the legislators who draft the laws and appropriate the funds to enforce public safety. 
<p>
	The federal law-enforcement apparatus is quite removed from the individual citizen and from 
local democratic control. Unlike their federal counterparts, who are appointed by the president, 
local sheriffs and district attorneys are directly elected by and must answer to local citizens. 
Similarly, city police are directly responsible to local mayors and city councils. If voters are 
dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate 
officials out of office. However, the voters do not have this direct option with federal law-
enforcement officials.
<p>
<b>The Proper Federal Role</b>
<p>
	If any word describes the proper role of the federal government in law enforcement and 
criminal prosecution, it is "limited." There are, of course, certain areas of criminal jurisdiction 
that the federal government should be involved in. Two broad areas come to mind. One is crime 
directed against the sovereignty of the United States, including offenses such as counterfeiting, 
treason, violations of national security, and assaults on federal officers.
<p>
	A second area is crime involving a significant interstate or international enterprise. Obviously, 
these offenses are appropriately subject to federal involvement because they cannot be handled 
effectively by an individual state. However, a word of caution is needed here. The Supreme 
Court often views individual crimes as belonging to a "class of activities." Virtually any crime so 
viewed could be found to have some marginal interstate effect. This category, therefore, must be 
carefully defined to include only crimes that by their very nature are truly interstate in character. 
Nationally organized crime syndicates, cross-state drug cartels, transportation of stolen goods or 
kidnapped victims over state lines, and interstate flight to avoid prosecution are examples of 
appropriate federal jurisdiction. 

<p>
	Lastly, the federal government properly provides technical assistance on a nationwide scale, 
serving all law-enforcement agencies at every level of government. This includes a national 
clearinghouse for information and statistical data as well as a national repository for criminal 
histories and fingerprints.
<p>
	By contrast, crimes that are not directed against the national sovereignty, or do not have an 
interstate or international dimension, are not legitimate concerns of federal authorities, no matter 
how serious they may be. As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has said: "Murder is not a 
federal crime. Murder of the president is. What has happened in recent years is people have come 
to think if it's a big problem, then it's a federal problem."
<p>	
While crime is a major problem affecting the entire nation, both constitutional tradition and 
practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively fought at the state and local level. 
Federal law-enforcement officers face an enormous challenge just fulfilling their proper 
constitutional role to fight interstate and international crime and providing technical assistance to 
local police on a nationwide basis. 
<p>
	Ultimately, the responsibility for halting the creeping federalization of crime rests with the 
voters. Although the temptation is great, national politicians must be principled and resist the 
urge to make ordinary crime a federal issue. It is vital for responsible leaders at both the state and 
federal level to recognize the dangers and drawbacks of the federalization of crime and to 
educate the public about the proper roles of the state and federal government in law enforcement. 
Only then will citizens be able to hold the appropriate officials accountable for public safety. In 
short, our nation needs statesmen who will stand up and proclaim, "Let's not make a federal case 
out of this!"
<p>
<b>The List Goes On . . .</b>
<p>
	With the regularity of a timepiece, Washington responds to widespread concern about crime 
with election-year legislation. Undaunted by our constitutional separation of powers and other 
hindrances, Congress keeps adding to the list of federal crimes; the results are often duplicative 
and ineffective, and occasionally comic.
<p>
	The 1994 crime bill pushed by President Clinton was a prime example of this election-year 
syndrome. Here are some highlights:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Blockading an abortion clinic:</b> This law applies to every clinic in America; 
interstate travel or commerce is not required for the application of federal jurisdiction. Penalty: 
up to one year in prison for first offense.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of "major artwork":</b> Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of firearms and explosives:</b> Obviously, theft is already outlawed in every 
state. This is another example of the massive federalization of gun laws. Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Possession of a handgun by a juvenile:</b> The bill made possession of a handgun by 
a juvenile a federal crime except where authorized by state law. Penalty: up to one year in prison 
or probation, depending on the background of the defendant.	
<p>
<li><b>Drive-by shootings:</b> Already illegal in every state. It applies to any drug-related 
shooting "into a group of two or more persons." No interstate circumstances required. Penalty: 
the death penalty is possible, if the shooting results in death.
<p>
<li><b>Killing a state or local official helping a federal law enforcement official:</b> 
Already illegal in every state. Penalty: up to the death penalty. 
</ul><p>
	Of course, Congress has a long, proud history of regulating minute aspects of our lives in the 
name of public safety. These federal laws are all on the books.
<ul>
<li><b>Mailing of injurious animals, plants, pests, and illegally taken fish and 
wildlife:</b> Penalty: up to one year.
<p>
<li><b>Damaging a livestock facility in excess of $10,000:</b> Penalty: up to one year for 
first offense. 
<p>
<li><b>Making false crop reports:</b> Penalty: up to five years.
<p>
<li><b>Issuing a check for less than $1:</b> Penalty: up to six months.
<p>
<li><b>Making false weather reports:</b> Penalty: up to 90 days.
<p>
<li><b>Interstate transport of unlicensed dentures:</b> Yes, it is a federal crime to transport 
artificial teeth into a state without the approval of a local licensed dentist. Penalty: up to one 
year.

<h2>Charlotte, the Queen of Southern Banking</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a></b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, the Texas banking industry seemed like a sure winner. The oil industry 
was booming. The state's population was growing rapidly as workers came in search of Sun-Belt 
prosperity. Major Texas-based manufacturing and retail enterprises burgeoned. Not surprisingly, 
some of the fastest-growing U.S. banks were located in bustling Houston and Dallas.
<p>
	But then the bottom fell out of gas prices -- and the banking industry. By 1990, the state's 
largest banks no longer existed, resulting in billions of dollars in bad loans and leaving bank 
customers confused and angry. Suddenly, the dominant players in the state's banking industry 
were those that hailed from faraway places like North Carolina and Ohio.
<p>
	It was not pleasant to be a bank customer in Texas back then. If you were a depositor in a 
bank that collapsed, you may have gotten all or part of your money back from the FDIC -- but 
you lost other things, such as convenience and a sense of security. If you owned a small business 
and badly needed a loan to expand, the picture looked even bleaker. Failing banks aren't likely to 
lend you money or cut you slack when you need it most.
<p>
	Other states have seen downturns in their dominant industries without suffering the double-
whammy of bank failures. The difference is government regulation. Until recently, Texas 
imposed strict geographical and size restrictions on its banks. Statewide branching was 
prohibited. These regulatory barriers kept Texas banks tethered to particular cities or regions, 
protecting them from competition and giving them little incentive to embrace innovation and 
serve consumers better. Lacking the diversification necessary to weather the oil glut of the 1980s, 
the state's banks either went under, saw the value of their equity drop, or were bought by 
stronger banks from more competitive, less regulated markets.
<p>
	One such market was Charlotte, North Carolina, home to NationsBank and First Union, two 
of the nation's 10 largest banks. At first glance, the idea that Charlotte would be one of 
America's leading financial centers seems absurd. With one-fifth the population of Houston, 
Charlotte has no obvious advantages in commercial influence or financial acumen. Yet Charlotte 
has become the banking capital of the Southeast. And NationsBank has become the largest bank 
in Texas.

<P>
	A major reason for the ascension of North Carolina banks to the upper tier of the industry is, 
once again, regulation. The state has some of the least restrictive bank regulations in the country. 
The state legislature authorized statewide branching in 1814; at the beginning of this century, the 
state began to charter banks and allowed them to sell insurance and other financial services. In 
the following decades, banks in the largest cities established branches across the state and began 
selling such products as annuities, commercial insurance, and securities.
<p>
	By the 1980s, a bank customer in North Carolina enjoyed many benefits unavailable to his 
peers in Texas. He could transact business with the same bank virtually anywhere in the state, 
which accelerated routine tasks such as clearing checks, depositing funds, and seeking balance 
information. He could purchase more services at lower cost than in Texas, because statewide 
banks can spread fixed administrative expenses over more branches and customers and can hire 
more experienced bankers. He was much more likely to have access to national ATM networks 
and bank credit cards with low interest rates. Most importantly, he had security. With a 
diversified loan portfolio and depositor base, his bank was less dependent on the economic health 
of dominant local industries.
<p>
	The benefits of competition in banking have become increasingly clear. In 1960, the year that 
NCNB (NationsBank's predecessor) was created from the merger of two small banks, North 
Carolina was one of 16 states with statewide branching. Over the next 20 years, there were only 
17 bank failures in those states, compared with 45 failures in the states that allowed limited 
regional branching and 66 failures in the states that prohibited branching altogether. 
<p>
	During the 1980s, a combination of economic turmoil and bad policy decisions created even 
more banking risk. In the first four years of the decade, more than 500 savings-and-loans and 
almost 200 commercial banks failed. Then things got worse. In 1988 alone, 200 banks and 233 
savings-and-loans closed or were liquidated. Most failures occurred in highly regulated states.
<p>
	By 1990, most states had figured out what North Carolina already knew: Competition is better 
than protection. Only three states continued to prohibit branching, while 33 allowed it statewide. 
Furthermore, Texas and other states dropped their longtime aversion to interstate banking and 
allowed banks in nearby states to acquire failing institutions.
<p>
	For banks in North Carolina (as well as in Ohio, New York, and California) that were bred in 
fiercely competitive statewide markets, even this limited form of interstate banking represented a 
golden opportunity. NCNB went into Florida in 1981, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland in 
1986, and Texas in 1988. A subsequent merger with C&S/Sovran in Virginia created 
NationsBank, which continued to enter new markets in the Southeast, most recently 
consolidating its position in Georgia by acquiring Bank South.
<p>	
Charlotte's other big bank, First Union, has also pursued numerous acquisitions in the new era of 
interstate banking. Most recently, it purchased First Fidelity Bancorp, making it the largest bank 
in New Jersey and sixth largest in the U.S.
<p>
	The First Fidelity deal illustrates why competition and interstate banking have much to offer 
consumers. As with statewide branching, interstate banking makes it easier for customers to do 
routine things. Travelers to another state can often bank at their own institution, which is usually 
cheaper and easier. Checks clear faster and are accepted at more businesses. Firms with 
operations in various states can work with a familiar institution rather than learning new rules 
and developing new relationships every time they expand. And according to economist Steven 
Horwitz of St. Lawrence University, both business and residential borrowers find it easier to get 
credit. "Banks in states with more liberal branching laws use a greater proportion of their 
resources for loans than do banks in states that limit branching," he says.
<p>
	For Garden State customers, the differences will be immediately noticeable, say banking 
analysts. "First Union, Nationsbank, and Wachovia [another major N.C. bank] offer customer 
service that is clearly superior" to the New Jersey norm, says Anthony Davis of Dean Witter 
Reynolds. Many New Jersey banks still close at 3 p.m., and few offer customers automated 
systems for checking balances or conducting transactions by telephone. With the arrival of First 
Union, New Jersey's mutual-fund investors can also enjoy one-stop shopping at their local bank.
<p>
	Of course, bigger is not necessarily better. It is competition, not size per se, that has allowed 
banks in less regulated markets to serve their customers better. Although North Carolina has 
fewer separate banking institutions per capita than most states, its competitive climate allows 
plenty of mid-sized and small banks to continue to battle successfully with large banks for 
market share across the state. 
<p>
	"I think community banking will always have a future because a number of people want to be 
known by name," says Bill Graham, the former banking commissioner of North Carolina. By 
identifying niche markets and improving customer service, home-grown banks in such states as 
Texas and Florida have thrived even as out-of-state banks have moved in. Post Oak Bank in 
Houston, for example, specializes in private banking and trust services for middle- and upper-
income professionals. "We felt the five big banks would be very dominant in the mass retail 
market," says chairman Kent Anderson, "but we felt opportunities existed to work the personal-
services business."
<p>
	Actually, the best way to keep community banking healthy may well be to push for even more 
deregulation. Sidney Bostian, former chairman and CEO of Investors Savings Bank, the   
second-largest thrift in Virginia, says that community banks are hurt most  by costly state and 
federal regulatory burdens and by high taxes and fees, because larger competitors can spread 
such costs over a greater number of workers and customers. "While consolidation is a desirable 
outcome in our banking system," Bostian says, "policymakers should take care not to create 
artificial incentives for bank mergers."
<p>
	In 1994, Congress extended interstate banking across the U.S. to speed the development of 
interstate branching, which means even more convenience for consumers. Paul Calem, senior 
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that interstate branching would 
also "enhance competition in banking, benefiting consumers through more favorable interest 
rates and fees."
<p>
	But some people never learn. Despite the benefits of banking freedom, Texas and a few other 
states may opt out of interstate branching, as the federal law allows. For the most part, though, 
bank customers everywhere are starting to enjoy the benefits of competition that states like North 
Carolina have long produced. And improbable Charlotte, not Dallas or Houston, is likely to 
remain the financial powerhouse of the South.

<h2>Bus-jacking the Revolution</h2><br>
<b>by John Walters</b>
<p>
	Long before "devolution" became a Washington buzzword, Indianapolis mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith turned to private companies to deliver municipal services in Indiana's capital city. He 
started with trash collection and moved on to waste-water treatment; in May 1994, Indiana's 
state legislature passed a bill allowing him to use state funds to improve the city's inefficient 
public-transportation system. The idea was simple: Add independently operated buses to the 
city's recently deregulated taxicab and jitney services to provide more efficient, cleaner, and 
cheaper transportation for the people of Indianapolis.
<p>
	But Goldsmith has been forced to confine his competitive program to state-funded 
transportation systems because of a roadblock thrown up by Congress. Bowing to the 
anticompetitive policies of the ancien
regime, the "revolutionary" 104th Congress approved an 
amendment offered by Texas Democrat Ronald Coleman which severely limits efforts to re-limit 
government. That amendment reaffirmed section 13(c) of the 1964 Federal Transit Act, which 
stipulates that any public-transit worker "negatively impacted" by competition may receive six 
years of salary and benefits. By seconding this mandate, the GOP-controlled Congress 
institutionalized the government monopoly in American mass transit and hurt the poor urban 
residents that the federal subsidies were designed to help.
<p>
	Section 13(c) ties federal mass-transit funds to a bundle of mandates aimed at protecting 
unionized city workers. The estimated cost of these transportation mandates to states and 
localities is two to three times the value of the subsidy. The federal government contributes less 
than 5 percent of all mass-transit operating funds -- about $4 billion a year -- but its mandates 
gobble up 10 to 15 percent of local mass-transit costs. Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation 
calculates that section 13(c) regulations alone cost local transit authorities approximately $2 
billion to $3 billion each year. 
<p>
	How did this happen? In the 19th century, the mass-transit industry was private, but it turned 
to government to protect it from competition. Regulation protected and hobbled private 
enterprise. Cities imposed price controls, mandated service routes, and gave in to demands by 
labor unions for strict work rules and wage formulas. 

<p>
When private mass-transit companies began to fail in the 1940s and 1950s, they were taken over 
by cities. These municipalities remained wedded, however, to the inefficient management 
techniques that drove private transit firms to bankruptcy. Under pressure from public-employee 
unions, they sought an alternative source of revenue: the federal government. 
<p>
	In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Urban Mass Transit Act, granting localities up to three-
fourths of funds needed for local transit projects -- provided that authorities do business only 
with transit unions approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. In a brazen attempt to fight 
union-busting, Johnson supported section 13(c) of the bill, which offered a federal guarantee of 
the right to collective bargaining.
<p>
	As a result, labor unions could threaten the loss of federal mass-transit subsidies in 
negotiations with local officials. Unable to cut labor costs and improve efficiency, transit 
authorities were forced to scrimp on maintenance and hold off on new equipment. Ridership 
declined as commuters found car travel cleaner, safer, and less expensive. 
<p>
	The 1964 act is just one of many Great Society programs that placed local responsibilities 
under the purview of the federal government -- with disastrous results. Since federal subsidies 
began 30 years ago, government at all levels has showered mass-transit projects with $200 
billion in subsidies. But in that time transit ridership has dropped 15 percent and operating costs 
have increased 105 percent. 
<p>
	The salaries for municipal bus drivers are often three to four times those in the private sector. 
According to Wendell Cox and Jean Love, consultants at the American Legislative Exchange 
Council, competition could save mass transit 20 to 60 percent of its costs each year. With 
expanded routes and better service, ridership would rise by 50 percent. Most importantly, an 
estimated 100,000 new workers, including many poor minorities, would be added to the 
economy.
<p>
	Transportation is a local priority best met by local officials and markets working together. 
When Indianapolis allowed competitive bidding for its "Open Door" service for the disabled, it 
enjoyed dramatic improvements in service and served more than twice the number of daily riders 
for the same amount of money. 
<p>
	By cutting counterproductive federal regulations, urban areas could spend their resources on 
more pressing concerns such as crime and stifling tax rates. Says Mayor Goldsmith, "Our fiercest 
competition for jobs and growth is not Chicago, Cleveland, or Atlanta, it is the 100 miles of 
rural, low-tax communities that surround us." Too bad Congress is ensuring this competition is 
one-sided.

<center><h2>Clinton's AmeriCorps Values<br>
How the President Misunderstands Citizenship</h2>

	The greatest achievement of the Clinton presidency has been to incorporate a message of 
personal responsibility and citizenship into the rhetoric of the Democratic Party. On the 
campaign trail in 1992, candidate Bill Clinton stressed "individual responsibility," sounding at 
times truer to conservative principles than George Bush. Clinton spoke eloquently of his efforts 
in Arkansas to preserve "the things we cherish and honor most about our way of life -- solid, 
middle-class values of work, faith, family, individual responsibility, and community." As 
president, he frequently invokes these Reaganesque themes.

	But his conception of citizenship is deeply flawed. Clinton has used the rhetoric of citizenship 
to justify his efforts to expand the welfare state. He has contradicted his emphasis on personal 
responsibility by working to preserve bureaucratic federal control of social programs. The revival 
of citizenship requires a transfer of power from government to families, voluntary associations, 
and communities. The president has instead sought to reinvigorate civic life by trying to 
relegitimize government.

<P>	At first blush, President Clinton's language of citizenship seems a sharp departure from 
the McGovernite ideology that has dominated American liberalism for the past 25 years. This 
ideology sees crime, drug abuse, family breakdown, and other social crises not primarily as 
deviant individual behavior but as social pathologies caused by underlying inequities. Moreover, 
in the McGovernite view, these pathologies are so complicated that traditional institutions such 
as churches and voluntary associations cannot possibly address them. Only policy specialists 
trained in the delivery of social services -- therapeutic-state elites -- are up to the task. The 
growth of McGovernism was accompanied by a massive transfer of power and resources to 
government. City halls, state capitals, and Washington, D.C., were given greater power to 
administer the programs that, liberals promised, would solve America's social crises. 
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, it had become apparent, even to Democrats, that liberalism's faith in the 
social-welfare state was misplaced. A growing body of research indicated that the expanded 
social-welfare bureaucracy, more often than not, worsened rather than relieved the problems it 
tried to solve. These policy failures also had clear political consequences. The Democratic Party 
began to lose traditional blue-collar voters, its former bedrock of support, who had become ever 
more frustrated by the mounting failures and rising costs of the welfare state. The liberal 
principles that undergirded the McGovernite approach -- especially the effort to blame society for 
failures of personal responsibility -- were at odds with the values of middle-class Americans. 
After Walter Mondale's landslide 1984 loss to Ronald Reagan, Democratic activists such as 
then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, then-Governor Charles Robb of Virginia, and Senator 
Sam Nunn of Georgia, banded together through the Democratic Leadership Council to bring 
Democrats back into the mainstream. 
<p>
	They called themselves "New Democrats," and much of their intellectual inspiration came 
from a school of political theory called communitarianism. Communitarians argued that man 
fundamentally is not a rights-bearing, property-seeking individual, but a social being who 
flourishes in stable associations and communities. Communitarians criticized both liberals for 
placing too much faith in bureaucracy and conservatives for stressing the power of the 
marketplace; they claimed that bureaucracy and the marketplace together had displaced the 
community as the locus of American life. 
<p>	
In the communitarians' view, 19th-century America offered the ideal model of community, with 
an active citizenry working locally to address shared concerns. Late 20th-century America, 
however, had witnessed the growth of big government and big business, which served to isolate 
and atomize Americans. The weakening of families and local community institutions, the 
communitarians warned, was beginning to erode fundamental elements of the American way of 
life. 
<p>	
According to the communitarians, the growth of bureaucracy, the instability of marketplace 
relationships, and an explosion of self-interested behavior -- increasing litigiousness is just one 
indicator -- all signaled a decline of the responsibility to community that is the essence of 
citizenship. Communitarians reminded us that it is civil society, not the marketplace or the 
bureaucracy, in which Americans interact and flourish. And it is civil society, they proclaimed, in 
which America's increasingly inaudible moral voice lies, for here is where the institutions that 
shape moral character are to be formed.
<p>
<b>The Clinton Promise</b>
<p>
	New Democrats clearly were on to something. Republicans had only paid lip service to the 
importance of civic involvement and the essential role of local and nongovernmental institutions. 
President Ford's Office of Public Liaison, President Reagan's Private Sector Initiative, and 
President Bush's Points of Light program showed that Republicans were aware of the problem, 
but these programs were severely limited in scope. They fell far short of providing the 
cornerstones of a domestic policy designed to redefine the relationship between citizens and the 
central government. 
<p>	
Eyeing the presidency in the early 1990s, Governor Clinton pushed beyond these Republican 
initiatives by drawing on the ideas of the communitarian movement. He emphasized 
responsibility in his presidential campaign, and the rhetoric of community and citizenship 
resonated with mainstream voters. On election night in 1992, President-elect Clinton called for a 
New Patriotism, in which Americans were "interested not just in getting, but in giving; not just in 
placing blame, but in assuming responsibility; not just in looking out for yourselves, but in 
looking out for others, too." On Inauguration Day, President Clinton declared, "It is time to break 
the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other. Let us 
all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and 
our country." 
<p>
<b>Big Government Redux</b>
<p>
	Thus the Clinton administration began with an oft-expressed aversion to the mentality of 
entitlement and a keen recognition of the danger to community posed by big government. It soon 
became clear, however, that the policies of his administration bore no relation to the rhetoric of 
his campaign and inauguration. Consider the debacle of health-care reform, the would-be 
centerpiece of the president's domestic-policy legacy. The attempt to place nearly 15 percent of 
the private economy into federal stewardship was clearly at odds with a new ethic of personal 
responsibility.
<p>
	After the conservative victory in the 1994 elections, the president and his advisers realized 
that the health-care debate had unintentionally provoked anger against big government. With his 
familiar pattern of rhetorical retrenchment and redirection, the president tried to coopt this anger 
by returning to the language of citizenship. In his 1995 State of the Union address, the president 
admitted that "we need to get government closer to the people it's meant to serve. . . . Taking 
power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is 
something everyone should be able to   be for."
<p>
	Notwithstanding this conservative tone, the president's new approach did not signal the final 
surrender of big-government liberalism. Rather, Clinton sought to recast big-government 
programs as instruments of individual and community empowerment. If conservatives believe 
that government must be limited in order to revitalize civil society, the president argued that 
government can be expanded or reinvented to serve as a "user-friendly" tool for citizens and 
communities. No Clinton initiative has epitomized this "bureaucratic populist" approach more 
than AmeriCorps, the president's national-service program. And it is no coincidence that in his 
1995 State of the Union, the President declared AmeriCorps to be "citizenship at its best."
<p>
	Touted by the administration as a "Republican idea," AmeriCorps at first struck many as 
precisely the type of program needed to revitalize civil society. The president promised that the 
program would assist nonprofit organizations working in local communities. In addition to 
promoting community service, AmeriCorps would combat the entitlement mindset nourished by 
the federal student-loan program by encouraging students to perform community service in 
return for financial aid. Most significantly, the president claimed that AmeriCorps would prove 
that government could act as a partner with citizens, using its resources to leverage additional 
contributions from the private sector. 
<p>
It quickly became apparent that in the AmeriCorps program, government overshadowed its 
"partners." More than one-fourth of AmeriCorps volunteers were placed in federal, state, or local 
government agencies -- where they would reinforce the bureaucratic state, not rebuild the 
voluntary sector. The program also drew criticism for channeling tax dollars to liberal advocacy 
groups and questionable activities, such as sex-education training and "self-esteem" enhancement 
projects. In retrospect, it is not surprising that such activities arose in a government-subsidized 
program; robust community groups that enjoy genuine grass-roots support do not need to seek 
federal grants. And the organizations that do seek out government support are generally those 
with their own in-house bureaucracies, accustomed to receiving federal social-welfare grants and 
contracts. 
<p>
	Finally, despite the president's statement that government could be used to leverage private 
resources, the General Accounting Office's audit of the first year of AmeriCorps activities found 
that only 12 percent of AmeriCorps's funds came from nongovernmental sources. The program's 
supposed ability to "leverage" private funds did not exist; if anything, AmeriCorps compounded 
the entitlement mentality that it sought to combat. Why would citizens support organizations that 
already received federal aid? In fact, public financing of AmeriCorps often led organizations to 
substitute the "blessing" of a government grant for the hard work of gaining and sustaining local 
support. 
<p>
	AmeriCorps reveals the administration's fundamental misreading of the components of 
healthy citizenship. The program provides government subsidies for voluntary activity at the 
federal, state, and local levels. By so doing, it conflates volunteering -- which nearly 90 million 
Americans regularly do -- with a federal-government jobs program run by a centralized 
bureaucracy. It is, in essence, a Great Society-style program trying to pass as a plan to 
reinvigorate citizenship and heal communities. But its very premise -- using federal resources to 
promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of 
citizenship. AmeriCorps blurs the line between the problems and needs best addressed by 
individuals, voluntary association and localities and those best addressed by the federal 
government. Instead, it seems to suggest that social problems are the responsibility of the central 
government, and the federal bureaucracy must direct and improve local solutions.
<p>
<b>The School Lunch Debate</b>
<p>
	For all the flaws of AmeriCorps, the administration's shrill opposition to moves to scale back 
the federal bureaucracy is an even clearer example of how the president misunderstood the 
relationship between big government and citizenship. The Democrats' success in slowing the 
passage of the Contract With America through the House of Representatives in early 1995 
reached its apogee during the debate over Republican efforts to convert federal funds for school 
lunches into block grants to the states. The president's rhetoric -- once again contradicting his 
earlier paeans to citizenship -- contributed greatly to his success.
<p>
	During the public debate, the president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged 
conservative reformers with an unqualified defense of the welfare state, evoking images of 
children starving because of Republican reforms. Rather than attacking the entitlement mentality 
responsible for unsustainable federal social-welfare spending, the administration fought 
desperately to save the status quo. The welfare bureaucracy was portrayed as a selfless agent of 
good. Ignoring successful local and privately run lunch programs, Clinton argued that the 
bureaucratic state -- described almost literally as a national nanny -- was the only entity that 
could be relied on to feed hungry schoolchildren. 
<p>
	They quickly expanded their criticism to include all aspects of the Republican drive to roll 
back the welfare state. In a defense of welfare spending in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (March 
14, 1995), Mrs. Clinton called conservative welfare reform a "mean-spirited attack on nearly 
every government program designed to help poor and disadvantaged children," and concluded, 
"There is no such thing as other people's children." Implicit in Mrs. Clinton's defense of big-
government liberalism was the belief that individual responsibility for one's own children is 
fundamentally inadequate_and the only responsible adult is the nanny-state. It followed, then, 
that Americans could not be trusted with the broader, self-governing responsibilities of 
citizenship: to make decisions for themselves, their families, or their communities. The solution, 
the Clintons argued, was government <i>in loco parentis</i>, to save our children, the elderly, 
the poor, and perhaps not coincidentally, to protect the political interests of the welfare state. 
<p>
	The Clinton view of citizenship is thus based on universalized interests and responsibilities, 
not genuine familial and social attachments. By arguing that "there is no such thing as other 
people's children," Mrs. Clinton denigrates the motivating force that flows from obligation to 
family and loyalty to good friends and conscientious neighbors. Self-interest, a heightened 
attachment to our own property and loved ones, is essential to citizenship; through self-interest, 
we learn to be responsible for ourselves and our families, and to work with others to improve our 
communities. A detached altruism that makes everyone's children our own undermines the fixing 
of parental responsibility for nurturing and raising each child. This is communitarianism taken to 
extremes.
<p>
	The president's ill-fated defense of the school-lunch program, moreover, exposed his shallow 
commitment to returning power, responsibility, and resources to local officials. If we are truly to 
revitalize citizenship, Americans must be allowed to take more responsibility for public safety, 
education, and assistance to the poor. And restoring this responsibility to citizens and 
communities will almost certainly produce many different paths to sustaining healthy family and 
community life and to helping the disadvantaged. With such efforts, the bureaucratic state's 
platform of regulatory and entitlement-based equity will be broken. Individual and community 
choices will have much greater responsibility for the lives of citizens. Circumstances will not be 
better everywhere, but they will be better where citizens work to make them better.
<p>
	President Clinton's communitarian-inspired vision lacks a credible model for rebuilding 
America's communities and voluntary associations. These institutions have been weakened by 
overreaching government and the deeply rooted liberal dogmas that created and sustain such 
government. Citizen apathy -- and citizen anger -- are the result, not the cause, of these forces.
<p>
	To revitalize citizenship, Americans should forge a consensus on a new separation of powers -
- getting the federal government and even large state and local bureaucracies out of those areas of 
public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. The Clinton administration has failed 
to distinguish between the problems that Americans are responsible for solving as individuals 
and those, far more limited in scope, that properly involve government. By restoring authority 
and resources to citizens and the institutions they control directly, we will also restore the central 
place of middle-class values in our community and political life.
<p>
	The Clinton administration's use of federal resources to promote voluntarism and its 
unwillingness to trust states, localities, and parents in the fight over school lunches reflect a 
larger problem: the inability of welfare-state liberalism to recognize its proper limits. More than 
150 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville noted:
<p><blockquote>
	"Local institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to science; they put it within the 
people's reach; they teach people to appreciate its peaceful enjoyment and accustom them to 
make use of it. Without local institutions, a nation may give itself a free government, but it does 
not have the spirit of liberty."
</blockquote><p>
	Liberty, members of the citizenship movement must keep in mind, entails both failure and 
success. The risks are great -- but so is the opportunity to teach the self-reliance and 
independence that is the essence of the American character.

<h3><I>But what about the children?</h3></I>
By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a></center>
<P><p><P>
 But what about the children?
<P>
 That's the question liberal defenders of the status quo throw
at conservatives who have worked this year to change the current
welfare system.  But that question can be dealt with responsibly
only when two other questions are answered first.
<P>
 First, will the changes lead to children being deprived of food,
shelter, clothing or medicine?   Answer:  Only if welfare administrators
refuse to tighten their belts and rethink their missions.  Most
welfare dollars never get to the poor people they are designed
to help.   Most go to support federal and state bureaucracies
and their political allies in the nonprofit sector.  If the welfare
system were a private corporation, its middle management already
would have been substantially downsized.  As it is, the change
needs to be imposed.  
<P>
 Second, will the changes lead to an improved war against the
real enemy, fatalism?  Answer:  Yes.  If poverty itself led to
illegitimacy, crime, laziness and illiteracy, the United States
could never have become a rich country, because it was poor people
-- worse off materially than poor individuals today -- who built
 America.  But poor children in the past generally had parents
who showed by word and deed the virtue of striving to meet challenges.
 Today, many poor children see all around them the apathy of life
on welfare -- and it's the fatalism that hurts.  If welfare reforms
help to develop more hard-working, family-honoring parents, their
children will be immensely helped.
<P>
 Welfare hurts children:  That's more than a theory.  One recent
study looked at the earnings of adult men who had grown up poor.
 The study compared adults of the same race who as children had
the same family income, family structure and parental educational
background; the only difference was whether families derived the
bulk of income from welfare or work.   The study showed that the
more welfare income a boy's family had received as he was growing
up, the lower his earnings as an adult; but more non-welfare income
led to higher adult earning.   The bottom line was that hard-working
parents, even (and sometimes especially) if poor, generally produce
hard-working children. 
<P>
 Sound charitable programs help children: That's also more than
a theory.  Groups provide assistance at every age from conception
through young adulthood: 
<UL>
<LI>Some 3000 crisis pregnancy centers throughout the United States
offer material, psychological,and spiritual help to young women
who are pregnant and do not want to be, and thus help their children
to avoid death before birth and gain a better life after they
are born.   The largest single network of independent local programs,
CareNet, has headquarters in Sterling, Virginia.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Bethany Christian Services cuts through the adoption bureaucracy
as well as anyone, and also is willing to do transracial adoptions
at a time when some organizations still look at skin color rather
than character. About half of the states have Bethany organizations;
national headquarters are in Grand Rapids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>KidsHope, based in Spring Lake, Michigan but now expanding
nationwide, leads members of congregations to become tutors and
mentors of children in poor communities.  Children receive significant
help and church members learn to reach out successfully.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Boys Town, based in Omaha but now expanded to several states,
has a series of programs for children and families in crisis;
family-style homes for abandoned and abused children are the most
intensive.  Boys Town's proven system gives people with ordinary
parenting skills the ability to handle troubled kids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Teen Challenge, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, has
more than 140 local chapters around the country devoted to helping
young people escape addiction or alcoholism. Teen Challenge leaders,
generally ex-addicts themselves, understand that people do drugs
or get drunk daily because they have holes in their souls that
only God can fill.
</UL>

<P>
  
<P>
 But what about the children?  That is a good question to ask
throughout the year and especially at Christmas, when we celebrate
the birth of a child who came into the world to suffer with us
(that is the literal meaning of compassion) and die for us.  It
is wonderful to see volunteers throughout the country who give
of themselves sacrificially.  And it is a great mistake to be
panicked into supporting bureaucratic programs that present &quot;buy
one, get one&quot; offers:  Here's bread, but along with it you
have to swallow a stone.

<U><B>&quot;Serious&quot; Budget Talks to Get Underway</B></U>
</center>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<P>
At the dawn of this century that is soon to conclude, one of man's
great discoveries was just beginning to blossom.  Albert Einstein's
explanation of the photoelectric effect led to an entirely new
body of knowledge that we now call &quot;quantum mechanics.&quot;
 It allows us to to understand, and therefore to manipulate, the
intricate workings of matter itself.  One of the more pervasive
examples of what quantum mechanics made possible is the phenomenon
we know as quantum tunnelling--the basis for semiconductor electronics.
 And I say &quot;pervasive&quot; because it is man's harnessing
of that microscopic phenomenon of tunnelling that is causing the
widespread change we are here to discuss.  Tunelling enables microelectronics
which, in turn, permits the cost of digital computing to decline
so rapidly that it is becoming pervasive--like the grains of sand
from which its semiconductors are made.
<P>
When all those computers are connected so that they can communicate,
the result is cyberspace.  The technological evolution from quantum
mechanics to cyberspace has been gradual and even orderly.  What
is more abrupt, however, is the transformation which our cultures,
economies and even our societies are undergoing as a result.
<P>
One reason our cultures are changing is that young people, whose
learning experience has occurred in the midst of pervasive computing--that
is, with the personal computer,  are somehow different than preceding
generations.  One of my colleagues, a recent college graduate,
has a sign on the door to her office which states &quot;Only the
Digital Shall Enter!&quot;  When I asked her to explain its significance,
she described a &quot;digital&quot; person as one who is quick
to accept change, generally optimistic but resistant of central
authority.  The digital, she said, sense intuitively that small
is preferable to large.  Moreover, I was informed that digital
people tend to be young, although she allowed that I was an exception.
 Clearly, her digital generation has accumulated a different set
of experiences, has somewhat different values, and possesses a
more positive outlook about the future than do the previous, &quot;analog&quot;
generations.  It is, in fact, a different culture.
<P>
 So too is today's economy somehow different.  For more than two
hundred years, industrial economies were characterized by one
overarching feature--the accumulation of barriers to new entrants.
 Whether through economies-of-scale, proximity to resources, regulation,
or simply by establishing a strong brand-name, industrial economies
built barriers to new entrants.  Those barriers were present in
all markets, whether local, regional or national, and for virtually
all goods and services, from Coca Cola to clothing to airlines.
<P>
New entrants could, of course, emerge but the barriers were high.
 In the new economy, those barriers are much lower and, in some
cases, nearly absent.  As recently as ten years ago, few would
have predicted that IBM's market capitalization on the New York
Stock Exchange would be surpassed by a software company.  But,
two years ago, that happened, when the value of Microsoft's shares
exceeded IBM's.  In fact, the value of Microsoft today is nearly
as large as the combined worth of General Motors and Ford.  One
expression of the new economics that is often heard in Silicon
Valley is referred to as &quot;The Law of the Installed Base.&quot;
 It says that, when technological change occurs, which is becoming
more and more often, whoever has an installed base of customers
is at greater risk than a new entrant.  And few companies are
more aware of that law than Microsoft and Intel.
<P>
With so many of our citizens, especially younger people, becoming
digital, and with barriers to new enterprises falling rapidly,
it is hardly surprising that the very nature of our society is
also changing.  What is remarkable, however, is the similarity
between <I>HOW</I> both our societies and computer architectures
are changing, and the speed with which it is taking place.  In
each instance, the overarching trend is toward becoming more distributed.
 Mainframes, those symbols of centralized power, are being replaced,
steb by step, by distributed computing.  In fact, one of the main
debates in computing circles today is whether the asymptote of
this trend will be the computer merging into the digital network.
 While I very much doubt that conclusion, it is not impossible.
 What is startling, however, is that so much of this change occurred
in little more than a decade.
<P>
So far, I have stressed two points. The first is that it is the
plummeting cost of digital computing that is driving the change
to new cultures, economies and societies, what Alvin and Heidi
Toffler have described as the transition from the &quot;second
wave&quot; industrial age to the &quot;third wave&quot; knowledge
age.  My second point is that the defining feature of that transition,
and what most distinguishes third wave behavior from second wave,
is diminshed barriers to new entrants.  Nowhere is the divergent
nature of those two behaviors manifested more clearly than in
the two terms most often used in the discussion over digital connection--Information
Superhighway and Cyberspace.
<P>
The second-wave term information superhighway connotes rigid physical
limits connecting concentrated, centralized elements.  Cyberspace,
in contrast, is characterized by its lack of limits and by its
distributed, decentralized nature.  The information superhighway
presupposes immutable laws of conservation--what goes north on
the highway must return south, whereas in cyberspace we assume
that, since the cost of replication is negligible, the amount
of information consumed vastly exceeds production.  As one of
my distinguished colleagues, Peter Huber, has expressed it, &quot;we
all run information deficits in cyberspace.&quot;
<P>
Superhighways tend to be government owned, operated by bureaucracies,
and with limited access.  Cyberspace, with the Internet as its
initial manifestation, has a vast array of ownerships, is operated
by empowered individuals, and with virtually unlimited access.
<P>
Having said what cyberspace is not, let me be clear about what
it is.  Expressed in the barest of terms, <I>cyberspace is the
culture and society of  people who are individually empowered
by digital connection.  The digital connection that enables cyberspace
is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal, peer-to-peer in architecture.</I>
 The result is an abundance of information, readily available,
with an economy characterized by its low barriers to new entrants.
<P>
One of, if not the, fundamental dilemmas of cyberspace resides
in the nature and ownership of property.  Our experience tells
us that clear and enforceable property rights are necessary for
markets to work.  Moreover, defining those property rights is
a central role of government.  Law, as we know it, was developed
to protect those rights.  In the Toffler's first wave, which was
agriculturally based, law was required to establish ownership,
and thereby ensure order, of the principal source of production,
land.  In the second wave, manufacturing became the economic driver,
and the structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions
that needed protection for their reserves of capital, manpower,
and hardware.  In each of those earlier economic systems, maintaining
stability was the important factor in defining property rights.
<P>
Their laws were designed to preserve the predictability necessary
to either land stewardship or capital formation.  In the third
wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces
land, capital, and machines.  And, since digital technology is
separating information from the physical world where first and
second wave property law found definition, it should come as no
surprise that the third wave is bringing a fundamental shift in
the purposes and methods of law.  In fact, that fundamental shift
is likely to extend beyond those statutes that govern just intellectual
property.
<P>
The dilemma is this:  if digital property can be reproduced and
distributed instantaneously, everywhere and without cost, without
our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can
we protect it?  How are we going to get paid for the work we do
with our minds?  And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the
continued creation and distribution of such work?
<P>
Today's copyright and patent law is based upon the <I>physical
expression</I> of ideas or knowledge.  Books, newsprint, tapes
and CDs are tangible means to preserve property rights under present
law.  They simply don't exist in cyberspace.  Instead, value is
obtained more by the way the information is presented than by
its content.
<P>
New software is often introduced at no cost to the user, but with
the expectation that he or she, having invested time and effort
in learning to use it, will pay for next-generation upgrades.
 Providers of information that is timely can extract a fee for
property that will, tomorrow, be free.  Such intangible features
as ease and efficiency of use, quality of presentation, timeliness
and format--those are the kinds of things that represent value
in a cyberspace economy.  As another of my distinguished colleagues,
John Perry Barlow, has so aptly pointed out, &quot;whether you
think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future
protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability
to control your relationship to the market--a relationship that
will most likely live and grow over time.  The value of that relationship
will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your
point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to
your market, and, underlying everything, the ability of that market
to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and interactively.&quot;
 
<P>
In spite of our experience to the contrary, how ideas are presentated
in cyberspace will be more important than the ideas themselves.
 I think of providing value in cyberspace as constructing elements
of the ultimate digital-to-analog interface--matching the overabundance
of available, digital information to the inherent, analog limitations
of we human beings.
<P>
And that diverts me, for a moment, to a subject that perturbs
me.  That is the obsessive fascination with bandwidth that contributes
so much confusion to the all-important matter of converting our
existing communications systems from outmoded analog, designed
largely for voice service, to the kind of digital infrastructure
required for cyberspace.
<P>
My concern derives from what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--that
we humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through
our eyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears.  This,
ultimately, is the requirement that will shape the communications
infrastructure of cyberspace.  Much higher bandwidth is, of course,
required for machine-to-machine communications, between elements
of the network, but it is at the man-machine interface where the
maximum value is added.  The focus upon bandwidth is, I fear,
a result of our second wave experience, where it is the movement
of information that is valued, not its presentation.  Regulators
and deregulators would better focus on making it easier to convert
our analog telecommunications systems to digital infrastructures,
rather than on maximizing bandwidth.
<P>
Bandwidth is important, because it will make connected computing
richer, but the fact remains that we humans lack a broadband input
channel to access all that bandwidth directly.  And, in the meantime,
it is digital connection, to link together those ever more pervasive
computers, that we need, even more than bandwidth.
<P>
I have spoken of the importance of re-examining the appropriateness
of current copyright and patent law, because the central premises
of cyberspace differ so markedly from our first and second wave
experience.  And I have stressed that the value received for how
information is presentated is outweighing its content.  Let me
go further, and suggest that copyright and patent laws will, gradually
but inexorably, prove to be outmoded in cyberspace.  Based on
largely irrelevant, physical premises, and unable to adapt to
the pace of technological progress in cyberspace, they simply
will be abandoned.
<P>
Peter Huber has proposed something that, to me, makes much more
sense.  That is that the body of common law, developed from judicial
decisions based on custom and precedent, is more adaptable to
change and better able to provide the essential protections that
are needed in cyberspace.  Although, at first that may seem a
radical proposal, it in fact returns to a well-established mechanism
of resolving disputes--the courts.  It allows accomodation to
change, within ethical bounds and, in contrast to copyright and
patent law, common law is not tied to a rigid requirement that
property be physical in nature.
<P>
Among the already-digital, there is another, more technical, feature
of cyberspace that allows the individual providers of information
to protect their digital property.  That is encryption, but not
in the usual sense of government controlled encryption.  It is
encryption in the sense that the creators of digital property
can use technology, in the form of software tools, to contain,
restrict, or meter the use of their ideas.  This, of course, encompasses
much more than enciphering and deciphering information.  For example,
in the language of object orientation, it means creating &quot;agents&quot;
to build and maintain the relationship between the creator and
customer.
<P>
Drawing liberally from John Perry Barlow, let me summarize his
thoughts on property in cyberspace:
<P>
 The protections that we will develop will rely far more on ethics
and technology than on law.
<P>
 Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual
property protection. (And should, for this and other reasons,
be made more widely available.)
<P>
 The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather
than possession. It will be continuous rather than sequential.
<P>
Along with the diminished barriers to new entrants that define
the cyberspace economy go diminished economies-of-scale.  Taken
together, they mark the decline of the concept of a monopoly or,
at least, of an enduring monopoly.  This is but another way of
restating what I referred to earlier as &quot;the law of the installed
base.&quot;  With technological progress opening new ways to serve
yesterday's markets, one-time monopolies are being replaced by
competitive battlegrounds.  Even where monopolies do emerge, the
pace of technological change is threatening to make them short-lived.
 This is true not only for digital technology, but for all the
goods and services in cyberspace.  The reason, as George Gilder
has pointed out, is because the very nature of competition in
cyberspace is different.
<P>
Second wave static competition, whereby many providers compete
to sell similar products at the lowest price is, of course, good
because it brings more value to the customer.  But the dynamic
competition of cyberspace, where different industries with different
technologies compete to meet customer's needs, is even better.
 It is better because it allows competing technologies and new
products to challenge the old ones and, if they really are better,
to replace them.  Static competition will lead to faster and stronger
horses, but dynamic competion gives us the automobile.  One need
only look at what is happening in such entrenched areas as the
market for mail, where fax machines and overnight delivery challenge
the public monopoly, or in television, where cable and satellite-TV
have broken the monopoly of broadcast, or the change that is underway
in voice telephony.
<P>
Such dynamic competition--the essence of what the Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter called &quot;creative destruction,&quot; is
the nature of the cyberspace economy.  Nowhere are the results
more dramatic than in our own computer industry and, in particular,
in Silicon Valley, California.  A negative view might be that
there has been so much destruction, so many companies were born,
flourished, and died.  But that can only be viewed as a modest
price to pay for the wholescale economic rejuvenation of the United
States that it catalyzed.  And, not surprisingly, that renewed
competitiveness is concentrated in the more important areas of
high growth, such as computing, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
and the broad array of service segments.  In many ways, I look
at Silicon Valley as the first colony of cyberspace.
<P>
There are many things one can already observe about the cyberspace
economy.  Although many features are still obscured, good data
abound.  But we know much less about how people adapt to cyberspace.
 We do, however, have strong indications that that adaptation
is not easy.  And I point to the simple fact that, in my own country,
although we have experienced a generally healthy economy and low
unemployment for more than a decade, there is a widespread sense
of uncertainty, even anxiety, about the future.  Yet we are progressing,
inexorably, toward a cyberspace society.  To gain some insight
into how that is occurring, it is informative to look at the changing
natures of individual freedom, the community and of government.
<P>
Perhaps the first manifestation of the new nature of individual
freedom is what we call the &quot;hacker,&quot; that completely
digital young person who ignored most of our social pressures
and rules to develop a set of computer skills through an early
and intense exposure to the Personal Computer--the PC.  Those
skills eventually made the hacker highly marketable.  He or she
became a technician, an inventor and, in many cases, a creator
of new wealth.  None is better known than Bill Gates, who chose
founding Microsoft over social pressure to continue his Harvard
education.
<P>
The hacker is neither a rare nor an unimportant feature in America
today.  Where parents once presumed the hacker would learn the
ways of conventional America, it is conventional America that
is learning the ways of the hacker.  By choosing individuality
over conformity, performance over concensus, the hacker became
our frontiersmen in cyberspace.
<P>
The nature of freedom was redefined in the transition to the industrial
age.  The second wave relied on standardization, and its institutions,
corporate and government bureaucracies, reflected conformity.
 It might even have made sense that, in some cases, a government
would prohibit entrepreneurs from entering new markets.  It might
even have made sense that, in a world of one-way broadcast communications,
a government would assume ownership over the spectrum and limit
the viewpoints expressed there.  Those kinds of infringements
on individual freedom were made in order for the system to &quot;work.&quot;
 They make little sense in cyberspace.  The sheer complexity of
the third wave is simply too great for any centrally planned bureaucracy
to manage.  Demassification, customization, individuality and
freedom--these are the natural features of cyberspace.
<P>
If the hacker is the pioneer, the frontiersman in cyberspace,
then his early communities may be on the internet.  The internet
is, in itself, a paradox.  As the first step toward the kind of
digital connection that enables cyberspace, ubiquitous and non-hierarchal,
it is also a step toward conforming--at least to a common connection
standard.  But there is little conformity in the way the internet
is used.  Copyright laws are, generally, ignored; propriety is
eschewed for the explicit; and privacy is more a challenge than
a right.
<P>
But, in spite of this seeming paradox, there is both order and
an emerging sense of community on the internet.  There is order
because software is being introduced, rapidly, both to make the
internet easier to access, use and explore, and to make it more
palatable, whether through encryption for privacy or censoring
software.  And there is community because &quot;electronic neighbourhoods&quot;
are proliferating, bound together not by geography but by common
interests.
<P>
My own son, studying for his doctorate in Buddhist history, is
part of a global internet community of like-minded scholars. 
On a more mundane level, my own love of Bassett Hound dogs is
shared with a community of people with similar friendships.  What
matters is that these relationships are the kind of glue that
hold communities together, and they are new.
<P>
Looking beyond this first phase of experience with the digital
connection, we can see the broader effects of reduced pressure
on highways, less air pollution, and diminished concentration
of population in urban areas.  This is more than a mere optimist's
speculation; more and more companies are accepting the home office
as a legimitate part of the modern institution.  The SOHO, a new
acronym for &quot;small office, home office,&quot; is the fastest
growing segment of the American PC market.
<P>
Whereas we have much to learn about the nature of society in cyberspace,
we can be sure it will be more distributed, and decentralized
than in the past.  And all indications are that it will be composed
of less heterogeneous communities, linked more by common interests
than by common location.  One could envision this trend as, in
fact, a renewed sense of community, sort of a return to the first
wave agrarian community.  What is different, of course, is the
lack of common physical location<I>.</I>
<P>
However one perceives the cyberspace community, whether as a return
to the past or as something utterly new, the connection between
them is far more likely to be a weaker one than the kind of governments
we have now.  Taking the early internet communities as examples,
the very sameness of interests that binds them will create an
expanded diversity among them.  Or, conversely, communities in
cyberspace will simply be affected less by what happens in other
communities.
<P>
And that brings me to my final point, which pertains to the nature
of national government in cyberspace.  I remain a skeptic when
I hear talk, generally more hypothetical than factual, that nations
are becoming less well-defined, with borders succumbing to international
commerce.  If anything, the common bonds of language, culture
and religion that tie nations together are becoming even stronger,
it seems.  I see no evidence that it will be different in cyberspace.
 What I do see as different is the nature of government in cyberspace.
 Just as surely as economies of scale and barriers to entry, those
twin bastions of the second wave industrial era, are diminishing,
so too will the concept of today's centralized, bureaucratic state.
 And it is already happening.  The question is no longer whether
second wave governments are in remission, but rather what will
the governments of cyberspace look like?
<P>
First, and in order to not be irrelevant, it must be &quot;digital.&quot;
 That means it must recognize that change--the greatest fear of
all bureaucracies--can be beneficial, and that enabling the citizens
of cyberspace is the only acceptable path to success.   To be
sure, this sounds so utopian as to be suspect.  On the proactive
side, ask yourselves what IBM is having to learn to survive and
why Microsoft and Intel thrive; or why Washington is so enthusiastic
to return authority to the fifty states.  On the more reactive
side, ask why France is experiencing so much turmoil, or why the
highly regulated telecommunications industry is so slow to change
compared to the computer industry.
<P>
Massive, widespread decentralization is already, irreversably
underway.  Sometimes welcomed, sometimes resisted, the trend is
hardly disputable.  New dimensions of individual freedom, manifested
by the renewed dominance of the consumer, are already underway,
in virtually all markets.  In this broad sense, defined by my
young colleague with the sign over her door prohibiting all but
the &quot;digital&quot; to enter, the world is becoming &quot;digital.&quot;
<P>
Second, governments in cyberspace will learn to follow their citizens,
adapting to changes in their societies.  The concept of who best
represents the &quot;elite&quot; will change, as I think it already
is in America.  I recently had the priviledge of sharing a few
hours over dinner with Newt Gingrich, certainly the most powerful
politician in America, and Bill Gates.  Let me assure you there
was no doubt as to whom was the role model for young Americans.
 Bill Gates may have been too modest to see himself in that role,
but Newt made him aware.
<P>
Let me summarize my main points.  Cyberspace is not a surrealistic
future that we confront, it is already upon us.  The global economy
is being shaped by it, and Microsoft's surpassing IBM's value
is tangible proof.  Moreover, cyberspace is not an abstraction--simply
expressed, it is the culture and society of  people who are individually
empowered by digital connection.  The digital connection that
enables cyberspace is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal.  The result
is an abundance of information, readily available, with an economy
characterized by its low barriers to new entrants, and diminished
economies-of-scale.  What is important about the requisite infrastructural
change is the conversion from analog to digital, far more than
the inevitable increase in bandwidth.  Property in cyberspace,
no longer a physical entity, cannot be protected by copyright
and patent laws, but instead needs to rely for protection on ethics
and technolgy.  The body of common law may be a practical means
to achieve that.  Dynamic competition, among new and different
industries and technologies, will replace the static competition
of the industrial age.
<P>
The culture and society of cyberspace may be best understood by
viewing &quot;hackers&quot; as the first inhabitants of cyberspace.
 Rejecting the social pressures and rules of the second wave,
they represent the digital mindset that is rejuvenating the American
economy.  With highly marketable skills in distributed computing
and networking, obtained in nonconforming ways, hackers have become
an essential means for institutions to reject second wave habits.
 Via the internet, they are creating the first third-wave society,
comprised of electronic communities.
<P>
Taken together, these are the observable elements in the transition
from the second wave, industrial age to cyberspace.  To complete
this transition, governments must become more decentralized and
more progressive, adapting to cyberspace, along with their citizens.

<h2>Our Foundering Fathers</h2>
<P>
<B>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</B> 
<P>
<B>Are You a Sperm Dad?</B> 
<P>
Perhaps the most important book written this decade on our greatest
social crisis is <I>Fatherless America: Confronting Our Most Urgent
Social Problem</I>, by New York intellectual David Blankenhorn.
The president of the Institute of American Values, Blankenhorn
dissects the insidious and prevalent bias against the value of
fatherhood in both elite and popular culture. In this impassioned
yet carefully reasoned and researched book, he argues that being
a father is &quot;society's most important role for men.&quot;
<P>
While mothers typically concentrate on meeting children's immediate
physical and emotional needs, Blankenhorn writes, fathers tend
to &quot;focus on preparation for the future and on children's
success in the larger society. Fathers are likely to devote special
attention to character traits necessary for the future, especially
qualities such as independence, self-reliance, and the willingness
to test limits and take risks.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, Blankenhorn writes, a proper view of fatherhood is essential
to the concept of masculinity. &quot;Fatherhood cannot destroy
or oppose masculinity, but fatherhood must domesticate masculinity.
In a good society, men prove their manhood by being good fathers.&quot;
But many journalists, academics, and purveyors of popular culture
are writing a new &quot;cultural script&quot;-new definitions
of what it means to be a man-that fails to serve the needs of
children, families, or society. Here are some of the inadequate
roles available to today's dads:
<P>
The Unnecessary Father. &quot;He may be useful in some ways. He
may be a nice guy, perhaps even a force for good. But he is nonessential,
peripheral, 'not that important.' His presence may be appreciated,
but it is not required.&quot;
<P>
The Visiting Father. This poor chump writes the checks and strives
valiantly to stay in touch with his children after a divorce.
Although often romanticized, as in the popular <I>movie Mrs. Doubtfire</I>,
&quot;the great majority of visiting fathers are not-indeed, cannot
be-good-enough fathers to their children,&quot; Blankenhorn writes.
<P>
The Sperm Father. He accounts for nearly 30 percent of all fathers
of young children. &quot;His is the fatherhood of the one-night
stand, the favor for a friend, the donation or sale of sperm.
His child is the unintended consequence, the result of the affair
that did not work out, the reason for the paternity suit, the
baby he never learned about.&quot;
<P>
The Stepfather and the Nearby Guy. Rosy assumptions to the contrary,
&quot;children who live with stepfathers experience outcomes that
are no better, and frequently worse, than children in mother-only
homes.&quot; The Nearby Guy (a coach, a teacher, the mother's
boyfriend) provides not fathering but often &quot;ambiguity, complexity,
and frequent change.&quot;
<P>
The New Father. &quot;He expresses his emotions. He is a healer,
a companion, a colleague, He is a deeply involved parent. He changes
diapers, gets up at 2 a.m. to feed the baby, goes beyond 'helping
out' in order to share equally in the work, joys, and responsibilities
of domestic life.&quot; How can you hate this guy? Blankenhorn
doesn't fault dads who change diapers, but he insists that this
is not their most important contribution.
<P>
In contrast to this cast of losers, Blankenhorn holds up the Good
Family Man. He &quot;puts his family first. He is responsible
for them. He sacrifices for them&quot; to help prepare them for
life in the real world. Sure, this guy also helps his wife care
for the children and pitches in with household duties, but he
views his role as complementary, not identical, to that of his
spouse. This distinction is vital to the masculinity of men and
to the future of fatherhood.
<P>
That's why, Blankenhorn says, it is crucial that society provide
men with the right cultural script, because successful fathering
depends more on societal codes of conduct than on biology. If
we get those codes wrong, we'll see &quot;the continuing decline
of fatherhood and a deepening ambivalence and skepticism toward
masculinity.&quot; We must get them right, because &quot;fatherhood,
more than any other male activity, helps men to become good men.&quot;
<P>
<B>Your Man-Frog or Prince?</B> 
<P>
If you want to be a good father, the single most important thing
you can do is to be a good husband. In a landmark study of marriage
and parenting styles, Jay Belsky, professor in the Department
of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State
University, has found that men whose marriages were in decline
tended to exhibit parenting traits that undermine child development.
<P>
&quot;Men appear much less likely than women to distinguish between
their feelings about their child and their feelings about the
marriage,&quot; writes Belsky in <I>The Transition to Parenthood:
How a First Child Changes a Marriage; Why Some Couples Grow Closer
and Others Apart</I>. (The book, by Belsky and John Kelly, is
available in paperback from Dell.) &quot;If a man is dissatisfied
with the latter, he will usually stay away from his family, even
if it means sacrificing the opportunity to get to know and form
a close bond with his youngster.&quot;
<P>
Sadly, it seems marriages tend to be most vulnerable just when
they need to be strongest-when children are very young. Belsky
found that when children entered the picture, a little over half
of all marriages declined. Only 20 percent of couples thought
their marriages improved, and the remaining 30 percent of couples
found their level of marital satisfaction to be about the same.
Research by the National Center for Fathering also shows a &quot;U-pattern&quot;
of marital satisfaction. It is high before the birth of the first
child, declines when children are young, and tends to rise again
as the children grow older and leave home.
<P>
Belsky writes that a major area of marital discord is the division
of responsibility for child care and housekeeping. Babies are
a lot of work, and the mother generally finds she bears most of
the burden-by choice or by default. Because a woman will tend
to measure her husband's share in domestic duties against her
own (she typically does three times more than he does), that perception
of unfairness breeds resentment. But men measure their contribution
(which averages 15 or 16 hours a week) against what their fathers
did. By this yardstick, husbands today are doing 40 percent more
household work than men did a generation before. Also, she tends
to downplay his contributions as a breadwinner; he regards them
more highly. By his calculations, he's a prince; by hers, he's
a frog.
<P>
The arrival of children provokes spousal conflict in other areas
as well, Belsky writes, including money, work, social life, and
commitment to the relationship. Obviously, those who would counsel
couples in their transition to parenthood must urge them to address
unrealistic expectations and conflict over gender roles. Discouraging
divorce is not enough; we must foster strong and loving marriages
that nurture the healthy development of children.

<h2>Leading the Fatherhood Brigade</h2>
<P>
Thousands of men gather in football stadiums around the country
to recommit themselves to their wives and children. Vice President
Albert Gore attends a national summit on fatherhood, with major
news media in tow, and chastises men for walking away from &quot;the
most important role that any of us will ever play in life.&quot;
Hundreds of thousands of African-American men convene in Washington,
D.C., to pledge responsibility to their families. Is fatherhood
making a comeback in the nation with the world's highest rate
of father absence? &quot;There's not a movement,&quot; says The
Reverend Donald Burwell of Fathers' Education Network in Detroit.
&quot;But I do think there is a fatherhood revival or Renaissance.&quot;
Whatever we call it, something is going on. In recent years, several
new groups dedicated to promoting fatherhood have sprouted, and
older organizations have reoriented their efforts to this cause.
Here are some of the leaders in the fatherhood field-a mix of
liberal and conservative, religious and secular-all united in
a belief that fathers are vital to their children's well-being.

<P>
 &quot;What reduces crime, child poverty, and teen pregnancy,
and requires no new taxes?&quot; asks the National Fatherhood
Initiative. The group's answer, of course, is good fathers. The
nonprofit organization was founded in 1993 to spread the &quot;news&quot;
that fathers are indispensable to their children's development.
<P>
Its goal is ambitious: broad cultural and social change. But it
has widespread support, savvy, creative and committed leadership,
and a national advisory board that includes William J. Bennett,
James Earl Jones, congressman Steve Largent, Willard Scott, Louis
Sullivan, and George Gallup. NFI's aggressive media outreach has
garnered more than 650 mentions in publications nationwide. With
backing from the Advertising Council, NFI will launch a blitz
public-service announcements this year to reintroduce fatherhood
as a vital concept.
<P>
NFI has become a nerve center for various fatherhood groups, sponsoring
national and local meetings. Last summer and fall, NFI chairman
David Blankenhorn led a &quot;National Fatherhood Tour&quot; to
30 cities to meet with community activists and promote the NFI
&quot;fatherhood pledge.&quot;
<P>
The organization plans an interfaith summit in Washington, D.C.,
in May, to convene various religious leaders-a more modest version
of its 1994 National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, which brought
together national and local religious, civic, business, and entertainment
leaders. Also in the works is a summit addressing the needs of
the African-American community, to be chaired by Louis Sullivan,
the secratary of health and human services under President George
Bush.
<P>
NFI president Don Eberly, a former top aide to Jack Kemp, is based
in the national office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, while director
Wade Horn, a former U.S. Commissioner of Children, Youth, and
Families, works out of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Originally conceived
as a public-education campaign, NFI has also become a membership
organization in response to popular demand. Membership benefits
include a quarterly newsletter, a media kit, a guide for community
activists, and a catalog of fatherhood-related books and videos.
With three full-time and three part-time staff members and a budget
of about $600,000, the institute's challenge now is to find the
funding to carry out its many ambitious initiatives.

Considered one of the leaders in the field, the National Center
for Fathering is a Kansas-based nonprofit organization that trains
individuals in the fundamentals of fatherhood. Founded in 1990
by scholar Ken Canfield, the center holds seminars based on Canfield's
<I>The Seven Secrets of Effective Fathers</I> (available from
NCF in paperback and as an audiocassette or a video seminar).&quot;Where
National Fatherhood Initiative is the strategic bomber of the
fatherhood movement, we are the infantrymen in the trenches,&quot;
says NCF spokesman David Warnick. With a budget of $560,000 and
10 full-time staff members, NCF runs programs for fathers from
all backgrounds, including corporate personnel, prisoners, military
dads, and inner-city fathers, and is actively involved in minority
outreach. More than 15,000 fathers around the country have participated
in its two-day training sessions.
<P>
Its national training program, &quot;Operation Domestic Shield,&quot;
is often disseminated through church networks, and Canfield works
as a trainer for the evangelical Christian group Promise Keepers.
But NCF prides itself on being a nonpartisan, nonsectarian organization,
working with everyone from California governor Pete Wilson to
Vice-President Al Gore.
<P>
The National Center for Fathering publishes a quarterly magazine,
<I>Today's Father: For Men Who Want To Be Better Dads</I>, which
contains parenting advice and lists of books and other resources,
and also produces a three-minute radio program carried on more
than 300 stations nationwide.

<br>
Although technically not a &quot;father&quot; group, this Christian
evangelical organization, founded by former University of Colorado
head football coach Bill McCartney, keeps popping up on the lists
of leaders in the fatherhood-renewal movement because it promotes
the building of strong marriages and families. It has been drawing
tens of thousands of men, for $55 a ticket, into sports arenas
from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C., for two-day conferences
featuring Christian music and inspirational speakers. Men make
a series of promises to God, wife, family, friendships, church,
and community.
<P>
Headed by president Randy Phillips, Promise Keepers now has a
staff of 250 and a budget of $64 million, and its 1-800 number
averages 20,000 calls a day during its summer registration season.
Such success has alarmed some women's groups. In October 1995,
for instance, a <I>Glamour</I> magazine editorial referred to
Promise Keepers as &quot;among those who still think men can't
keep up unless women are kept down.&quot; In response, the group
contends that being a leader means being a servant to one's family,
not a tyrant.

On Father's Day last year, Vice President Al Gore announced a
new nongovernmental initiative to promote paternal involvement
through community-based mentoring programs. The goals and structure
of Father to Father are so ill-defined that it is difficult to
tell where this initiative is going, but Gore's high-profile support
will bring welcome attention to the issue. This loose federation,
under the direction of Martha Farrell Erickson of the Children,
Youth and Family Consortium at the University of Minnesota, offers
kits to communities and organizations that want to reach out to
fathers, providing lists of resources and strategies for starting
their own mentoring group.
<P>
An electronic version of this effort is called FatherNet, a free
24-hour-a-day electronic meeting place that provides the latest
information and resources about and for fathers.

Under the mantle of the liberal Families and Work Institute since
1989, the Fatherhood Project was founded in 1981 by director James
A. Levine as a national research and education program to increase
male involvement in childrearing.
<P>
Programs include the Male Involvement Project, directed by Edward
W. Pitt, which works with Head Start and other early childhood
and family support programs. The MIP sponsors community-based
social programs in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco
Bay area, and a national training program for early-childhood
administrators such as pre-school directors. Publications include
<I>Getting Men Involved: Strategies for Early Childhood Programs</I>
and <I>New Expectations: Community Strategies for Responsible
Fatherhood</I>. The Fatherhood Project also oversees a program
called Fathers and Work, which promotes family-friendly workplaces
and presents seminars on how to deal with &quot;daddy stress.&quot;
<P>
A caveat: Critics argue that the project's emphasis on separating
men from the role of breadwinner could inadvertently erode paternal
involvement and provision. Some claim that directors Levine and
Pitt have bought into a feminist agenda that aims to turn fathers
into substitute moms.

Hailed as a &quot;modern-day prophet&quot; and a &quot;visionary&quot;
by others in fatherhood circles, Charles Augustus Ballard began
the institute 13 years ago to help young, directionless black
men in Cleveland, Ohio, become involved in their children's lives.
(See his article, &quot;Prodigal Dad: How We Bring Fathers Home
to Their Children,&quot; in the Winter 1995 <I>Policy Review</I>.)
Most fathers who have gone through Ballard's program finish high
school, get jobs, and legally establish their paternity.
<P>
Ballard's emphasis on reuniting fathers with their children--grounded
in thoroughly biblical themes of family and responsibility-has
appeal across the political spectrum. The institute's national
office is housed in the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a nonpartisan liberal think tank. His urban program got
a tremendous boost in early 1995 when the Ford Foundation gave
the group $2 million to reproduce its efforts nationally. The
institute has opened five new centers: in Milwaukee, Washington,
D.C., San Diego, Atlanta, and Yonkers, N.Y., each to be headed
by a married couple. The institute's strategy is to saturate one
blighted neighborhood at a time.
<P>
Some question whether a group headed by a single charismatic leader
can replicate and institutionalize its programs. We'll see: Each
new location will be headed by men and women who have been trained
by Ballard in Cleveland.

Six years ago, 18 African-American men in Omaha, Nebraska, decided
they would no longer tolerate gang violence and drug-dealing in
their neighborhoods. So they created M.A.D. D.A.D.S. (Men Against
Destruction-Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder), a community-based
group that organizes street patrols, paints over gang graffiti,
confronts drug-dealers and gang members, sponsors activities for
youth such as block parties and car shows, and to counsels young
people in local jails.
<P>
&quot;We started out of pain-the pain of our children dying in
the streets of their own communities,&quot; says a recent M.A.D.
D.A.D.S. publication. &quot;We realized that we could hold no
one responsible but ourselves. . . . So we united as a handful
of community fathers who now know that we must be the force behind
change.&quot;
<P>
From this handful grew an organization of more than 25,000 volunteers,
with 41 chapters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.
<P>
The group has logged more than 87,000 volunteer hours on the streets-more
than half after midnight. For its work on the front lines of impoverished
minority communities, M.A.D. D.A.D.S. has won national recognition
from Presidents Bush and Clinton, the National Education Association,
and <I>Essence</I> magazine. Fathers who want to open a chapter
of M.A.D. D.A.D.S. in their community can contact the national
office in Omaha and ask for John Foster, Bishop Robert Tyler,
or Eddie Staton.

Can ex-cons be good dads? The Reverend Donald Burwell, whose organization
works with fathers newly returned from prison or first-time offenders
hoping to avoid jail time, has answered that question at least
5,000 times. Since 1990, that's how many men his Detroit-based
group has trained in the interpersonal skills they need to reconnect
with their families. In the process, the organization has cut
recidivism rates in half for its participants. FEN also offers
instruction to women to help them reinforce at home what their
husbands or boyfriends have learned in class.
<P>
A tax-exempt nonprofit funded solely by donations, FEN will soon
be taking Burwell's innovative curriculum to four new locations
in Michigan, and opening branches in Chicago, Brownsville, Texas,
and near Memphis, Tennessee.

<h2>Hundred-Gallon Heroes</h2>
<P>
<B>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a></B>
</center><P>
 Eight million Americans donate blood each year, with the typical
donor giving a pint every seven months. But Mike Hitt, an electrician
from Katy, Texas, visits the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center
two times a week to donate plasma and platelets (blood components
that reduce internal bleeding among leukemia and other patients).
Hitt first gave blood in 1969 while serving with the Army Artillery
in Vietnam. Since then, he has donated more than 100 gallons of
blood and blood components-67 times his total blood volume. Nearly
a thousand patients have been aided by his gifts of life.
<P>
 Hitt is one of 62 winners of the 1995 Jefferson Awards, given
by the American Institute for Public Service. These prizes honor
ordinary people who, through their volunteer work, are making
extraordinary contributions to their communities. The annual awards
ceremony, held in the chambers of the U.S. Supreme Court, is a
reminder of the greatness of America-a country where liberty and
generosity go hand in hand, and compassionate citizens are free
to solve community problems in their own imaginative ways.
<P>
 The 1995 Jefferson Award winners range in age from 14-year-old
Gustavo Renteria of San Jose, California, who teaches English
to newly arrived Latino immigrant children so they don't have
to suffer in bilingual-education classes, to 106-year-old Billy
Earley of Florence, Arizona, who has volunteered more than 128,000
hours (equal to 64 years of a 40-hour work week) since she started
with the American Red Cross making bandages for wounded soldiers
in World War I. Mrs. Earley doesn't plan to retire from her volunteer
work for at least 10 more years. 
<P>
  Other 1995 winners include DWe Williams of Oklahoma City, a
foster mother who has adopted five children with special needs,
including one boy born without limbs; Mattie Hill Brown of Wilson,
North Carolina, who feeds 200 hungry people every week in the
soup kitchen she set up in the town's Masonic lodge; Ken and Twilla
Eden, who dress up as clowns in Boise, Idaho, to entertain kids
with cancer; 17-year-old Joshua Mele of Fayetteville, New York,
who designed habitat for and stocked 4,400 trout in a nearby fishery.
Charles Fortney of Tunnelton, West Virginia, who has served as
a scout master (for 46 years), Rotary Club president, school-board
president, and a trustee of his local United Methodist church,
is a walking definition of the term &quot;pillar of the community.&quot;
<P>
 One of the awards this year is shared by two brothers, Leslie
Colston and Bill Colston Jr. Both are paramedics certified in
advanced training with the Riviera Volunteer Fire Department outside
Corpus Christi, Texas. These brothers arrange their schedules
so that at every hour of the day one of them is always on call
and prepared to respond to a medical emergency. The Colstons are
among the 1.5 million Americans who provide fire protection and
ambulance service without pay.
<P>
 The brainchild of Sam Beard, a developer of low-income communities
and a former aide to Robert Kennedy who lives in Wilmington, Delaware,
the Jefferson Awards is one of those rare ventures that draw support
from across the political spectrum. Liberals on the board include
Hollywood lobbyist Jack Valenti and Senate Minority Leader Thomas
Daschle; conservatives include William E. Simon, the former treasury
secretary, and R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the editor of the <I>American
Spectator</I>. Liberals like to honor nonprofit helpers of the
needy; conservatives like voluntary, nongovernmental ways to address
community problems.
<P>
 The awards also mix public service with business self-interest,
an old American tradition. Nominations come from local newspapers
and TV stations, which see marketing advantages in celebrating
hometown heroes. WGAL-TV in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sells corporate
sponsorships for its nominations. The <I>Indianapolis Star</I>
received 150 suggestions from its readers, and more than 200 Hoosiers,
including Governor Evan Bayh and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, attended
the paper's lunch honoring its nominees.
<P>
 Mike Hyland, the executive director of the Jefferson Awards,
has been a TV reporter and a press secretary on Capitol Hill.
&quot;The media and Congress are cynical institutions obsessed
with finding corruption,&quot; he says. &quot;What a difference
it is to work for an organization that looks for heroes.&quot;

<P>
 &quot;I don't deserve this award,&quot; said Mike Hitt, the blood
donor <I>non pareil</I>, as he surveyed the other winners. Other
Jefferson Awardees said the same as they learned about him. Thomas
Jefferson would disagree. The awards are a fitting tribute to
Jefferson's vision of a democracy sustained by independent citizens
of energy and character. &quot;I agree with you,&quot; wrote Jefferson
to John Adams, &quot;that there is a natural aristocracy among
men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents.&quot;

      <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
    
       <hr width=50%></center><p>
	In their 1975 book <i>To Empower People</i>, Richard John Neuhaus and Peter Berger challenged policymakers to protect and foster the "mediating structures" --  neighborhood, family, church, and voluntary associations -- that stand between the private individual and large government institutions. "Wherever possible," they wrote, "public policy should utilize mediating structures for the realization of social purposes."
<P>	Twenty years later, Washington is heeding the call. In October 1995, Senator Dan Coats introduced a package of legislative proposals to help empower local, community-based institutions that are addressing social problems. Crafted with the help of William J. Bennett, a codirector of Empower America, the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal"</a> comprises 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. Coats defended his legislation at a recent symposium at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>; what follows are his remarks and critiques by some of the symposium's participants.
<p>

<b><a name="coats">Senator Dan Coats</b><br>
<i>Re-funding Our "Little Platoons"</i>
<p>
	An intellectual revolution is underway concerning the nature of our social crisis. It is no longer credible to argue that rising illegitimacy, random violence, and declining values are rooted in the lack either of economic equality or of economic opportunity. These positions are still current in our political debate, but they have lost their plausibility.
<p>	America's cultural decay can be traced directly to the breakdown of certain institutions -- families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associations -- that act as an immune system against cultural disease. In nearly every community, these institutions once created an atmosphere in which most problems -- a teenage girl "in trouble," the rowdy neighborhood kids, the start of a drug problem at the local high school -- could be confronted before their repetition threatened the existence of the community itself.

<p>
	When civil society is strong, it infuses a community with its warmth, trains its people to be good citizens, and transmits values between generations. When it is weak, no amount of police or politics can provide a substitute. There is a growing consensus that a declining civil society undermines both civility and society.
<p>	In this discussion, the importance of civil society is something I want to assume, not argue. But it leads to another question: Does this intellectual revolution have political consequences? Should it influence the agenda of Congress, or is it irrelevant to our work?
<p>	Let me begin by saying what is <i>not</i> at issue. I do not argue that government is sufficient to the need. Nothing short of a Great Awakening, as Gertrude Himmelfarb has noted, is sufficient to the need. But I <i>do</i> argue that conservatives have duties beyond waiting for another Charles Wesley. Realism about government's limits is not a substitute for effective public policy. I am convinced that political reflection on these themes is important not only for its own sake; it provides the next, necessary stage of the conservative revolution.
<p>	Government clearly has had a role in undermining civil society. Families, churches, and community groups were forced to surrender their authority and function to bureaucratic experts. Fathers were replaced by welfare checks, private charities were displaced by government spending, religious volunteers were dismissed as "amateurs", whole communities were demolished in slum-clearance projects. The power to replace an institution is the power to destroy it. 
<p>	So the first item on the political agenda is a re-limited government, leaving enough social space for civil society to resume its role. 
<p>	But this brings us to a problem. The retreat of government does not automatically result in the rebirth of civil society. It is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one. As Professor John DiIulio has observed, when a victim is stabbed, you need to remove the knife. But removing the knife will not heal the wound. 
<p>	In Russia, the retreat of government has resulted in what one expert calls "anarcho-capitalism" --  closer to the Mafia than the invisible hand. Even if this result had been known beforehand, it would not have been an argument to retain the communist system. But it is an argument for respecting the potential for social dislocation when civil society is weak. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise has said, "[T]he moral centers of black life were decimated by liberal policies." We should not ignore the potential for suffering, especially in our cities, when government retreats.
<p>	The decline of civil society threatens the future of our political order. It requires us to ask certain questions out of a reasonable, justified desperation. How do we creatively, but not intrusively, strengthen the safety net of civil society? How do we encourage the transfer of resources and authority, not just to state governments, but to those private and religious institutions that shape, direct, and reclaim individual lives? 
<p>	There is not -- and could never be -- a government plan to rebuild civil society. But there must be ways to actively take the side of people and institutions who are rebuilding their own communities, and who often feel isolated and poorly equipped.
<p>	This is the theory that Bill Bennett and I have adopted in the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal."</a> Government cannot directly restore what it has crippled. But we believe that deferring to and depending on these institutions in public policy would have a positive effect. As Robert Putnam of Harvard University has argued, the resources of community, unlike physical resources, become depleted when they are not used. They must be exercised or they atrophy. 
<p>	Our goal is to exercise civil society by turning over federal roles to private institutions. In practice, we hope to tilt public policies in favor of intact families. We want to strengthen grass-roots community organizations. And we propose to shift welfare responsibilities to private and religious charities. Every dollar spent by families, community groups, and faith-based charities is more efficient and compassionate than any dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>	The centerpiece and symbol of the package is the "Comprehensive Charity Reform Act." It would allow individuals to donate $500 of their tax liability to private, antipoverty organizations. This measure would take about 8 percent of federal welfare spending and provide it directly to institutions actually winning their war on poverty, armed with spiritual vitality, tough love, and true compassion. 
<p>	My objective is to promote a new ethic of giving in America. When individuals make these contributions to effective charities, it is a form of involvement beyond writing a check to the federal government. It encourages a new definition of citizenship -- one in which men and women examine and support the programs in their own communities that serve the poor.
<p>	This is exactly how I came to be involved in these issues. My initial interest was not academic. I had the experience of seeing how religious charities not only feed the body but touch the soul. They are dramatically effective, while the programs I reauthorized year after year in Congress did not even bother to keep track of their dismal results. 
<p>	One of my favorite examples is the Gospel Mission in Washington, D.C. It provides one of the most vivid contrasts to government failure I have ever seen. It has a 12-month drug rehabilitation rate of 66 percent, while a once-heralded government program just three blocks away rehabilitates less than 10 percent of those it serves. Yet the government program spends many times more per person.
<p>	To explain the difference you need to talk to those the Gospel Mission has served. One addict who came to the shelter after failing in several government programs says, "Those programs generally take addictions from you, but don't place anything within you. I needed a spiritual lifting. People like those at the mission are like God walking into your life. Not only am I drug-free, but more than that, I can be a person again."
<p>	Marvin Olasky has talked about the need to "defund" government and "refund" those faith-based institutions that actually work. Bill Bennett and I have taken this not merely as an interesting observation but as a challenge. The Project for American Renewal is not the definitive answer, but it is the beginning of a debate we can no longer avoid.
<p>	Naturally, we've encountered criticism, which has centered around three questions. First, is the project a violation of the letter and spirit of devolution? Nothing could be further from the truth. What we advocate is a particularly radical form of devolution. Some conservatives only seem comfortable transferring federal resources and authority to state bureaucracies. Our package would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities. It is hardly a conservative position to argue that, of all the institutions of American society, only state governments merit our trust. Our goal should not only be to redistribute power <i>within</i> government, but to spread power <i>beyond</i> government.
<p>

	Second, should there be <i>any</i> role for the federal government in these matters?
<p>

	My response is that conservatives need to pick their fights. States are better positioned to do many things -- but not to do everything.
<p>

	Federalism is useful, but we need to avoid a 10th Amendment utopianism. Bill Bennett tells the story of a governor who sought a series of federal waivers from him when he was President Reagan's education secretary. Bennett responded that they would be granted, but only if the governor also sent of list of state obstacles to reform. The state regulations far outnumbered the federal ones. 


<p>	State officials can repeat the same mistakes as their federal counterparts. State welfare bureaucracies can be just as strong and wrong as federal programs. We need the wisdom to concentrate on those areas where we can be most effective, even if it means a federal role in jump-starting reform. It is a paradox that it takes an active federal government to divest itself of its own power. Federal inertia serves the cause of bureaucratic centralization. 	
<p>

	Third, does the project -- with its tax credits -- contradict the Republican economic agenda, particularly the flat tax? 

<p>
	I support a flatter, fairer, simpler tax code. But I am convinced that eliminating the charitable deduction would be social engineering on massive scale. The level of charitable giving is closely correlated with the treatment of charitable contributions in tax law. Abandoning this commitment would invoke the law of unintended consequences with a vengeance.


<p>	There are many in the Congress who could not and would not support such a reform. And many of the most serious flat-tax proposals now recognize this fact, carving out an exception for charitable giving. Those are the only initiatives with a political future. 
<p>	I believe we are led by policy to creatively surrender federal authority to civil society. But there is a political point to be made as well. 
<p>	There is only one thing more important than what Republicans do in the budget debate. It is what they say the day after it has ended. If our only appeal to Americans is a balanced budget and devolution to state bureaucracies, the Republican revolution is likely to falter. 
<p>	No lasting political realignment can occur without an element of vision and hope -- a message that our worst social problems, while persistent, are not permanent. Hope is what turns a sociological debate into a compelling political theme. If we do not develop such a theme, Republicans will become social Darwinists by default -- accepting the survival of the fittest. But we know where that hope is kindled -- among individuals and groups engaged in the hard, noble work of restoration. Their victories are among America's great, untold stories. No alternative approach to our cultural crisis holds as much promise as the success of these "little platoons," precisely because they have qualities not found in government at any level -- spiritual renewal and authentic compassion. As a matter of public policy, and as a matter of prudent politics, it is time to aggressively take their side in the battle to recivilize American society.

<a name="him><b>Gertrude Himmelfarb</b></a><br>
<i>Remoralizing Civil Society</i>
<p>
	 I have never been beguiled by the idea of devolution. Like Senator Coats, I believe that devolution -- the transfer of power from the federal government to local and state governments -- is a necessary but not a sufficient step in the reform of our society. I also believe that the next stage of devolution -- the transfer of power from government at all levels to civil society -- is necessary -- but again not sufficient.
<p>

	In recent times, civil society has had many of its functions usurped by an overweening government. Welfare has displaced a good deal of charity. Families have been relieved of the obligation to care for their aged and incapacitated members. Communities can no longer stigmatize behavior such as illegitimacy that the government subsidizes and, in effect, legitimizes -- rhetorically as well as practically. (While researching my last book, I wrote a federal agency to inquire about the latest statistics on illegitimacy. I received a letter firmly rebuking me for using that term; the proper term, I was told, is either "nontraditional child bearing" or "alternative modes of parenting" -- hence, legitimizing illegitimacy).
<p>

Civil society has thus been severely weakened by government. But it also has been weakened by the culture in general. More important, it has been corrupted by the culture. In fact, some of the institutions in civil society are thriving as never before. There are powerful philanthropies and foundations, more than we've ever had before, and some have unprecedented wealth; there are private schools and colleges, social agencies, civic institutions, cultural organizations, and churches of all kinds. And all are flourishing in civil society.
<p>

	But not always to good effect. Senator Coats describes civil society as an "immune system" against social disease. But civil society has been infected by the same virus that has afflicted the culture in general. The theories and practices that have been so detrimental to our educational system -- affirmative action, multiculturalism, outcome-based education -- have been initiated and promoted by private foundations and universities. Some of the most egregious projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts have been proudly exhibited in local museums supported by the cultural elites of those communities. Even the churches, both mainstream and New Age churches, have contributed to what I would call the "de-moralization" of society, the kind of permissiveness and self-indulgence that is so conspicuous in our culture at large. The family is the bedrock of civil society. But it, too, is in a bad state -- witness the prevalence of illegitimacy, divorce, transient "relationships," neglected children, households where the main cultural vehicle is television, with its incessant messages of promiscuity and violence.

<p>
	It is not enough, then, to revitalize civil society. We have to start thinking about "remoralizing" civil society. And that is a far, far more difficult task. And here -- paradoxically -- is where the government can be helpful. Unlike some of my conservative friends, I've never been a libertarian in economic affairs; nor am I much of a libertarian in social and cultural affairs. In our present situation, it seems to me, the remoralization of society requires that we avail ourselves of all of the resources that we can command -- public and private, religious and secular, governmental as well as civil.

<p>
	This may be the most important lesson I learned from the Victorians: They did not bifurcate their lives. They did not distinguish between private virtue and public virtue. Nor did they try to keep religion out of the public square. The Dissenters, for example, had no objection to the established Church of England (there was no serious movement for the disestablishment of the Church throughout the entire Victorian period). Secularists habitually joined with religious groups -- utilitarians with Evangelicals -- in promoting various measures of social reform. Government officials responsible for the distribution of public relief cooperated with private charities, their common purpose being to prevent the "de-moralization of the poor" --  what we more politely call the "culture of dependency." They used, in short, whatever resources were available, in civil society and in the polity, to help stabilize and remoralize society.

<p>
	It's often said that you can't legislate morality. But we have, in fact, done just that. The civil-rights legislation in the 1960s had the effect not only of legally proscribing racial discrimination but also of proscribing it morally. The fact is that individuals, communities, families, neighborhoods, and churches do not function in isolation. They cannot sustain traditional values that are at odds with those being promoted by the government, by the courts, and by the culture. All values, even traditional values, have to be legitimized. And in a secular society, the main organs of legitimization are government, law, and the culture.
<p>

	Conservatives, then, must not only eliminate laws and social policies that have illegitimatized traditional values. They also must devise laws and social policies that will legitimize traditional values. One might say that our legislators and policymakers are as much our moral instructors as are our teachers and preachers. This is why the Project for American Renewal is an important document -- not only for the specific measures it proposes, but also for the principle it conveys: that government -- responsible, modest, self-critical government -- may be a useful ally of civil society in the remoralization of society.

<i>The New Demands of Citizenship</i>
<p>
	Dan Coats has issued a challenge for us to join in a new intellectual revolution, and join it we must. The most promising aspect of this revolution is that its recovery of the term "civil society" suggests that this concept may once again take deep root in our policy debates and in the public imagination. Civil society may very well supply the framework for a promising new social policy for the 21st century. 
<p>

	In his book <i>The Quest for Community</i>, Robert Nisbet suggested that the great challenge of modern society is "protecting, reinforcing, nurturing where necessary, the varied groups and associations which form the true building blocks of the social order." Nisbet's concern at the time (the 1950s) was that the human yearning for community, which is rooted in our social nature, would likely feed the hunger for a pervasive centralized government if not properly directed toward the restoration of real, functioning local communities. Our failure to heed his warning has left us with precisely the dangerous combination he feared -- a powerful central state combined with radically weakened social institutions. 

<p>
	In considering solutions to America's cultural decline, we would do well to keep in mind an ancient Chinese proverb: The possibility of progress begins when you call a problem by its right name. The present crisis in America is a crisis not merely of political and governmental dysfunction, but of societal disintegration.
<p>	We are witnessing today a dangerous depletion of the spiritual and psychological qualities upon which democracy and limited government depend. Our character-shaping institutions are collapsing in the face of a hedonistic mass culture increasingly characterized by violence, incivility, and a flagrant disregard for human dignity. We Americans are in rapid retreat from the very idea of society.
<p>	If we are to reverse this trend, we must change our conversation, and quickly, from the deterministic logic of the social sciences, which shift responsibility for antisocial behavior from the individual to the larger society. And we must move beyond our preoccupation with governmentalism -- that is, what government does, how it does it, or what it stops doing. 
<p>	Can Congress restore civil society? No one here believes that Congress can do more than help to set the conditions for such a recovery. But we should question whether Congress is prepared to do this much. Politicians must recognize that their ultimate success in policy reform depends precisely upon a deeper social renewal that can only originate in our hearts, homes, and local communities. The real question, then, is how do we, as a political community, respond to Nisbet's challenge to nurture the varied groups and associations of civil society.
<p>	There are many positive contributions that social policy reforms can make toward this end. Peter Berger and Richard John Neuhaus, in their classic work <i>To Empower People</i>, urged that the intermediary institutions and associations of civil society be recognized in policy reforms. They offered two primary principles to guide public policy formulation: first, that public policy should protect and foster mediating structures; and second, that wherever possible, public policy should encourage mediating structures to address social concerns. This is essentially what the Coats bill is attempting to do. Finally, there is much the individual politician can contribute to the recovery of foundational solutions: Elected officials can lead in rebuilding civic community and recovering effective charity in their districts.

<p>
	The most important thing is that we get the intellectual revolution right. That requires understanding what civil society is, why it matters, and what we Americans can do to recover it. The debate that lies ahead may indeed spark one of the most consequential shifts in social policy we have ever witnessed. The bill signals a departure from our current obsession with either the state or the market as instruments for social progress. Civil society is a different sphere. It is an intermediary sector, where private individuals join voluntarily in associations that operate neither on the principle of coercion, nor entirely on the principle of rational self-interest. In fact, the modus operandi of life in civil society gives expression to the pursuit of the common good, where actions are animated by a spirit of trust and collaboration. 
<p> I have a caution here, it is that civil society not simply be embraced mostly for its utilitarian value in replacing the central welfare state. The stakes in recovering civil society go far beyond the replacement of the welfare state, as important as that is. 
<p>The mediating associations of civil society, as Alexis de Tocqueville tells us, are essential to both our democratic and economic systems. He noted that "feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed only by the reciprocal influence of men upon one another" operating in civil society. This sector generates the social capital -- responsible citizens capable of self-governance and trust toward others -- upon which our economic and democratic life depend. Lose this third sector, and you end up not with two sectors but eventually with only one: the bureaucratic state. The reason for this is that a society of isolated, atomized individuals is simply no match for the power and expansive ambition of the omnicompetent state. In fact, individuals who are cut off from the problem-solving, order-creating realm of civil society will almost certainly turn to government for order and safety, and yes, even for a sense of belonging and purpose. The result is a politically organized society which is held together mainly by force of state authority. Anyone who thinks that the monster of statism has been slain by the mere adoption of the policies of political devolution should think again. 
<p>	Civil society, by definition, embraces institutions, groups, and associations, not individuals. It frustrates our dominant cultural impulse, which is to assert that the autonomous self is the only sovereign, and it grates against our dominant political reflex, which celebrates boundless individual choice as the highest good. The realm of civil society is free and largely autonomous, but it nevertheless imposes constraints and obligations on the individual and limits his choices. In other words, talk of civil society implies a return to authority and order. Many Western liberals -- whether in political or economic terms -- have embraced a notion of absolute freedom that is simply not self-sustaining. 
<p>	So as we evaluate this legislation, we must remember what has happened in our political culture even as we discuss the need for mentoring, fathering, character-shaping charity, community empowerment, and curbing divorce. Public policy has shifted away from our decades-long impulse to empower isolated individuals. Policies are now being directed at asserting institutional authority, social obligations, and moral requirements over the individual. We must be clear: We are talking about restoring authority in the noncoercive realm of civil society, not the coercive realm of the state.
<p>

	Freedom from the suffocating clutches of the social-service state is not simply a freedom to be left alone, as the latest conservative mantra has it. It is a freedom to become Americans again -- compassionate, civic minded, and committed to rebuilding the good society.
<p>

	The risk of the present revolution in Washington is that it simply replaces a sterile statism with an equally sterile antistatism, which does little to give life to a dying society. Dismantling ineffective and costly government is important work, but it does not constitute by itself a social or political philosophy. Freeing up the market is a splendid idea, but it does not constitute by itself a vision for a well-ordered society, and the market contributes little by itself to the recovery of community. (Some would argue that its effects are precisely the opposite.)
<p>	If civil society reappears, it will have been due to two events. First, we will have taken seriously the coherent moral vision reflected in this bill and worked to lodge it deeply within our public imagination, using it as the framework for rebuilding institutions, renewing human dignity, and restoring a functional society. Second, we will have directed our politics to the task of mobilizing Americans to do what politicians cannot.
<p>	We must applaud the Coats initiative without raising a new round of false expectations. The legislation should be accompanied by the issuing of greater demands -- yes, <i>demands</i> -- on American citizens. We're reminded daily that they apparently want power back. Well, this means helping them recover an awareness of their own social duties. With its emphasis on localism, citizenship, and networks of civic engagement, this bill issues a bold moral challenge to every American, one that should not be dismissed.
<p>

	The great question of our time is, 'How do we renew, regenerate, re-energize civil society?' " There is no compulsory program for civil society; it must be summoned forth. It will happen as we tap into the currents that have always renewed human society: religious revival, the quest for transcendence, moral order, and membership in community. This is important work, and work that every American citizen must embrace.

<p>

	Senator Coats is to be commended for recognizing that devolution of power from the federal government to state governments is not a sufficient answer to America's problems. He correctly notes that many of our problems require "the recovery of families, neighborhoods, churches, schools, and voluntary associations . . . an influence that is literally 'civilizing.'" He rightly points out that "even if government directly undermined civil society, it cannot directly reconstruct it."
<p>

	It is important, as Senator Coats argues, to demonstrate that faith in limited government is not just a negative attitude toward government; rather, it is rooted in an appreciation of the complicated network of institutions and associations that bind us together and provide us with much of what makes life worthwhile. Unfortunately, while the senator has correctly identified the problem -- the decline of civil society -- he doesn't seem to understand the reasons for that decline. Despite his rhetorical skepticism about the efficacy of government, his 19-bill legislative package, dubbed the Project for American Renewal, shows a faith in government almost as breathtaking as that of the architects of the Great Society.
<p>

	First the good news: The centerpiece of Coats's plan is the Comprehensive Charity Reform Act, which would provide a $500-per-person tax credit for charitable contributions to groups helping the poor. That approach -- also found in legislation introduced by Senator John Ashcroft and Representatives Jim Kolbe and Joseph Knollenberg -- would shift charitable spending from government to millions of individuals and private organizations, and we can expect entirely exemplary results. Private charitable groups have a far better record than government agencies at getting people back on their feet, off welfare, and into stable work and family lives.
<p>

	Now for the rest of the story. Coats says that the Project for American Renewal "is not a government plan to rebuild civil society" and that he favors "a radical form of devolution [that] would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities." But in practice he apparently believes that the federal government should tax American citizens, bring their money to Washington, and then dole it out to sensible state and local programs and responsible private institutions. Surely we have learned that government grants do not create strong, creative, vibrant private organizations. Rather, organizations that depend on government funding will have to follow government rules, will be unable to respond effectively to changing needs, and will get caught up in  games of grantsmanship and bureaucratic empire-building.


<p>	Moreover, nearly every one of his bills would further entangle the federal government in the institutions of civil society. Under the Role Model Academy Act, the federal government would "establish an innovative residential academy for at-risk youth." Under the Mentor Schools Act, the feds would provide grants to school districts wanting to develop and operate "same gender" schools. The Character Development Act would give school districts demonstration grants to work with community groups to develop mentoring programs. The Family Reconciliation Act would "provide additional federal funding . . . to implement a waiting period and pre-divorce counseling" for couples with children.
<p>

	Many of these bills are intended to address real problems, such as the effects of divorce on children and the terrible plight of children trapped in fatherless, crime-ridden, inner-city neighborhoods. But why is it appropriate or effective for the federal government to intrude into these problems? Surely local school districts should decide whether to build same-sex schools or residential academies for at-risk youth; and if the people of, say, Detroit decide that such options would make sense, any theory of responsible, accountable government would suggest that the local city council or school board both make that decision and raise the funds to carry it out.
<p>	Many of Coats's bills deal with symptoms -- they try to reform public housing by setting aside units for married couples or to provide mentors for children without fathers -- rather than dealing with the real problem, a welfare system that guarantees every teenager her choice of an abortion or an apartment if she gets pregnant. Some of the bills accept the federal Leviathan as a given and tinker with it -- for instance, by requiring that every federal dollar spent on family planning be matched by another dollar spent on abstinence education and adoption services. Others just follow the failed liberal policy of handing out federal dollars for whatever Congress thinks is a good idea -- school choice, restitution to crime victims, maternity homes, community crime-watch programs.

<p>
	Over the past 60 years, we've watched the federal government intrude more and more deeply into our lives. We've seen well-intentioned government programs become corrupted by the ideologues and bureaucrats placed in charge. We've seen schools and charities get hooked on federal dollars. The nature of government doesn't change when it is charged with carrying out conservative social engineering rather than liberal social engineering.
<p>	Let's not forget that if, say, Coats's Maternity Shelter Act were implemented next year, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, would be charged with implementing it. She might appoint HUD assistant secretary Andrew Cuomo to run it, or maybe unemployed ex-congressman Mel Reynolds, or maybe just some Harvard professor who thinks single motherhood is a viable lifestyle option for poor young women. One reason conservatives shouldn't set up well-intentioned government programs is that they won't always be in power to run them.
<p>	In <i>Democracy in America</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations . . . to give entertainments, to found seminaries, to build inns, to construct churches, to diffuse books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they found hospitals, prisons, and schools."
<p>	So why have families, churches, and neighborhood associations atrophied? Government, especially federal government, is a big part of the reason. Programs from Social Security to school breakfasts make family members less dependent on each other. Bureaucratic welfare programs not only encourage unwed motherhood and fatherlessness, they usurp a traditional role of churches. Governments promise to feed babies, teach children about sex, build playgrounds, run museums, provide job training, rehabilitate drug and alcohol abusers, and care for the elderly. Little is left for mediating institutions.
<p>	How do we get back to the healthy civil society that Tocqueville observed? Here's a program: First, reaffirm the constitutional mandate of the Tenth Amendment. That means the federal government should withdraw from areas in which it has no powers under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.
<p>	Second, cut federal taxes -- not by $500, but by a lot -- so that people have more money to spend, both on their own families and on charitable efforts. An important side effect of a large tax cut might be that more families discover they can live on one income and choose to have one parent stay home to care for children.

<p>
	Third, under the principle of subsidiarity, return all the functions of civil society to the lowest level at which they can be adequately performed -- the individual, the family, the church, the neighborhood, the school, the community, if necessary the state government. Advocates of limited government need to emphasize that the absence of government is not nothing: it's individual initiative and creativity and the vast array of associations that make up civil society.
<p>	Despite all we've learned about the failure of government, Coats just doesn't seem to get it. His proposals reflect the Washington that Roosevelt built, the Washington where, if you think of a good idea, you create a government program.
<p>	But ultimately, you either believe in individual liberty, limited government, and free markets, or you end up inviting the coercive state into every nook and cranny of civil society.

<title>Family Tax Credit Could Pay for College -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>TAX CREDIT COULD PAY FOR COLLEGE</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>	
<p>
	One of the reasons Washington has failed to pass a budget for 1996 is that President Clinton believes Congress has been too zealous in cutting government education programs.  
<p>What the president did not say -- and may not even know -- is that by opposing Congress's plan to give families a $500-per-child tax credit, he effectively denies millions of American families a greater financial opportunity to send their children to college.
<p>	That's right. The fact of the matter is that Congress's balanced budget plan is one of the most education-friendly bills in quite some time. And since the budget wrangling between Congress and the White House isn't over yet, there's still a good chance to save its most important benefits. Consider the following:
<p>	1.)  My colleagues at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have calculated that if an average American family saved the entire $500-per-child tax credit for a period of 18 years, that family would be able to accumulate an amount of money equal to what $14,000 buys today. That's more than enough to pay the average cost of an education at a public university.  
<p>
	2.)  Heritage analysts also have shown that the $500-per-child tax credit would provide families that can't afford private education with enough money to pay nearly 25 percent of the tuition at a typical private elementary school. This would increase the number of parents able to send their children to private schools, just like so many members of Congress do today.  
<p> 3.) Congress's seven-year balanced budget plan would cause interest rates to drop by at least 0.5 percent below what they will be if current federal budget and tax policies are kept in place. This reduction in rates would save a student more than $400 on the cost of an average student loan. Four hundred dollars is enough to pay for a year's worth of books, two additional classes, or even a third of the cost of a personal computer.
<p>	These are all benefits President Clinton will deny American families and students if  he  forces Congress to abandon the $500-per-child tax credit. Why then does he continue to lambaste Congress for cutting spending on education? After all, Congress's balanced budget plan would cut less than 2 percent per year during the next seven years from a federal education budget that represents only a tiny fraction of the total spent on education across the country. In other words, President Clinton would deny 28 million American families the ability to pay tuition for their 51 million children to go to college -- rather than cut a tiny portion of a budget that itself is a tiny fraction of America's educational effort.
<p>	From the president's point of view, such cuts are "anti-education." But from the vantage point of the average American family, the picture is quite different. After all, which do you think eventually will have a greater positive impact on your child's education: Four years of college, or programs run by the U.S. Department of Education?
<p>
Think of what you could do for your children's education with an extra $500 per year. You could save more than enough to send each child to a solid public university for four years. You could afford to purchase an encyclopedia set, a personal computer, the services of a tutor or any number of other educational values. Congress is offering these to the American people, and President Clinton doesn't like it. Why? Because the choice would be left in your hands. Like his ill-fated health-care plan, he wants the key decisions to be made by the bureaucrats.
<p>	The question Washington faces is this: Is a good education policy one that expands the reach and control of federal programs, as President Clinton apparently believes? Or is it a policy that expands the choices available to American families so they can afford the cost of a private elementary school and send their children to college?
<p>	I submit two more points to consider before this choice is made:
<ul><p>
	<li>The money spent on public elementary and secondary education has increased more 
than 200 percent since 1960. Spending by the U.S. Department of Education has increased 634 percent since 1962. What has all this money done for our kids? Over the same period, average SAT scores have declined 73 points.
<p>
	<li> It is not surprising why more families are choosing private schools for their children. A private-school graduate is 52 percent more likely to apply to college than a public-school graduate. And an average college graduate earns a salary nearly 80 percent higher than that of the average high-school graduate. 
</ul><p>
	So, next time President Clinton claims Congress is trying to deny education to children, ask yourself: Who is more concerned about my child's education? The bureaucrats who get my money if the president has his way -- or the private school or college that gets it if I make the decisions myself? Can we, as a nation afford another three decades, or even seven years, of declining test scores, bureaucracy as usual, and an increasingly undereducated workforce? 
<p>	The time to return control of our children's education to American families is now. One way to do it is to stand by a budget plan that does just that.

<title>Not Just a Rich Man's Issue -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>NOT JUST A RICH MAN'S ISSUE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>

<p>
	For decades, lawmakers who really know what makes the economy grow have been trying to cut America's capital gains tax. After all, every other industrialized nation has recognized the economic folly of penalizing thrift, responsibility and success, and has cut their capital gains tax or eliminated it entirely. 
<p>	Congress's balanced-budget plan contains the most recent effort to cut the tax on capital gains. During the back-and-forth debate, President Clinton accused Congress of trying to "give a tax break to the rich." 
<p>	But this simply isn't true. Based on my analysis of 1991 tax returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal Revenue Service -- more than 50 percent of the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. They could keep more of what they save and use their capital gains to pay educational, medical and other expenses. 
<p>	Sure, cutting the capital gains tax will benefit manufacturers, retailers and other employers -- those who provide Americans with jobs, and who also may be wealthy as a result of their success. This is all to the good, because the money these people don't pay in taxes will be invested in the economy and create more jobs instead of collecting mold in the pockets of federal bureaucrats. Businesses and households spend their money better than government: When was the last time you bought a $700 hammer?  
<p>	But the capital gains tax isn't just something corporate executives have to deal with. It's what gets slapped on your Uncle Joe when he sells his family business; on your retired grandparents when they sell that nest egg of General Motors stock they've been holding for 40 years; and on your parents when they sell their empty-nest home to live in an apartment. All these legitimate economic gains by middle-class American taxpayers -- many of them elderly -- shouldn't be accompanied by a huge tax bill from Uncle Sam. But they are. And it's not fair. 
<p>	Especially when those who argue against a capital gains tax cut fudge on the number of "rich" people who would benefit. Politicians -- including President Clinton -- commonly distort the numbers by counting the one-time capital gain your grandparents realize on the sale of their old house as if this indicated their normal income level. In other words, if they were collecting $30,000 a year from Social Security and made a one-time $30,000 capital gain from selling their house, they would be counted as a $60,000 a year household for purposes of arguing against cutting the capital gains tax!
<p> 	That's ludicrous. And it gives you an idea of the lengths some people will go to keep America from understanding what will happen when the government stops penalizing success. 
<p>	The truth is that each of America's leading private economic consulting firms -- including DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates -- has concluded that balancing the federal budget and cutting taxes at the same time, including the capital gains tax, would result in a stronger, more productive economy. This is precisely the plan President Clinton is opposing.
<p>	For example, one of the most widely respected models of the U.S. economy -- the University of Michigan Quarterly Model -- found that combining a balanced federal budget with tax cuts would produce immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing in long-term economic activity. When my colleagues and I at The Heritage Foundation conducted a similar study, we found not only that the economy would surge, but that most of the economic benefits hinged precisely on a cut in the capital gains tax. Without that cut, most of the benefits vanish.
<p>	 The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would cut in half the amount of money your parents are forced to pay the government when they try to collect their retirement nest egg. It would eliminate the tax liability of 3.5 million poor American families through a $500-per-child tax credit, so they wouldn't have to pay federal taxes at all, directly affecting the well-being of 8 million American children. And it would encourage a booming economy. Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, recently testified before Congress that just the "expectation" of a balanced budget had caused interest rates to drop two percentage points. 
<p>	But instead of admitting that Congress may have something here, and giving middle-class Americans a windfall of economic well-being, President Clinton wants to harp on the tired, class-warfare and envy rhetoric. He continues to present Congress's plan as "tax cuts for the rich." 
<p>	The facts do not support this view.

<h2>Block (Grant) Party</h2> 
<P>

<B>by <a href="http://badger.state.wi.us:/agencies/gov/gov_home.html">Tommy Thompson</a></B>
<P>
 What will the states do differently once they have block grants?
The short and simple answer: We will put our ideas to work. Once
a block-grant system becomes operational, several key areas of
public assistance will be set loose from the dead weight of federal
oversight.<p>
 For the most part, the block-grant system frees states
from the shackles of a waiver system that has inhibited innovation
and stymied true reform. Prior to recent congressional action,
if a state passed an innovative welfare reform initiative, it
would have to go to Washington on bended knee and kiss somebody's
ring in order to get a waiver to implement the program.<p>
 In Wisconsin,
we know the waiver system all too well. We have sought and received
227 different waivers to implement our innovative welfare programs.
And we know that you never get everything you ask for in a waiver
request, either. If your waiver asks for 10 items, you are lucky
if Washington grants you three.<p>
 In Wisconsin, the block-grant
system means we will be able to implement the most ambitious change
in the welfare system that this country has ever seen.  <p>
The changes
we expect to enact are called W-2, or Wisconsin Works. This initiative
would end the automatic welfare check. It would end AFDC. And
once implemented, W-2 will mark the greatest change in social
policy in this country in the past 50 years. <p>
In Wisconsin, we
will no longer have a welfare system; we will have a work system.
In fact, we have already transferred our welfare division from
our Department of Health and Human Services to our Department
of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations, and have made it a work
division. The reason: We are replacing the automatic welfare check
with a comprehensive package of work options, job training, health-care
and child-care services, and even financial planning.  <p>
And we
know W-2 will succeed in moving people off welfare and into the
workforce. Wisconsin has been reforming the welfare system longer
than any other state by far, having begun when I took office in
1987. Since then, our AFDC caseload has dropped 30 percent, and
we're saving our taxpayers $17 million a month.  <p>
Imagine what
Wisconsin and other states could do with the freedom and flexibility
provided by the block-grant system. <p>
In a recent study, Princeton
University professor Lawrence Mead concluded that Wisconsin cut
its welfare dependency because it tied benefits to work. W-2 is
based on the philosophy that for those who can work, only work
should pay. We assume that everybody is able to work-or at least
is able to contribute to society through some work activity within
their abilities. The only way to escape welfare or to escape poverty
is to work. There is no other way. Therefore, W-2 helps the traditional
welfare recipient make the transition to employment and an independent
life as quickly as possible. When people seek economic assistance
(or what used to be known as AFDC) from the state, they will be
required to sign up for work immediately. And it is only by performing
some level of work that they will receive economic assistance.<p>

W-2 consists of a four-rung job ladder designed to help participants
climb out of poverty and government dependence and into a life
of independence and self-reliance. The top rung is unsubsidized
employment. Under this option, participants who are job-ready
will be matched up with the best available job. This is the ideal
option-the rung on the ladder that all participants should aspire
to reach. A W-2 participant directed into unsubsidized work is
also eligible for, depending on his income, food stamps, health
care, child care, and the earned-income tax credit. <p>
The second
rung on the ladder is subsidized employment, or trial jobs. This
rung is for people without a work history but with a willing attitude.
Employers who hire people on this rung get help in offsetting
some of the costs of training and trying out a new employee. The
wage subsidy is limited to between three and six months. A person
in a trial job can remain on this rung of the ladder for no more
than 24 months and is eligible for food stamps, child care, health
care, and the earned- income tax credit. <p>
Community-service jobs
constitute the third rung and are meant for people who need to
practice the work habits and skills necessary to be hired by a
private business. These jobs will pay 75 percent of the minimum
wage (more than the welfare grant) and may come with food stamps,
child care, and health care. A person can remain in a community-service
job for up to nine months before being required to move up the
ladder, and there is a lifetime limit of 24 months for this rung.<p>

The fourth option, and bottom rung of the ladder, is called W-2
Transitions. This rung is reserved for those who legitimately
are unable to perform self-sustaining work, even in a community-service
job. To receive cash benefits, participants will work in activities
consistent with their abilities. Work at this level pays 70 percent
of minimum wage, and the worker is eligible for food stamps, health
care, and day care. Although this option has a 24-month participation
limit, extensions are permitted on a case-by-case basis. <p>
The goal
of this program is to move those with little or no work histories
up the work ladder, gaining more work experience, until they are
in an unsubsidized job and caring for their families on their
own. Participation is limited to five years over a person's lifetime.<p>

The benchmark for W-2's fairness is a comparison with low-income
families that work for a living. With this in mind, the program
includes a system of copayments for health-care and child-care
benefits. Just as low-income families must pay for child care
and health care-either in full or in part-W-2 participants will
be required to pay what they can afford for these services, on
a sliding scale. W-2 also would make health care more accessible
to low-income working families by allowing them to buy into the
state health-care system. <p>
Finally, Wisconsin Works is designed
to address the problem of teen pregnancy. In the past, too many
long-time welfare recipients started on welfare as teen parents.
We have to break the cycle of dependency earlier. So under our
plan, teen parents who are minors and who cannot live at home
or with a legal guardian will not be allowed to set up their own
household with cash assistance from the state. For those who cannot
live at home, three options will be available: Live in a foster
home, live in a group home, or, as a last resort for older teens,
live in a supervised independent setting.  <p>
The Wisconsin Works
welfare package has received bipartisan support in our legislature,
which is expected to approve the program early next year; we plan
to implement it in 1997. Without block grants, however, we would
need a series of waivers and probably would be unable to adopt
half of the program's initiatives. <p>
Another area that holds tremendous
promise for innovation under a block-grant system is Medicaid.
No item affects state budgets more profoundly than Medicaid, so
states will be looking for the most efficient and effective way
to provide high-quality health care at a reasonable cost. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we started improving our Medicaid system some time ago, but again
had to rely on a waiver system that scuttled some of our plans.
Regardless, industry experts have recognized Wisconsin for running
the country's most efficient Medicaid system. <p>
We began our reform
efforts using a managed-care system, which has allowed us to provide
more Medicaid recipients with a higher quality of care at lower
cost. Indeed, by enrolling AFDC recipients in health-maintenance
organizations, the state became an active player in controlling
costs. Instead of serving as a blank check, the state could step
in and negotiate the highest quality care at the best price. Instead
of serving as a health-care &quot;payor,&quot; the state is now
a health-care &quot;buyer.&quot; <p>
What is most exciting about the
program is that HMOs are providing AFDC recipients with better
health care. They have a primary doctor, someone they can go to
on a regular basis. They also have greater access to important
preventive care, such as well-baby visits and immunizations. <p>
While
Wisconsin is not alone in utilizing a managed-care system for
Medicaid recipients, the block-grant system will make it easier
for all states to shift to such a system.  <p>
As major buyers of
managed care, states will be able to leverage their purchasing
power to control costs as well as improve access and quality.
With the financial flexibility of block grants, many states also
will be able to extend this formidable purchasing power to offer
low-cost coverage to uninsured working families. Though managed
care, particularly for the elderly and disabled, requires careful
planning and vigilant oversight, it will be an essential component
of every new Medicaid program. <p>
States throughout this country
have been extraordinarily successful in enrolling nearly one-third
of all Medicaid recipients in managed-care organizations. But
progress has been frustrated by lengthy, time-consuming waivers
for arcane federal rules designed to impede managed care. In effect,
the current waiver process gives states a Hobson's choice: Either
accept the costly and burdensome new strings often attached to
federal waivers, or forgo altogether the use of managed care and
other modern delivery systems now common in the private sector.<p>

Besides managed care, the Medicaid block-grant system would allow
states to pursue integrated solutions in providing health care,
particularly long-term care for the elderly. <p>
Comprehensive service
networks are being created by the private sector from the inevitable
integration of health-care suppliers, particularly health plans,
hospitals, and clinics. While the federal government has been
oblivious to these historic changes, employers and other buyers
of health care are adapting to take full advantage. The block-grant
system will allow state Medicaid programs to take advantage as
well. <p>
Under the old Medicaid system, states were forced to take
a fragmented approach to health-care problems, most notably long-term
care. An incomprehensible layer of federal restrictions forced
states to create disparate programs in order to work around federal
obstacles. In the provision of long-term care, the result was
a confusing, overly complex and costly mix of home, community,
and institutional care. <p>
The new Medigrant program, however, will
permit states to integrate their long-term care programs and promote
the purchase of private long-term care insurance. By combining
the array of home, community, and institutional programs into
more integrated solutions based on managed care, the elderly and
disabled will have more options and taxpayers' costs will be better
controlled. Integrated solutions also provide states with greater
leverage to improve access to health care as well as the quality
of care. <p>
A third advantage to the block-grant system is that it
would allow states to make Medicaid coverage more sensible. As
an entitlement under federal law, the scope of Medicaid coverage
is now determined by the courts and rule-making bureaucrats. Neither
the medical community nor the taxpayers have any real say in the
matter. This has led to such absurdities as the coverage of gourmet
cookies, soap, and household appliances. This has long frustrated
the states as they've struggled to manage their systems. <p>
Freed
from federal oversight, we'll likely see the end to Medicaid as
the Cadillac of health plans and the eventual adoption of coverage
more akin to that offered to workers in private industry. While
coverage for the elderly and disabled will continue to include
additional services, particularly long-term care, the end of the
legal entitlement will permit states to take into account true
medical needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative services.<p>

Finally, the Medicaid block-grant system will lead to streamlined
administration, which will save taxpayer money. As a result of
an avalanche of federal mandates, Medicaid has become the most
complex social program ever devised. The Medicaid program is now
governed by more than 50,000 pages of federal-state agreements,
more than 2,000 pages of federal laws, and some 15,000 pages of
federal rules and instructions. This extraordinary level of complexity
makes the federal tax code look like a nursery rhyme. <p>
Furthermore,
states must collectively prepare more than 8,000 federally mandated
reports each year. Most of these are never read, much less used,
by a living soul. Because of the labyrinth of federal eligibility
rules, there are more than 200 different ways to qualify for Medicaid
in Wisconsin alone. Making matters worse, federal loopholes force
states to cover middle-class individuals and facilitate the hiding
of assets and income. <p>
Under the 170-page Medigrant bill, state
Medicaid plans could be vastly simplified, thousands of pages
of inane federal rules would be rescinded and those 8,000 reports
would be reduced to just 50-one for each state. States like Wisconsin
will be able to streamline eligibility determinations, close loopholes
and tie Medicaid coverage to participation in jobs programs like
W-2. And accountability will be enforced where it truly matters-in
the establishment of fiscal controls, independent audits and evaluations,
and public reporting of program performance. <p>
Medicaid will be
an area where states will clearly be able to demonstrate a greater
ability to manage an unwieldy program and provide services better
than Washington. And it will serve as an example of what can be
accomplished once Washington steps back and keeps its overregulating
fingers out of the mix. <p>
The block-grant system will provide states
with a remarkable opportunity to enact their best ideas and brightest
programs. The ultimate winner will be the taxpayer, who will receive
a higher quality product at a lower cost. Already, with the limited
amount of experimentation the federal government has allowed,
states have shown that they can manage complex programs like welfare
and Medicaid much better than the federal government. The very
concept of federal block grants shows that Congress is recognizing
the great work that is already being done by the states. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we can't wait to carry on that work and put our best ideas into
practice.

<h2>Humble Clovis Defies The Education Visigoths</h2>
<P>
<B>by Christopher Garcia</B>
<P>
 In 507 a.d., at Vouill&eacute; in present-day France, the King
of the Franks led a band of warriors against the Visigoths, the
marauding barbarians who had sacked Rome a century earlier. The
king, named Clovis, defeated the Visigoths and broke their hold
on Europe.<p>
 Today, a modern namesake-the Clovis Unified School
District (CUSD), in Fresno, California-is successfully defying
another ominous empire: the education establishment. Despite serving
a significant portion of Fresno's urban poor, Clovis is proving
that public schools can deliver a good education with a small
budget and minimal bureaucracy.<p>
 Clovis has long ignored the prevailing
cant about the need for high spending and huge bureaucratic machinery
to regulate public education. During the 1993-94 school year,
CUSD spent $3,892 per pupil; school districts nationwide averaged
$5,730. The district's student-to-administrator ratio is 520:1-nearly
twice the national average. And although similarly sized districts
(like those in Rochester, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin) typically
house 300 to 400 employees in their central offices, CUSD employs
just 167. With no teachers union or Parent Teachers Association
(PTA), CUSD is a rarity among public schools.  <p>
In this case, less
means more-more students performing above average across a broad
range of measures. The district's average score on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) is 52 points higher than the state average
and 42 points higher than the national average. CUSD's mean composite
score on the American College Test (ACT) stands respectably at
the 65th percentile. In 1995, with a senior cohort of 1,606, CUSD
students passed 720 Advanced Placement (AP) exams. <p>
Perhaps one
reason Clovis kids outperform their peers is that they show up
for class more often: The district's high-school attendance rate
is nearly 95 percent, and its drop-out rate is only 4 percent.
The district doesn't skimp on its extracurricular offerings, either.
More than 80 percent of Clovis students participate in one of
the most successful programs in California. Last year, the district
earned a championship at the National Future Farmers of America
Convention and sent its state-champion Odyssey of the Mind team
to compete in the world finals. <p>
Many Clovis children are among
the most disadvantaged in the region. Nearly 40 percent of the
district's students live in Fresno City. Six of CUSD's elementary
schools enroll enough AFDC children to qualify for direct financial
assistance from the federal government. And five schools have
student bodies with more than 50 percent minorities. In 1989,
the median household income of the community surrounding Pinedale
Elementary School was $10,000 below the national median of $28,906.
And yet Mexican-Americans, who make up the district's largest
minority (about 18 percent of all students), outperform their
state and national counterparts on the ACT by significant margins.<p>

Created in 1960 from the merger of seven rural, low-income school
districts, CUSD presented its first superintendent, Floyd V. Buchanan,
with a significant challenge: Barely more than one in three of
the district's 1,843 students performed at grade level. Buchanan
wanted to push this figure to 90 percent-but how? <p>
Put simply:
competition, control, and consequences. Buchanan reasoned that
schools would not be spurred to meet the goals that he and the
central administration set for them unless they competed against
one another in academic and extracurricular achievement. He established
goals for each of the system's 11 schools at the start of the
year, ranked them according to their performance at year's end,
and established a system of carrots and sticks (mostly carrots).<p>

Most importantly, administrators and teachers were allowed to
choose the teaching methods and curricula they felt suited their
objectives. This formula, in place for decades, has allowed the
district-now with 30 schools and 28,000 students-to place between
70 and 90 percent of its students at grade level. <p>
Competition
in the district exists at several levels. Earning a rating as
a top school is its own reward, but the district recognizes high
achievement in other ways. The top schools on the elementary,
intermediate, and high-school levels are recognized at an annual,
districtwide award ceremony. The district's best teachers and
administrators are honored at a dinner. And the school's achievements
are reported to parents and the community in the pages of the
district's publications.  <p>
The friendly, competitive culture at
Clovis clearly has helped drive achievement. Because a school's
performance at a districtwide choral competition or drama fair
influences its ratings, teachers, students, and administrators
work hard to give their routines the extra edge needed to push
ahead of their colleagues. Schools borrow the winning strategies
used elsewhere. Students at Clovis West High School, for example,
often score better on SATs and AP exams than those at Clovis High
School, so Clovis High has borrowed test-preparation tips from
Clovis West. Clovis High is also trying to improve discipline
by looking at successful techniques employed at Buchanan High.<p>

Competition, however, would produce little without local decision-making.
Anticipating trends that would revolutionize America's Fortune
500 companies, Buchanan made flexible, decentralized, site-based
management a fundamental feature of the school system in 1972.
The district office has been responsible for setting goals and
establishing guidelines, but schools have worked to meet these
goals in their own ways. &quot;They give us the what and we figure
out the how,&quot; says Kevin Peterson, the principal of Tarpey
Elementary School.<p>
When officials at Pinedale Elementary School
determined that parent participation there was lower than at other
schools, for example, they realized that immigrant parents felt
locked out by language barriers. So they created &quot;family
nights&quot; to help these parents take part in their children's
education. With their children present, the parents are taught
games and devices they can use at home to help their children
with their homework. The result: Immigrant parents now participate
more. Such innovation is easier in the absence of teacher unions.
For example, the district deploys teachers weekly to the homes
of about 100 recently arrived immigrants to provide them English-language
instruction and to help them build a bridge to their rapidly assimilating
children. Meredith Ekwall, a first-grade teacher at Weldon Elementary
School, teaches English at night to the parents of her ESL students
to encourage English use in the home. In districts where collective-bargaining
agreements stipulate precisely how much time teachers spend teaching,
micromanage the amount of time teachers can devote to activities
outside of the classroom, and dictate what a district can and
cannot ask its teachers to do, such flexibility and voluntarism
is rare.<p>
Along with teacher autonomy and greater parent access,
Clovis strives for accountability. All the teachers, without exception,
are expected to bring 90 percent of their students up to grade
level. If they do not, everyone knows about it. The district's
research and evaluation division notifies teachers, parents, and
administrators of school and student performance. And with curriculum
development and teacher hiring and firing in the schools' hands,
knowledge is power. The approach has &quot;made every teacher
accountable,&quot; says Redbank Elementary School Principal Susan
VanDoren. &quot;[I]t made me sit down and look at all those kids
[needing help] and ask, 'What can we do?'&quot; <p>
Parents seem more
likely to ask that question in Clovis than in other school districts.
Parents and other community members (including the clergy, senior
citizens, and businessmen) sit on advisory boards, where they
review individual school performance and formulate policy. Last
year, some parents were upset that children were required to read
feminist author Maya Angelou's <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</I>.
Parents forged an agreement with the district that allows them
to review books assigned to their children and help develop alternatives.
Other boards recently voted to institute a voluntary uniform and
a fee-based home-to-school transportation program. Teams of parents
issue critiques of schools on the basis of data culled from parent
surveys; these reviews are posted in every staff room in the district.<p>

These boards function the way PTAs are meant to, but without the
stifling hand of teacher-union influence. &quot;The reason for
the success of Clovis,&quot; says Superintendent Walter Buster,
&quot;is that these schools are truly governed by elected lay
people.&quot; <p>
Ultimately, it seems, success in CUSD is driven
by community expectations. &quot;There's a corporate culture that
has been established that requires more of people, expects of
people more, and gets of people more,&quot; says H.P. Spees, executive
director of Fresno-Madeira Youth for Christ and member of CUSD's
clergy advisory council. <p>
This culture of expectation is impressed
upon teachers even before they pick up a piece of chalk. A lengthy,
multi-tiered interview process incorporates parents, teachers,
community leaders, principals, and administrators and signals
to prospective teachers that the Clovis community demands much
of its teachers. According to Ginger Thomas, the principal of
Temprance-Kutner Elementary School, some teacher candidates quit
the interview process, saying &quot;you guys work too hard.&quot;
Assistant superintendent Jon Sharpe contends that Clovis sustains
&quot;a work ethic in the public sector that's almost unsurpassed.&quot;
He may be right: In 1992, CUSD teachers even voted down their
own pay raise to channel the money into books and supplies. <p>
In
an education system under assault for its academic failures, Clovis
has produced a winning formula. CUSD schools have won recognition
by the state of California 15 times and earned national blue ribbons
from the U.S. Department of Education 13 times. The prestigious
Phi Delta Kappa Center for Evaluation, Development, and Research
has featured Clovis in two works, <I>Clovis California Schools:
A Measure of Excellence</I> and <I>Total Quality Education</I>.
Even outspoken critics of public education recognize the district's
accomplishments. &quot;If we are going to limit ourselves to the
Prussian system of education, Clovis is the best we are going
to get in a tax-financed school,&quot; says Marshall Fritz, the
founder of the Fresno-based Separation of School and State Alliance
and the father of four Clovis students. <p>
Awards aside, the real
lesson of Clovis is that good education depends not on bloated
budgets but on creative and committed teachers and administrators
held accountable by engaged communities. Clovis's success also
suggests that quality in public education will not be the norm
until resources are channeled to classrooms rather than bureaucrats,
and parents wrest control over education from teachers unions.

Michigan had no public-school teacher strikes

Under legislation signed last March by Governor John Engler, school
teachers are now fined a day's pay for each day they strike and

Montana earned $13 million from timber harvests on state-owned

down 12 times as many trees, the U.S. Forest Service lost $42
million in its Montana properties. Don Leal of the Political Economy

less than one-third the staff to prepare timber sales. <p>

eligible, 97 have chosen them since their introduction last March.

Backgrounder No. 1063<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This is untrue.
<p><ul>
<li> The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.
<p>
<li> When past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is an astonishing 13 years.
<p>
<li> Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than three quarters will spend over five years on AFDC.
</ul><p>
The current liberal system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, "poverty" is harmful for children, and welfare, by allegedly reducing poverty, will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not assist children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastatingly negative effect on children's development. It is welfare dependence, rather than poverty, which has the most negative effect on children.
<P><ul>
<li> Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. 
<p>
<li> Welfare receipt as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower will be the boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income. 
<p>
<li> Receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
</ul><p>	
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult. 
<p>
The House and Senate will soon pass welfare reform legislation based on three key principles: 
<p>
1)  Reducing the growth of illegitimacy; 
<p>
2)  Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and 
<p>
3)  Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending. 
<p>
The public strongly supports the key provisions of the congressional reforms. According to recent polls:
<p><ul>
<li> By a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent, Americans support a "family cap."  Eighty-four percent "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."
<p>
<li> Three out of four Americans believe welfare encourages illegitimacy. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
<li> Still, nine out of ten Americans feel that welfare recipients should have "to work for their benefits."  However, they feel overwhelmingly that work requirements should be imposed on welfare mothers with older children before they are imposed on mothers with pre-school children.
</ul><p>


<b>THE PATTERN OF DEPENDENCE: LENGTH OF TIME ON WELFARE</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. According to this picture, AFDC generally provides temporary aid, and very few recipients receive welfare for extended periods. This picture is inaccurate. 
<p>
Of the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, most will be dependent on welfare for very long periods of time. As Chart 1 shows, families receiving AFDC at the present time have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years enrolled in AFDC.<sup>1</sup>  When past receipt and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC among those families currently receiving AFDC benefits is an astounding 13 years.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, these figures actually underestimate the length of welfare dependence, since such families are very likely to receive other welfare benefits (such as food stamps, SSI, Medicaid, and housing) even after they leave the AFDC caseload.
<p>
As Chart 2 shows, among those families currently receiving AFDC, 72 percent have already spent over two years on AFDC, and nearly half have already spent over five years on AFDC. 
<p>
Looking into the future and making projections based on the historical patterns of AFDC receipt, it is clear that among the 4.7 million families currently on AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. And more than three quarters of current AFDC families will spend over five years on the AFDC caseload.
<p>
Long-term welfare dependence is most common among women who have children out of wedlock. Never-married mothers, in general, remain on AFDC twice as long as divorced mothers.
<p>

<b>DOES WELFARE BENEFIT CHILDREN?</b>
<p>
The current debate over welfare reform involves conflicting visions of society and the impact of welfare on human behavior. Real reform will not be achieved until specific core assumptions which form the foundation of the modern welfare state have been overturned and discarded. From its onset, the liberal welfare state has been founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:
<p>
<b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.
<p>
<b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Therefore, welfare is good for kids.
<p>
From this logic has sprung a relentless thirty-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The current proposal from Congress to slow down the automatic growth of welfare spending violates these cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system and thus has led to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment.
<p>
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of an increasing number of young Americans.
<p>
It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually. The first is that raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children. The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that "poverty" causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.
<p>
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values which are key to the child's success.
<p>
The second flawed liberal premise is that it is very easy to raise family income through welfare. This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.
<p>
This is borne out by experimental evidence. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80.<sup>4</sup>  The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs:  Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment.
<p>
The third liberal tenet is that higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life. In certain limited cases, such as when welfare is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives. While higher welfare payments and spending do not benefit children directly, they do increase dependence and illegitimacy, both of which have devastating negative effects on child well-being. Thus, overall, welfare operates as a system of organized, well-funded child abuse. 
<p>
The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, recently published research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high benefit states.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>6</sup>  Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children.
<p>
Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
O'Neill and Hill conclude:
<p><bq>
	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states.<sup>8</sup>
</bq><p>
A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher <i>non-welfare income</i> obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25).<sup>9</sup>  However, <i>welfare income</i> had the opposite effect:  The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing, up the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.
<p>
A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.
<p>
Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women who are raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare.<sup>11</sup>  Similarly, single mothers who were raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers who were not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
Boys raised in single-parent households receiving public housing aid are more than five times more likely to engage in criminal activity than are boys who are not raised in such conditions. Young girls raised in single-parent homes in public housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out of wedlock themselves than are girls who are not raised in such conditions.<sup>13</sup>  In short, welfare usually operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult.
<p>
In attacking the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, the Clinton Administration has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Administration's report on welfare makes clear its belief that rapid automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
The Administration report is founded unequivocally on the failed hypothesis that combating "poverty" through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy which, in turn, have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed, not (as the Clinton Administration does) at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's plan.
<p>

<b>PUBLIC SUPPORTS CONGRESSIONAL WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
By overwhelming margins, the public supports the principal elements of the welfare reform passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Bethesda-based polling firm, for the Family Research Council in mid-October 1995.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
For example, by a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent Americans support the family cap. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock."
<p>
In contrast to proposals by President Clinton, the welfare reforms agreed to in the House/Senate conference will contain modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy. Three out of four of those polled agreed that the current welfare system makes it easier for women to choose to have children out of wedlock. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
However, the public still believes overwhelmingly that welfare recipients should be required to work. Ninety percent of those polled stated that "recipients of government welfare programs should have to work for their benefits."
<p>
Since it would be difficult to require all welfare recipients to work immediately, the reform bills passed in the House and Senate urge states to impose work requirements on the most employable recipients first. Specifically, the bills urge states to focus work requirements on fathers in two-parent families and single mothers without pre-school children before requiring work of single mothers with pre-school children. (Roughly half of AFDC families have no children under age five in the household.) The public agrees overwhelmingly with these work priorities. Eighty-eight percent of the public feels that work should be required of fathers and mothers of school-age children before it is required of mothers caring for pre-school children.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The welfare reform legislation which will be approved by the House/Senate conference proposes a reform of the current welfare system based on three central themes:
<p>
<b>Reducing the growth of illegitimacy;
<p>
Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
<p>
Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
Among the many elements of reform in the legislation, seven are crucial:
<p>
1) The bill will end the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC spending. Under the legislation, states which increase their welfare caseloads will no longer be rewarded by an automatic increase in federal funding. This change imposes a fundamental fiscal discipline at the state level which is essential to real reform.
<p>
2) The bill establishes a family cap. Under the bill, mothers already enrolled in AFDC will not receive an automatic increase in federal welfare benefits if they give birth to an additional child while on welfare. (However, states will be permitted to enact legislation to "opt out" of this requirement.)
<p>
3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states which reduce out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
<p>
4) The bill provides $75 million per year in funding for a new block grant for abstinence education.
<p>
5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill establishes serious work requirements for welfare recipients. Under the bill, up to 40 percent of the AFDC caseload will be required to work or become self-sufficient by the year 2002.
<p>
6) In contrast to all previous "work" requirements, in the AFDC program, the work requirements in the proposed legislation are real. Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a "pay after performance" rule. Recipients will not receive benefits until the required work has been performed satisfactorily. If the recipient fails to perform the required hours of work, benefits will be reduced pro-rata.
<p>
7) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of "workfare" is to reduce welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to maximize the number of welfare recipients in "make work" public service jobs. It recognizes that the best road to self-sufficiency is to reduce the number of persons who become dependent and get "hooked" on welfare in the first place. In contrast to President Clinton's plan, which rewards states for expanding "welfare addiction," the approach in Congress for the first time focuses on rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who get "hooked" on welfare in the first place.
<p>
Overall, the proposed legislation represents a significant and badly needed first step in overhauling a bloated and destructive welfare system. The proposed reforms will be of great benefit to society, the taxpayers, and, most important, welfare recipients themselves.

<B>LETTER TO OUR READERS</B><HR>



<h2>Welcome to <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2><br>

by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><p>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></b><br>

<i>January-February 1996, Number 75</i></center>

<p>

	<i>Policy Review</i>, the magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<p>	Our new name is <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will focus on the institutions of civil society -- families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments -- that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government.


<p>	We think of our mission as "Applied Tocqueville," in honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832 wrote <i>Democracy in America</i>, still the best book about our country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their communities. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders today who are carrying on this tradition.
<p>

	We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities. Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<p>	Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments, and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed liberal programs.
<p> 	The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable than government.
<p>	Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<p>	Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and behaviors.
<p>	The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. America is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the lead. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.
<p>
<center><b>An Invitation to Liberals</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p>
	We hope many liberals and centrists will join us in this adventure. Liberals who have learned from their mistakes of recent decades have a great deal of practical wisdom to offer conservatives who are trying to replace the welfare state. And conservatives will be most effective in the coming era of institution-building if we can harness the energy, idealism, imagination, and intelligence of liberals in our cause. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> hopes to be a bridge between conservatives and liberals who are trying to renew the American experiment in self-government.

<p>
	At the same time, we will make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of civil society. Unlike liberals, who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives follow Tocqueville in seeing religious fervor as one of the most powerful forces for strengthening and sustaining civil society. We expect that many of the great institutions that will emerge over the next generation will be founded by churches, synagogues, mosques, and ecumenical associations of people of faith. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will feature a department, "One Nation Under God," that will describe how religious institutions are repairing America's social fabric. 
<P>	We also see business as an essential ally of the citizenship movement. Liberals see nonprofit associations as morally superior to profitmaking businesses. Conservatives, by contrast, hold that the marketplace offers accountability and incentives for performance that are frequently missing from the nonprofit world. The most creative answers to social problems often come from businesses that can profit by solving them. A new column, "Blessings of Liberty," will show the contributions of economic freedom and marketplace competition to the regeneration of civil society.
<P>	Liberals who claim they want to promote civil society frequently use government regulation and judicial decisions to achieve the opposite. The Declaration of Independence accused King George III of a "long train of abuses and usurpations" that denied Americans their fundamental liberties. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will include a department, "Abuses and Usurpations," that will detail how federal and state executive branches, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions.  

<p>
	One of our most important departments, "Home Front," will provide news and information about organizations that are working to rebuild the family. While many liberals are belatedly recognizing the importance of strong families, liberal organizations such as the Children's Defense Fund still concentrate on securing government funds for single mothers and the social workers who serve them. Conservatives hold that children need loving families more than they need government money, and "Home Front" will profile the organizations that are doing the most to promote responsible parenthood.
<p>

	Many other conservative organizations have dedicated themselves to advancing civil society. The Capital Research Center, the Manhattan Institute and its magazine <i>City Journal</i>, the <a href="http://www.acton.org">Acton Institute</a>, the Philanthropy Roundtable, the Hudson Institute, the Reason Foundation, World magazine, the Institute for Contemporary Studies, the New Citizenship Project, <i>American Enterprise</i> magazine, the Civil Society Project, Focus on the Family, the <a href="/pff/">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> are just a few of the organizations doing outstanding work in this area. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will report on their work, publish articles by their researchers, announce their upcoming conferences. Our goal is to build the American Citizenship movement into one of the most significant political and cultural movements of the next generation.
<p>
<center><b>Freedom with Responsibility</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p> 
	Why have we chosen the phrase "American citizenship" for this movement? Because these words combine freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Freedom without responsibility cannot endure; responsibility without freedom cannot create. The great American experiment in self-government has survived for more than two centuries and created more opportunity for more people than any other political system because for most of our history we have emphasized both the rights and the responsibilities of citizenship.
<p>	As many observers now argue, this great experiment is at risk, and the restoration of American citizenship is now the most essential requirement for the renewal of American culture. Moreover, it is the most important unifying principle of conservatism in the post-Cold-War era. The principle appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, nongovernmental institutions. It appeals to religious conservatives with their emphasis on faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to  growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize generosity and economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, it appeals to nationalists who want to restore American patriotism and a strong sense of American cultural identity. And the restoration of American citizenship is an attractive principle for bringing liberals and centrists into the conservative fold.
<p>

	The restoration of American citizenship will also bring our divided country together. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: These have included the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our  own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of our neighbors' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
<p>

	Please join us in the historic mission of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. To the long-time readers of <i>Policy Review</i>, and especially to you who have been with us since our beginning 18 years ago, we say: Thank you for your support and encouragement, your letters, and your comments on our articles. You are our most important constituency. We believe you will thoroughly enjoy the newly designed magazine, and hope you will stay. Our new mission is based on what you have said you like most about the old <i>Policy Review</i>. We are determined to live up to your standards. 


<p>	To our new readers, we say: Welcome aboard. We need your ideas, we need your enthusiasm, and we need your moral energy. Join us in the American citizenship movement, as we offer the analysis and stories that will help revive the spirit of American citizenship and work to ensure that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth.

<ul>
<li>Note:  This photo is of an auxiliary building, not the main one.
<li>This department was created in 1966 to oversee the growth in urban mass transit programs, air traffic, and construction of the Interstate Highway System.
<li>Because each member of Congress tries to assure that his or her state or district recieve as much pork as possible, this department regularly funds expensive, low-priority projects over more sensible, appropriate ones.
<li>Congress earmaked 129 surface projects, at an annual cost of $250 million in FY 1995. During the same year, $1.5 billion was appropriated for airport grants-in-aid, including nearly $5 million for the Jimmy Stewart Airport in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.
<li>19% (18,000 workers) of its civilian staff was furloughed in the first government shutdown.
</ul>

<A HREF="9.jpg"><IMG SRC="9.gif" ALT="PHOTO" align="left"></A><b>YOUR GUESS?</b><input name="9" type="text" rows="1" size="36"><br>
<ul>
<li>Made infamous in the 1980's for purchasing $12 "portable language inscribers" (a.k.a. "pencils"), $45 hammers, and $130 toilet seats, this bureaucracy has shaped up considerably in recent years.
<li>The Clinton Administration underfunded even its own Bottom-Up Review of this Department by $100 million in 1995, and neglected to budget for unexpected emergency actions, like the one to Haiti.
<li>258,000 civilian employees (31% of its overall staff), labelled non-essential, didn't show have to commute to this 5-sided building during the first shutdown.
</ul>

<li>Sent home 34,600 workers (58% of civilian staff) during the first shutdown.
<li>Approval of the budget as passed will eliminate one of this department's highest-profile positions, the Surgeon General's Office.
<li>Is part of the largest spending bill Congress produces annually.
<li>Operates the NIH.

<ul>
<li>Its operating costs have ballooned by over 800 percent in the last thirty years, but did cut its 1996 budget to $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion in 1995.
<li>It recently came under the same environmental and workplace regulations that had long been imposed on all other organizations nationwide.
<li>Its 1995 appropriations bill eliminated 2,350 positions, 8.6% of its workforce.
<li>Since November 1994, it has been "Under New Management."

<li>90% of its civilian staff was labelled non-essential during the shutdown in early November.
<li>This department is part of our maze of overlapping departments, bureaus, and agencies designed to win the Cold War.
<li>It oversees US foreign aid programs.

<ul>
<li>Note:  Looking for name of the building.
<li>Once contained the entire staff of its highest ranking official, but that staff now occupies two entire builings, each larger than this original structure.
<li>89% (357 employees) of its core staff and 82% (1,000) members of its agencies were deemed "non-essential" by the OMB.
<li>Will hopefully be frequented by an army of moving trucks come December, 1996.

<center><h4>Statement to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</h4> 
<h2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> 
<P><i>December 12, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
Toward the close of my tenure as secretary of education, in a
speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America,
I called for a &quot;transformation of government policy to match,
and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;  I
was referring to the public's recognition that drug use was no
longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but a
personal, medical and economic catastrophe.  That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to '92 -- with
real results.  Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war.  But public sentiment, as this Gallup poll attests,
has not changed.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug
control policy with the federal government rightfully leading
the fight.
<P>
It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine in ten Americans
seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs
rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  Americans
should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use among adolescents
is once again on the rise after the steady and dramatic decline
of the 1980's and early 1990's.  According to the Center on Addiction
and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, &quot;the jump in
marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals that 820,000
more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of
that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and
addicts.&quot;  More bad news is that drug-related hospital emergency-room
cases -- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached
the highest levels since 1978.  Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.  
<P>
What Americans have witnessed -- and reacted to in the Gallup
Poll -- is the result of a failure of public policy brought about
by a moral torpor on the drug issue.  Policy follows attitude.
 But the public's attitude is not one of indifference toward the
scourge.  When asked what they wanted to see <I>a lot more</I>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <I>two-thirds</I>
cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United
States.  By contrast, <I>fewer than half</I> -- 43 percent --
asked for more treatment programs.
<P>
The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot; presents
a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support it received
in the Gallup poll.  Unlike the effective and modest treatment
programs sponsored by churches and using variants of the 12-step
method, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful
and ineffective.  From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment spending
almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment slots actually
declined.  And the discouraging result is that overall cocaine
treatment is not significantly reducing the polulation of hard
core addicts.  We must turn our support toward the proven models
of treatment, while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine
and crack addiction as yet one more compelling reason why preventing
casual drug use by the young -- the first step on the path to
addiction -- is so important.
<P>
Gallup poll respondents put drug interdiction high on their list
-- the percentage of those calling for increased efforts to reduce
the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was 88 percent.  Those
respondents are right  -- the government should put the U.S. military
in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our
borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction
process.  We know that strong interdiction works.  In 1989, the
U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down on the cocaine
cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking and interdiction
effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries
north.  These events produced substantial disruption in the cocaine
supply to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991.  Drugs were less available
on the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined;
reported cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy
users fell; and casual use dropped dramatically.  Today, U.S.foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once-strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated.   We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine-source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.  
<P>
More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict people for
the use and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America.  The response is wise on both counts.
 Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels.  The federal role requires the identification and dismantling
of all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating
in the U.S.   Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention
education are state and local responsibilities for which current
federal aid should be block granted without mandates.  
<P>
The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose legalization
of drugs send a strong message to those who would propose such
an option.  Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and
threatening to society because they are illegal.  They are illegal
because they are dangerous and  threatening to American society.
 Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.  On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization
-- and the overwhelming body of the American people who  reject
such a policy of despair. In the Gallup poll, the people have
again made that point.
<P>
Success in the drug war depends above all on what happens in America's
homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations, television
and movie screens, city streets and civic halls.  It depends on
the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy,  police chiefs, judges
and community leaders.  When I was President Bush's &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities.  I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better.  I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements.  The point is, we know what works.
 The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<p>
<center><h3>How Capitalism is Capitalized</h3> 
Letter to the Editor of the <i>Washington Post</i><P>
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>December 2, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
Dear Editor:
<P>
John Berry's November 9 Trendlines article, &quot;Treasury Argues
That the Tax Bite on Capital Isn't So Bad,&quot; reveals the ignorance
of our Treasury Department with regard to the workings of capitalism.
 The core of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' argument
is that declining inflation since the early 1980s has reduced
the tax burden on corporate profits.  But corporate profits taxes
are taxes on income, not capital.  Income can only be derived
from businesses that have already raised capital.  Companies reporting
substantial profits, such as those listed on Fortune 500, are
often established firms in mature markets.  Many are &quot;cash
cows&quot; that transfer wealth from capital to income because
they have exhausted their opportunities for successful risk taking.
 The fact that such firms are shouldering a lighter tax burden
with the decline of inflation tells us nothing about the &quot;tax
bite&quot; on capital.
<P>
The fact is, at a nominal rate of 28%, the capital gains tax has
stood at an historic high in the U.S. since 1987.  That's because
without inflation-indexing, the real rate can easily exceed 100%
on long-held assets that have merely earned a market-based rate
of return.  This high unindexed capital gains tax shuts off capital
to all but the least risky ventures, discouraging entrepreneurship
and thus producing sub-optimal economic growth.  That may be fine
for the large, established, risk-averse corporations throwing
off the cash that Larry Summers is proud to say is suffering lighter
tax burdens in a low-inflation environment.  But it offers scant
hope to our inner-cities and other capital-starved communities
that would have the most to gain from a rebirth of the entrepreneurial
spirit.  That's why I strongly urge congressional leaders and
the White House to include in their budgetary agreement a measure
to lower and index capital gains tax rates.

<center><h3>Immigration:  Where We Go From Here</h3> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 27, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 American immigrants generate jobs, products, processes, small
businesses, and government revenues at a pace that far exceeds
any strain on U.S. resources.  This is not just my conclusion;
  former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead, U.S. News Editor
Mortimer Zuckerman, IBM Vice President Ed Zschau, Texas Instruments
CEO Jerry Junkins, and a dozen other investment, manufacturing,
and communications leaders expressed the same conclusion in a
recent joint statement.
<P>
Some immigration policies badly need reform, especially those
having to do with illegal immigration.  Under the 1986 immigration
reform act, for example, it's illegal to hire an undocumented
alien, and hard and costly even to hire a legal one.  By contrast,
it's allowed, and in many cases legally mandated, to pay out welfare,
medical, education and other benefits.
<P>
It would be better, and more American, to make it easy to work--for
example, with a generous guest worker program and low-cost i.d.
for participants.  It would be just and would create better incentives,
and make it harder to get welfare payments.  For instance, the
U.S. could more readily accept immigrants who take a pledge not
to go on welfare (a pledge many have already taken).
<P>
With such policies, we not only can &quot;afford&quot; to keep
the golden door open;  we will attract the same type of dynamic
men and women who historically helped build this immigrant nation.
 Let's agree to reform the welfare state and not allow America
to be turned into a police state.

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i>

</center><p>



	Citizenship has always been an important question in America, and sometimes it is urgent. This is such a time. In the nature of our society, we leave much to private action. We do this as a matter of principle, in the interest of the liberty that is our entitlement. In America, it is our nature and our law to recognize this natural liberty. That is why private action is unusually important here. But today, private action is not doing its job.

<p>
	We know the facts. A third of all children are born out of wedlock. Half of marriages break up. Thievery and pillage, rape and murder flourish at horrific levels. Our graduates know neither basic facts nor main ideas. Most Americans are economically dependent on the government in some way. Our world is richer and more sophisticated, yet there is a decline of civility, of responsibility, and of knowledge about the highest things, giving our society a low, even primitive cast. Americans have the feeling that something more than their greatness may be going. They feel the loss of goodness, and the emptiness of that feeling cannot be borne.
<p>

	The liberals have a plan to repair this loss. It is the centralized, bureaucratic, administrative state. Its language is familiar: It calls us to "attack our problems on a national scale," "with the full resources of our country," "with the best minds in the nation," all "coordinated from the top." It reminds us that "Washington has a responsibility" -- for example, to keep children nourished. Liberalism finds its energy in utopian promise. Woodrow Wilson would "marry our interests to the state," as if we could be, in the literal sense, one grand family. Franklin Roosevelt would eliminate want, not just from the United States, but from the world. And he would eliminate fear while he was at it. Lyndon Johnson would guarantee equality of result. Hillary Clinton would "change what it means to be a human being in the 21st century."

<p>
	Modern liberalism is progressive, visionary, and ever expanding, and has a conception of citizenship appropriate to its principles. The citizen under modern liberalism responds to policy. He knows that the progress to which society is destined requires progress by him, in his own person. He must be ready, when fashion shifts, to alter his pronouns, his diet, and his relations with his children. He must stay abreast of the shifting value placed on family, or patriotism, or history. He must, in short, be pliable, ready to be shaped and molded.
<p>	Liberals understand the importance of making their vision of citizenship compatible with, even necessary to, the old concept of citizenship that it replaces. When Bill Clinton was inaugurated, for example, he suddenly became "William Jefferson" Clinton. To emphasize the point that he is named after Thomas Jefferson, he spent the eve of his inauguration at Monticello, and traveled the same route that Jefferson did to arrive at the ceremony. He announced his tax increase on Lincoln's and Washington's official birthday, and spoke about their greatness and attention to duty. 
<p>	President Clinton thus continues a tradition of successful modern liberalism begun by Woodrow Wilson and perfected by Franklin Roosevelt. Modern liberals know better than to reject openly the ideas of the Declaration of Independence. But they talk plenty about "completing them," which means changing them completely. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, invented a new demon -- "the economic royalists" --- to replace King George III. He claimed to be defending liberty, in the same way the Founders had defended it against the King.
<p>	But in fighting the economic royalists, Roosevelt attacked also the right to property, a fundamental right that the Founders took pains to establish. Because of this cleverness, the liberals are good at seeming public spirited and devoted to the old ideas. People have long trusted them to serve the community, to care about citizenship and neighborliness.
<p>	We conservatives are united in our opposition to the liberal idea of citizenship. We have seen that there is no liberty under this program. It extinguishes liberty by extinguishing the creature capable of liberty. By the force of government, it replaces him with some new being. It takes a lot of government to "change what it means to be a human being." Several million administrators, deploying a quarter of the largest economy on earth, do not seem to have finished the job in a full generation of trying.
<p>	If we conservatives do not like the liberal idea of citizenship, what do we like? There, more work is needed.
<p>	Recall the standard list of the things wrong with our society, such as divorce and illegitimacy and crime. I would add one generally forgotten: a loss not only of habit, but of knowledge, a loss not only of the exercise of good citizenship, but of the ideas that underlie it. In short, we are ignorant of the basis of our government and the way that it should operate.
<p>	Working adults know that the government is too big and wastes their money and tells them lies on a regular basis. But very few people know or understand even the basic issues of contemporary politics. They do not know, for example, that the cuts proposed by the current Congress amount only to a small fraction of federal spending. They do not know that each of the Clinton budgets called for large increases in domestic spending. They do not know that the welfare system pays its typical clients more than $22,000 per year in southern California, nor that this is more than double the minimum wage.
<p>	This ignorance is neither surprising nor worrisome, except that it betokens a larger ignorance of the high purpose of and the strict limits on government in America. Because of this, we tend to work out our policies practically. We will devolve welfare to the states because "the federal system has proved that it does not work." We hardly mention that the only real entitlement is to the money we earn for ourselves, and that we have no right to anything earned by another. In this respect, we compare poorly to the generation of Americans who would not pay a tax on tea because they were not represented in the legislature that imposed it. These earlier Americans could tell you, right down to the law of nature and human equality, why that tax was wrong, and why another one might be right. They were schooled in the business of being citizens. That schooling made it possible for them to win their liberty.
<p>	Our statesmen -- even those on the Right -- do not do a sufficient job recovering this lost knowledge. None of our statesmen called the Clinton health-care plan unconstitutional. Few oppose entitlements root and branch. What are we to do?
<p>	The recent debate on Proposition 187, California's illegal-immigration initiative, suffered from this failure. Good people supported the initiative, and good people opposed it. The good people who supported the initiative, with a couple of important exceptions, did not make a case about the meaning of citizenship. They talked about denying these so-called benefits of citizenship to some who did not deserve them, without saying what most of them believe: Citizens do not deserve them, either. The good people who opposed the initiative talked a lot about equal treatment, and they said little or nothing about the beliefs and practices that constitute citizenship in America. We were left with a debate about a side issue, and the main point was lost in the whirlwind.
<p>	If statesmen cannot do the work, then we citizens -- in private life -- must do it. I would salute, for example, the conservative writings that support the regeneration of fatherhood, and the sanctity of the family, and the necessity for religion to become powerful once again in our public as well as in our private lives. It is vital to add, however, that our problems are deeply political, and their solution will require hard political action, based upon deep political reasoning and unyielding political conviction.
<p>	Although the Bureau of This or the Agency for That may not be the answer to the evils we face, we are still a profoundly political nation, and our public life is infused with political ideas. Take, for example, the recent celebration of "voluntary and local associations" as we find in the writings of Marvin Olasky or Russell Kirk or Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have turned back to Tocqueville, and we know now that American life until lately teemed with these associations and was elevated and ennobled by them. Of course we are right, in one sense, to think that these local institutions are not at all political. They have no formal constitutional place, they function apart from political action, and they exist in one form or another wherever societies are found.
<p>	Still, in America these local, prepolitical institutions had a special vitality. That vitality was nourished by the political institutions of the country. Now that those institutions have changed, the local institutions of America have diminished in strength. Major social-service charities are worried that, under block grants, they will not get as much money from the states as they have been receiving from the federal government. These same charities do not, as a rule, provide actual direct help to the poor. Rather they assist the federal government in providing those services. Here, then, are "local and voluntary institutions" that are not really local and not really voluntary. Their character has been altered by a change in national politics.
<p>	When local institutions thrived in America, they did so under the influence of a great principle at the heart of the nation's politics. According to this principle, we are equal in our rights, and not to be governed except by our consent. Our citizenship itself operates under this principle of equality, a principle announced in the first organic law of the United States. It is a principle not of local but of national scope, a principle authoritative not because it was adopted by a town or even by a country, but known to every man who is rational. In America, local and voluntary institutions operate beneath the shelter of high national principles.
<p>	Conservatives rightly think that religion should play a larger part on the public stage, for religion has been a vital component of American citizenship from the beginning. Tocqueville observed that "there is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America." Liberty is vital to religion, he wrote, and religion in turn is vital to liberty:
<p><blockquote>	"Liberty regards religion as its companion in all its battles and its triumphs, as the cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims. It considers religion as the safeguard of morality, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of the duration of freedom."
</blockquote><p>

	But it is important to learn from the Founders about how to speak of religion. The Founders were absolutely at ease with a civic acknowledgment of the Deity and its implication for citizenship. But they spoke in the language of reason as well as of revelation. The preachers of the Revolution spoke often and strongly about morality, both in public places and in their churches. In so doing, they addressed their countrymen not as parishioners simply, but also as fellow citizens. Take for example the words of Samuel West, a preacher and a member of the convention that wrote the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780:<p><blockquote>
	"The most perfect freedom consists in obeying the dictates of right reason, and submitting to natural law. When a man goes beyond or contrary to the law of nature and reason, he becomes the slave of base passions and vile lusts; he introduces confusion and disorder into society, and brings misery and destruction upon himself. This, therefore, cannot be called a state of freedom, but a state of the vilest slavery and the most dreadful bondage. The servants of sin and corruption are subjected to the worst kind of tyranny in the universe. Hence we conclude that where licentiousness begins, liberty ends."
</blockquote>	

<p>If we wish to emulate our Founders in our efforts to restore religion to the public square, we must do it in this way. This way is stronger than the appeal many religious conservatives put in its place today. It is stronger because it makes its claims upon an argument and evidence that applies to all, and not only those who are blessed with faith in the person of their Maker. While it supports that faith, and lays the ground for it, this way begins with reason, the faculty that perceives the natural law -- the basis of citizenship in our Founding.
<p>	The Founders were also conscious of the limitations citizenship places on religion. Consider the words of George Washington in a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island:<p><blockquote>
	"It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support."</blockquote><p>
	Religious liberty, Washington argued, is central to the American conception of citizenship. American citizenship is open to people of any faith or creed. Liberty -- the freedom to use one's property, to pray to one's God, to speak one's mind -- sets a limit upon politics that is inviolable.
<p>	At the same time, the basis of liberty sets a limit upon something more than politics. It sets a limit also upon what properly may be called religion. Religion is free in America from all oppression, and yet those who practice it must live under a political guideline. They must "demean themselves as good citizens." Nor is this standard simply a negative or passive requirement. Citizens must give their country "on all occasions their effectual support."
<p>	Citizenship, then, provides a standard against which religion itself must be measured. True enough, citizens may be exempted from military service if their religion requires it, yet the rules of justice that underlie citizenship can be enforced even in the face of a claim of religious protection. If, for example, the Davidians at Waco had been abusing their children, even if they were doing so in the name of God, then the use of force to extract those children would have been justified.
<p>	One "cannot say that people have a right to do wrong," said Abraham Lincoln, that great student of the Declaration and the Founders. If we know what is right, then we may with justice require right from others under the law. We may with justice expect a man who pledges his faith to a woman to keep that faith, a man who fathers a child to provide for that child, a man who is a citizen to fight for his country. The country is on the side of the citizen who does his duty. It belongs to that citizen; he and his fellows are sovereign in it. In return for their liberty, which the government does not give them but helps them to protect, they have obligations that they are bound to discharge.
<p>	I have described the attentive and pliable citizen who is the hallmark and aim of the modern, liberal regime. Another kind of citizen is implied in the heritage that comes to us from our forefathers. This is a citizenship that responds to the bidding of the natural law and human equality. Americans take up more space, speak more directly, and stand their ground more assertively than people in most other places. An American is more likely to start a business, to give to charity, and to care for his community.
<p>	 Such a citizen has been shaped by hammer blows and the sting of the sword. These were the blows of the American Revolution and the wars that have come since. They were fought in the name of a faith and a creed that applies to all and is at the same time special to us. Winston Churchill, the son of an American mother, regarded the American people as the new great people of the earth, standing beside the Greeks and the Romans and the British among the leaders of mankind. When he cited the great documents that have secured the liberties of the English-speaking peoples, he did it on the Fourth of July. He named the Declaration of Independence as the greatest of them all, knowing full well that it covered all men, whatever tongue they spoke.
<p>	If private action is to do its job again in our country, it must not be seen as a private realm alone. Uniquely in our country, the rules that guide a private citizen, as he cares for his family, and works at his job, and serves his community, are the same rules that inspire the form and purpose of government. For that reason, the restoration of the private realm to its full vitality and decency requires the recovery of the ideas that form the basis for our politics. We must once again hold certain truths to be self-evident. We must meet the challenge that those truths lay before us.

<a name="powell"></a><li> Colin Powell's Nov. 8 decision not to run-for president closes
one chapter of the 1996 presidential sweepstakes, but opens many
others. Although the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
ruled it out, there is still a possibility that he may be asked
to join the Republican ticket in the vice presidential slot. And
his name is already being touted as a presidential candidate in
the year 2000
<P>
Let's analyze some of the reaction to the potential Powell campaign,
before <I>and</I> after Nov. 8.
<P>
<B>Before.</B>  Several, days before Powell's announcement, leaders
of 10 conservative groups held a press conference warning the
retired general not to run and vowing to oppose him if he did
&quot;Any candidacy by Colin Powell must be stopped. He will be
stopped,&quot; said Morton Blackwell, the Republican National
Committeman from Virginia.
<P>
Blackwell also went as far to suggest that some conservatives
were promoting Powell only because he is black &quot;If General
Powell were a white general holding these views, they would not
consider for a moment supporting him for our party's nomination,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Others attending the press conference and supporting this view
included Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation and National
Empowerment Television, David Keane of the Conservative Political
Action Comrnittee, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform,
and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<P>
This move by some party conservatives was the most hypocritical
and preposterous in recent memory. First, for people who like
to tout their pro-America credentials, it is exceptionally un-American
and undemocratic to suggest that any American is barred from seeking
public office. If he or she is unacceptable, it's up to the voters
to decide, not for a self-appointed band of litmus testers to
try to scare people out of running.
<P>
Several black conservatives were asked to participate in this
charade, including the publisher and editor of <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. 
<P>
But the response and receptiveness (or lack thereof) to Powell's
potential candidacy helped smoke out some of the elements in the
Republican Party who are most strident and resistant to expanding
the party's base. This was one positive outcome of otherwise deplorable
behavior on the part of some patty activists.
<P>
Time magazine reports that House Speaker Newt Gingrich met privately
with Powell Nov. 2 and encouraged him to run, saying &quot;a campaign
would succeed-but only if Powell wanted it very badly.&quot; Without
endorsing Powell Gingrich encouraged him and told him they could
work as a team Powell also had conversations with former Presidents
Ford, Bush and Carter prior to making his final decision. The
broad range of support Powell received, from former Presidents
to lay persons, demonstrates his appeal across party and ideological
lines.
<P>
<B>After.</B>  One newspaper, the <I>Concord (N.H.) Monitor</I>,
said of the Powell decision: &quot;Powell made the right decision
for the right reason. . . If we were President Clinton, we would
seize the chance and call on him to lead a bipartisan, broadly
representative commission on race relations.&quot;
<P>
It is an indication of how far we have to go concerning stereotypes
and pigeon-holing of our nation's black citizens that a major
American newspaper would even suggest reducing a four-star general
to the status of race merchant.
<P>
In response to Powell's announcement that he was joining the Republican
Party, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the general took a &quot;step
backward&quot; by aligning with the GOP. Noting GOP plans to cut
popular federal programs for the poor, Jackson said Powell will
have to do &quot;some very heavy lifting to meet his goal of making
the party more attractive to black voters.&quot;
<P>
Jackson's reaction reveals two important things about his approach
to politics. One, his view that it is a a step backward&quot;
for a man of Powell's stature to work toward two-party participation
by black Americans demonstrates the Reverend's idea of &quot;progress&quot;
is for all blacks to walk in lock step behind Democratic leaders.
<P>
Two, his view that Powell will have to change the GOP by himself
places an unreasonable expectation on the retired general's shoulders.
After all, Jackson has been in the Democratic Party for years
and they Still refuse to accept him as their standard bearer.
Perhaps he should do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of his own
in the Democratic Party.
<P>
Powell's son Michael, in an interview with Time magazine following
Powell's Nov. 8 press conference, said the retired general might
be persuaded to accept a spot on the GOP ticket if asked by the
nominee. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he was in government
again as a secretary of something or even vice president,&quot;
said the younger Powell.
<P>
And some of Powell's supporters have not yet thrown in the towel.
Some Powell partisans are organizing a massive write-in campaign
and pinning their hopes on a win in New Hampshire to coax Powell
to join the Republican field.
<P>
California Citizens for Powell Chair Emmett Cash III said, &quot;If
the people of New Hampshire write him in great numbers, he will
be the next President of the United States. New Hampshire is the
key to this election for Colin Powell.&quot; But it might be best
to respect Powell's wishes--for now. He doesn't want to be a candidate
this year. After 35 years of service to his country, he deserves
a break.
<P>
<a name="collins"></a><li> In a surprise announcement, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Il.), the
longest serving black woman in Congress and a Chicago political
power, said she will retire. Since being elected to succeed her
late husband in 1973, Collins has handily won election after election.
Collins, in a Washington, D.C. press conference, said, &quot;The
main factor in stepping down is I'D be 65 years old next year.
I believe you know in your life when its time to make a change.&quot;
<P>
Collins said she considered retiring in 1994. The 7th Congressional
District which she represents contains the Loop and most of the
North Michigan corridor and the Near North Side, with the infamous
Cabrini-Green housing project. It also goes south, past the Century
Prairie Avenue mansions to the Taylor homes and takes in a few
heavily black South Side neighborhoods.
<P>
Collins played a pivotal role in remapping Illinois' congressional
districts after the 1990 census, demanding that her district retain
the Loop. &quot;It has been frustrating moving from the majority
to the minority, but that's not the reason I'm leaving,&quot;
said Collins. &quot;I've enjoyed fighting the Republicans, quite
frankly.&quot;
<P>
Her retirement set off a stampede of would-be successors.
<P>
<a name="jj"></a><li> Two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Nov. 9 he's
thinking anew about running in 1996 now that retired Gen. Colin
Powell has ruled out a potential White House bid.
<P>
The Associated Press reported that less than 24 hours after Powell
announced he would not run, Jackson said at a news conference
that he has met with his advisers over the past few days to ''assess
the landscape.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I still have the fire in my belly and clear vision in my
head about what a president ought to do to make the nation better,&quot;
said the founder of the National Rainbow Coalition and presidential
candidate of 1984 and 1988.
<P>
Jackson said it was premature to say when he would reach a decision.
<P>
But while criticizing what he said was Clinton's inattention to
urban issues, Jackson suggested he would stay on the political
sidelines if the president begins to pay more attention to cities
and racial inequities.
<P>
&quot;I feel that Clinton, if he focuses on the covenant, honors
it and addresses those people who elected him, he could be elected
again. But if he abandons that base then that base has no allegiance
to him,&quot; he said.
<P>
Jackson said it would be difficult for him to run in the Democratic
primaries and that an independent candidacy would be the only
way to &quot;open the process up.&quot;
<P>
<a name="cv"></a><li> President Clinton emerged the clear winner in CityVote, the
presidential preference balloting that lumped together declared
and potential candidates, independents and party members on Election
Day.
<P>
210,000 votes were cast in 13 cities, including Tucson, Ariz.
and Fayette, Mo. In the Nov. 7 non-binding urban primary, Clinton
drew 43.7 percent. Colin Powell came in second with 18.2 percent
and Sen. Bob Dole finished third with 11.9 percent.
<P>
The rest received votes in this order: Steve Forbes, Ross Perot,
Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Jesse Jackson. Republican presidential
hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Sen. Arlen Specter and Sen. Dick Lugar
rarely, if at all, exceeded 1 percent.
<P>
Twenty-one names in all appeared on the ballot. Legal challenges
prevented several bigger cities, including Boston, Baltimore and
Newark, from participating. CityVote also was plagued by pressures
from the
<P>
Democratic National Committee, which sought to have Clinton's
name struck from the ballot.
<P>
<a name="banks"></a><li> Banks may have lost a defense against redlining charges.
<P>
Two economists with the Federal National Mortgage Association
said earlier studies erred in supporting a reason often given
for lender avoidance of low-income neighborhoods, according to
a report in American Banker.
<P>
The idea that home values in such neighborhoods tend to fall is
mistaken, the researchers found. In fact, they said, home values
in poorer areas have actually gone up, while those in affluent
areas have slipped.
<P>
Their study indicates that bankers, in avoiding low-income neighborhoods,
lack an economic justification they could cite before to counter
fair-lending charges. Now they must focus on the credit histories
and incomes of particular applicants--rather than the area in
which they live. That is much harder to do.
<P>
The economists, Eric Rosenblat and Ying Li, in a paper presented
Oct. 24 to the Society of Government Economists, said the flaw
in earlier studies was a reliance on demographic information that
wound up having no correlation to housing values.
<P>
The earlier studies looked at the number of welfare recipients
and the number of vacant homes in an area to explain why bankers
did not lend in certain communities.
<P>
Many economists have questioned the validity of those studies,
arguing that bankers consider only the borrower and the house
when making loans. Community characteristics such as the number
of welfare recipients don't matter, they said.
<P>
The Fannie Mae study is the first research project to formally
rebut the prior findings.
<P>
The researchers based their conclusion on data collected by Fannie
Mae and the Federal Home Mortgage Corp. that covered housing purchases
in California--including Los Angeles, Anaheim and Oakland. They
limited their review to homes that changed hands at least twice
between 1986 and 1994.</ul>

<title>Missing: $13.5 Billion -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Missing: $13.5 Billion</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) wins my annual award for the most outrageous example of government bungling. If this isn't an example of why government should be entrusted with as little responsibility as possible, I don't know what is.
<p>
	A recently completed Inspector General's (IG) audit found that the department's Food and Consumer Services (FCS) division -- which is responsible for the school lunch and food stamp programs -- could not document what it did with $13.5 billion of the $36.7 billion it spent in 1994. That's right: 34 percent of what it spent was unaccounted for! Talk about waste, fraud and abuse!
<p>
	The auditors reported that at one point, when figures from the Treasury Department -- which writes the government's checks -- didn't match its own, FCS just "fudged" the numbers and forced a match. According to the IG, the employees made no effort to figure out why the discrepancies existed or what was done with the unaccounted-for money. In the private sector, this is called "fraud." 
<p>
	Even big-government liberals like Vice President Al Gore now agree that government is rife with waste and foolishness. For a good laugh -- rather, a good cry -- just read Gore's <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/npr/nptoc.html">"National Performance Review."</a> As I noted, the Agriculture Department is responsible for running two very costly and politically charged programs: school lunches and food stamps. These programs affect millions of American families and suck up billions of your tax dollars every year. And the bureaucrats responsible for running the programs don't even know where your money went!

<p>	Of course, the USDA bureaucrats have an excuse. They complain about a recent switch to a new automated bookkeeping system. In other words, everything was humming along just fine until somebody tried to make things work more efficiently.
<p>	Come on. Either Agriculture Department managers are incompetent and need to be replaced or the welfare state has grown so large that nobody can keep track of where our money is going.
<p>	
The so-called "War on Poverty" -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized school lunches, etc. -- has cost American taxpayers $5.4 trillion over the past 30 years. There really aren't enough "good intentions" in the world to justify spending that much money with basically no result. The percentage of Americans living in poverty is still around the same level it was in 1965, when the spending spree began. When something doesn't work, it should be fixed. Or gotten rid of.
<p>	Of course, conservatives like me are demonized when we suggest that the welfare state  undermines personal responsibility. Now, along comes this audit to suggest that welfare also affects the responsibility of the people running the system.
<p>
	Think about it. Wouldn't you get a little jaded about accountability after years of passing out billions of dollars for a system that doesn't work -- and the more it is seen as a failure, the more money you are given to pass out?
<p>
	It is probably a pretty safe bet that this particular agency is not unusual, that similar outrages would be found if the rest of the welfare system were audited.
<P>
	In fact, the auditors in this case had to give up before finishing because the bookkeeping was so sloppy. "We discontinued our review because we did not believe that we could complete our sample in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost," they said.
<P>
	At least someone was thinking of who was picking up the tab.

This week, President Clinton is sending thousands of U.S. Troops to Bosnia to make peace and not everyone agrees on the goals, reasons, or if we should even be in Bosnia.  This week, Town Hall has assembled several pieces of information from around the net and here at Town Hall.  Check back every day for new additions and later in the week, give us your opinion of the Bosnia mission.

 There are four key issues pending with telecommunications conferees:
<ol>
<li><a href="#net">Internet Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#puhca">PUHCA</a>
<li><a href="#reg">Price Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#comp">Long Distance Competition</a></ol>
<P>

<P><a name="net"></a>
<center><B>INTERNET REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Earlier this year, the House voted 420 to 4 in support of the
&quot;Cox-Wyden-White&quot; approach to Internet regulation and
&quot;cyberporn.&quot; This approach established no new criminal
penalties for pornography on the Net; provided immunity for on-line
service providers who enable users to block or screen access to
objectionable material; and, prohibited the FCC from regulating
the Net.  The Senate approved the more intrusive &quot;Exon&quot;
approach, which Speaker Gingrich opposed.
<P>
<i>This morning, House conferees met to decide what approach to
Internet regulation they would advance in Conference</i>.  They
adopted the White approach, which maintains most Cox-Wyden provisions
but also includes new criminal penalties for transmission of pornographic
material on the Net.  In adopting the White approach, however,
they changed the standard for application of these penalties from
the limited Constitutional standard of &quot;material harmful
to minors&quot; to &quot;indecency&quot; -- a killer amendment
in the eyes of the broad Internet, on-line provider and freedom
coalition (e.g., Americans for Tax Reform; Citizens for a Sound
Economy, Heritage Foundation).  The vote among House members was
17-16, with Republicans Goodlatte, Gallegly, Hoke, Moorhead, Frisa,
Barton, Hyde, Schaefer, Buyer, Flanigan, Barr, Paxon and Stearns
voting for the &quot;indecency&quot; approach.  The Christian
Coalition was strongly supportive of this change, with the freedom
coalition strongly opposed.  Democrats who supported the &quot;indecency&quot;
standard included Conyers, Schroeder, Gordon and Jackson-Lee.
<P>
<i>If this provision cannot be changed back to the original White
approach, many of those who supported the White approach will
work to kill the bill</i>.
<P><a name="puhca"></a>
<center><B>PUHCA</B>
<P></center>
The Senate telecommunications bill would allow the 14 registered
utility holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to enter telecommunications and related businesses
on the same basis as other companies (utility and non-utility).
 <i>Earlier this year, Speaker Gingrich called for such flexibility</i>
(see attached news release).  
<P>
The House bill has no provision comparable to the Senate language.
 In staff conference negotiations so far, the House has refused
to accept the Senate PUHCA language based on the assertion, advanced
most often by Congressmen Dingell and Markey, that it has insufficient
consumer protections for captive utility ratepayers.  (In reality,
the Senate bill contains extensive consumer protections aimed
at ensuring that captive ratepayers do not subsidize telecommunications
activities.)
<P>
<i>Senate staff have now offered additional consumer protections
in an attempt to break the impasse; no response has yet come from
the House</i>.
<P><a name="reg"></a>
<center><B>PRICE REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Staff of House and Senate conferees have agreed to strike language
contained in both versions of the legislation requiring the FCC
and state public service commissions to replace old-style, cost-plus
rate-of-return regulation with price regulation.  This requirement
was included on the grounds that price regulation would not only
streamline Federal and state telecommunications regulation, but
would also reduce any financial incentives that the local telephone
companies might have to cross subsidize competitive services with
revenues earned from non-competitive offerings.
<P>
Price regulation requirements were included largely through the
efforts of Senator Lott and Congressman Tauzin.  <i>Staff apparently
decided to strike the provisions from the conference report in
deference to pressure from the White House and some state regulatory
commissions who view the requirement as an encroachment on their
jurisdiction</i>.
<P>
The move from rate of return regulation to price regulation was
a key feature of both bills, supported especially by Sen. Pressler
and Cong. Fields, and <i>its elimination from the final bill would
make it significantly less pro-competitive</i>.
<P><a name="comp"></a>
<center><B>LONG DISTANCE COMPETITION</B>
<P></center>
During the telecom debate in September, the House expressly rejected
provisions that would have delayed Bell company entry into the
long distance market until they were able to demonstrate that
local phone markets were competitive (i.e., a facilities based
test).  The House rejected this proposal out of concern it would
create a disincentive for long distance carriers to enter local
phone markets with the Bells, thereby delaying Bell entry into
the long distance market.
<P>
<i>Though the Senate staff apparently has agreed to the provisions
in the House bill, the long distance carriers have persuaded Chairman
Bliley and Rep. Fields to reconsider the type of facilities-based
local competition test that the House earlier rejected</i>. Neither
the House conferees nor the conference committee as a whole have
voted on this issue.

<title>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ADOPTION</title>

<p>
<h2>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING<br>
ABOUT ADOPTION</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I hope that we will reach out across the country
and create an environment in which every couple who wants to have
a child -- or several children -- and is capable emotionally and
financially to adopt, has the opportunity to adopt.  And I hope
every child who finds himself in a situation without a permanent
relationship with adults who care will have an opportunity for
a permanent legal family; and that we will work together to make
adoption as easy as possible, as practical as possible, and as
supported as possible.&quot;  -- Speaker of the House of Representatives
Newt Gingrich at the National Council for Adoption's Adoption
Hall of Fame Banquet, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;Even if pro-choice and pro-life advocates can never agree 
philosophically on the question of abortion, we can agree on adoption. 
I have long been a proponent of adoption and will continue to support 
it. Both pro-choice and pro-life advocates can and should come together 
to promote adoption. Too many children desperately need families and 
homes.&quot; -- Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;I'm particularly pleased that this house will serve
as a place from which children will be adopted under the responsibility
of Catholic Charities, and I would personally plead that everyone
who knows of this house, everyone who knows of other places like
it, will do all that can be done to promote adoption of the children
here in our own country.  We have more than 400,000 children languishing
in foster care in America.&quot; -- First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at Mother Teresa's Home for Infant Children in Washington,
D.C., 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;The fact is that with adoption comes joy and challenges
and, always, blessings.  If you're thinking of starting a family,
or adding another member to your present family, please consider
adopting a child who has been waiting -- sometimes a long time
-- for someone to love them and provide a happy home.  You'll
be giving a precious gift -- the special love of a family -- to
a child who desperately needs it.&quot;  -- Dave Thomas, founder
of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants in a publication
entitled &quot;Adoption Works...For Everyone:  A Beginner's Guide
To Adoption.&quot;

<title>Bridging the Budget Gap on Medicare -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>BRIDGING THE BUDGET GAP ON MEDICARE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
 Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi"> The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 73<br>
November 21, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The Congress-White House budget agreement reached on Sunday would incorporate a slightly modified Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline against which to measure competing ways to balance the budget in seven years. 
<p>
This is important because it means both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will be using the same "benchmark" to compare proposals with current law. Until now, the White House has insisted on  using baselines developed by its own Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Congress uses the nonpartisan CBO, as required by statute. Since the OMB's forecast for the economy and spending under current law generally is more optimistic than CBO's (that is, assumes faster economic growth and a slower increase in many federal programs), achieving any proposed federal budget requires smaller savings according to the White House than according to CBO.
<p>
Using the same CBO scorecard will make it much easier to reach compromise in a number of policy areas where the White House and Congress hitherto appeared too far apart for an agreement. Perhaps the most important of these areas is Medicare. The White House and congressional Democrats in recent weeks have attempted to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate conference budget resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June. Americans have been told that, while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the conference budget resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings. Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
Using the same CBO baseline for both Medicare proposals sharply reduces the gap. 
<p>
Specifically:
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress. This makes the difference between the two plans $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.
<p>
But even this overstates the gap between the two positions in terms of reducing the outlays for Medicare. The reason:  Congress's budget includes new revenue into the program from raising Part B premiums in two ways. In the arcane accounting of Washington, bringing new revenues into the Medicare program is considered identical to cutting the growth of projected spending on health care services. It obviously is not, however, since adding revenues to fund the program does not reduce spending, even though it does reduce the growth in net outlays. 
<p>
Under the congressional plan, the first way Part B premium revenues are increased, compared with current law, is by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of costs instead of allowing them to fall to 25 percent of costs, as current law would do (meaning an actual reduction in premiums). This raises $48.7 billion over seven years. Under the second change, an affluence test would be applied to Medicare recipients, and upper-income beneficiaries would face an additional increase in premiums, reducing the subsidy these individuals currently receive from taxpayers. This second change raises $8.6 billion over seven years. Thus, the combined revenue generated by the premium adjustments -- which is classified as a reduction in spending by Washington, but actually funds more Medicare services -- is $57.3 billion over seven years.
<p>
The Clinton budget contains no premium increases, even on the wealthy. So to compare the effect of the two Medicare proposals on actual spending for services, it is necessary to add the misleadingly classified $57.3 billion revenue increase to the congressional budget numbers.
<p>
If Medicare spending under the two budgets is compared with the CBO baseline, after correcting the congressional figure for the additional premium revenue, the difference in spending falls to a gap of just $20.7 billion over seven years in a program which is projected to spend $1,900 billion over that period. Thus, the gap between the White House and Congress on Medicare spending is just one percent of current projected outlays.

<hr><P>
<i>What would have happened if the Founding Fathers had tried to
draft the Declaration of Independence today with a lawyer from
the American Civil Liberties Union on the committee....</i>
<hr width="50%">
</center><P>
JOHN ADAMS: Gentlemen, let us pray that the Almighty will grant
us wisdom in the wording of this document and in setting the course
for this new nation.
<P>
ACLU: I object! God has no place in government!
<P>
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: Sir, to forbid the rightful acknowledgment
of God in the affairs of state would be an abridgment of the religious
freedom we came to this country to enjoy.
<P>
THOMAS JEFFERSON: Religion is the foundation of all just government.
Our laws have their source and their authority in the Bible. Don't
we need wisdom and His blessing? The Bible says, &quot;The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&quot; and &quot;Blessed
is the nation whose God is the Lord.&quot;
<P>
ACLU: Don't forget that it was abuses by a state religion that
were partly responsible for bringing us to this point of separation
from England.
<P>
JEFFERSON: We need separation of church and state to prevent the
church from controlling the state, or the state the church--not
to prevent the church from civilizing the state and holding it
morally accountable.
<P>
ACLU: You are imposing your belief in God on me! I'm an atheist!
<P>
ADAMS: Whether you are an atheist or not does not affect God's
existence. Oh, very well. Those who wish to may privately and
individually acknowledge God's ruling in our lives.
<P>
Now, Mr. Jefferson will read us the Declaration of Independence,
subject to our revisions.
<P>
JEFFERSON: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! 'Truths' is a relative term. What's true for
you may not be true for me. And creation is a religious concept.
<P>
ADAMS: Then let us amend that statement to read, 'We hold these
opinions to be self-evident, to some, that all men are equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Sexist!
<P>
ADAMS: How about 'all persons are equal'?
<P>
ACLU: Better. But I'd prefer, 'all races, genders and lifestyles
are Equal--'
<P>
FRANKLIN: 'lifestyles'? What are lifestyles'?
<P>
ACLU: Sexual preference: adultery, homosexuality, prostitution,
pedophilia--
<P>
FRANKLIN: I pray our nation never--
<P>
ACLU; If you people persist in your references to prayer, I'll
seek a court injunction.
<P>
ADAMS: Order! Order! Gentlemen! Mr. Jefferson, please continue!
<P>
JEFFERSON: '--That all lifestyles, etc., are equal and that all
persons find themselves possessing certain arguably inalienable
rights, that among these are life--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Infringes on a woman's right to reproductive
choice.
<P>
JEFFERSON: '. . . liberty and the pursuit of happiness'
<P>
FRANKLIN: This doesn't even make sense! How can people have 'rights'
which are not granted by anyone? How can those who do not have
a right to life profit from their rights to liberty and the pursuit
of happiness?
<P>
I move we kick this lawyer out of the meeting!
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Violation of the first amendment to the Constitution:
my right to free speech.
<P>
ADAMS: What is the Constitution?
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of speech extends not only to political dissidents,
such as ourselves, but to moral relativists, and to those who
may in the future seek to destroy what we are now building.
<P>
FRANKLIN: God forbid!
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of religion means that moral values can have no
influence on public life.
<P>
ADAMS: But that is nonsense! This would mean that our public prayers
would violate the laws of the nation we are in the process of
creating.
<P>
ACLU: That's what the Supreme Court will say!
<P>
FRANKLIN: If that's how you people are going to interpret it,
I hope to God we never do draft it.
<P>
ADAMS: Gentlemen, we seem to be deadlocked. Every attempt on the
part of men of good will to establish this nation seems to be
actively thwarted by the lawyer from the ACLU. The revolution
is hereby cancelled. <P>

 The Hebrew and Greek words for &quot;envy&quot; are used 23 times
in the Bible.  They are used negatively 22 times, positively once
-- when the apostle Paul in Romans 11:14 hopes that the good lives
of Christians will arouse non-believers to constructive envy.
<P>
 Calvin Trillin, author of the hilarious food book <U>American
Fried</U>, presents his own version of constructive envy concerning
ordering in restaurants.  Do not study the menu, he says, or discourse
endlessly with the waiter; instead, see someone at an adjacent
table who is stuffing his face with great joy, point at him and
his food, and tell the waiter, &quot;I want some of that.&quot;
<P>
 Constructive envy.
<P>
 Sitting in a room at the Gospel Mission on 810 Fifth St. N.W.,
41-year-old Jerry Minor opens the furnace door of his past and
looks into hell.  &quot;I couldn't -- I couldn't hold a job,&quot;
he recalls.  &quot;Drugs and alcohol.&quot; Mr. Minor started
using heroin and cocaine when he was 19, was married at 22, and
over the next few years turned from &quot;recreational use&quot;
into a drug-focused wreck of a man.
<P>
 Mrs. Minor accepted the occasional use, but as it mastered Minor
and he became unable to hold a job or act decently in the home,
she &quot;just couldn't put up with it anymore&quot; and left
in 1984.  Minor hit the streets, selling crack cocaine and heroin
but not netting much cash in the process, &quot;because I was
using as much as I was making. Most of the money went right back
into my body.&quot; 
<P>
 He was also &quot;off and on&quot; in jail for selling drugs.
 When not behind bars he would see his wife and children every
few weeks; she would plead with him to stop doing drugs, but &quot;it
was just beyond my control to stop.&quot; He sometimes stayed
at big, government-funded homeless shelters, but he found there
&quot;a lot of the same things that I was always doing.  A lot
of drugs, a lot of fights.&quot;  
<P>
 Minor walked into the Gospel Mission in 1992 -- out of desperation,
not belief.  &quot;I was tired of doing the things that I was
doing.  I was tired of going in and out of jail.  And that was
it.  The shelters fed me and clothed me but they gave me no rest.
 I was just tired, you know?&quot;  He was also functionally illiterate,
and deciding it was time to do something about that.
<P>
 At the Gospel Mission, constructive envy started to set in. 
&quot;I started seeing other people accepting the Lord, and realized
they were getting better. I wanted some of that, because I had
tried everything else. And there were people here showing me that
they cared about me.  People helped me with the Bible, helped
me understand the Bible.  And it was the grace of God that finally
did it.&quot;
<P>
 Three years later, Minor is working as a drug counselor at the
Gospel Mission.  He could never be licensed by the government:
 He doesn't have the classroom hours, and his reading still isn't
very good. (A volunteer tutor works with him regularly.) But he
knows the tricks of the drug trade and isn't easily taken in by
scams; he's stood up to bullies before and isn't easily possessed
by fear; he's learned to live with little and isn't readily subject
to greed. 
<P>
 There's still a long way to go for Jerry Minor.  He's working
on his relationship with his children.  (His ex-wife has since
remarried.) He's still working on his 3-R skills.  But &quot;now
he's a leader,&quot; says Gospel Mission staff psychologist Molly
Soper.  &quot;The men look up to him, and new ones come in see
that he's getting it together in a way they have not.&quot; 
<P>
 Constructive envy.  It doesn't happen when homeless men are thrown
together into a shelter that enables their self-destruction by
supplying needs regardless of behavior.  It doesn't happen when
men forget that right and wrong do have meaning, and that not
all life styles are equal.
<P>
 But when it does set in -- because truly compassionate people
have structured a challenging environment in which  the desire
to change is watered daily -- constructive envy does not enable
people to wallow as they are.  It changes them.

<P><p><P></center>
 Over the past several years there has been a dramatic retrenchment
of government's economic role.  Around the globe various countries
have privatized their banks, steel mills, post offices, air traffic
control systems and roads.  The change has been no less dramatic
in the energy sector.  Great Britain and Chile have already privatized
their electricity industries and several other countries are now
following suit.  Given this return to private enterprise in former
bastions of statism, it is somewhat embarrassing that, while the
Russians have privatized more than 10,000 firms in the past couple
of years, the U.S. Congress is finding it impossible to privatize
four agencies that generate and distribute electricity in the
South and West, and at most represent one-twentieth of one percent
of our GDP.
<P>

 These agencies, the Power Marketing Administrations (or PMAs
to their fans), were created over the past sixty years to market
power generated at dams operated by the Corps of Engineers and
the Bureau of Reclamation.  The electricity generated at these
facilities is sold at mostly below market rates to rural electric
co-operatives and local government utilities -- a group commonly
called &quot;preference customers&quot;.  
<P>
 Privatization of the PMAs has foundered on the effect it would
have on the electricity rates charged to consumers of this low-cost
power.  So far, various proposals to address this problem have
been lacking.  The preference customers have advocated that the
PMAs be sold to them at bargain prices.  This has run into the
opposition of private utility companies that also want the chance
to bid on the assets.  The House Resources Committee's plan, now
defunct, would have sold the Southeastern Power Administration
(SEPA) to the highest bidder, and mitigated any &quot;rate shock&quot;
with a regulatory rate cap.  
<P>
 The sale of SEPA has been waylaid by traditional interest group
politics.  The beneficiaries of this program (i.e., the preference
customers who receive subsidized power) have a concentrated interest
in this issue that, as usual, has trumped the general interest
of taxpayers who paid for the construction and operation of the
PMAs and currently subsidize the power.  It's been reported that
even the Bass Anglers Sporting Society fought the sale.  It seems
they fear the owners of the privatized dams will increase fees
at bass rich reservoirs.  This is yet another example of how good
intentions are simply not enough to move the process in Washington.
<P>
 In order to privatize the PMAs and, more  generally, in order
to truly reform the Federal government, we are going to have to
do more than just think good thoughts and exhort Congress to vote
the general interest.  We have to make change something special
interests desire rather than fear.
<P>
 In the area of privatization, we should learn from the experiences
of other countries around the world.  Through voucher and other
plans foreign governments have transformed natural opponents of
privatization such as employees and customers into stakeholders
and advocates.  The Czech Republic's voucher scheme was extraordinarily
successful.  It made the benefits of privatization obvious even
to &quot;widows and orphans&quot; for whom terms like &quot;shares&quot;
or &quot;stock exchange&quot; had still been rather foggy.
<P>
 Taking inspiration from the Czech experience we need to privatize
the PMAs in way that turns potential opponents into proponents.
 The way to do this is to convert the PMAs into government corporations.
 Next, the final consumers of PMA power -- those who use power
bought from a PMA to light their homes or run their businesses
-- would be given the option to purchase stock in the PMAs at
a price reflecting the value of the PMAs under current operating
conditions.  This option would be fully transferrable and so consumers
could either exercise it, thus become part-owners of the corporation,
or sell it to whomever they want under any conditions they agree
upon.  
<P>
  Unlike the proposals put forward so far by the preferred customers,
this legislation will open the sale up to any qualified bidder.
 This will ensure that the assets will wind up with those who
can use them most efficiently.  This approach will move decisions
about ownership and operation of these facilities out of committee
rooms in Washington and give those decisions to people who have
a direct interest in the outcome.  Interested buyers will have
to woo consumers instead of sending lobbyists to Washington. 
<P>
 However, unlike open sale proposals put forward so far by private
utilities, it will not leave in place an interest group protected
only by a governmental regulatory structure.  A wide-open bidding
process will bid up the value of the PMAs giving consumers the
chance to realize substantial gains by selling their options.
 Consumers will be compensated for any possible &quot;rate shock&quot;
through cash from the sale of their option, or appreciated stock.
<P>
 Most importantly, it will convert those who are now most fearful
of any change in ownership of the PMAs into supporters of privatization.
 Consumers will take an active interest in the process as they
check the financial pages of their newspaper every day for the
latest offer.  They will write their Congressman asking not to
stop the sale, but to expedite it so they can realize their gain
from the sale on the open market.
<P>
 In December of 1986, on the day Margaret Thatcher's government
was launching its privatization of British Gas, a crowd of about
a hundred people gathered in the foyer of the Manchester Stock
Exchange.  Before the sale, the government had done everything
possible--staggered payments, bonus and voucher schemes, and free
and matching shares--to encourage and empower former customers
and employees to buy shares.  That day, the foyer soon took on
the atmosphere of a bookie's office.  As the price of the newly
floated shares rose, the crowd cheered.  When prices faltered,
they booed.  This shows how a creative plan can capture the imagination
and support of the public.  
<P>
 The approach described above can change the current political
dynamic in a similar and dramatic way.  It would end government
involvement in generating electricity, an area where it no longer
needs to be involved.  It will also provide an example of the
innovative types of solutions that can be used to restructure
other areas of the Federal government.
<P>
 This concept will be incorporated into a bill that will be introduced
by one of the authors, Congressman Shadegg.  The plan will avoid
a sale to the current preference customers at below market rates,
which would not truly privatize these facilities.  A preference
sale would merely move the facilities from the left hand of the
government to the right, perpetuate subsidized power and hurt
the taxpayer.  
<P>
 The privatization plan embodied in the bill also avoids a &quot;trust
us&quot; sale to the existing private power companies under terms
which ask the current customers give up their benefit for nothing
and rely on a government regulatory structure to protect them
from rate shock.
<P>
 Following the example used around the world, giving a fully transferable
purchase option to the current customers meets two important criteria.
 First, it will achieve privatization at market rates, and second,
it will fully compensate the current customers.

<h2>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD<br>
DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>
<p>
In the wake of the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a
U.S. sailor and two Marines and the groping of a female sailor
by a drunken chief petty officer on a commercial flight, Admiral
Jeremy Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, has called for A
Day of Introspection for service men and women to consider the
issue of sexual harassment.
<p>
Whether &quot;introspection&quot; can help is anyone's guess,
but if our nation's military leaders are really serious about
combatting improper sexual activity by service personnel, they
will move quickly to stop the save of sexually explicit materials
on military bases.
<p>
Believe it or not, the federal government is the country's largest
distributor of pornographic materials.  By selling sex magazines
to U.S. Armed Forces through the military exchange system, the
government spreads smut tax-free and at discount prices.
<p>
Most Americans (51 percent) favor banning the sale of pornographic
materials on military bases, according to a new national survey
conducted for the Family Research Council by Voter/Consumer Research,
a Maryland-based pollster.  Not suprisingly, support for this
measure is particularly high among women.
<p>
To date, the Navy's solution to the problem of sexual harassment
and misconduct has been both misguided and ineffective.  The positive
effects of sexual harassment classes have been more than offset
by assigning more women to the close quarters environments of
naval aviation and combat ships.
<p>
Evidence of this is the recent deployment of the <I>USS Eisenhower</I>,
to the Mediterranean for six months.  The crew included 415 women,
a large number of whom became pregnant, engaged in extramarital affairs,
and returned to publicize incidents of sexual misconduct.  Experienced
sailors were not surprised by the <I>Eisenhower</I> results. 
Any skipper of a coed ship can relate incidents of fraternization,
granting of favors for sex, on-board pregnancies, etc. 
<p>
Navy regulations already prohibit the sale of materials that &quot;inspire
or encourage lust, particularly in the young, by exploiting indecent
or undue exposure, exaggerating sexual characteristics of male
or female figures, or by showing suggestive obvious passionate
actions or poses.&quot; 
<p>
The Navy's hesitancy to dump this trash may be because commanders
lack the courage to enforce the regulations or fear First Amendment
challenges.   At least one ship commander ignored such possible
constraints and did the right thing.
<p>
The captain of the <I>USS America</I> received a complaint about
a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April, 1984 issue of
<I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman engaging
in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer was ordered
to deep-six the magazine.
<p>
In many cases, commanders may not understand the connection between
sexually explicit material and sexual misconduct.  They can't
&quot;connect the dots.&quot;
<p>
Pornographic material, like alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.
 Beginning with &quot;soft&quot; pornography sold in Navy stores,
the desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more
explicit, more deviant images in order to reach the previous level
of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and  may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.  Such activities may include promiscuity,
exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, sex with children, rape,
sadism or homosexuality.
<p>
Army exchanges sell this trash, too. <i>Hustler,</i> one of the
more perverse of the &quot;mainstream&quot; magazines,  is sold
openly at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where military personnel
find one of the largest government-sponsored displays of erotic
material in the world.
<p>
Submariners at Groton, Connecticut can also choose from a wide
selection of pornography.  Even in Washington, D.C., the Pentagon
Book Store sells nine &quot;soft-porn&quot; magazines and two
sexually explicit homosexual magazines, the latter belying DOD's
commitment to &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot;
<p>
Under current policy, military exchange managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot;
outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case <i>Miller vs. California</i>.
<p>
The <I>Miller</I> criteria were written to protect freedom of
speech and expression but there are kinds of speech and expression
not protected by the Constitution. These include, among others,
slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling
&quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater, copyright violations and
child pornography.
<p>
Navy regulations allow commanders to ban materials that could
incite sexual harassment in the workplace.  According to the Navy,
the workplace is &quot;an expansive term for military members
and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.&quot;
 This includes off-duty in an off-base military community, on
commercial airplanes, at aviation conventions and on the high
seas.
<p>
Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune applied this concept of  &quot;off
duty&quot; to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed off limits to military personnel. The shop's owner,
Eugene Enslin, filed a suit alleging violation of his constitutional
rights of free speech.  U.S. District Court Judge W. Earl Britt
dismissed the lawsuit, concluding that, &quot;A military commander
has an overriding duty to safeguard the morals, welfare and discipline
of his men.&quot;
<p>
A 1992 Department of the Navy memo states: &quot;A commanding
officer has broad responsibility to ensure the effective and efficient
operation of his/her command... [and] has authority to regulate
or ban activities that may be detrimental ... to good order, discipline,
and morale among command personnel.&quot; It is clear that commanding
officers may restrict base exchanges from selling materials that
promote illicit or offensive behavior.
<p>
In a 1992 letter to the Navy's Assistant Secretary for Manpower
and Reserve Affairs, the Navy Exchange Commander wrote: &quot;I
believe strongly that our Navy...should establish a Navy-wide
policy which states that material inconsistent with its core values,
which is demeaning to men or women of our Navy and which is contrary
to good order and discipline, will not be sold in exchanges.&quot;
<p>
In a 1992 memo to the Chief of Naval Operations, Captain P. W.
Kelley, a Navy lawyer, stated: &quot;In view of the mission of
the exchange system... adult periodicals can be excluded from
exchange shelves.&quot;
<p>
Several years ago, Americans learned that topless and bottomless
&quot;performers,&quot; male and female, were appearing under
military auspices at U.S. military bases in the Pacific.  When
these incidents were publicized, the Navy banned the sex shows.
 It argued, &quot;The issue of moral acceptability aside, on-base
activities such as these contribute to creating an environment
in which all females are regarded with less or no respect, and
abusive behavior toward all women is not only passively accepted
and condoned but encouraged.&quot;
<p>
It is clear that the Navy understands the detrimental effect of
pornographic materials and explicit sex-related entertainment.
 It is also clear that policies are in place to limit the availability
of such material or shows to service members.  The fact that defies
logic is that the services remain in the porn business.  Why?
<p>
Given the rise in sexual assaults and the growing attention devoted
to sexual harassment, the Navy must stop the sale of pornography through 
military installations. Unscrupulous businessmen are willing to sell the 
trash, but must taxpayer funded stores peddle depraved material at cut-rates 
and tax-free to servicemen worldwide?
<p>
Eckerd Drugs and 7-Eleven have voluntarily decided not to sell
sexually explicit material despite the loss of potential profits.
 Why does the U.S. government, which should stand for what is
right and moral in our country, not have the social conscience
of these commercial firms? 
<p>
Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton has the unilateral authority to
remove pornographic material from military stores.  With the stroke
of a pen, his executive order could prohibit the sale of sexually
explicit materials in base exchanges all over the world.  Such
an order would surely be upheld in the courts, especially if based
on long respected claims of military deference.  We are waiting,
Mr. President.

<title>How Congress Can Help Trigger Reform in DC Schools -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>HOW CONGRESS CAN HELP TRIGGER REFORM IN D.C.'S SCHOOLS</i></h3>
By James F. Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 440<br>
November 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr width=50%>
<p>
Nowhere in America is there a greater need for innovative approaches to education than in the nation's capital. Amid the intense debate in Congress and around the country over education and the future of America's schools, little is being done to improve the educational system for the children of the District of Columbia. Fortunately, however, at the request of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on D.C. Schools and Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) have developed a plan that takes the first step towards giving the District's children the education they have a right to expect.
<p>
The dismal record of the District's schools is a national embarrassment. The city spends an average of almost $9,000 per year on its more than 80,000 enrolled students. This is the third-highest spending rate of any state or equivalent jurisdiction, some $3,000 above the average. Its student-teacher ratio (14.4 to 1) is the fourth-lowest of any state or equivalent jurisdiction. Yet SAT scores in the District rank 49th out of 51 (50 states plus D.C.), and its graduation rate is also 49th out of 51.
<p>
It is time for a drastic overhaul of the District of Columbia school system. Ideally, the pressure for this should come from within the District, but reformers have been frustrated by the fierce opposition to change, led by the school bureaucracy and the teachers union, that so far has stymied action from within the city. Congress, however, has a unique role in the District. Within the District of Columbia appropriations bill, it has an opportunity to help trigger local reform by adopting Representative Gunderson's proposal to improve educational opportunities for the District's children.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal authorizes the establishment of independent public charter schools, using existing D.C. public and private schools as well as new schools created with the help of universities in the District. It even authorizes many federal institutions within D.C., including the National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public charter schools.
<p>
The establishment of charter schools would help restructure the existing public school system, allowing innovative school principals and teachers to work with parents and academic institutions to overhaul the system. Under the Gunderson proposal, lower-income parents would have the right to choose an effective private school if they are not satisfied with their child's public school. This would hold the public schools to account.
<p>
Specifically, Representative Gunderson's proposal gives scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family income is at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family income is not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. These scholarships would allow low-income D.C. families to send their children to any private, independent religious or non-religious school located in the District of Columbia and the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and Maryland. They also would cover the cost of fees and other expenses for tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs of transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia public school, public charter school, or private school participating in the tuition scholarship program. 
<p>
The Gunderson proposal establishes a special panel to develop tests to monitor the progress of the District's schools so that parents have real information on which to evaluate D.C.'s schools. This World Class Schools Panel would be responsible for developing a core curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. In addition, it would encourage more private-sector involvement in the District's schools.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal does not tell D.C. residents what schools they must have. Rather it creates the conditions and incentives for change. It is still up to parents, teachers, principals, and District institutions to take advantage of this opportunity.
<p>
The plan is not without its weaknesses. For one thing, it does nothing to help the D.C. Superintendent or parents break down the suffocating bureaucracy that swallows education dollars and thwarts reform. And while a "D.C. Desk" in the Department of Education might help D.C. schools locate resources and expertise to assist reform, there is a real danger that it will become just another force blocking reform. Despite these weaknesses and its limited scope, Representative Gunderson's proposal would be the crucial first step in ending business as usual in the District's school system. It would give parents, students, and innovative educators the tools they need to force change on a fossilized system. And it would give low-income families the chance to escape those public schools that refuse to give children the education they should expect in the nation's capital.

<i> &quot;Well, I think in the information age, too much information
and too much sort-of-quasi-information -- I mean, you guys have
to compete with near-news, too -- It's like, you know, like when
we were kids, we'd drink near-beer?  You've got all this information
and a lot competition among news sources and then you're competing
with the near-news and there is a danger that too much stuff cramming
in on people's minds is just as bad for them as too little in
terms of their ability to understand.&quot;
   </i>   <br><b>-- President Clinton</b>
<br>
               <I>The Washington Post</I>, 
                September 24, 1995
<P><hr width="50%">
<p> &quot;Too much information?&quot;  &quot;Near-news?&quot;  &quot;Ability
to understand?&quot;  In these informal remarks to a group of
reporters and producers, President Clinton appears to be having
second thoughts on the &quot;third wave&quot;.   In sharp contrast,
many commentators herald the much-acclaimed information revolution
precisely because it will empower individuals to convey and receive
their own news and information.  Who's right?  Are the many on-line
services, the Internet, talk radio and the sheer increase in electronic
outlets and programs a good thing?  More particularly, will they
lead to a more informed citizenry?
<P>
 There's no denying that Americans now enjoy an ever-expanding
range of outlets from which they can get a wealth of news and
information programming.  Focusing only on the electronic media,
98 percent of all U.S. homes can receive the major TV networks,
of which we now have four.  More than 90 percent of all households
can subscribe to cable TV and roughly 60 percent do.  Eighty-five
percent of all U.S. homes have VCRs.  Almost all can subscribe
to two one-hundred-channel direct broadcast TV systems (DBS) and
over a million have done so in the space of a year.  Ninety-four
percent of Americans can receive more than five TV  stations,
most of which carry locally originated programming.  By subscribing
to either cable or DBS, they can have more than a 100 additional
networks of information and programming.  Increasingly, AM radio
stations are adopting talk radio formats.  Local or nationally-syndicated
talk show hosts are giving millions of Americans the opportunity
to listen and discuss the issues of the day with  each other.
 Anyone with a telephone line, at least a 286 computer and modem
can access an online service and the Internet.  The three biggest
online services claim over 8 million subscribers and the entry
of Microsoft's new online service has caused sharp price reductions.
 
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this period of unprecedented change and opportunity
is causing many new companies to enter the market while others
are consolidating or forming alliances with each other.  Notably,
some of the nation's largest telephone companies are preparing
to enter the video market using their own facilities or recently
acquired radio frequencies.  At the same time they are forming
their own production companies and forming alliances with the
owners of existing programs.  Recently, three big networks, CBS,
ABC and TBS, have been acquired by large media companies.  
<P>
 Paradoxically, these developments have created two competing
sets of concerns for those leery of the ongoing changes in the
marketplace of ideas.  On the one hand, there are the President's
worries that the quality of the public debate is declining.  For
example, will the plethora of news sources make it too difficult
to carry on a coherent national discussion?  Do the talk show
and online discussions too often stray from the facts?  Or are
they too shrill, uncivil, or illiberal?  
<P>
 On the other hand, the Clinton Administration worries that the
House and Senate telecom bills  about to go to conference will
unduly relax statutory limitations on broadcast ownership.  Apparently,
the concern is that possible broadcast mergers may stymie public
debate by giving large companies too much control over the marketplace
of ideas.  Is the fear that we will then end up with too little
diversity of &quot;stuff cramming in on people's minds?&quot;
 
<P>
 Neither of these concerns is well-founded.  First, the Administration's
concern about media concentration is misplaced, especially if
the focus is on the broader marketplace of ideas.  Americans are
now enjoying  the benefits of more speakers than ever before even
if limited to traditional electronic media.  Given that the current
mergers are taking place in relatively unconcentrated markets
with low barriers to entry and are still subject to traditional
antitrust review, it is reasonable to assume that they are motivated
by the desire to become more efficient.  In competitive markets
any such improvements will largely benefit viewers and listeners,
often by improving program quality and diversity.  In addition
to existing competition, more and more Americans have wholly new
ways to express and receive ideas -- talk radio and online services
being two examples.
<P>
 Second, rather than be concerned that Americans are receiving
too much information which is reducing their ability to understand,
we should celebrate the new power Americans now enjoy to get news
and information.  This &quot;demassification&quot; of the media
(Alvin Toffler's term) will allow Americans, when they choose,
to get their news unfiltered through the established media.  This
is not to say that the reputation of news sources is not important.
 In fact, a speaker's trademark may become even more important
to listeners in the information age.  Listeners will continue
to have strong incentives to use trademarks and their own good
judgment to discern quality speech and speakers from the rest.
 What will be different is that a speaker's cost of reaching widespread
audiences has plummeted and will continue to fall.  
<P>
 This process is fundamentally healthy.  Old established speakers
with established franchises are and will continue to be challenged
by new sources.  Currently distrustful citizens will have alternatives
to turn to.  The old and the new media will criticize, check and
ultimately improve each other.  Remember the concerns the print
industry had regarding the introduction of radio?  Those who worry
about the onslaught of information and &quot;near news&quot; would
do well to remember the fundamental insight of Judge Learned Hand:
&quot;The First Amendment presupposes that the right conclusions
are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues,
than through any kind of authoritative selection.  To many this
is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our
all.&quot;

Program</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>Clinton and Cisneros Wrecked a Good Housing Program</h3>
<i>November 1, 1995</i><P>

Letter to the Editor of <i>The Washington Times</i> 
</center> 
<hr> 
Dear Editor: 
<P> 
I was surprised to learn that, according to your Oct. 26 report ("HUD's 
relocation of urban poor targeted for ax," Nation), I had "launched" the 
Clinton administrations' Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Moving to 
Opportunity program to "address urban blight by moving poor people from 
public housing in inner cities to subsidized rental units in higher-income 
neighborhoods."
<P> 
In the Bush administration, the Moving to Opportunity program was first 
authorized Oct. 28, 1992,--two weeks before President Clinton's election 
victory.  The program was designed as a demonstration project to support a 
family's choice to use a rental voucher to move to privately owned housing in 
any neighborhood of the family's choosing--one that offered more job 
opportunities for parents and better education for children.  This was the 
essence of the Reagan idea of vouchers for housing instead of public housing 
construction.  As such, the program was the antithesis of the social 
engineering that resulted in the forced residency of low-income families in 
government-run housing projects in the inner city. 
<P>Unfortunately, by the time Moving to Opportunity was 
<i>launched</i> by the Clinton administration in 1994 (see "A helping hand 
or social engineering?" Nation, March, 15, 1994), the program had been 
transformed by HUD into a massive new fair-housing program to disperse 
low-income families to middle-income suburban neighborhoods.  HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros said he wanted to replicate this dispersal strategy in 
every city in the country.
<P> 
The Clinton/Cisneros plan distorted a program that was intended to 
support the housing vouchers--the cornerstone of conservative housing policy.  
That's unfortunate, but under the circumstances, Congress was right to end it.

<h3>William J. Bennett Discusses Abortion Controversy</h3> 
 
 
<b>Address to the Catholic Campaign for America 
<br>Washington, D.C.</b> 
<P><i>November 17, 1995</i></center><P>
<hr> 
<P> 
	As Catholics of the Catholic Campaign for America, we must address without hesitation, and 
with proper moral seriousness, the issue of abortion in America.  One and a half million 
abortions performed every year -- of which the overwhelming majority are performed on 
perfectly healthy women in order to prevent the births of perfectly healthy children -- is a 
national shame and a national catastrophe.   
<P> 
	But not only is this catastrophic in itself -- indeed, it is virtually a definition of catastrophe -- 
it is also horrible in its consequences on the sensibilities of the American people.  There is 
little doubt that the 30 million abortions since 1973 have had a coarsening effect on a people's 
attitudes toward its children; it has diminished our sense of natality.  And it has accelerated 
the growth of what Pope John Paul  II has correctly called the "culture of death." 
<P> 
	In addressing the abortion issue, we should never abandon principle.  We should invite as 
many people as possible to the affirmation of our clear end: significant reduction of the 
number of abortions.   
<P> 
	But reasonable people of good will can and do disagree on the <i>means</i> to reducing 
abortions.  Some would push for various forms of criminalization, some would not. Some 
believe a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is the surest and best way to go; 
others, in good faith, doubt this.  Differences aside, it seems to me we ought to bring to the 
cause all those who look at the figure of one and a half million abortions a year with horror 
and misgiving.  We can admit that yes, there are some hard, wrenching cases, cases on which 
people of good will disagree.  But let us set aside the small number of hard cases and focus 
our efforts on the vast majority of cases on which most Americans do not feel moral 
ambiguity. 
<P> 
	My own view is this:  I believe <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was wrongly decided and based on  
flawed legal reasoning;  I support legislative efforts to expand the boundaries of legal 
protection for the unborn (such as waiting periods, parental notification, restriction of 
abortions after viability, and other such measures); I oppose the use of public funds to pay for 
abortion;  and I strongly support pro-life alternatives such as adoption and abstinence. 
<P>
	As for the specific issue of a constitutional amendment, I know many people feel strongly 
about it.  But for myself, I do not think it has done much good, and I also believe there may 
well be drawbacks to it.  Above all, I believe it has done nothing to help reduce the number of 
abortions.  And that is, after all, the crucial issue in this debate: <i>how to reduce the number 
of abortions in America</i>.	 
<P> 
	Abortion is a moral issue and the law should reflect that fact.  Current law refuses to 
demonstrate to people that abortion is even a serious issue, much less a moral one.  Our efforts 
should be to infuse into the law a heightened sense of the spiritual and human dimensions of 
the issue.  Provisions which highlight and stress the morality of the issue -- waiting periods, 
information about fetal life and possible consequences for the mother, and parental 
notification among others -- should be pursued vigorously, on the state level.  And the recent 
effort to ban partial-birth abortions seems to me both tactically smart and morally sound. 
<P> 
	I believe that there is a pro-life agenda that is both incremental <i>and</i> principled, 
politically realistic <i>and</i> ambitious.  Our nation, as it is today, will sustain certain legal 
reforms: ending late-term abortions and sex selection abortions; promoting informed consent; 
and requiring parental notification to end the desperate isolation of pregnant teens and to 
promote responsibility, communication, and mature decision making.  That is where we ought 
to concentrate our legal efforts. 
<P> 
	I recognize that some pro-life groups will consider this kind of incremental approach as too 
little.  To which I respond: the approach I am advocating recognizes that social reform must 
respect political realities if we hope to restrict abortion-on-demand.  "Public sentiment is 
everything," Lincoln said of American democracy.  "With public sentiment, nothing can fail; 
without it, nothing can succeed.  Consequently, he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper 
than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes and decisions 
possible or impossible to be executed."  
<P> 
	I believe this type of pro-life movement would find the support of the majority of Americans -
- including many Democrats who are deeply troubled by the massive number of abortions 
which take place every year.    
<P> 
	There is an instructive historical analogy to which we can turn.  Research by Professor Marvin 
Olasky (author of <i>Abortion Rites: A Social History of Abortion in America</i>) has 
revealed something that most Americans on both sides of the abortion debate do not 
understand.  At the outset of the Civil War the abortion rate, in a smaller U.S. population, was 
almost exactly what it is today.  A pro-life movement, based in a network of shelters, began to 
actively oppose abortion by providing refuge to women in trouble.  Institutions like YWCA, 
the Salvation Army, and Florence Crittenton homes concentrated their efforts among 
prostitutes and young, urban women, impregnated and abandoned.  These activists worked for 
small victories, provided women with positive, pro-life alternatives to abortion, and fought for 
laws while not making them their primary focus.  The result?  Between 1860 and 1910, this 
steady, compassionate social pressure reduced the rate of abortions by over half.  And the rate 
stayed low until about 1960.  This model -- what Olasky refers to as "containment" as a way 
to achieve "roll back" -- is precisely the model anti-abortion advocates should look to and 
learn from.  It is politically viable and ultimately more effective and life-affirming. 
<P> 
	In another historical analogy, some have compared abortion in this century with slavery a 
century-and-a-half ago.  Many defenders of the rights of blacks had differing views on which 
specific efforts to abolish slavery in a democratic republic would prove most expedient, 
prudent,  and fruitful.  These were passionate debates about an important issue.  I believe the 
course of action chosen by abolitionists like Harriet Tubman offers greater promise than the 
course chosen by John Brown.  Again, I think we could learn much from Lincoln -- who 
proposed containing slavery so as to put it on the path to extinction.  The spirit of both Harriet 
Tubman and Abraham Lincoln would well serve the pro-life movement today. 
<P> 
	Finally, I want to express my deep respect for the pro-life people who have labored long and 
hard and selflessly on behalf of the unborn.  I am speaking here of the people in the crisis 
pregnancy centers, adoption agencies, and foster homes around this country.  Their work is 
among the most admirable in the nation.  These are the people who are doing the most to 
contain and reduce the numbers of abortion in America.  They are unsung heroes of our 
Republic.  It is time we give them the praise they deserve.

</a>
<ul>Senior fellow and director of
regulatory studies, Thomas Lenard joined the Foundation
after seven years with the microeconomic consulting firm
of Heiden Associates, where he specialized in regulatory and
antitrust economics.  In the mid-1980s he was a special advisor for
economic policy at the White House Office of Management and
Budget.  Lenard also was a senior economist for the
Council on Wage and Price Stability.  He earned his
bachelor of arts degree in 
<a href="gopher://gopher.econ.wisc.edu/">economics</a>
from the 
<a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</a>
in 1966, and his doctorate degree in
economics from 
<a href="http://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a>
in 1972.</ul>

<ul>




l.</ul>
The Foundation's policy team -- staff, senior fellows, adjunct fellows and fellow travelers -- works to provide the political philosophy and public policies which will inform the civic discussion which is creating the next generation of American society and government.  The Foundation's Vice President for Policy, Bill Myers, guides that work (when tolerated), collaborates on it (when permitted), cajoles (often), harasses (sometimes),  and, in other ways, shepherds PFFs policy efforts.  So far, that work aims to assess The Big Change, divine The New Majority, replace the FCC, transcend the FDA, free public utilities, foster home ownership, and otherwise build a positive, practical vision for America.  When not so engaged, Myers threatens to play the part of Senior Fellow in order to write and speak on subsidiarity, federalism and public policies which are best addressed locally, topics on which he once frequently published.  Myers has previously provided more traditional direction to the policy activities of the Free Congress Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange, the State Policy Network, and the South Carolina Policy Council

<ul>A senior fellow at the Foundation, Olasky is studying the most
effective methods for assisting the truly needy in society and designing
replacements for the current welfare state. He is the author of The Tragedy of
American Compassion, hailed as a landmark work in the study of charity. He is
writing its sequel, The Promise of American Compassion, while at the Foundation.
Olasky is also editor of World, a Christian weekly news magazine, and has written
numerous articles for publications such as <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a> and <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review</a>.</ul>

<p>
<ul>
The Honorable Louis M. Sullivan, M.D. chairs the Foundation's Medical Innovation Project.  After serving as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Bush Administration, the longest tenure (47 months) of any HHS Secretary in U.S. History, Dr. Sullivan returned to Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM).  As Head of HHS, Dr. Sullivan oversaw the Federal agency responsible for the major health, welfare, food and drug safety, medical research and income security programs in service of the American people.<p>

Dr. Sullivan became the founding Dean and director of the Medical Education Program at Morehouse College in 1975, the first minority medical school founded in the United States in this century.  In 1978, MSM began operation as a two year program in the basic medical sciences, admitting its first class of 24 students.  On July 1, 1981, the Morehouse School of Medicine became independent from Morehouse College with Dr. Sullivan as its Dean and first President, and on July 1, 1983, MSM became a member of the Atlanta University Center.<p>


<dt><a href="/pff/multi/people/vlahos.jpg"><img hspace="8" alt="Picture of Michael Vlahos" src="/pff/multi/people/vlahos.gif"></a> <b><a name="Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></b>

<ul>While our lives move inevitably from future to past, Vlahos, a
senior fellow at the Foundation, has tried to march in a different direction.
From Bronze Age archaeology, Byzantium, and British imperial history at <a href="http://www.cis.yale.edu/FrontDoor/">Yale
University</a>, he moved to foreign relations and modern war at the <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/fletchCatalog.html">Fletcher School
of Law & Diplomacy</a>. As Director of Security Studies at <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>-SAIS, he
widened his view to take on war and society. So broadened, he was asked to turn
the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Cabinet/html/Department_of_State.html">State Departments</a> Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs into a real,
long-range think tank. He did. Its theme became -- and, in 1988, just in time --
world change. Vlahos was then commissioned to help turn the U.S. Navys
rangefinders toward Big Change, while at the Center for Naval Analyses. In the
Foundation, he has found a place that not only sees the ongoing transformation of
American life -- the Big Change -- but that actively seeks to be a part of it.
Now Vlahos writes, in print and in the ether, about where we are going and how we
will get there.</ul>

<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>RUSTY</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>
RUSTY


<p>Sorry -- this is going to have to be a short one. I've been in the Oval Office with Bill, Mrs. William J. Clinton, Bob Rubin, and Dick Morris. We were talking strategy for the coming budget battle, and I'm waiting for the meeting to resume. For the first time in months, we're feeling confident and ready to go to war!

<p> Mrs. WJC and Dick Morris have put Bill on a pretty stringent diet -- high fiber, low fat. As you must know, Rusty, ever since my New York Times bestseller Earth in the Balance (for which, by the way, I was paid a moderate advance and had my contract vetted by the Senate Ethics Committee -- just so you know), they've been clamoring for another Al Gore manuscript. Just last week I finalized it. It's a compilation of all of the changes and streamlining that we've done since my revolutionary ``Re-Inventing Government'' proposals. Let me tell you, I sweated over those 43 pages. But in the end it was worth it -- I smell another hit! 
<p>
And Tipper had a cute idea: put a picture of Bill five months ago on the front cover -- you know, puffy-faced, red-nosed, cottony-eyed, kind of a ``government before the Gore plan'' photo; and on the back cover, put a photo of the leaner, trimmer Bill as a ``government after the Gore plan'' photo. So now we're in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for the leaner and trimmer Bill to emerge. 
<p>
In this meeting, anyway, he's certainly holding his own. I recommended that we make no concessions, no compromises. He nodded in agreement.
<p>
``Absolutely,'' he said. ``I think there comes a time when we just say, 'Hey, there are some things that we believe in, some things we will absolutely not compromise on.'''
<p>
``Great!'' I said.Bill looked plaintively at Mrs. WJC. She nodded to Dick Morris. Dick reached into a pocket and removed a jumbo Snickers bar. Bill tore into it.
<p>
``Gosh,'' I said, ``that's a peculiar diet regimen.''
<p>
``Yeah, well . . .'' mumbled Bill, mouth full. He turned to Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. ``I raised taxes too much, didn't I?'' he asked.
<p>
Bob was about to reply, when Dick Morris snatched away what remained of the Snickers bar. Mrs. WJC took out a short ruler, and with amazing speed snapped it down hard on Bill's hand.
<p>
``Ow!'' he cried.
<p>
``There's more where that came from,'' she said.
<p>
I just looked out the window, embarrassed. You know me, Rusty: I say, ``Let Clinton be Clinton.''
<p>
Bob Rubin leaned forward and spoke, almost in a whisper. ``Mr. President, do you really think you raised my taxes too much?''
<p>
Bill was silent for a moment. Bob opened up his case and took out a large McDonald's bag. ``Look, Mr. President. Look what I've got! A Big Mac -- '' Bob removed the plastic box -- I made a mental note to tell him that it will take our precious environment 15,000,000,000 years to digest the box that contains a hamburger that will take him only 15 minutes to digest -- and Bob began to eat the Big Mac. He reached into the bag and pulled out another one.
<p>
``Well, lookee here! Another Big Mac, all warm and gooey. Who will help me eat this, I wonder?''
<p>Bill answered in a tiny voice, ``I will.''
<p>
Mrs. WJC got into the act. ``But why should he give it to you? You raised his taxes too much.''
<p>
``No I didn't.''
<p>
``I CAN'T HEAR YOU!''
<p>
``No I didn't!''
<p>
Bob tossed Bill the second Big Mac. Paper rustled, lettuce flew, special sauce splattered -- the whole thing was gone in an eyeblink.
<p>
The intercom buzzed. ``Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich on conference call, Mr. President.''
<p>
Bill reached for the phone. Mrs. WJC waved her ruler. Dick Morris produced a large pepperoni pizza.
<p>
``Hello, Senator, Mr. Speaker,'' Bill said. ``I must tell you that I'm very disappointed in your budget bill. I think it declares war on the poor and underprivileged, it maintains a generous welfare for businesses and lobbyists, and I plan to veto it.''
<p>He paused for a moment, while Dole and Gingrich spoke. After a moment or two, Mrs. WJC put away her ruler, and Dick Morris put the pizza down on the credenza.
<p>
Bill cleared his throat. ``Actually, Newt,'' he said, ``I see your point. And Senator, in a way I agree with you, too. Maybe if we all sit down -- ''
<p>
Mrs. WJC yanked the phone from the wall. Dick Morris tossed the pizza aside and asked if Bob and I would excuse them. As we crept out, a few aides wheeled in a large caterer's steam table, laden with pies, ribs, butte red corn, and a suckling pig.
<p>
I never realized that letting Clinton be Clinton would be so fattening.

<html><head><title>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - October 1995</title></head><body><h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>NOVEMBER 1995</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	Other than political pundits and political junkies, most Americans have not yet turned their attention to the 1996 presidential race. President Clinton will apparently be the Democratic nominee and has shored up his base during the last few months.
<P>
The re-entry of Ross Perot into the election equation with his newly-formed third party--the Independence Party (the Reform Party in some states where there is a name conflict)-has heartened Democrats because it is perceived that Perot takes more potential votes from the political right than he does the political left.
<P>
In polls taken earlier this year, Clinton was losing to a then unnamed Republican presidential opponent. Now he beats the front-runner among GOP candidates, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, by several percentage points. Clinton's opponents usually make the mistake of underestimating his political tenacity and dexterity--at their peril. Remember: Former President George Bush was receiving 90 percent approval ratings a year-and-a-half before the 1992 general election.
<P>
There is an obvious yearning among the electorate for a president with leadership abilities, who inspires and presents a vision for the next millennium. Clinton has described the public mood as that of being in a "funk." Some have compared this description to that of President Carter's "malaise" speech during the year leading up to his re-election defeat. But the state of the public's mood runs much deeper. In many ways, Americans are depressed about their future. Media constantly bombard them with bad news--conflict, controversy and grim statistics.
<P>
The political process, including incessant media frenzies, has resulted in the denigration of nearly every American hero, living or dead. They want to tighten their fiscal belts, but depressed wages often keep them from doing the right thing The two major parties often appear to be more interested in making each other look bad, than explaining to voters exactly what is going on.
<P>
What the existing crop of Republican contenders are faced with is high expectations from a cynical public which has been disillusioned by its political leaders in recent years. Dole, et al, are campaigning in this complex environment and do not appear to making much headway.
<P>
Dole, the only candidate who has a significant amount of support from likely Republican primary voters, does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm. His support, at best, is sot The other candidates are registering in single digits with voters in most polls. The only people who seem to be benefiting from the GOP primary process are political consultants, who get paid to spend a candidate's money until it runs out.
<P>
Enter General Colin Powell. So far, he maintains high name identification and respect among the public, the media hasn't yet bloodied him up with stories about past mistakes, and he has not been forced to be about many of the pressing issues of the day. Some people see him as a savior for what ails America; some are not so sure.
<P>
But it is clear from the current political climate that voters are not going to settle for someone who doesn't make them optimistic about the future, someone they can trust, someone they can be proud to call "Mr. President."

<p>
<font size=+3>D</font>uring his recent visit to the U.S., Pope John Paul II 
spoke movingly of how America's founding documents and the abolition 
of slavery are linked with the moral causes of today.  &quot;President
Lincoln's question is no less a question for the present generation
of Americans,&quot; the pope said in Baltimore.  &quot;Democracy cannot 
be sustained without a shared commitment to certain moral truths
about the human person and human community.&quot;
<p>
As slavery was in the years before the Civil War, abortion is
a defining moral question.  The issue &quot;that will not go away&quot; 
is once again on the front burner of public debate.  Interestingly enough,
while talk grows among some leading conservatives about the circumstances
under which they could endorse &quot;pro-choice&quot; politicians, several 
leading liberal publications are giving space to the weightiest arguments 
against abortion on demand.
<p>
<center><h3>Facing Reality</h3></center>
<p>
The cover story in September's <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> is devoted to
abortion.  Prof. George McKenna of the City College of New York writes 
of the inescapable parallels between the pro-slavery and 
pro-abortion movements, including their rhetoric of &quot;privacy,&quot;
&quot;choice,&quot; and the insistence that &quot;religion&quot; should 
not interfere in the controversy. McKenna argues that abortion opponents
should adopt a &quot;Lincolnian&quot; position designed not to
outlaw abortion immediately through legislation, but to restrict it while 
galvanizing public opinion against the practice.
<p>
Naomi Wolf, an avowed feminist, writes in an Oct. 16 <i>New Republic</i>
article entitled &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; that the feminist 
movement errs when it fails to acknowledge that abortion is an 
&quot;evil,&quot; that it kills &quot;children&quot; and traumatizes many 
women. While Wolf does not abandon her &quot;pro-choice&quot; position, 
she does urge defenders of abortion to embrace a &quot;moral framework&quot; 
that mourns the loss of the aborted child.
<p>
To these ripples must be added the wave caused by the partial
conversion of Norma McCorvey to the anti-abortion cause.  McCorvey, 
the &quot;Jane Roe&quot; of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, recently abandoned the
pro-abortion camp and was baptized a Christian.  In an interview
on <i>ABC News</i>, she cited the grief that overwhelmed her when she 
saw &quot;empty swings&quot; in a park and thought of the children
whose deaths by abortion she had helped to cause.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"ABORTION IS A DEFINING<br>
MORAL QUESTION . . ."</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Taking Action</h3></center>
<p>
While the public debate takes new turns, Congress has begun to
take forthright action to restrict abortion.  The House of 
Representatives voted in August to ensure that no federal health monies
would be denied to medical schools that refuse to abide by the
new abortion training mandate from the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education. The House also reinstated a
stronger version of the Hyde Amendment limiting federal abortion
funding.  Both of these amendments, plus a ban on federally supported 
human embryo research, were attached to the 1996 Labor, Health and 
Human Services appropriation bill.
<p>
Perhaps the most important measure right now is the Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 1833), cosponsored by 152 members of Congress, 
including 25 Democrats. A &quot;partial birth&quot; abortion is
a technique used to kill babies in the second or third trimester.
 It involves deliberately breech-delivering the baby alive until only 
his/her head remains in the mother's uterus while the rest of the
body protrudes into the birth canal.  The abortionist then jabs
surgical scissors into the base of the
baby's skull, opens the scissors to widen the cavity, then uses
a vacuum catheter to suction out the
brain.  Delivery of the now-dead baby with its collapsed skull
completes the procedure. A vote in the full House -- an historic 
moment in the rejuvenated national abortion debate -- is imminent.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Time is short.  Call 202-225-3121.  Urge your representative to
vote for H.R. 1833, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.  At the same 
time, urge him or her to stand fast for the pro-life House
positions in the 1996 Labor, Health, and Human Services bill.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="tax>
<b>Families First.</b>  The long struggle to provide tax relief for America's
families took a big step forward as the Senate Finance Committee approved 
a permanent $500 per-child tax credit on Oct. 19.  Marriage penalty relief, 
expanded individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and adoption tax
credits were also included.  Since the House has already approved
an even larger tax relief package with similar provisions, it appears that 
Congress will soon put family tax relief on the President's desk.  White 
House officials continue to threaten a Presidential veto.
<p>
<b>Careering.</b>  Hasty politicking on job training bills has both houses
talking dollars but not sense. The Careers Bill (H.R. 1617) and the 
Workforce Development Act (S. 143) streamline federal job
training programs but fail to uproot elements of Goals 2000 and
the School-to-Work initiative, with its central economic planning features. 
Congressmen are playing right into this agenda by
mandating data collection for a vast Labor Market Information
System, and promoting the National Skill Standards Board.  H.R. 1617 and 
S. 143 passed in their respective houses and passage in some form now 
seems certain.
<p>
<b>Back from the Brink.</b>  According to the 1995 Trustees Report, Medicare
will be bankrupt by the year 2002 unless major reforms are enacted.  
The full House approved reforms on Oct. 19 which 
introduce competition and choice into the failing Medicare system.
 In addition to capping the growth in Medicare spending, Medisave 
accounts for seniors -- similar to those proposed for
working families in Rep. Bill Archer's (R-Tex.) H.R. 1818 -- would
be established.  These accounts would allow seniors to choose their 
own doctors and pay for services not covered by a
traditional insurance plan (i.e., prescription drugs or long-term
care premiums).
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Red-blooded Change.</b>  For years, the American Red Cross has produced
AIDS materials full of misinformation.  Condoms have been emphasized 
instead of behavioral change.  Recently, however, Red Cross officials 
reversed course, calling for abstinence, HIV testing, partner notification,
and discouragement of  illegal behavior.  The largest federally-funded
AIDS education group, Red Cross still has a ways to go, however, since 
it still uses a &quot;nonjudgmental approach to HIV/AIDS 
education&quot; for youth, omitting the terms &quot;husbands&quot;
and &quot;wives&quot; in favor of  &quot;partners&quot; and
portraying homosexuality as no different from heterosexuality.
<p>
<b>Teen Trends.</b> New studies from the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) find that: 1) births to teenage mothers declined by 4 percent 
from 1991-1993; 2) teen pregnancy rates (including both
births and abortions) were down in a majority of states; and 3)
after 50 years of increases, birth
rates among unwed women of all ages have leveled off for three
years at 45.3 per 1,000 unmarried women.  These encouraging figures 
coincide with an increase in both abstinent teenagers and in states 
adopting legislation encouraging abstinence education.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Out of Control.</b> The large volume of calls from indignant parents
and teachers to the National Education Association (NEA) indicate the union 
went too far when it decided to promote the 
&quot;celebration of a Lesbian and Gay History Month&quot; endorsed
by homosexual groups and the American Historical Association.  At 
least one of the groups promoting the October observance
seems ready to admit defeat.  The president of the Gay, Lesbian,
and Straight Teachers Network told an <i>Education Week</i> reporter 
that the conservative reaction was &quot;beyond our control.&quot; 
<p>
<b>Capping Debate.</b> When members of the House and Senate meet soon
to strike agreements on a welfare reform bill, the defining issue will 
be the family cap. If passed, the cap would deny a
federally-funded increase in cash benefits to mothers who bear
additional children while on welfare.  While modest in scope, the 
cap is a critical first step in a larger effort to renew personal
responsibility.  Massachusetts recently went further by introducing
the first legislation in the nation that would terminate cash payments 
to unwed teenage mothers.
<p><a name="poll">
<b>FRC Survey.</b>  FRC's fourth annual Family Issues Survey, to be released
in late November, shows that most Americans (66 percent) believe &quot;things 
have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track&quot; -- compared 
to 21 percent who feel that things in America are on the
&quot;right track.&quot;  High &quot;wrong-track&quot;
perceptions usually reflect economic problems, and, indeed, a
new Census Bureau study shows that middle-class incomes showed no 
gains last year.  Earnings for full-time workers actually
dropped.  However, FRC's poll also shows that the majority (61
percent) of those who think the country is on the wrong track cite 
&quot;the breakdown of the family and a decline in values&quot; rather
than U.S. economic problems.

<p>
<h3>Colorado Ambush?</h3>
<p>
Oral argument was held Oct. 10 in the U.S. Supreme Court over
Colorado's Amendment Two.  A decision is expected in early spring.  At 
issue is the voter-approved referendum amending Colorado's state 
constitution so that homosexuals do not qualify for special rights. 
The measure invalidates special homosexual rights laws in several cities,
including Aspen, Boulder and Denver, but was struck down by Colorado's 
liberal state supreme court.
<p>
Amendment Two was initiated by Coloradans who perceived that homosexual
rights laws threaten their freedoms of religion, association and speech, 
as well as economic liberties.  For example, Boy Scout programs have 
been attacked in many places where &quot;gay rights&quot; laws are in
effect.
<p>
If the tone of the questioning by justices was any indication,
the Amendment could be in for a rough ride.  Led by Clinton appointees 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, six justices asked questions 
that seemed hostile.  Only Justice Antonin Scalia vigorously defended 
the law, arguing that the people of Colorado do not discriminate merely
by approving limits on special rights for particular groups -- 
particularly those which are not bona fide minorities. Scalia noted
that many states prohibit bigamy and homosexual conduct.  If these
laws are constitutional, he asked, then why can't Colorado bar special 
status for sexual orientation?
<p>
Justice Ginsburg answered that Colorado repealed sodomy laws in
1972, and that passage of the Amendment constituted a denial of 
homosexuals' access to the political process.  Scalia said,
however, that if that logic is applied, then all groups disadvantaged
by state laws, including smokers, have suffered unconstitutional 
discrimination.
<p>
Oral arguments do not dictate how a case will be decided, but
the hearing showed just how liberal the court remains in some crucial areas. 
Family Research Council filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief warning that delicate matters are best resolved through
laws that reflect bedrock cultural values.  Drafted by attorney 
Melissa Wells-Petry, who has written widely in support of the
military's ban on homosexuals, the brief warns that a reversal
of Amendment Two would constitute as large and destructive a judicial 
power grab as occurred in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> (1973).

<p>
<h3>Kinsey Breakthrough</h3>
<p>
Answering charges raised by FRC's new video, <i>The Children of 
Table 34</i>, Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft told the 
<i>Indianapolis Star</i> (Sept. 19) that he believes the child sex data 
in the famous Kinsey Report from the 1940s was the work of one pedophile.
This account contradicts that of Alfred C. Kinsey himself, who wrote in 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> (1948) that explicit sexual 
data on 317 youngsters was collected by nine pedophiles.
<p>
Kinsey's findings continue to be the most influential data on
sex research published in this century.  Because the data have been 
used to validate the idea of child sexuality that animates most of
sexology and today's sex education, public illumination of Kinsey's
ethical swamp may lead to educational, legal and scientific reform. 
FRC is pressing Congress for an investigation into the
Kinsey Institute's child sexuality files, whose existence Dr.
Bancroft has now confirmed.  First
questions:  Who was the aforementioned pedophile and how did he
get access to hundreds of children, including infants?  Dr. Judith 
Reisman, who first explored the Kinsey child data in a 1981 monograph, 
and later in the 1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>
with co-author Edward Eichel and editors Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. 
John H. Court, says she is encouraged that the 50-year-old mystery 
might finally be solved.
<P>
Meanwhile, FRC is appealing the Public Broadcasting Service's
rejection of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> for airing. PBS 
designates June as Gay Pride Month and, in mid-October, began 
running a four-part series celebrating homosexual activism.  This
same PBS says that the FRC video presents a &quot;conflict&quot; 
because FRC, as a pro-family group, has an interest in the material. 
Presumably, the &quot;conflict&quot; is that the film accords with
FRC's stated aim of protecting children from sexual abuse.
<p>
The Kinsey Institute is still a heavy recipient of taxpayer money
through its connection with Indiana University.  Kinsey's work and 
continuing influence are long overdue for public scrutiny.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>FRC Goes to the Wire</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>R</font>ecently I ran into Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania after a lunch in the Senate Dining Room in the U.S. Capitol. 
Many times the senator and I have taken debater's chairs opposite each 
other, even discussing some of our differences on national television.
<p>
&quot;You're the only one who will debate with me about abortion,&quot;
he told me and joked that we should take our &quot;act&quot; on the road.
It has been a privilege for me to talk about social issues on
behalf of the many people who support the Family Research Council. Every 
day, reporters from organizations such as <i>The New York Times</i>, 
<i>The Washington Post</i> and the nightly news shows call us
at FRC for our -- and what we hope is your -- perspective.  But usually 
an hour-long conversation with a reporter becomes a 10-second soundbite 
on the network news or less than an inch of copy at the bottom of a 
two-column story.
<p>
Not any longer.  Our dream of providing a pro-family voice is
much bigger than merely building a conservative &quot;speed bump&quot; 
in a vast terrain of liberal reporting. That is why we are about to
premiere our own television show.  Our vision is to help a national
audience understand not only what we believe but why we support the kind 
of pro-family reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is 
to make a connection with even more of those millions of Americans
who go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world
their children are inheriting.
<p>
Beginning Wednesday, Nov. 1, &quot;Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council&quot; will air at 8 p.m. on the new cable network 
National Empowerment Television (NET). We will be coming to
you on a weekly basis thereafter.
<p>
The show includes such segments as &quot;Behind the Headlines,&quot;
an insider's look at what is happening to the family in Washington, 
and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; which will highlight what FRC
has been doing to bolster the family.  The majority of our show,
however, will be fast-paced discussions of the answers pro-family 
advocates offer to the tough social questions we face today.
<p>
We believe &quot;Straight Talk&quot; has the potential to break
out of the 10-second soundbite box that conservatives usually occupy 
on television.  Family issues deserve in-depth treatment.  Most of
all, we hope to provide you with the kind of informative discussion
that will help you in your own understanding of the state of the 
family today -- in politics, in society, and beyond.
<p>
This is an exciting new venture for FRC.  NET now reaches into
more than 11 million homes and is growing daily. &quot;Straight Talk&quot; 
is an important addition to the network's menu.  We invite you to
watch and share your comments with us as the show unfolds.
<p>
Here's thanking you in advance for the kind of support that has
made &quot;Straight Talk&quot; possible.

<h4>Lobbying Reform</h4></center>
<p><hr width=30% size=2><p>
For years, political advocacy groups have taken advantage of the
public purse to finance their agenda.  Groups like Planned Parenthood 
receive millions of federal dollars each year, even as 
they engage in high-powered lobbying and political advocacy.
<p>
During its consideration of a multi-billion dollar appropriations
bill earlier this year, the House of Representatives adopted an 
amendment to prohibit recipients of federal grants from spending any
grant funds on political advocacy.  The amendment, sponsored by
Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), also proposed strict limits on the 
amount of political advocacy a grantee could engage in with
&quot;non-grant&quot; funds.  Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) chairs
a House subcommittee that has held hearings and urged limits on such 
advocacy.
<p>
A coalition of liberal organizations has mounted a fierce campaign
to scuttle lobbying reform. This campaign has stalled the Treasury-Postal 
appropriations bill for several weeks.  The Clinton
Administration is threatening a veto if the Istook-McIntosh provision
is included in the final bill. The issue is likely to come to a head in 
mid-November.
<p>
<b>Action Item:</b> Call your congressman and senators today.  Tell
them it is time for genuine reform of the congressional spending process. 
A vital first step is to end &quot;welfare&quot; for lobbyists.

To help politicians summon the courage to scale back the role
of government in American life, FRC will host a one-day symposium 
on Dec. 13 in Washington, D.C. The topic will be government's 
contribution to cultural decay.  The conference will launch a new 
initiative to cultivate charitable alternatives to the welfare state. 
Under the leadership of Forest Thigpen, the Mississippi Family Council 
recently hosted a similar event, entitled &quot;Leading People Out of 
Poverty,&quot; that attracted some of the nation's leading authorities 
on reform. To order tapes, contact the Mississippi Family Council at

<title>Breaking the Telecom Logjam -- PFF</title>

</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<P>

<h2>Breaking the Telecom Logjam
</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/director.html">G.A. Keyworth, II</a>
<P>
	As the House and Senate Conferees resolve the differences in the telecom bills passed by their respective bodies, they should keep one imperative in mind: "It's time to break the telecom logjam."  For the average American  these bills have undoubtedly gotten lost in a confusing swirl of competing claims and counterclaims about whether the bills will foster or undercut telephone competition.  Of late, the public discourse has been further confused by Clinton Administration contentions that the telecom bills would lead to undue media concentration and price gouging by cable TV companies.
<P>
	While widespread disaffection with this process would be understandable, a "pox on both your houses" attitude is a mistake.  The stakes for American consumers and workers in reforming telecom policy are immense.
<P>
	Starting in the mid-1970s Congress has time and again considered telecom legislation only to see the process stumble, stall and fail.  In this vacuum, the antitrust divestiture court, Federal Communications Commission, and the 50 states have set telecom policy.  At the national level, pro-competition policies were promoted by the divestiture court and the FCC.  Competition in the long distance, telephone equipment, and information services markets has flourished.  While some states have begun to open local telecom markets to competition, Congress now has a unique opportunity to jump-start this process by preempting state and local entry barriers and liberalizing related long distance, cable and broadcast regulation.  Congressional action would free up this dynamic sector and assure that the competitive process evolves naturally and produces a myriad of new digital services at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
	The importance of these coming contests is underscored by the many impressive preparations the combatants are undertaking to ready themselves to compete.  Most notable is AT&T's recent announcement that it will divest its network equipment business.  This second divestiture by AT&T will free it of any business conflicts with the Baby Bells who buy a lot of network equipment as it begins to compete in local telephone markets.  AT&T also has acquired McCaw Cellular, the largest independent cellular company, giving it the "wireless" capacity to compete with local telephone companies.  Also, a  consortia of cable companies and Sprint made winning bids of more than $2 billion in recent FCC auctions for wireless frequencies.  Finally, Hughes Satellite, Hubbard Broadcasting, Motorola and others have or will be embarking on satellite strategies.  These developments represent only a glimmer of the competitive energies that these telecom bills are about to unleash.
<P>
	The Clinton Administration and others claim that  passage of these bills would be a mistake.  They contend the bills will permit undue media concentration, lead to higher cable TV rates, and insufficiently guard against abuse by the Baby Bells of their local telephone monopoly.  These objections are either misplaced or can be worked out.
<P>
	The bills will not permit undue media concentration for two reasons.  First, all significant media mergers would still have to pass antitrust review.  Second, the radio and television markets (where the critics are most concerned) have seen hundreds of new stations come on line in the past five years, have low levels of concentration and face powerful challenges from competitors offering hundreds of channels, such as direct broadcast TV satellites (DBS), cable TV systems and telephone "video on demand" systems.
<P>
	Likewise, intrusive cable rate regulation is no longer productive.  Aside from the fact that cable faces competition from broadcast and DBS, cable regulation has simply not worked well.  It has been difficult for regulators to regulate cable systems, because cable prices are only one of several variables within the cable operator's control.  As a result cable rate regulation has likely led cable operators to reduce programming investment and quite possibly explains the failure of  the cable-telephone mega-mergers announced in 1993.
<P>
	The competitive issues implicated by the dispute between the local and long distance companies are admittedly more complex.  As much as we can be hopeful that local competition will flourish in most areas for most Americans, we are not there yet.  What preconditions the Baby Bell companies should meet before being allowed to enter the long distance market is something over which reasonable Nobel Laureates can disagree.  The House and Senate proposals are reasonable ones, though, and the time has come for the legislative leaders and President to cut the Gordian knot.
<P>
	These bills are not perfect by any means.  For example, they duck the important issues of reducing residential phone subsidies and freeing up radio spectrum use.  A Progress & Freedom Foundation study recommended these reforms as part of a fundamental reform package which would replace the Federal Communication Commission and rely even more on market forces.  These and other legislative improvements will have to await a "second" bite of the apple.
<P>
	Finally, there is no denying that these complicated bills evidence a lot of  "sausage-making."  Nonetheless, they replace a smorgasbord of federal law, FCC rules, divestiture court jurisprudence and state regulation.  In so doing, the telecom legislation would open local telephone markets to competition from long distance and cable TV companies, open the long distance market to competition from the Baby Bells, and open cable TV markets to competition from the local telephone company.  While many important issues would be left to the FCC and state regulators, reform along the lines of the bills would constitute a "great competitive leap forward."

<h2>When Will Government Be Back in Business?</h2>

<hr size="4" width ="65%"><p>
</center>





After much talk and fanfare, the "<a href="/townhall/spotlights/9-18-95/welcome.html.cgi">train wreck</a>" is upon us and the Federal government has closed  (has anyone noticed?).  What that really means is that as of noon today (11/14/95), all nonessential services were stopped .  Which makes us ask, if some services are nonessential, why are taxpayers paying for them?<p> 

Never wanting to miss an opportunity to give away T-shirts to our users, weve' come up with a little contest.  When do you think the government will be reopened?  The rules are simple.  If you correctly guess the day and time at which the President signs the reconciliation bill, you will be eligible to win one of our fine shirts. 
<p>
The person who guesses correctly, or comes the closest, will be the winner.  If two or more get the day and time right, the recipient will be randomly selected from a pool made up of those who guessed correctly.  All submissions sent after the announcement of an agreement between the Congress and the President will not be eligible.  Remember, only one guess per person.
<p>
Let us know what you think about the closing of the Federal government.  Depending on ones political outlook, this is 
 either a disaster or a godsend.  One thing is sure, commuting into our Capitol Hill offices will be much easier as
long as this situation continues.

<title>Commerce Department Funds Blatant Lobbying -- Heritage</title>

<center>											18 USC 1913</center>
<p>
Opponents of the effort to end 40 years of political corruption manifested in a system of taxpayer-subsidized lobbying often state that existing federal law already prohibits using grant funds for advocacy.  They cite the above section of the U.S. Code to defend this view.
<p>
	It appears, however, that the law is irrelevant.  In recent weeks, the Department of Commerce has provided $200,000 to HandsNet, Inc., a California group which operates an online computer service focused on lobbying and available on the Internet.  According to its own Internet-based documents, HandsNet links "5,000 public interest and human service organizations across the United States."  Among the services offered: "the latest Action Alerts."
<p>
	A description of the grant award1 prepared by the grant provider, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (part of the Commerce Department), specifically mentions that the grant will allow "National organizations [to] help local ones keep up to date by publicizing action alerts...."  A recent selection of alerts includes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>"Istook Amendment--Call Your Representatives 10/30/95"</b><br>
"Now is the time to turn up the heat.... So Call, E-Mail, or Fax Your Representative Today!"
<p>
<li><b>"Give President Clinton a Wake-Up Call"</b><br>
"If President Clinton signs immoral welfare and Medicaid 'reform' bills, the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for children will be destroyed."
<p>
<li><b>"Stop English-only Proposals in Congress 10/24/95"</b><br>
"Call and write to your Representative and Senator. Ask to meet with them directly."
<p>
<li><b>"Congress Yields To Traditional Values Coalition"</b><br>
"The hearing, dubbed 'Parental Involvement in Social Issues in Education'...is likely to become a tax-funded platform for gay bashing."
</ul><p>
Each of the alerts is supported by information to describe what action needs to be taken and what arguments can be used to lobby Congress most effectively.

<p>

<b>About the Grant to HandsNet</b>
<p>
	The $200,000 awarded to HandsNet, Inc., of California was to be used for the nationwide training of public interest organizations on how to use the Internet more effectively. The NTIA award summary states that HandsNet "will train 250 organizations in Internet skills, so that they can publish information on the new system."	In addition, HandsNet will "conduct a national outreach campaign" to introduce human services groups to the Internet.
<p>
	The major component of the grant appears to be a new training center in Washington, D.C. The center will be fully functional around January 1, 1996, according to HandsNet documents, but is housed temporarily at the headquarters of Families USA (funder of the 1994 Clinton health care bus caravans).  The national center will be operated in conjunction with the Institute for Global Communications, also of California.
<p>
<b>About HandsNet</b>
<p>
	In reviewing the HandsNet site on the Internet, it appears that its principal purpose is explicit political advocacy.  The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, among many other issues.  The three key information components provided are Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest (a summary of the alerts), and daily updates on key issues.  According to its Internet site, HandsNet is affiliated with the Institute for Global Communications, an arm of the Tides Foundation.  Members of HandsNet include the major opponents of the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort, including OMB Watch and the Alliance for Justice.
<p>
<b>About the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure 
Assistance Program (TIIAP)</b>
<p>
	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program is operated by NTIA in the Commerce Department.  Under the Clinton Administration, this program has mushroomed in cost, from $10 million in FY 1994 to $25 million in FY 1995.  In 1994 there were 92 grants; in the most recent round (to be announced in mid-November, but already awarded), there are 120.  There also are indications that the TIIAP may subsidize other lobbying activities, in addition to those of HandsNet, Inc.
<p>
	According to NTIA documents, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America received $300,000 in 1994 to set up a "nationwide on-line information system" for itself and all 164 affiliates.  Also in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet received funding to "establish a network of regional field representatives" and "demonstrate a model for building a national grassroots information system," among other things.
<p>
	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, ACORN (which led noisy demonstrations in Congress earlier this year), the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Citizens Fund (an affiliate of Citizen Action, an active grassroots lobbying organization).  It is unclear which, if any, will receive funding.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Commerce Department, through NTIA, has awarded a grant to an online lobbying organization for the specific purpose of engaging more groups in its Internet advocacy efforts.  The $200,000 gift to HandsNet, Inc., to train people in the publishing of action alerts and other lobbying materials represents a blatant misuse of taxpayer funds.
<P>
	Supporters of taxpayer-funded political patronage argue that the current system is designed to prevent abuses.  The case of the Commerce Department and HandsNet, Inc., provides a serious test of this claim. The fact that such a significant grant could be made with no effort to hide the fact that it directly funds lobbying activities clearly demonstrates the need for Congress to reform this costly and irresponsible form of political corruption.

<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the budget reconciliation</a></center>
<P>
<P>
The much-touted "train wreck" has been averted with the adoption of continuing resolutions.  The House and Senate have passed their versions of the budget.  Now members from each house must meet to iron out a final package to send to President Clinton.
<P>
Both the House and Senate versions of the budget reduce the government's burden on citizens and introduce better incentives for savings and investment.  President Clinton has vowed to veto any budget that closely resembles those passed in the houses of Congress; some Republicans are in favor of allowing the budget ceiling to expire if Clinton refuses to move to the right.  Who will flinch first?  The political manuevering is bound to be exciting!  
<P>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the final phase of the budget process:  conference.
<P>
On Monday, get a refresher on the budget process and what "conference" is.  You'll also be able to see our national debt, updated continuously, as well as review, line-by-line, last year's budget.  On Tuesday, we take a break from our budget coverage to bring you an election-day special.  On Wednesday our budget battle coverage resumes with links to and analysis of the two versions of this year's budget.  On Thursday, check out the politics behind the battle.  On Friday, e-mail the Budget Conferees with your opinions!

<title>Where Teachers Send Their Own Children To School -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>WHERE TEACHERS SEND THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO SCHOOL</i></h3>
By Denis Doyle and James Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Business/Education Insider No. 42<br>
October-November 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<blockquote>"If teachers and their organizations reject the institutions they are teaching in and feel free to choose a private alternative, on what basis should other parents, particularly the poor and dispossessed, be denied this option?"</blockquote><p>
  This pointed question was posed by Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Educational Policy, during a recent lecture in Washington on his latest study, which shows where public school teachers send their children to school.
<p>
Drawing on 1990 Census data, Doyle finds that, taken together, public and private school teachers nationwide are only slightly more likely than the general public to choose private schools (17.1 percent to 13.1 percent). But in America's most troubled cities, the pattern is quite different:  Public school teachers are two to three times more likely than the general public to use private schools. For example, in Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of the children of the city's public school teachers who make less than $35,000 attend private school. This is more than double the national average; among public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll some or all of their children in private school. The pattern continues in cities like Boston (24.4 percent), New York (21.4 percent), Miami (35.4 percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). As Doyle observes, "in America's cities, where the schools are arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the institutions in which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools."
<p>
Doyle's study also analyzes the relationship between race and a public school teacher's use of private schools. Doyle finds that, nationally, black public school teachers use private schools more than white public school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and Hispanic public school teachers use private schools more than non-Hispanic public school teachers (16.5 percent to 11.9 percent). Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more likely than nonwhite parents to send their children to private school. In the United States as a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of other races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent of Hispanic parents send their children to private school, while 10.1 percent of all non-Hispanic parents do so.
<p>
Doyle notes that black public school teachers are almost as likely as the public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent compared with 13.1 percent). He concludes that "black teachers who can afford a choice exercise it:  they are 50 percent more likely than black parents in general to enroll their children in private school. This might explain the high support for publicly funded school choice programs among minorities--they are often in the worst school districts and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when they can afford it."
<P>
Doyle says that "teachers--public and private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low income, middle income, and high income--know how to address the nation's education crisis:  they vote with their feet and their pocket books. They choose private schools for their children when they think it serves their interests best."
<p>
"When public-school teachers choose private schools," says Doyle, "the truth is self-evident:  although they work in public schools they choose private schools for their own children because they believe the latter are better. They are connoisseurs."

<p>
<b>WISCONSIN PRIVATE PHILANTHROPISTS SUPPORT CHOICE</b>
<p>
In response to an August 25 Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting the expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) to include religious, independent, and newly founded schools, private citizens in Wisconsin donated more than $1.8 million as of September 22 to help give the children of Milwaukee the right to stay in the schools of their choice. The campaign was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE), Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.8 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $125,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
The Court's August 25 ruling put a stop to the Milwaukee choice expansion program and left more than 2,300 children stranded after they had already signed up for classes in the religious schools of their choice. The state and local teachers' unions, along with the ACLU, backed the lawsuit which resulted in the temporary injunction.
<p>
The case is to be heard soon by the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, and a decision is expected before the end of the year. According to the Landmark Legal Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, which is providing legal support for the children, "the Milwaukee school choice litigation will ultimately result in a major U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing school choice programs that include religious programs."
<p>
<i>Copies of the July 1995 Wisconsin statutes enabling the expansion of Milwaukee's Parental Choice Program to include religious schools and the affidavits filed recently in the Wisconsin Supreme Court are available from the Blum Center for Parental Freedom in Education, Marquette University, PO Box 1881, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881.</i>
<p>
<b>HIGH MARKS FOR WISCONSIN SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b>
<p>
In a related development, Family Service America (FSA), the largest international non-profit association dedicated to strengthening family life through education and research, has completed its independent, third-year evaluation of the Partners Advancing Values in Education scholarship program in Milwaukee.
<p>
PAVE is the nation's largest privately funded school choice program. Its design closely resembles Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson's recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which is publicly funded. In the 1994 school year, PAVE provided scholarships to 2,654 low-income students who attended 84 elementary and 13 secondary private or parochial schools in Milwaukee.
<p>
FSA's first-year evaluation of the program reported high levels of parent satisfaction (96 percent) and involvement (97 percent) among the 960 (63 percent) families who completed a survey. The second-year evaluation investigated seventh graders' academic achievement and reported that PAVE students scored higher in reading and math than did representative samples from Milwaukee public schools.
<p>
The purpose of the third-year evaluation was to determine whether parental satisfaction and involvement were consistent over the three years of PAVE's scholarship program for low-income families in Milwaukee.
<p>
<b>Findings of the third-year evaluation:</b>
<p>
"The overwhelming majority of parents were satisfied with the performance of the schools."  The responses indicated the following levels of satisfaction:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>96 percent</b> with the teacher's performance,
<li><b>94 percent</b> with the principal's performance,
<li><b>92 percent</b> with the discipline of the school,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with the program of instruction,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with textbooks,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with amount child learned,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with opportunities for parental involvement, and 
<li><b>97 percent</b> with school location.
</ul><P>
Some 92 percent of respondents rated their school "A" or "B."  Almost twice as many parents in each category were "very satisfied" rather than "satisfied."  And according to the study, parents became significantly involved in the schools of their choice:  96 percent attended parent-teacher conferences.

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON UPDATE</b>
<p>
<b>AmeriCorps</b>
<p>
Backed by an unfavorable report from the General Accounting Office (GAO), the nonpartisan investigative arm of the national legislature, Congress is trying to end what critics call one of the federal government's largest boondoggles:  AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House took the first step by voting to end funding for this high-priced program. The Senate, in  a 52 to 47 vote, followed suit on September 26. If enacted as part of the budget, this change would save the American taxpayers $575 million in FY 1996.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration and its supporters hail AmeriCorps as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, opponents say it has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project.
<p>
The August GAO report found that the new Clinton program cost $26,654 per participant to run, or more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. Some 93 percent of the funding for the program comes out of taxpayers' pockets.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) argues that in an era of budget deficits, the Administration was asking the American taxpayer to fund bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts. Grassley also claims that the program does little to help American families pay for college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, and removes participants from the local communities where they are needed most. Indications that AmeriCorps improperly funds political activities sealed the program's fate in the Senate's debate.

<b>Direct Lending</b>
<p>
Congress is debating the future of President Clinton's direct lending program for student loans.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans, the evidence suggests otherwise. The direct government lending program appears to be bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. 
<p>
The Senate has recommended an appropriation of $378 million for FY 1996. While this is $94.4 million more than the 1995 amount, it is $172 million less than the Administration's request. This has the effect of capping the program at 20 percent. The House has voted to zero out the program.
<P>
<b>Question of Cost.</b> Much of the congressional debate over direct loans turns on the crucial question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initially estimated it could save $4.3 billion over five years. But this estimate ignored the long-term costs. The FY 1996 budget resolution amends the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. 
<p>
A revised CBO report, released in July and based on changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save only $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program entirely while maintaining a guaranteed loan program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years. According to Representative Bill Goodling (R-PA), the guaranteed loan program is "one of the most successful" public-private sector partnerships.
<p>
The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided through private institutions. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money needed to provide capital for the loans. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year. According to Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to direct loans could add up to $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.
<p>
<b>Army of New Employees.</b> The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to handle the new program. The agency is hiring 600 new employees to administer the Clinton program and anticipates needing another 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational -- if Congress changes its mind and funds the program.
<p>
There are other worries about the direct lending program. Currently, some 75 percent of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government. If the federal government takes complete control of the loan program, colleges and universities in effect will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. The Department's power to control loan revenue, along with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. Such financial power could provide the federal government an opportunity to influence or force curriculum changes, or to mandate such things as politically correct "diversity standards."
<p>
Today's guaranteed loan program is by no means perfect. Taxpayers still bear all the risk. But there have been several recent improvements in the program. For example, the loan application process has become simpler in recent years. The default rate also has been cut significantly.
<p>
There is little support for a government takeover of the guaranteed lending program. According to a nationwide poll of 1,000 respondents, 72 percent of Americans believe student loans should continue to be offered through private financial institutions, not the federal government. Congress would better serve both the students and the universities of America by eliminating the direct lending program and allowing the more economical and guaranteed lending program to provide the money to students.

<title>Time To Enact Real Enterprise Zones -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO ENACT REAL ENTERPRISE ZONES</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 438<br>
October 24, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
There is a genuine and urgent desire in Washington to trigger an economic rebirth of America's inner cities. But two rival proposals to help achieve that goal are the products of two profoundly different visions of how to generate economic development within inner-city America. One vision, which is the basis for an initiative being prepared by the Clinton Administration, assumes that progress can be achieved only if government leads the process of development and primes the economic pump. It calls, in effect, for an urban industrial policy managed from Washington. The other vision, which forms the core of bipartisan legislation intended as an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill, recognizes that the wise approach is not to try to pick winners and losers, but instead to provide the best possible climate of incentives and simplified regulation to foster local enterprises.
<p>
The White House view is that depressed neighborhoods can best be helped by steering more government programs into them. The Clinton Administration is readying a plan to do this by giving preferential treatment in awarding government contracts to firms operating in troubled neighborhoods. This initiative flows from the Administration's "Enterprise Zone" program, enacted in the last Congress, which centered on channeling government programs into targeted areas. The name given to that government-led program was particularly ironic since the original enterprise zone idea, developed in the 1980s, explicitly rejected the notion that government could trigger an economic recovery in the inner cities and called instead for a sharp reduction in regulation and taxes to spur business formation. That earlier version was not enacted.
<p>
A very different view of urban economic development is enshrined in bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate recently. The sponsors intend it as an amendment to the upcoming reconciliation bill.
<p>
The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act (S. 1252) is sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). Cosponsors include Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), John Breaux (D-LA), and Michael DeWine (R-OH.) The legislation would refocus and strengthen the Administration's enterprise zone program, based on a view of how to stimulate economic development in depressed neighborhoods that is very different from that held by the White House. Rather than have the government try to pick firms for preference in federal contracts, the Abraham-Lieberman bill seeks to make existing enterprise zones much more attractive to private investors. It would do this by eliminating the capital gains tax on investments in stock, business property, or a partnership in the zones, as well as by providing other tax incentives for direct investments and business redevelopment within the zones. The government would not limit these incentives to selected private investors or firms.
<p>
This approach understands that private investors are more likely than government officials to identify the entrepreneurs that can be the engines of economic development in depressed neighborhoods. It also recognizes that one of the main obstacles to business creation in these areas, particularly for small new firms, is the difficulty of attracting start-up and working capital. For small new enterprises, capital typically is obtained from  personal savings or private investors, not from the government--or even banks. That is why the capital gains tax exemption and other investor incentives in the Abraham-Lieberman bill are so important. As Senator Lieberman put it in a 1993 floor statement criticizing the lack of such incentives in the Clinton enterprise zone legislation, "Capital incentives are important because they are the one way... in which the government, with a small  expenditure, by reducing taxes, can draw in a large amount of private capital."
<p>
Stimulating a flow of private investor capital also recognizes that the firms most likely to succeed in a blighted area probably will not attract the attention of government. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise for several years has been drawing public attention to the remarkable economic successes of locally generated inner-city enterprises in the most unlikely situations. Most of these enterprises would not qualify for a government contract or grant even if they sought it. But with the incentives of the Abraham-Lieberman bill, they are exactly the kind of innovative, upstart firms that would be sought out by risk-taking small investors.
<p>
These firms in the inner city also would be helped by another feature of the bill intended to remove some of the obstacles that add to the cost and frustrations of starting an enterprise. Within the enhanced enterprise zones, local governments could request waivers from federal regulations (other than civil rights, public safety, and similar rules) that hinder economic development. This is important because federal rules often unintentionally stymie economic and social improvement in depressed areas. For instance, restrictions on business activity in public housing projects in the past have blocked the creation of tenant businesses to provide child care, transportation, or other services that would make it easier for residents to become employed. Realizing the barriers posed by well-intentioned regulations that ignore practicality, many state and local governments have taken steps to simplify or pare back their own rules. The Abraham-Lieberman bill would require the federal government to do likewise in the zones.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation would take the first steps to help stabilize depressed areas in two other crucial ways. First, it would foster home ownership within enterprise zones. Based on proposals first developed by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the legislation would provide incentives and grants to encourage resident management and ownership of public housing and the ownership of vacant property. Experience has shown that resident management and home ownership encourage the sense of long-term commitment among the residents of a neighborhood that is so crucial to establishing a favorable climate for enterprise.
<p>
Second, the bill would give some financial help to low-income parents wishing to obtain a better education for their children by choosing an alternative public or private school. Though the provision is modest, it indicates that the sponsors appreciate that improving the climate for education, as well as for business and home ownership, is crucial to achieving the economic turnaround of inner-city America.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation brings together a surprising group of bipartisan co-sponsors. They are united behind an approach to urban improvement that recognizes the failures of government-led economic development and the need instead to create a positive climate for investing in small local enterprises. If Congress is to play its proper role in reviving the inner cities, and the hopes of those who live there, the first step would be to include the Abraham-Lieberman legislation in the budget reconciliation bill.

<h2>AmeriCorps</h2>
<b>Testimony by Arianna Huffington <br>
To<br> The Subcommittee On Oversight And Investigations<p>
</b><p>
OCTOBER 17, 1995<P>
Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today.  I wish to speak about the difference between true volunteerism and paid "volunteerism," between the effective compassion that can come only from individuals, and the compulsory compassion of the bureaucratic welfare state.  I think that this is an important distinction to make, particularly here in Washington.  After all, only in Washington could you find someone who could miss the irony of paying someone for so-called "volunteer" work.  But I imagine you've heard a lot about that today.
<P>
I also wish to speak about the work we are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion that I have co-founded with Professor Marvin Olasky, and of the work that hundreds of  thousands of Americans are doing around the country everyday to help those most in need.   It is my unequivocal conclusion that Americorps, both as a reality and as a symbol, is hurting the work that has to be done if we are to solve the major social problems facing us.  It's hurting in three fundamental ways:
<P><OL>
<LI>It contradicts the basic religious and philosophical teachings about human nature, according to which human beings have an instinctive propensity to reach out and  help others.  This instinct -- which, in my latest book, I call the fourth instinct -- is competing with other, more self-interested instincts, but as a culture we need to do everything we can to strengthen the instinct that makes us part of a healthy community.  Americorps, by paying people to "volunteer" -- by paying them to do what should be done naturally as part of our learning to live and care for each other in society -- undermines that most important instinct in human beings.  
<LI>Americorps, in its small but significant way, like Great Society programs, in their all-pervasive way, cheats people out of the character-building rewards of giving.  We build up our moral muscle by exercising it.  We become virtuous by the practice of virtue, responsible by the practice of responsibility, generous by the practice of generosity, and compassionate by the practice of compassion.  And all these traits are being practiced because that's how we become fully human, not because we are being paid to practice them. 
<LI>The third, and most immediate, way Americorps undermines the practice of true, effective compassion is by standing in sharp contrast to the hard, unpaid, true volunteer work being done everyday in the trenches around America. What hundreds of thousands of people are doing everyday, Mr. Chairman, is rolling up their sleeves and actually helping to feed, to clothe, and to turn lives around. There was a very moving documentary on PBS last week about little-known, community-based groups working hard at tackling social problems in Anacostia.  How many of these groups are using Americorps volunteers?  Mr. Chairman, if these people were depending on  paid "volunteers" to keep going, they would have closed down long ago.</ol>
<P>Helping those in need is a moral imperative.  It is our responsibility -- our obligation -- and in a completely different realm from getting loans to go to school or money to live on.  These are all important necessities, but when we mix the two together, and, most important, when the mixing is done by the government at taxpayers' expense, something very important is lost -- both for the building of individual character and for the building of healthy communities. 
<P>The people I most admire in this world are volunteering their time everyday without the benefit of any fancy, bureaucratically-run programs.  Not too far from the Capitol, Mr. Chairman, there is Hannah Hawkins, a feisty, no-nonsense lady who runs an after-school program in Anacostia called Children of Mine.  Hannah serves hot meals to kids.  But she gives them much more than that.  She gives them the love and attention that many of them have never received at home.  She also gives them an important gift that government would never give -- Bible lessons, which teach them the difference between right and wrong, and which bring hope and meaning to their lives.  
<P>Also not too far from here are Marsh Ward and Julia Lightfoot, who run 
Clean and Sober Streets,  a safe harbor for drug and alcohol addicts who are trying to put their lives back together.  They give addicts the sort of attention and caring that they have not received before, particularly from government-run institutions
<P>In Denver, there is  Bob Cote, who runs a program called Step 13 in which he tries to help addicts turn their lives around.  Bob, a former addict himself, refers to the government-run programs as "suicide on the installment plan."  Bob's program houses 100 men a night; they are allowed to stay as long as they need to -- as long as they follow the rules, which include doing some kind of work each day as well as staying sober.  Bob's operation costs $300,000 a year, with no help from the government.  Bob estimates that if he were to do what he does now but with government money, it would cost more than $2 million because of all the absurd rules and regulations.  And that doesn't even count for having to pay for volunteers.
<P>In San Antonio, there is the Rev. Freddy Garcia, who runs a program called Victory Outreach, a combination church and halfway house for recovering addicts.  Rev. Garcia's success rate in getting people cleaned up and back on their feet is more than 60 percent.  Recently, the Texas Drug and Alcohol Commission asked Rev. Garcia to stop referring to his work as "drug rehabilitation" because he wasn't conforming with their regulations.
<P>And I could go on and on, Mr. Chairman. You probably haven't seen or heard of any of these people.  And  there's a simple explanation for this, Mr. Chairman: they aren't walking the corridors of Congress asking for government funds to sustain their programs.  And they most certainly do not believe that the best way to help the poor is to convince the government to help them.  Americorps is an affront to the people I mentioned and it is also a hindrance to the work Marvin Olasky and I are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion.  Our aim is nothing less than the transformation of America's efforts to aid those in need, from a bureaucratic, government-centered approach to a community-oriented, people-centered approach. 
<P>We have found plenty of inspiration for our work in American history, going back to the Pilgrims.  When the Pilgrims needed help to survive their first winter at Plymouth Colony, the Indians didn't simply give them a hand-out -- they gave them a hand-up.  Squanto taught them how to plant their corn successfully in New England's difficult soil.
<P>Squanto's act of effective compassion is the origin of Thanksgiving.  The hand-up made a huge difference.  The Indians didn't just run a soup kitchen or donate food to their neighbors; but too often that is what we do today.  The hand-out stems hunger for a while -- the hand-up banishes it forever. 
<P>I do not mean to diminish the effort or goodwill of Americans who will volunteer their time on food lines or organize food drives this Thanksgiving.  They are making a difference and brightening the holiday for many.  But what is needed is their involvement in making a lasting difference, as Squanto did with the Pilgrims.  
<P>Through a national campaign we are launching during Thanksgiving week, we hope to challenge some of our long-held assumptions regarding giving. Our message is simple: For compassion to be effective, it must be personal, challenging, and spiritual.  It does not involve government, and it most certainly does not involve payment for what is a natural duty and responsibility that we need to nurture from the time our children are very young.  I don't want my daughters when they are teenagers to say to me: "Why should I volunteer for free, Mom?  Dick and Jane are getting paid for it!"

<P> 

 
 
<p><li>Politicians mostly circumspect concerning <b>O. J. Simpson's</b> acquittal. Only<b> Pat Buchanan</b> condemned 
verdict. President<b> Bill Clinton</b> issued a statement: ``Our system of justice requires respect for the decision. 
At this moment, our thoughts and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible crime.'' 
<b>Bob Dole's</b> statement told Americans: ``It is very important at this time that we use all our energies to find 
ways to understand each other and bring us together.''<b> Phil Gramm</b> deemed it inappropriate ``for a member 
of the Senate to be commenting on jury trials.'' <b>Colin Powell</b> said that the trial showed that the judicial 
system works and called on the country ``to move on.'' Also for moving on:<b> Lamar Alexander, Jack Kemp.</b> 
Gov. <b>Pete Wilson</b> said he ``would urge the removal of cameras from our courtrooms.''<b> Jesse Jackson</b> urged 
Simpson to lead the fight against domestic violence. . . . Even editorialists declined to judge the jury. New 
York Times faulted the police, prosecution, and Judge<b> Lance Ito</b> for ``bungling,'' and the defense for making 
``a prejudicial appeal,'' but took no position on the verdict. Not going out on a limb: the Washington Post, 
which noted that the acquittal ``stunned and disappointed'' some people but ``satisfied'' others. . . . Coverage 
of O.J. and racial division by the media fueled more talk about Powell. <b>Charles Krauthammer</b> argues that 
though a President Powell would prevent major reform of the welfare state, he would improve race 
relations. 
 
<p><li>White House is in an upbeat mood, buoyed by rising poll ratings and convinced that Republicans will field 
weak candidate next year. Clinton's strategy, which advisor<b> Dick Morris</b> calls ``triangulation,'' seeks to 
position him as a centrist, between congressional Republicans and Democrats.<b> Ann Devroy</b> (Washington 
Post) writes, ``Clinton's message that he is for the popular things Republicans favor -- like a balanced 
budget -- but against the unpopular things they propose -- like cutting Medicare -- is beginning to take.'' . . . 
Not all Democrats enthusiastic about the new strategy. Asked on Meet the Press to choose between Dole 
and Clinton, Sen.<b> Daniel Patrick Moynihan</b> (D., N.Y.) responded, ``I would rather have as President 
someone not running for the Presidency.'' Moynihan has clashed with White House recently over welfare 
and his proposal to save billions by reducing estimates of inflation. . . . Vice President<b> Al Gore</b> calls 
Republicans ``extremists,'' Clinton accuses them of raising taxes (actually Medicare deductibles, college-
loan fees, etc.) on the needy. Attacks led Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole to call off budget talks for now -- 
though Dole jokes that Gore's ``extremist'' talk ``may help me in some of the early primaries.'' . . . More 
tough budget talk from both sides: Clinton declares, ``I would gladly, gladly terminate my tenure here if the 
price of continuing it was just shelving everything I believe in about this country.'' Gramm says, ``He can 
hold us in session until the Second Coming and there is no possibility that I am ever going to spend one 
nickel above the level . . . in our budget.''

<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Million Man March & Affirmative Action</a></center>
<P>
In 1965 President Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, mandating "employers doing business with the federal government to develop affirmative action plans to assure equal employment opportunity in their employment practices."  Affirmative action was born.
<P>
  For thirty years affirmative action laws have been a source of tension between whites and minorities.  Some conservatives have even suggested that the Million Man March was not just a call for African-American solidarity, but also a wake-up call to the nation's leadership to deal with the real anger of African-Americans and redouble their efforts to end the "slavery" of assistance programs like affirmative action that suggest, as Shelby Steele put it, "somehow color, not our hard work, can bring us advancements."
<P>
  On 27 July 1995 Majority Leader and Republican Presidential frontrunner Bob Dole introduced the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, proposing that, "...the federal government should not discriminate against, nor should it grant preferences to, any individual because of that individual's race, color, ethnic background or sex."  Will this be the end of affirmative action and the associated tensions?
<p>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the Million Man March and the issues surrounding affirmative action.
<P>
On Monday, we focus on the Million Man March as a backdrop for our discussion of affirmative action.  On Tuesday, read President Clinton's report on affirmative action as well as some reponses to that report.  On Wednesday read two conservative approaches to restoring equal treatment in employment.  On Thursday, read conservative commentary on the Million Man March and critiques of affirmative action.  On Friday we bring you arguments for the end of "quotas."  
<p>
Please share your opinions with us any day of the week by filling out our affirmative action questionaire.  We hope you find these articles enlightening!

<title>   Testimony of Karen Kerrigan on Spectrum Allocation
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">



<center><h3>Testimony of Karen Kerrigan<BR>
President<BR>
Small Business Survival Committee</h3>

<h4>Before
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
September 12, 1995
<P>
On Spectrum Allocation</h4></center>
<hr>



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
<P>
I am here today representing the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 
member nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization which fights against the growing burden 
of taxes and regulations on America's small businesses and entrepreneurs -- SBSC supports free 
markets over government industrial policy.  SBSC also spearheads the Campaign for Broadcast 
Competition, a coalition of advocacy organizations opposing the proposed giveaway of the 
spectrum to the nation's broadcasters.   
<P>
I am especially pleased to be here today.  It is not often that one has the opportunity to 
publicly oppose what many have said will be the most expensive case of corporate welfare in the 
history of our Nation.
<P>
I am speaking, of course, about the proposed giveaway of the nation's airwaves to the 
broadcasting industry.  This is the expensive residue of a failed industrial policy, and it can, and 
should be reversed.
<P>
The story starts innocently enough with an "America first" technology program.  It turned 
into an unprecedented government giveaway of taxpayer-owned airwaves.  And, absent 
Congressional action, it will conclude by rewarding an industry which has time and again turned 
its back on its public service obligations.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Communications Commission seven years ago 
pursued a plan to make High Definition Television (HDTV) the broadcasting standard for the 
United States.  As part of that plan, the FCC proposed giving the broadcasters new spectrum to 
allow them to move from analog television to HDTV.  Once HDTV was in place, the theory was, 
the analog spectrum would be returned to the government.<P>
<P>
As is often the case with bureaucrats playing venture capitalists, the market outsmarted 
and surpassed the government's chosen industrial "winner."  In this case, digital technology far 
outstripped the ability of bureaucrats to see into the future, rendering all of this planning for 
HDTV, for all intensive purposes, obsolete.
<P>
With the new digital technology each new digital TV channel can be used for one HDTV 
signal.  Or, it can be split into 6 very high quality digital TV signals.  (In other words  the 
spectrum gift combined with new digital technology now transforms CBS into 6 CBS's; ABC 
into 6 ABC's and so on).
<P>
This free new spectrum need not be used just for television; it will unlock an unlimited 
number of new lucrative businesses for the broadcasters.  The spectrum could be used to provide 
72 digital radio channels, computer data delivery, wireless telephone service, pay TV -- or any 
combination of each of them -- as well as other profitable uses.
<P>
In the face of the new technology, the broadcasters profess a continued commitment to
HDTV and the use of the new Advanced Television (ATV) channels for HDTV. 
<P>                                                                                                    
...Or maybe not.  This year the broadcasters have insisted on receiving the "flexibility" to 
use the spectrum as they see fit.   Broadcasters are actively exploring the opportunities for 
potential new services -- as they should be.  The questions today are:  why are the broadcasters 
the chosen few for the privilege of "spectrum flexibility," and why should they get it for free!
<P>
Now, as the broadcasters freely admit, HDTV is a technological and economic dinosaur.  
They don't want to be shackled to it, nor should they.  There is no market for it, and other digital 
technologies would use the airwaves far more efficiently.
<P>
The broadcasters correctly realize that new digital technology will transform communications as we know it.  And what they want is the valuable distribution pipeline -- the 
spectrum -- with no strings attached.  They clearly do not want it for the purpose for which it was 
intended -- providing HDTV.  They may want it to provide digital television.  But, no one really 
knows, since the technology is changing almost daily.
<P>
But while the broadcasters don't want to be held to the HDTV implementation, they still 
want the additional spectrum -- free of charge.  Why?  Because it is valuable.  If this spectrum 
were auctioned as the PCS spectrum was last year, it could raise between $10 billion and $100 
billion.
<P>
Even in Washington, that's a lot of money.  These market value estimates are not just 
random numbers picked out of  a hat.  Even the FCC conservatively estimates that the spectrum 
is worth between $11 billion and $70 billion.1  <P>In response to questions from the Senate, the FCC has attempted to calculate the potential value of the spectrum.  Within the past few weeks, ITT and Dow Jones paid a whopping $207 million to buy WNYC, New York City's local public UHF station.  The station has few hard assets, no programming appeal -- its new owners are going to switch to commercial programming, with a limited viewership . . . In short, the 26 companies who bid for WNYC wanted to pay big bucks for one thing, its spectrum.
<P>
Based solely on the $207 million paid for WNYC, the FCC valued the spectrum 
potentially at $37 billion.
<P>
"Even" at $37 billion, the figure is more than double the amount this committee needs to 
raise to reach its target in the massive effort to balance the federal budget.  And, the FCC says 
this a conservative estimate.  Some experts estimate that the market value of the digitized spectrum in the not too distant future will reach nearly a half-trillion dollars.
<P>
And the FCC doesn't disagree.2   In a May 5th letter, the FCC said that private market valuation of the spectrum in the future might approach $500 billion.<P>Why this special gift of largesse to the broadcasters?  The proposed giveaway not only flys in the face of efforts to balance the budget but also bucks a profound message that voters sent to Washington last November -- no more coddling of special interests at the expense of other Americans.<P>The giveaway to the broadcasters can't be a reward for the great job they've done serving 
the public good --  as they claim, and as required by their current licenses.  As everyone who has 
a TV knows, and as numerous Congressional hearings this year have shown, the broadcasters 
have done a good job at packing the airwaves with programming that the majority of American 
households find troubling and offensive.
<P>
One media reviewer said that the broadcasters' motto for the upcoming fall lineup must 
be:  "To hell with kids.  Many of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8:00-9:00 pm hour 
have gone to the graveyard, replaced by racier fair. . ."3<P>The news coverage is no better.  The president of NBC's News Division, Andrew Lack, admitted that "too often we now choose, without a moment's hesitation, to report the story that makes you fell repulsion over the story that makes you think -- which in television means usually boring."  Mr. Lack went on to ask his peers:  "And why do we keep pushing it?  Are we all just whores in search of another share point or a better November book?"4 <P>While the broadcasters hide behind their "unique public service" responsibilities as an argument to shield them from a prospective auction of the valuable spectrum; the public, media critiques and now industry insiders question their competency in this regard.<P>Of course, competition in the form of cable, direct broadcast satellite, on-line computer services and more has given consumers added viewing choices.  Broadcasters have not gone the wayside because of this competition.  Their bottom-lines and profits continue to increase.
<P>
The broadcasters plead that to pay for spectrum will kill "free" TV.  But the recent 
purchase prices and bids for the networks prove that investment money is available for those who 
want to have the privilege of providing "free" TV.  Walt Disney, which paid $19.3 billion for 
ABC/Cap Cities obviously sees investment pay-offs.  Westinghouse which offered $5.4 billion 
for CBS appears to view the business as profitable as well.
<P>
In the past year alone, the networks combined revenues were $21.42 billion.  Their 
combined profits were $2.82 billion.   Clearly, broadcasting is more profitable than ever.
<P>
Robert Wright, [president] of NBC, recently told the National Press Club that "right now 
broadcast television -- and NBC -- are both having banner years.  And even more important, the 
fundamentals of the industry are looking strong as well."  Congratulations Mr. Wright.  Keep up 
the good work.  Apparently advertising-supported TV is doing fine, and will continue to profit 
handsomely -- without a big government handout.
<P>
The FCC agrees with Mr. Wright:  over-the-air broadcasting is and will continue to 
thrive.5     In a September letter, the FCC pointed to the ABC, CBS and WNYC deals, and concluded that:  "free over-the-air television is such a lucrative business, there is no reason to believe that either analog or digital broadcasters will cease providing this service."<P>Finally, advertising-supported broadcasting will only go away if its viewership goes 
away.  If the audience is there, advertisers will continue to subsidize what the broadcasters 
modestly call "free" TV by paying for the right to reach viewers.
<P>
The broadcasters also claim that "they" shouldn't be singled our for auctions, and that the 
Commerce Committee should auction the government spectrum first.
<P>
However, as Faye Anderson one of my close colleagues has recently stated, comparing 
the broadcast spectrum to government spectrum is like comparing "pork loin to pig's feet."
<P>
According to Dale Hatfield, a noted spectrum expert and Reagan Administration 
technology official, this is the cleanest spectrum available.  It is beachfront property.  Mr. 
Chairman, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, if you are going to raise money through auctions, you 
must go where the value is.
<P>
More importantly, the broadcasters are not the only users who have been asked to pay for 
the public airwaves.  As the Committee well knows, Congress in 1993 mandated that the FCC  
auction all licenses for new spectrum.  For example, the FCC already has sold only a part of the 
PCS spectrum for $8 billion.  That's $8 billion that went to the US Treasury.
<P>
If they want to play, let's have them pay.  If it is good enough for PCS, it is good enough 
for all the new businesses the broadcasters hope to pursue.
<P>
Now, the broadcasters have two other arguments.  First, they argue that such a large 
auction of spectrum will depress values and thus won't raise much money.  Then, they argue that 
broadcasters couldn't possibly afford the spectrum, and thus couldn't provide digital television.  
Our question is, which one is it?
<P>
Either way, the public wins.  We tend to believe that there will be buyers for this 
spectrum.  The FCC agrees.  With all the possible benefits of digital broadcasting, the FCC 
expects that numerous companies, <u>including the broadcasters</U>, will compete for and likely win many digital licenses.6   In other words, somewhere between here and the auction block, the broadcasters will figure out ways to participate in the bidding process.
<P>
This, of course, begs the question:  is the government and the U.S. taxpayer responsible 
for guaranteeing NBC's long-term success, or any other broadcaster's?  I don't think so.
<P>
One last question:  under the current broadcaster proposal, the broadcasters will retain 
their analog signal for anywhere between 10 and 15 years, when digital TV becomes the 
standard.  What happens after 15 years and digital TV has only penetrated 80 percent of the 
market or 90 percent or even 95 percent?  Is Congress going to turn off the analog signal just like 
that?  Even if millions upon millions of their constituents are still watching analog televisions?  
In short, the broadcasters will continue to own their analog licenses for the foreseeable future and 
beyond, even while they get to exploit the myriad new digital technologies.  This is unfair no 
matter how you slice it.
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Commerce Committee, I realize that the broadcasters 
have been an extremely powerful lobby in Washington.  Given the upsurge in interest we have 
seen on this issue, I think that their political dominance, as with this deal, is largely a thing of the 
past.
<P>
What you have today is an opportunity  -- perhaps the last opportunity in the foreseeable 
future -- to encourage the development of an innovative, competitive, profitable broadcasting 
future, instead of tying the future to the history of the past fifty years.
<P>
You have the opportunity to raise tens of billions of dollars and in so doing demonstrate a 
careful stewardship of one of our nation's most valuable assets.
<P>
And you have the chance to encourage competition while destroying the most egregious 
of set-asides.
<P>
In his June speech, Mr. Wright spoke of the need to encourage change and competition in the communications marketplace.
<P>
Technological change is already upon us:  new digital technologies will soon allow the 
new spectrum to be used to transmit multiple digital TV signals; additional subscription services 
-- like HBO; newspapers; local news and data; computer/video games. . .the options are nearly 
endless.
<P>
The problem is that the broadcasters now ask that Congress give them a free ride in this 
technological carnival.  Mr. Wright recently estimated that this market generates $100 billion in 
annual revenues.7  And NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and all the other broadcasters want in. . . the easy, cheap way.<P>Of course, they're already all already part way there.  NBC alone: owns two 24-hour cable 
networks, has interests in 19 other cable networks, has multiple international broadcasting 
properties; and has entered the new computer-media market with NBC Desktop Video, NBC 
Digital Publishing and NBC Data Network.

<P>
Clearly, the broadcasters are financially capable and market savvy enough to identify and exploit new markets.  They don't need the government's help.  They already control a majority of 
the TV market.  We don't need to give them a head start in the race to win the digital 
marketplace.
<P>
I look forward to discussing this issue with you and answering any questions you have.
<P>
Thank you.           <P>

06-November-1995

<P> 
 
 
<P> I CONFESS that I love a guy in uniform, but the appeal of the military man of the moment is wearing thin. 
Colin Powell is flirting with the nation and the GOP. But will he respect them after the election?
<P> Powell will announce his political intentions next month, and Washington prognosticators are evenly 
divided over whether or not he'll toss his helmet into the ring. Some Powell watchers are convinced that his 
innate caution will dictate enjoyment of his new prosperity and privacy rather than entry into the mean 
world of presidential politics. Others believe the rumor that Powell has hired a Republican polling firm and 
intends to announce his candidacy on Veterans' Day, in time to make a big splash in the November 18 straw 
poll in Florida.
<P> If General Powell does decide to enter the Republican race, what kind of Republican will he be? His 
popular image is of someone who had to do it all himself, overcoming the obstacles of poverty and a racist 
society through intelligence and gumption. Powell did work hard, and deserves respect. But as
<i>My 
American Journey </i>candidly reveals, his childhood was far more secure and comfortable than, say, Phil 
Gramm's. Powell was raised by loving, middle-class parents in the South Bronx of the Forties, a far cry 
from the living hell that is the South Bronx in the Nineties. He grew up in a racially mixed, harmonious 
neighborhood, and went to City College in New York at a time when academic standards were high and 
racial separatism was not preached. Powell's justifiable pride owes no debt to an Afrocentric curriculum.
<p> Politically, however, Powell has shown little appreciation for the lessons to be drawn from the differences 
between life in pre-Balkanized New York and life in the racially tense city of today. Indeed, in the wake of 
the O.J. verdict, he has shown an uncharacteristic clumsiness in handling racial issues. 
The O.J. verdict 
itself, Powell says, ``shows that the judicial system works.'' And though the sense of self-preservation he 
developed in the Army prevented him from joining Louis Farrakhan's march in Washington, he at first 
pleaded a schedule conflict rather than refusing straightforwardly to attend  -- an evasion that was all too 
transparent. Willing to offend conservatives (he is ``disturbed by the class and racial undertones beneath the 
surface of [their] rhetoric''), he seemed wary of taking on the outspokenly bigoted Farrakhan.
More generally, Powell has tacked left and right as his political interests have dictated. Until a week or two 
ago, he was expressing liberal social views; he stated his opposition to a Balanced Budget Amendment, and 
declared the Contract with America ``a little too hard, a little too harsh, a little too unkind.'' He called 
conservatives ``Neanderthals.'' His few genuflections in a conservative direction were vague tributes to the 
family and fiscal restraint, without any particular policy agenda, rather as if Bill Clinton had stepped up to 
the Republican mike. Indeed, he frankly said that ``neither of the two major parties fits me comfortably in 
its present state.'' 
<P> How did he choose which party to flirt with? He explained that the Democratic Party ``is not alive and well 
like the Republican Party is.'' Instead of rescutitating the Democrats, however, he seems more interested in 
tailoring the GOP to his own measure. But first he has to capture it. He duly tacked rightwards in an 
interview with Le Figaro. Suddenly the Contract with America was marked by ``energy, life, and a will to 
change.'' Even Newt Gingrich came in for a compliment. As for Powell himself, he pronounced himself 
``slightly to the right of center.''
<p> Initially, this may well work. As several polls have demonstrated, there is probably a larger popular 
audience for Powell than there is for his establishment opinions, including among GOP primary voters. But 
this popularity makes Powell a very valuable resource to those who do agree with his views. And who might 
they be? Over the past few months, says Powell, he has become aware of plenty of Rockefeller Republicans 
who have been ``somewhat silent.'' 
<p> Now, liberal Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill may not have had time to talk to Colin Powell, 
but their ``voice'' is being heard loud and clear. They have been working feverishly to derail the 
conservative revolution. Is it, then, the rank-and-file Rockefeller Republicans to whom Powell intends to 
give a voice? If he has met large numbers of them, he must have spent the summer in Connecticut or Rhode 
Island. And any impression that they represent the country's Republican voters is unlikely to be dislodged 
by his book tour, where he reportedly signs a thousand books an hour with barely a glance at the grateful 
purchaser, before he's off to his next star-struck press interview.
<p> SO, IF he were to enter the Republican primaries, Colin Powell would be undertaking the political mission 
of transforming a vibrant, conservative GOP into a pre-1964-style progressive GOP. Since Clinton's 
election, 142 Democratic officeholders have switched to the Republican Party. There are a record number 
of Democratic retirements from the Senate, and when the Republicans succeed in delivering on their 
agenda, there will be a boatload of Democrats retiring from the House. The current state of the GOP should 
suggest another maxim for Powell to add to his famous list of rules: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
<p> But Colin Powell seems to believe that a fix is needed. He ignores the success of the conservative coalition. 
Having operated for years in official Washington, he appears to have internalized liberal orthodoxy on the 
permissible limits of political discourse. 
<p> But the Republican Party might not be the only casualty if Powell runs. He is currently enjoying the 
admiration of the nation. But would the Powell legend survive a run for the Presidency that pitted him not 
only against Bill Clinton, but also against the dominant conservative wing of the GOP? And all on behalf of 
the country-clubbers, of whom there were few in the Bronx, the Army, or even the Reagan White House.  --

<title>At Summit, Put U.S.-China Policy On Solid Ground -- heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AT SUMMIT, PUT U.S.-CHINA POLICY ON SOLID GROUND</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/lippen.htm">Brett C. Lippencott</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 436<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	Sensing a dangerous drift in relations, President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin have laid the groundwork for a U.S.-China summit on October 24, 1995, in New York City. A great deal of work needs to be done. The U.S.-China relationship is highly unstable and, although Beijing shares much of the blame, President Clinton has only made matters worse.
<p>	
	The Clinton Administration's China policy has been like a runaway car, careening from one side of the road to the other, always in danger of running off the cliff.  It is time to regain control of U.S.-China policies. Otherwise, both U.S. interests and the security and stability of Asia will be in jeopardy.
<p>
	President Clinton should make clear to President Jiang that the U.S.-China relationship should not be focused on only one issue, such as Taiwan, or even human rights. Rather, the relationship should be broadly based. In his discussions with the Chinese president, Clinton should concentrate on four major areas of concern: 1) trade, 2) Chinese arms sales and other military provocations, 3) America's ongoing relationship with the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, and 4) the status of Hong Kong.  Discussing these issues would give the New York meeting a badly needed focus while finally putting U.S. China policy on more solid ground.
<p>
	<b>China Must Comply with Trade Agreements.</b>  China's inability or unwillingness to create an environment amenable to foreign business makes U.S. support for PRC membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) impossible. Beijing has promised to open its markets to greater international participation by strengthening its legal system, easing controls on foreign exchange, removing non-tariff barriers, and opening protected sectors of the economy. However, China so far has not lived up to its promises. 
<p>
	Beijing wants to join the WTO to guarantee its continued economic access to the international community, a critical factor in its own economic advancement. China's leadership also feels that entry into the WTO would be another signal of international acceptance of China as a world power. But if China wishes to enter the WTO, it must accept the same entry standards required of every other country. This should be made clear at the New York summit.
<p>
	President Clinton also should insist that China abide by the agreement on intellectual property rights, which it reached with the United States in January 1995. Clinton should inform the Chinese that failure to enforce the terms of the agreement will invite U.S. sanctions and cause American corporations to reassess China's commercial attractiveness.
 <p>
	<b>Hold China Accountable for Arms Violations.</b>  President Clinton should make clear that if allegations of Chinese sales of intermediate-range missiles to Pakistan and assistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program are true, these actions will be considered dangerous violations of international norms. China must be held accountable for such acts and strongly encouraged to adhere to the international "rules of the road."  The U.S. cannot ignore violations of these rules.
<p>
	President Clinton should object strongly to China's hostile military actions in the South China Sea.  Earlier this year the Chinese navy took control of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef in violation of internationally established territorial norms.  This action challenges America's interest in freedom of navigation.  Instead of merely talking about the importance of open sea channels, the U.S. should take a more active approach and make clear that the U.S. 7th Fleet can and will protect these interests.  A statement of this sort would send the unambiguous message that America intends to continue playing an active role in the security of Asia.
<p>
	<b>Maintain Relationship with Taiwan.</b>  President Clinton must resolutely communicate America's intention to continue its unofficial relationship with the Republic of China, as defined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Though the PRC will ask, the United States should not yield to Beijing's pressure to deny visas for private visits by senior ROC officials, including President Lee Teng-hui.  The U.S. must not allow China to exercise a veto over U.S.-ROC relations.
	<p>
	China has shown flexibility by allowing Taiwan to participate in various international organizations, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank.  Using these precedents, President Clinton should urge the PRC to consider and support Taiwan's membership in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization and such U.N.-related agencies as the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
<p>
	It must be made clear to President Jiang that U.S. defensive arms sales to Taiwan will continue in direct response to the security situation in the region.  Thus, because the PRC's actions will have a direct influence on the nature and quantity of arms sales to the ROC, it would be in Beijing's best interests to refrain from intimidating actions, such as last July's missile tests conducted near Taiwan.  China also should scale back its military threat to Taiwan and re-open the high-level dialogue canceled in reaction to President Lee's June visit to the U.S.  The suggestion made by President Jiang earlier this month that he would welcome a meeting with President Lee should be praised as a positive first step in strengthening the strained ties between Beijing and Taipei.
<p>
	<b>American Interests in Hong Kong.</b> President Clinton should tell President Jiang that American confidence in the U.S.-China relationship will be damaged if Hong Kong's autonomy erodes after the reversion to China in 1997. Clinton also should express strong U.S. support for Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), which was elected on September 17, 1995.  The current LegCo should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term, free of any disruption that might arise when Hong Kong reverts to PRC rule. President Clinton should be adamant about maintaining a popularly supported legislative body in Hong Kong.
<p>
	Clinton also must make it clear that the U.S. intends to conduct substantial bilateral relations with Hong Kong up to and after the 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.  This relationship should consist of, among other things, 1) strong American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership, 2) an active American consulate general, 3) continued U.S. Navy port calls, and 4) an accelerated effort to complete outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.
<p>	

	China's emergence as a major regional and global power will be America's defining foreign policy challenge in the next decade. While the PRC's future will be decided by the Chinese, it is up to America and the international community to define and communicate to Beijing the norms by which it will be judged.  Taiwan, Hong Kong, China's military development, and trade are issues important to American interests in Asia.  How Beijing responds to these issues will be a test of its intentions and behavior in Asia and the rest of the world.  The key for the Clinton Administration in the coming months, and for the U.S. in the foreseeable future, is to conduct relations with China in a more stable manner, ignoring none of these overriding issues but at the same time allowing no one issue to derail the relationship.
<p>
	Engaging Beijing requires more than rhetoric and meetings.  It also requires a clear definition of U.S. interests and priorities that serve as the basis of what the U.S. does, not merely what it says.  Words about principle are not enough. U.S. actions must be clear enough to demonstrate unambiguously that American cooperation or opposition depends on how well China adheres to international rules of the road.  If nothing else, the October meeting provides an opportunity to define these rules, which serve U.S. interests, and to begin restoring a coherence to the conduct of the President's China policy that has been lost in recent years.

<ul><li>	General Colin Powell is clearly in the throes of a media lovefest regarding his potential presidential candidacy.  His autobiography, My American Journey, was released Sept. 15 with an initial print run of 800,000 copies.  It is expected to shoot to the top of the bestsellers' lists almost immediately.
	<P>About 3,000 fans jammed into a large bookstore and lined up for blocks as Powell launched his book-promotion tour in McLean, Va., a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb, by appearing to sign his autobiography.
	<P>In a new CNN/Time poll released Sept. 15, 53 percent said they wanted to see Powell run for president.  He ran ahead of President Clinton in a two-way match up and was in a statistical dead heat with Clinton in a hypothetical Dole-Clinton-Powell race.
	<P>An in-depth profile/interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's "20/20" aired the same day the poll was released.  Other television interviews with the major networks will follow.  Powell has been on the cover of Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report in the last few weeks.  And, as he embarks on his multi-city book tour that runs through October, the media hype will continue.
	<P>But don't expect it to last.  Remember 1992 and Ross Perot's budding presidential bid?  Perot's potential candidacy was touted as the second coming--until he actually got into the race.  In particular, the poll showing Powell would best both Clinton and Dole is eerily reminiscent of a similar poll in 1992 showing Perot leading both Clinton and then President Bush.  Then the negative media barrage ensued with charges of "inspector Perot" and innuendos that the Texas businessman's elevator didn't go all the way to the top.  <P>
	Granted, Perot didn't help his cause with his on-again/off-again campaign.  But the media frenzy damaged his reputation, perhaps irreparably.
	<P>We did learn a few things about Powell that we didn't know, however, from the Walters interview.  For starters, Powell appears to be comfortable with the economic conservatives of the Republican Party, but not quite as comfortable with some of the more strident social conservatives.  Although, in the rush to judgment, his positions on the issues have already been mischaracterized by some conservatives and members of the press, Powell appears to be:
<ul><LI>Pro-choice, but not pro-abortion;
<li>Against quotas and racial preferences, but favors reaching out to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race;
<LI>Solidly for 2nd Amendment rights of gun ownership, but willing to be slightly incon-venienced with registration and/or waiting periods;
<LI>Supportive of a private moment in school for prayer at the students' choosing, but would not support mandatory school prayer; and
<LI>Uncomfortable with the Clinton administration's vacillations on foreign policy issues.
</ul>	<P>Powell has a commanding presidential presence.  He dwarfs the other candidates, both in terms of his life's achievements and the charisma he possesses.  
	<P>At least one of the other GOP presidential candidates has commented on Powell's chances to get the party nomination.  "Despite the political yearnings of pro-abortion Republicans and much of the national news media, retired Army Gen. Colin Powell has not a prayer of winning the GOP nomination," Alan Keyes told USA Today in an interview.  
	<P>Keyes concluded that Powell has a "good background and he's accomplished a lot in his life, but he doesn't seem to have thought through the public policy issues.  Being a good man and being a good president are not necessarily the same thing."
<p>	But it is likely, if Keyes had his druthers, he'd prefer to have poll numbers like Powell, than the 1 to 2 percent national support which the two-time U.S. Senate candidate currently garners.
	<P>Nevertheless, Powell should think long and hard before entering the race.  The media, in their rush to make mere mortals of men, have so tarnished the character of our political leaders that we have few, if any, heroes remaining--living or dead.  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with his reputation intact on the sidelines, may serve as much of a purpose for Americans as he would after being sullied by the whole campaign process.

<LI>  Advisers to the Rev. Jesse Jackson disclosed recently that he has submitted his name to be included as a presidential candidate in a nonbinding urban presidential primary called City Vote, to be held in November, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
	<P>Jackson is contemplating a challenge to President Clinton from within the Democratic Party, but is giving more serious thought to running as an independent.  City Vote is a privately financed effort to give greater prominence to the urban issues Jackson advocates by allowing voters in some 20 cities to cast a nonbinding vote for presidential preference at the time they vote in local elections this November.
	<P>Jackson's aides said he is putting his name on the City Vote ballot both to raise the profile of urban problems and as a way to keep his personal political options open.
	<P>The head of the National Rainbow Coalition announced Sept. 9 that he had raised the $150,000 he owed the FEC from his 1988 presidential campaign, removing one of the obstacles to a potential return to the presidential trail next year.  Had he not paid the settlement, Jackson would not be eligible to receive federal matching campaign funds in future races.
<P>	"All options are alive," said Jackson at a press conference.  He outlined three possible political courses of action for himself in 1996--to stay out of the race, to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries or to run as an independent.  
	<P>He noted, however, that he second option was "remote" and that he would wait until the spring to decide on an independent run.  Jackson said that part of his decision would be based on whether Clinton "embraces an activist agenda" for urban development, education and health, as well as enforcement of affirmative action laws.

<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<Li>   Efforts by the Georgia legislature to redraw the state's congressional district map collapsed Sept. 12, leaving the task to a three-judge federal panel.
	After overwhelmingly rejecting two proposed compromise redistricting plans during that week, both houses of the General Assembly voted to adjourn, following a five-week special session that cost the taxpayers at least $500,000.  "I hate to admit failure, but I don't know anything else to do," state House Speaker Tom Murphy, a Democrat, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.  And state House Reapportionment Committee Chairman Tommy Smith said earlier, "I see absolutely no hope of the conferees passing any plan out on this congressional exercise."
	<P>The special session was called Aug. 14 after the U.S. Supreme Court in late June ruled that the majority-black 11th District of Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney was unconstitutional.
	<P>The justices said the legislature had relied too heavily on race in creating the seat following the 1990 census.  The 11th District stretches 250 miles from Savannah to Atlanta in an effort to pick up black voters.
<P>	But, during the special session, the legislature found itself badly split among competing demands from white Democrats, black Democrats and Republicans.
	<P>The black Democrats wanted to retain at least two of the state's current three majority-black House districts.  The Republicans, who now control the other eight districts in the state, feared dilution of their numbers.
	<P>The latest compromise plan, rejected Sept. 11 by a 122-22 vote in the state House and 44-8 in the state Senate, would have left Democratic Rep. John Lewis as the only one of the state's three black incumbents with a majority-black district.
<P>	Republicans disliked the plan because it would have placed House Speaker Gingrich and GOP Rep. Bob Barr in the same Atlanta-area district.  And black legislators objected because it failed to keep McKinney's district from intruding on the 5th District represented by Democratic Rep. John Lewis, and because it removed a key part of the majority-black district of Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop.
	<P>The new congressional map will now be drawn by the same three-judge federal panel that originally threw out the 11th District.

<a name="welfare"></a><br>
<P>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><P>
<LI>The prospects for ending welfare as we know it were dashed with the caving in of moderate Senate Republicans, joining with liberal Democrats, to fundamental changes in the current system.  Nearly everyone agrees that the welfare system has been a disaster.  
	<P>It has been particularly devastating for black communities throughout the U.S.  As late as 1958, 78 percent of black children were living with two-parent families.  That figure is now at 45 percent--and falling.  But the reverberations of the disastrous welfare system can be felt throughout virtually every segment of society.
	<P>The two most important aspects of welfare reform--denying additional benefits to women who have more children while on the welfare rolls and denying cash benefits to teen-agers who have children out of wedlock--should have been easy to implement.  Any idiot can see that if you pay women to have children without marrying and you set up house for teen-agers who have already shown that they are irresponsible and pay them to continue to make the same mistakes, you'll end up with what we've got right now.  After all, do women who are married and work receive a raise every time they have a baby?  And, if people are paid to have babies, why is anyone surprised when they do?<P>
	<P>But the battle was actually lost in the spring when the debate on welfare shifted from making parents responsible for their children to punishing children for their parents' mistakes.  Once the liberals took the latter argument and ran with it, moderates caved.  Although versions of those elements remain in the version passed March 24 by the House, which has generally been far more conservative in its approach to welfare, senior administration officials have made clear that the President would veto the House measure.
<P>	The Senate bill seeks to save $70 billion in welfare spending over seven years and, by the year 2000, would require that 50 percent of parents receiving welfare work for their benefits.  It would also impose a five-year limit on drawing welfare benefits, although states could offer hardship exemptions to a limited pool of recipients.  
	<P>These are good first steps, but they miss the point.  Welfare should not be an entitlement, but a contract between the recipient and his or her country that, in exchange for assistance during hard times, he or she will do the following: 1) Work and/or attend school; 2) Change irresponsible behavior; 3) Vow to make better decisions in the future.
	<P>The President and others will, however, claim victory for reforming the welfare system.  The Republicans have extolled the concept of block granting the welfare payments to the states in the form of lump sums.  This will allow the states more flexibility to see what works and what doesn't.  
	<P>But, politicians have a tendency, when given lump sum payments, to transfer those sums to areas where the politically powerful have exerted pressure.  And, with a lack of vision as to the principles upon which we would like our national welfare system administered, we'll end up with 50 different hybrids.
	<P>Five years from now, we'll look back on this period and say, "We should have done something in 1995.  The problem has gotten worse."

Can Medicare be Rescued?<p></center></h2>
<hr>

<title>Whistling In The Dark -- Heritage </title>
<center><h2> Whistling In The Dark</h2><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>September 28, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>Congress is crashing head-on into the devastating problem of illegitimacy, and balking. 
<p>Decades after liberal ideology declared marriage obsolete and liberal welfare policy discouraged it, America has reaped a bitter harvest: Millions of children growing up without dads, and moms struggling through life without much hope for the future.
<p>Congress is now trying to hash out the differences between House and Senate versions of a comprehensive welfare-reform bill. Unfortunately, liberals of both parties seem determined to join with President Clinton and block reforms that could help avert further social catastrophe. They are on the verge of shooting down a plan to deny welfare increases to unwed mothers who have more children while they're on welfare. That means: Taxpayers will continue to subsidize out-of-wedlock births.
<p>Yet, the numbers are stark and incontrovertible. We are becoming a nation of fatherless children. And fatherless children grow up to commit more violent crime, take more illegal drugs and become statistics in more social pathologies than any other group.
<p>Unmarried mothers gave birth to 80 percent of all black children born in the inner city in 1994. But the problem goes far beyond the inner city. In 1965, when a worried young strategist in the Johnson administration's War on Poverty warned of  the end of the black family, 25 percent of all black births were to unmarried mothers. Today, nearly 30 percent of all births in America -- regardless of color  -- are to unmarried mothers.
<p>In other words, the country as a whole has now gone further down the road of family disintegration than the black family had in 1965. Sadly, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y. -- who first warned of this problem -- is now among the senators blocking genuine welfare reform.
<p>America must stop providing a financial incentive for women on welfare to have children out of wedlock. The only way to do that is to cut off additional payments to those who have more babies while on public assistance, and to deny benefits to girls under 18 who give birth to illegitimate children.
<p>This is not as heartless as it sounds -- after all, does your boss give you an automatic raise if you have more children? If you were contemplating a new addition to the family and your boss said, sure, we'll give you a raise to take care of it, wouldn't you be more likely to go ahead? 
<p>Meaningful welfare reform also must require mothers to name the fathers of their children as a condition of receiving welfare payments -- to make dads pay child support.
<p>The alternative is to just keep whistling in the dark. If Congress can't muster the courage to take these measures, here's what's in store for America:
<p><ul>
<li>Crime -- A state-by-state analysis by The Heritage Foundation found a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime for every 10 percent hike in the number of children living in single-parent homes. Get ready to pay higher taxes for more policemen, more judges, more prisons and more dangerous neighborhoods.
<li>Health -- Babies born to unmarried mothers face a "substantially higher risk" of  serious infant health problems, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. More money, therefore, will be needed for Medicaid.
<li>Education -- Children from single-parent homes do more poorly in school, and are more likely to be truant or have disciplinary problems, according to the National Association of Elementary School Principals. Schools will become more dangerous and kids will learn even less.
<li>Economy -- Problems in school mean problems in the workplace. Look for lower productivity and higher unemployment.</ul>
<p>When are liberal politicians in Washington going to get it? The brand of "compassion" they've been dealing out is killing us. It's time to do something about it.

<title>Chernobyl Times Two -- Heritage </title>

<center><h2>Chernobyl Times Two</h2><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>9/28/95<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
If you think the closest the United States ever came to nuclear disaster was at Three Mile Island, you probably aren't aware of communist dictator Fidel Castro's latest little construction project.
<p>Just 250 miles from Miami, the United States is facing what could be its greatest nuclear threat, in the form of a couple of Russian-designed nuclear reactors under construction in Juragua, near Cienfuegos. The Cubans are building not one, but two, nuclear accidents waiting to happen.
<p>What is so dangerous about these reactors? Here are just a few -- by no means all -- of the problems:
<p><ul>
<li>The reactors are of the same defective design as the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl that literally melted down, spreading radioactive fallout over thousands of square miles of Russia and Eastern Europe. 
<li>Sixty percent of the Soviet-supplied materials used in these reactors are defective, according to Cubans who have left the project.
<li>The containment dome of the first reactor is designed to withstand pressures of only seven pounds-per-square-inch (PSI), when U.S. reactors are only considered safe -- indeed are only allowed to be built -- if their domes can withstand 50 PSI.
<p></ul>
Castro had mothballed the project in the early 1990s because of U.S. objections. But work has resumed. Roger W. Robinson Jr., who worked at the National Security Council under President Reagan, recently told a House committee Castro may be resuming construction hoping to "shake down the U.S. and international communities for some kind of substantial compensatory alternative," as the North Koreans were able to do with their reactor project at Yongbyon. U.S. acquiescence in the recent Russian-Iranian nuclear deal also encourages Castro to pursue his goals.
<p>So the tale of two Chernobyls continues.
<p>With the completion of Castro's nuclear reactors, Cuba will gain a "menacing and even devastating new policy lever" in its relations with the United States, according to Robinson. He says a Cuban nuclear accident would have a similar effect as "the detonation of a nuclear weapon near the United States." Depending on the winds and other weather conditions, nuclear fallout could spread west as far as Texas and race up the eastern seaboard to Washington, D.C., within possibly four days.
<p>Oddly, the environmental community, usually foaming at the mouth over this type of scenario, is silent. Apparently, if the nuclear violator is one of their political heroes, Greenpeace, Worldwatch and other like-minded organizations are not nearly as anxious to chain themselves to construction equipment and halt progress on a nuclear project. 
<p>So what can be done?
<p>The fact is that short of a military strike -- which no one is seriously contemplating -- there's not much America can do. The Cienfuegos reactor project is just one more reminder of how vital it is that the United States do everything in its power -- continuing the economic embargo, intensifying it by bringing in other nations, keeping funding for Radio and TV Marti -- to oust Castro and his cronies from power in Cuba once and for all. 
<p>In the meantime, Congress also should call on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to remove all technical and financial assistance from the project. If Russia refuses, it should face a cutoff of U.S. economic aid.
<p>Of course, whether the Clinton administration is willing to take these steps depends on how worried it is. I think we should be more than a little concerned about two Chernobyl-style reactors being built -- not all the way across the Pacific Ocean like the North Korean reactors -- but only 250 miles from U.S. shores. 
<p>But that's just my opinion.

<title>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
A Senate committee voted to abolish the White House drug czar
and move its function to the Treasury Department saving $10 million
next year.  Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) explained, &quot;If
this administration will not facilitate and prosecute the drug
war, then Congress is forced to do it for them.&quot;  Clinton
promises to veto the bill if the final version eliminates the
Office of National Drug Control Policy.
<P>
Shelby says the administration is sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.
 I object to the administration's handling of this issue, its
lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;   He blames drug czar
Lee Brown for &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in fighting illegal
drug use and trafficking.
<P>
Senator Shelby is correct about &quot;a mixed message.&quot; 
The Clinton administration has overseen an all-out retreat in
the drug war.
<P>
At a hearing before a House committee earlier this year, former
First Lady Nancy Reagan said, &quot;Why is it we no longer hear
the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from our leaders
and our culture?&quot;  Former drug czar William Bennett echoed
Reagan's point, there is &quot;no viable effort by the Clinton
Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign
supply control.&quot;  And former DEA director Robert Bonner stated,
&quot;I believe that there has been a near total absence of presidential
leadership by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal
drug use in this country.&quot;
<P>
At the same hearing Lee Brown began his testimony with an unusual
and telling aside.  He told the committee, &quot;I am extremely
disappointed by the way that you have structured this hearing.
 You have placed me on the third panel to testify, following the
appointees of the last administration.  This is contrary to established
precedent in the House for scheduling of administration witnesses
regardless of which party sits in the White House.&quot;
<P>
The administration's anti-drug record possibly explains the House's
witness sequence and the low esteem accorded Dr. Brown.  Even
Democratic Congressmen piled on the drug czar.  Rep. Charles Rangel
(D-NY) said, &quot;I've been in Congress for over two decades,
and I have never, never, never seen a 
president who cares less about this issue.&quot;  Rep. John Conyers
(D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's confirmation hearings,
&quot;Either the president is with you, or he has just given you
a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are getting
ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration.&quot;
<P>
Probably the latter is closer to the truth.  The question remains,
should Congress discard the drug czar's post because Clinton isn't
committed to the war?  After all, when the ONDCP was established
by Congress in 1988, it was authorized to develop and coordinate
the policies, goals, and objectives for the drug fight.  What's
lacking in this administration is vision and leadership.  Snuffing
out an issue coordinator at the cabinet level is not the right
decision.
<P>
Senator Shelby would transfer the drug czar's responsibilities
to the Treasury Department.  But placing drug policy under Treasury
might further taint drug enforcement given the problems now linked
with the ATF.   Other anti-drug efforts like prevention and treatment
would likely suffer.
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin supports the existing drug office.
 &quot;ONDCP is critical,&quot; says Rubin, &quot;because it is
a neutral agency coordinating all the 50 agencies with anti-drug
roles.&quot;  Even Attorney General Janet Reno sees a &quot;need
to continue a strong and coordinated effort&quot; played by the
drug czar.  
<P>
Brown defends his post:  &quot;The deletion of funding for the
ONDCP will undercut the President's ability to fight drugs and
drug-related crime, which recent polls confirm are America's greatest
fear.&quot;  He points out that 77 million Americans report some
history of using illicit drugs.
<P>
Brown shouldn't be faulted for his boss's apparent indifference
to the drug problem.  One of the czar's primary duties is to advise
the president.  But if his advice is ignored and Clinton fails
to personally support the drug war, it will languish.
<P>
Brown said that &quot;Shutting off the relatively small $9.9 million
for our office will do irreparable damage to the nation's ability
to have a coordinated anti-drug strategy.&quot;  Of course he's
right.  Treasury cannot effectively coordinate government-wide
anti-drug efforts.  Eliminating Brown's job because his boss doesn't
care is wrong.
<P>
This nation needs a coordinated anti-drug program and it begins
with a committed president.  The drug czar is an important player,
but he can't take the lead alone.  
<P>
With abuse rates rising and the culture glamorizing illicit drugs,
now is not the time to abandon what the czar's office represents:
a coordinated anti-drug commitment.
<P>

<h2><center>Hearings on Regulatory Policy</h2>
before the U.S. House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Technology, Committee on Science<p></center></h3>
<b>Statement of Thomas M. Lenard<br>
Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies,The Progress & Freedom Foundation</b><p>
September 28, 1995<P>
Madame Chairwoman and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in these hearings, which address an extremely important set of issues.  Innovation and technical progress are the means by which our nation's overall economic welfare and living standards are improved.  We must therefore try to assure that government programs enacted for a variety of different purposes do not create disincentives to the development and adoption of new technologies.<P>
	Regulatory programs come in different sizes and shapes.  Since necessity is the mother of invention, some of these programs undoubtedly stimulate the development of technologies needed to satisfy specific regulatory requirements.  Overall, however, the effect of regulation on innovation is probably adverse.  In particular, there are major regulatory programs affecting high-technology sectors of the economy that clearly discourage and delay the introduction of important new innovations of great potential benefit to consumers.  These effects are frequently difficult to quantify.  The cost of a new technology delivered to consumers several years later than it should be, for example, may not be readily apparent.  Even more difficult to discern are the costs of innovations that never are made because development costs artificially have been driven too high.  The best recent estimate of the total cost of federal regulation, due to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology, is about $600 billion annually or $6,000 per American household.  Yet this figure does not reflect the adverse effects on innovation of the regulatory programs I discuss below.<P>
	These programs span the regulatory landscape from traditional "economic" regulatory programs, aimed at pricing and entry conditions, to programs intended to protect the public's health and safety.  Their common characteristics are:<P>
they require an approval or license from a regulator for a new product or service to be introduced; and, 
they affect very innovative sectors of the economy.<P>
	Granting regulatory agencies product-approval authority tends to increase the costs of innovation and delay the introduction of new technologies, because the incentives faced by the agencies are generally not conducive to rapid approval.  The burden of proof is typically on the applicant to show that his product is consistent with the public interest, however defined in the relevant statute.  This can be an expensive proposition and regulators frequently raise the costs by requesting additional data on which to base their decision.  Moreover, once such a framework is in place, it can be used by incumbents to raise the cost of entry to new competitors.<P>
	My testimony focuses on the relationship between innovation and regulation in the biomedical and telecommunications sectors of the economy.  The revolutionary developments in biotechnology and computing have had a profound impact on these sectors.  These sectors are heavily regulated, however, and this is slowing the innovative process appreciably.         
<P>
Medical Innovation
<P>
	The discovery and development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is a time-consuming, uncertain process that requires years of expensive laboratory work, pre-clinical and, ultimately, clinical testing.  It now takes approximately 15 years to bring a drug to the market, at an average cost that has been estimated at close to $400 million.  Many years of costs are incurred before there is even a slight chance of patients receiving new products and of companies earning returns on their investment.  This is of special significance for start-up companies, such as the many small biotechnology and device firms which have no products bringing in revenue while they invest heavily in researching new products. 
	<P>The current regulatory framework for new medical products requires that sponsors of new drugs or medical devices apply to the Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval, submitting data on the safety and effectiveness of their products.1  The only route to the market is through the FDA.	<P>The effects on innovation in the drug and device industries of delegating the approval process to a risk-averse agency operating in a political environment are exactly what we might expect.  The return to research has fallen and become more uncertain, resulting in less domestic product development.  We also observe "approval arbitrage," whereby companies concentrate their R&D efforts overseas where the regulatory burden is less onerous.  The high regulatory costs and increased uncertainty also deter new entrants into the drug and device industries, reducing the pool of capital available for funding new research.  Ultimately, the system as now configured deprives patients of life-saving and life-enhancing products that never come to market because the overall costs of innovation have been driven too high: <P>  
Despite skyrocketing research and development budgets in the biomedical industries, there has been no corresponding increase in the flow of new drugs and medical devices to the market.  The industry's research spending, after adjusting for inflation, is ten times the level it was in the early 1960s.  Yet, the output of approved new molecular entities has not increased since enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962 and remains far below the pre-1962 level.<P>
The time required to bring a new drug to market, including pre-clinical testing, clinical development and regulatory review has increased from a little more than six years in the mid-1960s to about 15 years in the early 1990s.<P>
In the medical device area, the number of premarket approval applications decreased from 78 in 1990 to 40 in 1993, while the time for approval increased from 609 to 823 days.<P>
Medical device companies increasingly are locating research and manufacturing facilities offshore solely because of the regulatory burdens associated with entering the market here.<P>
	These are all sobering facts, in the face of the large increases in research budgets and the availability of totally new sciences, such as biotechnology and powerful computing, since the early 1960s.  Americans obtain access to fewer new drugs and devices and receive them later than they should.  America's procedures for bringing new products to patients are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world, and it is now routine for new drugs and devices developed by American companies to be available in other countries before they become available here.<P>
	The FDA's adverse effect on innovation extends to foods, where it also has jurisdiction and where food additives are subject to a similar premarket approval process.  For over twenty years, the FDA has been deciding what to do with the fat substitute olestra that has been found in clinical studies to reduce overall fat intake and to be harmless.2  The fact that the manufacturer of this product has spent upwards of $100 million before making a single sale has surely not gone unnoticed by others contemplating similar R&D efforts.    <P>

Biotechnology
<P>
	While the influence of the FDA on biotechnology products is obviously strong, these products are also held hostage in other regulatory arenas.  Biotechnology holds great promise for the development of more environmentally benign pesticides and more effective bioremediation techniques.  Yet, the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory approach to the testing and approval of these agricultural and other biotech products is discouraging their development, as has been pointed out by Dr. Henry Miller, former head of the FDA's biotech office.3  For example:<P>The development of a promising new biotech product that would prevent frost damage when sprayed on crops was cut short by the establishment of very expensive experimental hurdles by the EPA.  The product has thus far not been commercialized.<P>The Monsanto Company was denied permission to undertake a field test of a biotech product aimed at controlling a corn-eating insect.  Had Monsanto used a cruder "conventional" genetic technique, the field trial would not have been subject to government oversight at all.  Monsanto subsequently dismantled its entire microbial biocontrol program.<P>
EPA's policies have discouraged research on promising new techniques of bioremediation -- the detoxification of wastes using living organisms -- that could increase the effectiveness and reduce the costs of cleanups of toxic waste sites.<p>
	The basic problem is that these innovative biotech products are being subjected to higher regulatory hurdles simply because they are based on a new technology, despite evidence that they may well be safer and more effective than conventional alternatives.
<p> 
Communications
<p>
	The telecommunications area also offers numerous examples of how the government's licensing authority raises the cost and delays the introduction of new technologies.4  The 1934 Communications Act gives the FCC broad powers to license (1) wireline facilities and services used in interstate common carriage; and (2) the use of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Instead of serving consumers' interests, these licensing powers have lent themselves to abuse by incumbent firms interested in protecting their markets.  Few businesses or trade associations can resist the temptation to use available regulatory procedures against competitors:<p>
For example, although there is now general agreement that competition in long-distance markets has spurred innovation and pushed prices sharply down, the FCC successfully protected AT&T from long-distance competition for several decades.  The Commission's previous policy of forbidding competition in long-distance markets cost consumers tens of billions of dollars.<p>
The Commission's resistance to the provision of "enhanced services" by telephone companies has imposed another layer of costs, as demonstrated by the single example of voice-mail.  Today, phone companies provide voice-mail services at roughly five dollars a month per mailbox to roughly ten million customers.  Though the technology was available in the 1970s, if not earlier, FCC permission to deploy it did not come until 1988.  The cost to the economy from the Commission's delay in authorizing these services has been estimated at approximately $6 billion.<p>
The FCC's exclusion of phone companies from the provision of video programming and cable television, put in place in 1970, also has been costly.  The Commission subsequently came to the view that this policy might be inhibiting competition and began to reevaluate it -- a process that occupied the Commission for five years.  In 1992, the Commission concluded that telephone company provision of video-dialtone services should be allowed, but the Commission took another two years to approve the first application to provide such services.  Since cable rates are estimated to be 20 to 30 percent lower in markets served by more than one provider, the Commission's failure to authorize entry by phone companies obviously imposed billions of dollars of costs on cable subscribers.<p>
	The barriers to innovation from the FCC's power to license spectrum are, if anything, more striking:<p>
The introduction of both FM radio and television was delayed for years by FCC equivocation over which bands would be assigned to what uses.  FM radio technology, invented in 1933, was not in widespread use until the 1960s.  The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards and froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952.<p>
Cellular technology, first conceived in 1947 by Bell Laboratories, was not introduced commercially until the 1980s.  AT&T was operating its first experimental cellular telephone system in 1962, but the FCC did not even get around to allocating spectrum for cellular until 1974.  The first cellular licenses were not handed out until 1983.  Today, the cellular industry generates some $14.2 billion in revenues a year.  The decade of delay is estimated to have cost Americans roughly $85 billion.   
<p>
Concluding Comments
<p>
	In sum Madame Chairwoman, innovation is adversely affected by the current regulatory frameworks in critically important sectors of the economy where the technological opportunities are greatest.  At The Progress & Freedom Foundation, we have been developing a new framework for bringing medical products to market as well as a replacement model for current communications regulation.  Both of these models would reduce or eliminate the adverse effect the current regulatory structures have on the incentive to innovate.  We hope to have an opportunity to share our views as these issues are considered.      <p>

<title> Lobbyists Bring Scare Tactics To Your Hometown -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h2>LOBBYISTS BRING SCARE TACTICS 
TO YOUR HOMETOWN</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 21, 1995<br>

<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	Washington lobbyists may be in your state -- and they are trying to scare you.
<p>	They believe that once you hear what the House of Representatives is up to -- it voted recently to end welfare for lobbyists -- you'll be as scared as they are. 
<p>	If the proposed reform legislation passes, these "beltway bandits" no longer will be able to use government grants -- your hard-earned tax dollars -- to subsidize their political advocacy. Never mind that they didn't ask you whether you agree with their causes or not. They just want your tax dollars. And they won't rest until they are sure they can continue to feed at the public trough.
	<p>Unknown to most Americans, these lobbyists have relied on 40 years of political patronage in Congress to obtain billions of taxpayer dollars that routinely are used to lobby for even more government money. It works like this: A non-profit advocacy group searches through the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance -- a guide to more than $40 billion in annual government giveaways -- to find some program related to its activities. The organization then applies to federal bureaucrats in Washington for a "grant" and receives a fat check from the U.S. Treasury.
<p>	Unfortunately, each federal dollar these advocacy groups receive from Washington frees up other money, which can then be spent on lobbying and other political activities you may or may not agree with. In addition, federal grantees are allowed to "skim" a certain percentage of each grant to apply toward "overhead" or "administrative" expenses. This percentage can range anywhere from 10 to 30 percent or more.  
<p>	A perfect example is the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC). Although this organization has actively lobbied Congress against a balanced-budget amendment and other policies, and operates a political action committee that contributes thousands of dollars each year to political candidates, NCSC is 96 percent taxpayer funded. According to its 1993 IRS filing, $72,910,930 of $75,956,825 in revenue came from the government. The bulk of this money came from one of the giveaways in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance called the "Senior Community Service Employment Program." 
<p>	Did the NCSC ever ask you whether you wanted a balanced budget or if you support their slate of political candidates? It didn't ask us either. But it didn't hesitate to take our money -- and yours.
<p>	Of course, your local non-profit couldn't get money from this program. The NCSC is one of only nine national groups allowed to receive the $320 million available from this grant. Why? Because they have the clout and the lobbyists -- bought, in large part, with your money.
<p>	Needless to say, these folks aren't going to take Congress's effort to end such practices lying down. One of their "watchdog" groups, OMB Watch, has been sent out to scare small local non-profits. They want these local groups to call Washington and express concern that the proposed reforms will prevent them from pursuing their activities. In fact, local non-profits that take money from the government usually spend the money wisely -- by directly helping people, not by paying high-priced lobbyists in Washington.
<p>	Believe it or not, OMB Watch is now financing a 27 state "road show" to stir up local non-profits. Given the number of states being visited, the costs are likely to be substantial.
<p>	Who is financing this little circus? After a little digging, we found out that OMB Watch is linked to an organization called the Unison Institute, which receives a taxpayer subsidy. In fact, the two organizations jointly run the "Right-to-Know" computer network (RTK Net) on the Internet, which is being used as a primary tool for the campaign to protect welfare for lobbyists. The credits on RTK Net proudly proclaim that it is paid for by "multiple philanthropic and government agencies," including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>	In other words, the same shell game these groups use to obtain your tax dollars for lobbying is being used to preserve the shell game itself!
<p>	So, when the "road show" arrives in your town, and you hear horror stories about babies crying and old folks dying because of what the new meanies in Congress want to do to non-profit organizations that lobby, don't be fooled. 
<p>	Just ask if the people making the claims receive any government funding. Then ask why they didn't check with you before they used your money to lobby for their cause. 
<p>

<html><title>Spotlight on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As the Senate considers the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, it must consider funding for AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House already has voted to end funding for this program. While it is hailed by the Administration and its supporters as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, it actually has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project. In an era of budget deficits, the Administration is asking the American taxpayer to support a program that funds bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts in order to fund the President's pet program. 
<p>
Although supporters maintain that AmeriCorps is a successful "program that encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to college and disperses decision-making power from Washington to the states,"1 the rhetoric contrasts sharply with reality. The Senate should follow the bold lead of the House of Representatives and terminate AmeriCorps because it:
<p><ul>
<li>Does little to help American families pay for college;

<li>Destroys the spirit of volunteerism;

<li>Removes participants from local communities where they are needed and uses them to enlarge the federal bureaucracy; 

<li>Improperly funds partisan political activities; and

<li>Costs the taxpayers too much.
</ul>
<p>
FAILING TO HELP AMERICAN FAMILIES PAY FOR COLLEGE
<p>
AmeriCorps does little to help working families pay for college and fails to accomplish its stated goal of "expanding educational opportunity."2  The program's eligibility criteria allow any individual, regardless of income, to qualify for its benefits. For example, President Clinton's daughter Chelsea could receive the same educational award voucher as more needy participants and could be selected over youth from families who need help to meet the rising cost of post-secondary education. The only requirements are the following:3
<p><ul>
<li>Participants must be citizens or legal resident aliens aged seventeen or older at the commencement of service in many cases.

<li>Participants may serve before, during, or after post-secondary education.

<li>Participants must have a high school degree to receive education vouchers.4</ul><p>Thus, the children of wealthy and influential people can elbow out poor students. As Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) has noted, for every one AmeriCorps participant (who may or may not need financial assistance) who receives college benefits, many more needy students could qualify for Pell Grants.5<p>	Chart 1 indicates that if the federal government took one AmeriCorps award of $26,700, and converted it into a means-tested program, it could provide approximately 18 students with college Pell Grants for each AmeriCorps participant. If the President's goal is to help those who need funding for higher education, means-tested programs would provide more opportunity to more people.<p>UNDERMINING THE SPIRIT OF VOLUNTEERISM
<p>
The generosity of AmeriCorps' benefits also sends a mixed message about volunteering. Taxpayers do not need another program to do what millions of Americans already are doing. Private sector community service is thriving. There are numerous state and local volunteer programs that idealistic young people may join. Surveys by Independent Sector show that in 1994, 89.2 million Americans 18 and over volunteered in some capacity, for an average of 4.2 hours a week. They were not moved by the lure of a lucrative government job, but by a spirit of true volunteerism and genuine service.
<p>
	In particular, volunteer activity is flourishing among college students across the country. Campus-based volunteer student groups are expanding, and more schools are encouraging students to volunteer by broadening their regular curricula to include service jobs.6 The federal Commission on National and Community Service is calling on schools and colleges to encourage more students to perform volunteer work,7 but almost every college and university in the United States already gives students opportunities to earn school credit for participating in community service activities. For example, Rutgers University, the site chosen by President Clinton to announce the AmeriCorps program, integrates community service into the undergraduate curriculum, through its Civic Education and Community Service Program. The course work includes a combination of traditional academic disciplines related to volunteer services performed in the communities that are home to Rutgers campuses.8<p>	Similarly, Loyola University in Chicago features programs designed to inspire students to help alleviate Chicago's urban blight. It sponsors partnerships with area schools and a community policing project for criminal justice and sociology students. Other academic programs attract students to service-oriented careers, such as social work and nursing.9<p>	Even Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., the private school attended by Chelsea Clinton, requires community service. There are student work programs and voluntary service projects on and off campus for all grades, mandatory service projects for ninth-graders, and 30 hours of off-campus community service required for graduation, according to a Sidwell brochure.
<p>
	By providing payment for "volunteering," however, AmeriCorps weakens the spirit of volunteerism and undermines efforts to promote true community service. Moreover, AmeriCorps creates a huge bureaucracy to do what 51.1 percent of Americans over the age of 18 already do.10 As Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) has noted, " [With] federal bureaucrats involved, you need a federal bureaucracy to write the grant announcement, a federal bureaucrat to oversee and review the grant applications, another federal bureaucrat to issue the grant, then you need a state bureaucrat to write the grant, a state bureaucrat to establish a `dialogue' with the local communities, and you will need several staff at the local level to make sure that they are complying with all the guidelines and red tape required by the federal government."11  AmeriCorps embodies all of the principles of enlarging rather than reinventing government.<p>	AmeriCorps further corrupts and undermines true volunteerism by encouraging successful, independent, local volunteer organizations to become dependent upon federal funding. AmeriCorps makes participating programs look to the federal bureaucracy for money and solutions to the problems in their backyards rather than take the initiative to solve community problems themselves.
<p>

ENLARGING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
<p>
In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000 "volunteers" described as "working all over America, helping people -- person to person."12  In reality, a significant number of these highly paid "volunteers" are working in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded programs, or political action organizations. Of the 20,000 "volunteers" currently participating in the program, 2,053 are working inside the federal bureaucracies on programs funded by the federal government. Chart 2 presents a breakdown of AmeriCorps participation within the federal government.
<p>

ENGAGING IN PARTISAN POLITICS
<p>
Several AmeriCorps programs have ignored the Corporation's mission statement of addressing the nation's problems through direct community service. Instead, they have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers. 
<p>
	 Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 clearly states that:  "any approved national service position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political organization.... "
<P>
	But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps "Summer of Safety" program last year organized 40 groups to rally against the federal crime bill's "three strikes and you're out" provision.13 Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission statement was a non-profit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed to use its "volunteers" to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods. Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. "The 'volunteers' had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door in April and May (1995) when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb were fighting for re-election."14  According to 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor, "We realized there was something politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying... this was a great position we were in, making public officials accountable for their jobs."15  The Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding, but the example shows the potential for abuse.<p>HEAVY COST TO TAXPAYERS<p>During the debate on AmeriCorps in the 103rd Congress, several Senators made floor statements offering to eliminate the program if it proved too costly and was found to be unsuccessful. One was Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), who declared that "Congress will not, and should not, fund a program if it is unsuccessful. I do not believe it will happen but if it does I would favor cutting the program."16<p>	The General Accounting Office (GAO) has just released a report requested by Senator Grassley on the costs of the AmeriCorps program.17 Senator Grassley asked for the investigation of the costs after the 103rd Congress approved a 96 percent increase in funding that raised program spending from $217.3 million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $427.3 million in Fiscal Year 1995 (including the National Service Trust and AmeriCorps grant).18 The Administra
tion is asking the American taxpayers to pay for an expensive program that cannot provide evidence of its benefits to the taxpayer or to the local communities it is suppose to serve. Further, the Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees AmeriCorps, is not required to evaluate the program rigorously over the long term.19<p>	The GAO report highlights important discrepancies between the Clinton Administration's estimates of how much AmeriCorps costs and the true costs. According to the GAO, the cost is approximately $26,700 per volunteer for ten months work. This estimate, as noted by the GAO, is substantially higher than the Clinton Administration's. Eli Segal, chief executive officer of AmeriCorps, stated in congressional testimony this March that the total cost, which includes all benefits and education vouchers, per "volunteer" would be no more than $18,800.20 The GAO's research, however, reveals that costs are more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. The Administration now claims that the $17,600 figure was intended to represent only the federal contribution.<p>	Chart 3 summarizes GAO estimates of the cost per "volunteer."	As the GAO report clearly points out, the federal government is the primary source of funds for the program. Only 7 percent of the AmeriCorps budget comes from private sources, with the federal government responsible for 79 percent of the costs and state and local tax dollars covering 14 percent. This is the opposite of the Administration's intention when the program was created. In a February 28, 1993, <i>New York Times</i> op-ed, President Clinton stated that the program would receive its funding primarily from the private sector:
<p>
<blockquote>	While the Federal Government will provide the seed money for national service, we are determined that the participants -- the individuals who serve and the groups that sponsor their service -- will guide the process. Spending tens of millions of tax dollars to build a massive bureaucracy would be self defeating.21</blockquote><p>	The program has failed to demonstrate an ability to leverage other private sector money and is spending far more of the taxpayers' money.<p>	According to the Corporation for National Service, the total direct compensation package for an AmeriCorps "volunteer" is worth nearly $13,000 for approximately 10 months of work -- nearly $15,900 on an annual basis. This is more than the amount that 42.3 percent of young householders, ages 15-24, take home as pay on an annual basis.22 Moreover, AmeriCorps "volunteers" have a greater opportunity to obtain additional benefits and grants than many workers in the private sector, including those with secondary degrees and years of work experience. For instance, each "volunteer" is paid a $7,400 cash stipend along with a $4,725 tuition credit. In addition, the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, the legislation which created AmeriCorps, allows states and service organizations to supplement the federal compensation package. These "volunteers" can be paid up to twice the minimum wage, or $8.50 per hour, and still be eligible for the $4,725 education credit and free medical and child care benefits.
<p>
	Although the average AmeriCorps "volunteer" receives approximately $13,000 in benefits, the GAO found that the total average cost per "volunteer" is nearly $27,000. Therefore, more than half of the cost is going to bureaucracy and overhead -- not even to the young people participating. For instance, the Navy's Seaborne Conservation Corps costs $66,715 per "volunteer" and $49.06 per hour of direct service; the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps costs $42,758 per participant and $31.44 per hour of direct service; and Magic Me of Baltimore, Maryland, costs $49,652 per participant and $36.51 per hour of direct service.23<p>	Surprisingly, in a recent editorial, <i>Washington Post</i> journalist E.J. Dionne, Jr., suggested that AmeriCorps should continue because "government agencies can accomplish useful things at a low price."24  But AmeriCorps is not low cost, and it is still a mere assertion of opinion that agencies are accomplishing useful things. Regardless of where the resources come from, "volunteers" are compensated better than many young adults in the private sector.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared that "National service will be America at its best -- building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility. National service is a challenge for Americans from every background and way of life, and it values something far more than money."25  The President's rhetoric is appealing. However, despite a $1.7 million public relations budget, the laudable goals of AmeriCorps do not match its reality. AmeriCorps sounds good on paper, but it is nothing more than an expensive and largely bureaucratic government jobs program. It does little to promote the true spirit of volunteerism and lacks any means-testing assurances that its financial rewards actually will go to those most in need of college assistance. 
<p>
	 Congress should repeal the AmeriCorps program.

<h2>Legal Disservices Corp.: There Are Better Ways To Provide Legal Aid to the Poor</h2>

<b>Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty </b></center><p>
Subscribe to <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">Policy Review</a><br>Send a <a href="mailto:moffettk@heritage.org">Letter to the Editor</a><p>
	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<blockquote>
<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."

<hr length=70%> <blockquote>
<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."

<h3>   
<center>TOWN HALL Hosts Bob Dornan Conference On-Line<br>
CompuServe reserves Convention Center for event</center>
</h3>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC, September 18, 1995 -- Town Hall announced today that it will be hosting an on-line conference featuring California Republican Congressman and presidential hopeful, Robert "B-1 Bob" Dornan. The conference will be held in the CompuServe convention center on Friday, September 22, 1995 from 9:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. (EST).  Any CompuServe member can participate by typing CONVENTION at the GO prompt.
<P>
Rep. Dornan will discuss his race for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination and why he believes it so important that the views he holds be openly and strongly discussed in the public arena. These views include tax relief for American families, a Balanced Budget Amendment, the protection of innocent, pre-born children, school choice and school prayer, a strong national defense and immigration reform.
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dornan's views are often attacked by the national
media as "extremist" or "far right." But Dornan, an Irish-Catholic who
scored a perfect 1994 rating from the American Conservative Union
(ACU), has confounded critics by consistently winning in a majority
Democrat district without ever backing away from his core conservative
beliefs. 
<P>
This is Rep. Dornan's second on-line conference through Town Hall. The overwhelming popularity of his first conference required Town Hall to utilize the CompuServe's larger convention hall that has a capacity for over 1,000 on-line users.
<P>
Dornan represents California's 46th Congressional District -- a community that includes most of the Orange County cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. Rep. Dornan is Ranking Republican Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical and Technical Intelligence, Member of the House National Security Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Personnel.
<P>
Town Hall, Inc., based in Washington, DC, is the nation's leading interactive computer network for conservatives.  A project of The Heritage Foundation and National Review magazine, Town Hall offers conservatives both an Internet site (http://www.townhall.com) and a private forum on CompuServe to share ideas, conduct research, and plan strategy.  CompuServe users can access the Town Hall forum by typing TOWNHALL at the GO prompt.  Other personal computer users can obtain a free 30-day trial to Town Hall by calling 800-441-4142.

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<title>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION BUDGET</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation</h2>
<i>Number of Cabinet Agencies Would Shrink from 14 to 5</i>
<hr>
<h2>HERITAGE BUDGET PLAN PROPOSES "TOP-TO-BOTTOM" 
REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
WASHINGTON, APRIL 17, 1995 -- While almost everybody in the 
nation's capital, from President Clinton to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
continues to talk about "reinventing" or slimming down government, The 
Heritage Foundation today offered a comprehensive and detailed plan for 
actually doing so.<p>
The ambitious proposal, released today in draft form, "examines every 
nook and cranny of the $1.6 trillion federal enterprise," a spokesman for 
the prominent think tank said. Every agency and every program within 
each agency was "put to the test."<p>
The Heritage Foundation plan was characterized by Vice President Stuart 
Butler as a "federalism budget" because many responsibilities would be 
transferred to state and local government. In putting the plan together, he 
said, a team of analysts conducted a Peter Drucker-style top-to-bottom 
review of the entire federal government<p>
The plan, according to budget expert Scott Hodge, would: 1) balance the 
federal budget by the year 2000, two years earlier than would have been 
required under the balanced-budget amendment, while providing $152 
billion in tax relief to families with children, business and the elderly; 2) 
end corporate welfare; 3) close down obsolete and wasteful programs, 
strengthen core programs that are legitimate functions of government, 
and transfer functions that "are not proper federal activities" to the states 
or the private sector; and 4) create several new agencies as part of the 
consolidation process.<p>
<center><h3>Medicare, Foreign Aid, Defense</center></h3><p>
To promote economic growth, the Heritage budget plan calls for cutting 
the effective capital gains tax rate in half; allowing businesses the 
equivalent of writing off capital investments in the year in which they are 
made, rather than stretching out the deductions; and creating new 
"Individual Retirement-Plus Accounts," which would provide tax-free 
income upon retirement (though contributions to such accounts would not 
be tax-deductible).<p>
Social Security would not be touched. Medicare, however, would 
undergo major surgery, offering to retirees a variety of medical plans and 
choices, similar to those enjoyed by federal employees and members of 
Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
Changes and cuts in the foreign-aid program would result in savings of 
$10 billion to $14.6-billion over five years.<p>
In keeping with the Heritage Foundation's view that the first priority of 
the federal government is to defend the nation and secure U.S. interests 
abroad, defense spending would be maintained at current levels, adjusted 
for inflation. This is about $130 billion more than the administration has 
called for over the next five years.<p>
Heritage analysts consistently have argued that the Clinton administration 
has underfunded its own defense plan, known as the "Bottom-Up 
Review," by some $100 billion over five years. The General Accounting 
Office (GAO) has placed the shortfall even higher, at $150 billion.<p>
House and Senate leaders have more or less gone along with the 
administration's funding plans. Heritage Foundation analysts, however, 
believe this is a mistake, arguing that funding at such low levels would 
require the United States to withdraw more forces from Europe or Asia. It 
also would mean leaving the United States vulnerable to ballistic missile 
attack. To fully fund the Bottom-Up Review force, the Heritage budget 
would add the needed $100 billion to the Clinton administration's 
proposed five-year defense budget, plus $30 billion for such new 
initiatives as ballistic-missile defense. (The Heritage Foundation is 
expected to publish its own missile-defense plan next month.)<p>
<center><h3>Top-to-Bottom Structural Reorganization</center></h3><p>
Butler said the Heritage plan would allow U.S. taxpayers to spend far 
more of their own money, rather than sending it to Washington for 
bureaucrats to spend. "The public realizes that the federal government is 
too expensive, mired in debt, and does a poor job of carrying out its core 
functions, while doing many things it shouldn't do. They want this to 
stop. That was the message of both the 1992 and 1994 elections. The 
Clinton administration has proposed nothing that would change 
fundamentally the way government works -- or its cost." What is needed, 
instead, Butler said -- and what The Heritage Foundation will present to 
Congress when the House and Senate return from their recess -- is a plan 
for the kind of "top-to-bottom structural reorganization" many businesses 
have undertaken in recent years.<p>
If the Heritage plan were fully implemented, Butler said, the number of 
Cabinet level departments of government would be reduced from 14 to 
five (Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, State and the 
Treasury). The Departments of Agriculture and Interior would be 
reorganized and reduced to sub-cabinet level independent agencies. The 
Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons programs and veterans 
programs now administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs would 
be shifted to the Department of Defense. <p>
Three major independent agencies -- the Federal Communications 
Commission, Interstate Commerce Commission and Small Business 
Administration -- would disappear entirely. The Departments of 
Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Labor, 
and Transportation -- like Energy and Veterans Affairs -- would be 
closed down, though some of their functions, as part of the overall 
streamlining and consolidation process, would be shifted to the states or 
moved elsewhere within the federal government.<p>
The new agencies proposed by The Heritage Foundation would 
consolidate various functions now scattered throughout the bureaucracy. 
Government research and data-collection functions, for example, would 
be moved from the Census Bureau (part of the slated-for-extinction 
Commerce Department), Bureau of Labor Statistics (Labor Department), 
and other agencies to a new Bureau of National Statistics. According to 
Butler, "An important purpose of this change is to house these functions 
within an agency characterized by a new ethos -- dispassionate data 
collection -- rather than within departments driven by policy-making."
Similarly, various environmental and land-management functions, now 
housed at the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, would be 
consolidated within a new Bureau of Natural Resources.<p>
Total spending reductions over five years would amount to more than 
$750 billion net. There also would be a net saving of $97 billion in 
interest on the national debt by the time the deficit is eliminated in the 
year 2000. (The Heritage Foundation report calculates future spending 
levels three different ways: using l) direct year-to-year spending 
comparisons, 2) government "baseline" spending projections, and 3) 
baseline projections, plus revenue from privatization and asset sales. 
Washington has been using the second method, measuring everything 
against a projected spending baseline.)<p>
<center><h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</center></h3><p>
Unlike the Clinton administration's and other budget proposals now being 
"vetted" in Washington, most of which focus solely on budget 
"functions" and costs, The Heritage Foundation blueprint provides 
Washington with step-by-step instructions on how to make the necessary 
changes.<p>
"It is very easy to say, 'Shut down the Departments of Commerce, 
Education, Energy, Labor, and Transportation and board up their doors.' 
But the process is far more complicated than that, so lawmakers need 
realistic advice on how you actually close down a government agency." 
Butler noted, "Some functions of these departments and the other 
agencies identified for extinction are necessary and proper, and worth 
continuing. The bureaucratic edifices within which these isolated 
programs now operate, however, are totally unnecessary and should be 
eliminated." Butler added that Heritage analysts already have been 
working with congressional task forces on how to conduct "radical 
surgery" on the government.<p>
<center><h3>Federalism, Privatization, Reorganization, Elimination</center></h3><p>
The Heritage budget plan was written by a team of analysts including 
Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, 
Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow and former director of privatization 
programs for the Office of Management and Budget, and Baker Spring, 
Heritage's senior defense policy analyst.<p>
To accomplish the objective of balancing the budget by the year 2002, 
while providing taxpayers with a "fiscal responsibility (tax-cut) 
dividend," the plan would:<p>
Limit the overall rate of increase in federal spending to just over 1 
percent per year. "Capping total spending [increases] ... does not mean 
every program must grow at that rate," Butler said. "It means that, taken 
together, programs cannot exceed that limit. If some high-priority 
programs grow faster," he added, "others must grow more slowly and 
others may have to be terminated." If Congress can't muster the political 
courage to make the cuts needed to stay within the legally binding 
ceiling, a bipartisan spending reduction commission -- similar to the 
military base-closing commission -- would be appointed, rather than 
instituting an across-the-board "sequester."<p>
Transfer to state and local governments programs more appropriately 
carried out at those levels of government. For example, more than 70 
means-tested anti-poverty programs, currently administered by the 
Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human 
Services, and Housing and Urban Development, would be included in a 
new welfare block grant that would be given to the states. The Heritage 
Foundation plan also would transfer most federal lands to the states, 
except for national parks and wilderness areas that are deemed to be "of 
national significance," and end the "earmarking" of funds for local 
transportation and other projects.<p>
Butler explained: "Congress should enact a federal budget that makes 
clear that the first responsibility of the federal government is an adequate 
national defense. Congress then should examine every other program to 
determine whether it is truly national in scope and can be carried out on a 
national scale only by the federal government. Funding for all agencies 
and programs that don't meet this test, such as many education, welfare, 
health (and) transportation ... programs should be transferred to the states, 
or the money returned to the people as federal tax relief."<p>
Privatize all commercial activities of government. The proposal calls for 
the sale of the following federal assets: the $200 billion federal direct-
loan portfolio; Amtrak; the federal Power Marketing Administrations; the 
hydroelectric dams currently operated by the Army Corps of Engineers 
and Bureau of Reclamation; most of the National Weather Service; the 
Naval Petroleum Reserve, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Federal Helium 
Reserves, and U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation; many real-estate 
holdings; and most of the 1,200 non-defense aircraft owned by the 
government.<p>
Eliminate corporate welfare. The Heritage Foundation budget plan would 
terminate dozens of programs that directly or indirectly subsidize private 
businesses, including all agricultural subsidies and commercial 
agricultural research programs, energy research programs, NASA's 
commercial aeronautic research and development programs, export credit 
guarantee programs, and export enhancement and "market promotion" 
programs. Also headed for the chopping block: Airport Grants-in-Aid 
and Essential Air Service Program (Transportation Department), Bureau 
of Export Administration (Commerce), Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (independent), Economic Development Administration 
(Commerce), Farmers Home Administration and Farm Credit System 
(Agriculture), International Trade Administration (Commerce), Minority 
Business Development Agency (Commerce), Next Generation High-
Speed Rail Program (Transportation), Small Business Administration 
(independent), and U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (Commerce). 
All government ties and taxpayer guarantees to the Federal Home Loan 
Bank System, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp., and Government National Mortgage Association 
would be terminated.<p>
End programs that don't work, "have become outmoded or obsolete, that 
duplicate other programs, or that do not involve legitimate government 
functions."<p>
"Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost never die, 
bureaus, agencies and programs that duplicate each other's function's 
have sprung up all over the government," Butler observed. Vice President 
Al Gore's National Performance Review, for example, noted that 14 
separate government departments and agencies spend $24 billion a year 
on 150 employment and training programs; 11 different federal 
departments and agencies administer 340 separate programs for families 
and children; and the Department of Commerce shares its mission with at 
least 7l federal departments, agencies and offices.<p>
The Heritage Foundation budget plan would close down many of the 
government's 1,200 "independent commissions, councils and boards," 
would sharply reduce the size and scope of the 170-year-old Army Corps 
of Engineers, and would close down, among other agencies, the 85-year-
old Bureau of Mines (Interior Department), 81-year-old Agricultural 
Extension Service (Agriculture), the 60-year-old Soil Conservation 
Service (Agriculture: now called the Natural Resource Conservation 
Service), the 60-year-old Rural Electrification Administration 
(Agriculture: now called the Rural Utilities Service); the 70-year-old 
National Fertilizer Development Center (part of the independent 
Tennessee Valley Authority: now called the TVA Environmental 
Research Center), and the 108-year-old Interstate Commerce 
Commission (independent).<p>
Butler said, "This is not the time to be timid. The federal government 
now consists of layer upon layer of bureaucratic waste, duplication and 
inefficiency. This was documented during the Reagan era by the Grace 
Commission and more recently by Vice President Gore's National 
Performance Review. "In addition, the federal bureaucracy has been 
assigned, or has assigned to itself, numerous tasks that are best left to the 
states, the private sector, or individuals.<p>
"Rather than tinkering at the margins, Washington needs to act with 
intelligence and resolve. We hope the Heritage budget plan will inspire 
the Congress and White House to accept the challenge."<p>

   In a speech some hailed as courageous and others said was classic Clinton, the President said July 19 that race
and gender preferences are fair, and have lived up to their purpose of removing obstacles blocking opportunities for
minorities and women. He issued a directive to federal departments and a 100-page report advocating reforms to
ensure that programs benefit those who need help the most.<p>
     The President ordered the elimination or overhaul of any program that "creates a quota, creates preferences
for unqualified individuals, creates reverse discrimination or continues even after its equal opportunity purposes
have been achieved."<P>
     Clinton also called for a new federal set-aside program to target federal contracts to businesses in poor
areas even if they are owned by whites.  Currently, set-asides are reserved for women and minorities.<P>
     The president's remarks cheered leaders of women's groups and minorities, who are an instrumental part
of his political base.  Myrlie Evers-Williams, head of the NAACP, praised Clinton for "his bold, decisive
statement."<P>
     But Rep. Gary Franks, a black Republican from Connecticut, said Clinton's proposals could only add to
"the stigma of any person of color" who must repeatedly proved his or her qualifications. Franks sought,
unsuccessfully, to attach an amendment to a defense spending bill that would wipe out race-and gender-based
preferences for future federal contracts.  The House delayed consideration of the FY96 defense appropriations
measure until after the August recess and, thus, scuttled Franks' amendment in the process.<P>
     In sharp attack at the House leadership, Franks said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) And others
indicated they supported his proposal and would back his effort to attach the measure to the defense spending bill. 
Instead, the Rules Committee did not even vote on whether to grant Franks a waiver.  It approved by unanimous
voice vote a rule government floor debate under which Franks' proposal could be easily killed.<P>
     "I was lied to for seven weeks," Franks said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, adding that
it left "a bitter taste in [his] mouth."  According to Franks, House leaders lost their nerve after members of the
Congressional Black Caucus threatened to use parliamentary tactics to tie up the House to block the Franks
amendment.<P>
     Gingrich has been criticized within his party recently for saying the GOP should go a bit slower on the
affirmative action front until the party has a positive agenda to promote to potential black voters.  The House
Speaker is wise in this regard and is on the right track, despite what some conservatives say.<P>  
     Since the party does not have a record of defending civil rights in the recent past, it lacks the moral
authority at this time to simply do away with those measures which have offered some protections to minorities and
women.  The GOP must present an alternative approach.  Simply saying society should now be color-blind, when it
is clearly not, is either naive or cynical.<P>
     Along with Gingrich, presidential candidate Lamar Alexander has perhaps made the most sensible
suggestion regarding the GOP's approach to affirmative action.  "We need to be talking about equal opportunity,"
he said on CNN's "Inside Politics" program on Aug. 2.  "When we talk about racial preferences, we need to also say
we're against racial discrimination.  We have to be very careful concerning this issue," he added.<P>
     Alexander is right.  Affirmative action is a delicate, emotionally charged issue and all politicians would do
well to handle it in a thoughtful manner.<p>
<a name="democratic"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   The Democratic Party has targeted two Congressional seats currently held by black Republicans for defeat in
1996.  Republican Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma were both listed in a directive
called "Majority  96," in which the Democrats indicated the seats by state they'd like to regain in order to have a
majority in the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
     The directive says Franks "won with only 52% of the vote in 1994.  Bush won the district, but it can be
easily claimed by the Democrats in 1996."<P>
     Regarding Watts, the edict described him as the freshman who "won seat vacated by Dave McCurdy with a
low 51% of the vote" (actually, Watts received 52%).  "This charismatic quarterback led the Oklahoma University
Sooners in the early  80s and won over his Democratic district in 1994," the document continued.  "While
consistently a Democratic area, the district nevertheless favored Bush by 9 points in 1992."<P>
     Other districts targeted included the 9th District of Texas, currently represented by Steve Stockman; the
22nd District of California, represented by freshman Andrea Seastrand who narrowly won Michael Huffington's
open seat with 49% of the vote; and the 1st District of Idaho, represented by Helen Chenoweth.<p>

<a name="memo"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Democrats often accuse Republicans of playing the race card, but an internal memo sent to President Clinton
from his pollster, Stanley Greenberg, demonstrates that while Democrats claim to be "color-blind" in public, they
play racial politics behind the scenes.<P>
     The memo, dated July 5, 1995, is addressed to the Clintons and Gores, White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Harold Ickes and Erskine Bowles, and the President's Senior Advisor George
Stephanopoulos.  The contents were revealed in a CNN "Inside Politics" broadcast in August.<P>
     "The President is fundamentally mispositioned for 1996, and. . .white downscale voters question whether
Mr. Clinton's initiatives matter to them and whether he understands and identifies with their lives and daily
struggles," said Greenberg's memo.  The memo cites specific groups the President needs to win over or win back
next year: White working class women, union members, older working class men and rural Latinos."<p>

<a name="finance"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   A principal operative for the Alan Keyes presidential campaign has resigned and signed on with Pat Buchanan's
campaign team.<P>
     Arthur Rocker, former finance director for candidate Keyes, agreed to join Buchanan as a national co-chairman, he said in an interview.  Rocker officially accepted the position Aug. 8.<P>
     Rocker recruited Keyes to run for president last fall and played a major role in the formation of the
exploratory committee.  After helping Keyes raise more than $300,000 during the first six months of the year,
Rocker left the campaign, saying, "I'm disgusted with his [Keyes'] organizational skills and question his leadership
ability."<P>
     For its part, the Keyes campaign said Rocker had been the source of "still-unresolved discrepancies in the
finances" of the exploratory committee.  However, the Keyes organization is the only one among the Republican
presidential candidates which has failed to file a Federal Elections Commission financial disclosure report or
requested an extension.  Keyes says he was "too busy to do it," according to a Baltimore Sun report.<P>
     The fundraising specialist said that, as a Buchanan operative, he would do whatever was asked of him.  "I
admire Buchanan's commitment to conservative values.  He's been consistent in his positions over the years," said
Rocker.<p>

<a href="#quick">(back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   House Speaker Newt Gingrich dropped into unfamiliar surroundings the evening of Aug. 2 as he listened for
more than an hour to residents of Washington asking--and sometimes begging--him to help their city out of its
morass of problems.<P>
     Billed as a discussion in town-meeting style, as part of the House Republicans' effort to find solutions to
decades of urban ills, it quickly became something much more.  Nearly 1,000 people attended the forum and
hundreds more were unable to get into the packed high school auditorium.  This meeting was the first of several the
speaker has planned to address the city's budget crisis and deteriorating public schools.<P>
     But this may have been part of the problem.  There was an obvious mood filled with unrealistic
expectations as audience participants asked the speaker questions as varied as how to get parents more involved
with their children's educational process to how to get rid of the current school superintendent.<P>
     Gingrich was booed when introduced, but the questioners were, for the most part, respectful.<P>
     Sharing the stage with top local Democrats--Mayor Marion Barry and congressional delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton, plus Jesse Jackson--Gingrich acknowledged the improbable grouping.<P>
     He joked that months ago, the odds that he and Barry would be on the same platform and working together
were "probably as good as some folks would have given against my being speaker or (Barry) being mayor again."<P>
     Both Barry and Jackson sat in silence as Gingrich spoke.<P>
     Even though the previous Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, lived on Capitol Hill during his final
years in office, he never engaged city residents in the style that Gingrich did.  The gathering is supposed to be the
first such session for Gingrich, who has said he will attend them.<P>
     "Tonight is a beginning," Gingrich told a woman who asked about the quality of Washington's public
schools now and in the future.  "I can't assure you that as a group we'll make a big difference.  I can't give you a
date or even guarantee that it will happen.  But we will reach out and do everything we can to improve resources
and safety to have a healthy Washington."<P>
     Barry, the popular four-term mayor who managed a comeback after leaving office in disgrace because of a
cocaine conviction, said he and Gingrich were putting political differences aside to collaborate on making
Washington "the finest capital anywhere in the world."<P>
     Team play was the evening's official theme and Norton warmly credited Gingrich with garnering some
$200 million in federal highway funds for city road repairs.  Norton, who has tried hard to insure that city residents
are not excluded from the exchange of ideas for saving their city, was largely responsible for the speaker's
appearance.<P>
     In the face of periodic insults, Gingrich stood at the lectern taking copious notes, nodding in agreement and
responding only occasionally to questions asked.  He won applause when he promised residents "significant" tax
relief and world-class schools.<P>
     "We do not have the right to micromanage the lives of the people who live in this city," he assured the
attendees.  Congress earlier this year established a federal board to control the city's finances.<P>
     In August, the speaker's task force on the D.C. economy recommended a federal income tax credit and
other tax breaks--totaling between $1.3 billion and $2.7 billion--to attract and keep residents and businesses in the
city.<P>
     Gingrich and Wisconsin Rep. Steve Gunderson also unveiled a plan to raise private-sector funds for
equipment, maintenance and repairs in the public schools, which opened nearly a week late last September because
of thousands of fire code violations.<P>
     A second fund-raising drive would establish a scholarship fund for low-income families who would prefer
to send their children to private schools, said Gunderson, leader of the House Republicans' task force on D.C.
schools.<P>
     Later that day, at a brief news conference, he pronounced the meeting a success.
     "What surprised me the most, and pleased me the most," he said, "was the calm intensity" of people in the
audience.  "Here were people who were frustrated, who felt Congress had dealt with them unfairly in the past.  But
they were back one more time."<P>

<title> Kicking America's Welfare Habit -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture #540</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3> Kicking America's Welfare Habit: Politics, Illegitimacy, and Personal Responsibility</h3><br>
<p>By The Honorable Pete Wilson, Governor of California. Governor Wilson spoke at The Heritage Foundation's Lehrman Auditorium. Wednesday, September 6, 1995. His speech was sponsored by The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">Governors' Forum</a>. 
<p> 

It's a pleasure to be back at Heritage. I've enjoyed your hospitality many times before.
Your willingness to hear from the nation's governors is just one bit of evidence that this institution has the wisdom-- all too rare in this town -- to know that Washington doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas.  
<P>  
The American people are fed up with an arrogant and out-of-touch federal government. That's what fueled  
the ballot box rebellion of 1994. 

Yet, despite the enormous success of the House Republicans in delivering on the Contract with America,  
voters remain deeply cynical about Washington's ability to make change. 
  
In fact, a poll done last week by <i>USA Today</i> showed voters' faith in Congress at an historic low. 

Why? Well, I can't think of a better example of what fuels voter cynicism about Washington than the status  
of welfare reform. 
<P>  
The American people are justifiably outraged by a federal welfare system that contradicts their values. It  
penalizes work, discourages marriage, and encourages illegitimacy. 

A foreign power bent on ruining America couldn't have designed a more destructive system than the one  
Washington has imposed on the American people. 

That's why in 1992, a candidate who promised to "end welfare as we know it" held such appeal for many  
voters. But what we've seen since has only deepened their contempt for D.C. 
<P>  
Bill Clinton has been President for almost a thousand days, three quarters of it with heavy Democratic  
majorities in Congress. 

And how far has he gotten on his pledge? 

Well he spent $33 billion of the taxpayers money on "welfare as we know it." 

Nearly a million more people have enrolled in "welfare as we know it." 

And today, 600,000 more children are living on "welfare as we know it." 
 <P> 
But Bill Clinton hasn't changed one word of federal law to "end welfare as we know it." Not one. 

Cal Ripken isn't the only guy with a streak still going strong. 

Every day Bill Clinton sits on the Oval Office, he's still not ending welfare as we know it.  He's extending  
welfare, and he knows it. 
<P>  
Voters understand that it is possible to change welfare. 

Millions of them -- in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and California --  
have seen their governors do it, often with bipartisan support, often with limited resources, and often  
despite lawsuits from the welfare defenders. 

In California, I've reduced welfare grants by 20 percent, saved the taxpayers $9 billion, doubled the  
number of welfare recipients at work, and insisted that teenage parents on welfare live in their parents'  
home, that parents get the check, and the girl stay in school to learn the skills that will let her and her child  
escape welfare. 
<P>  
By contrast, the federal model of welfare simply provides a welfare check to an unwed child-mother -- who  
is too young to get a driver's license -- so she can move out to her own apartment.  How utterly  
irresponsible. 

Then she is given even more accessible prey to the next man seeking a junior-high school one-night stand  
romance. 

It doesn't have to be that way.  People can escape welfare.  But it takes work, and it happens one person at  
a time. 

A great example is Trish Molina. 
<P>  
I met Trish in California's Riverside County after she graduated from our successful welfare work program  
known as GAIN. 
 
She got an entry-level job at a small wireless cable company.  She's since been promoted three times.  
  
Today, she's the assistant to the head of the company.  She's happy. She loves her career.  She just needed  
the skills and discipline to take a job and stick with it. 

Most important, the job isn't just helping her, it's helping her children. 

They now have the example of a mother who gets up every morning and goes to work, teaching them what  
it means to accept responsibility for yourself and contribute to your community. 
 <P>
The young mother says that now that she's working she respects herself and her children respect her too. 

That's why we need welfare reform that demands personal responsibility, encourages work and discourages  
irresponsible behavior. 

Yet, President Clinton has not only failed to make significant welfare reform in Washington, he's actually  
blocked state like mine that are trying to make that change. 
<p>
At a meeting of the nation's governors, he promised to approve welfare waivers in 90 days or less, whether  
he agreed with the changes or not. 
 
In California, we sought a federal waiver for one reform we wanted to make to reduce welfare grants...and  
to make work more attractive than welfare. 
 
That was over a year ago. 

And the Clinton Administration continues to delay it at a cost to traxpayers of $3 million a week. 
<P>  
We've sought another waiver since November. 

This one would allow us to end the practice of giving larger and larger welfare checks to women who have  
more and more children while already on welfare. 

We think it's simply wrong to reward that kind of irresponsible behavior.  Working families don't get an  
automatic pay raise when they have more children, so why should women on welfare? 

And why should a young couple working and saving to have a child be taxed to subsidize that welfare  
mother's irresponsibility? 
<P>
It seems simple enough to me, but it took the Clinton Administration months to respond to our request. 
 

Then, in twisted logic that could only make sense to Washington, the Clinton Administration decided we 
could stop rewarding adults for having more and more children on welfare...but they insisted we had to 
continue rewarding teenagers for the same irresponsible behavior. 
<P>
Well, I've got news for them: Having more and more children on welfare is wrong whether you're and adult 
or a teenager. 

That's why I refuse to accept this absurd condition from President Clinton. 

Today, I'm rejecting President Clinton's half-baked waiver and insisting that he live up to his promise.

Mr. President, grant this waiver and every other waiver California has requested as you promised you 
would...with no strings attached. 
 
It's what you promised the American people.  Have the guts to keep your word. 
<P>  
Unfortunately, like a lot of voters, I'm skeptical he will. 
<P>
And his continued failure to reform welfare is why action in the Congress is so important.  Congress is our 
last best hope for real reform. 

When the House passed welfare reform in less than 100 days, a skeptical public were given a glimmer of 
hope that things might really be changing in Washington.  

But then, welfare reform landed in the Senate. 
<P>  
More and more, the Senate looks like the graveyard for the Contract with America. 

0n the balanced budget amendment.  On tax cuts.  On the crime bill.  And now, on welfare reform.

The Senate's continued delay holds states hostage to the whims of Bill Clinton's welfare bureaucrats.  We 
are compelled to wrench reform from hostile guardians of the status quo. 
 <P>
Worse yet, the compromises being cut in the Senate raise serious doubts as to whether the Senate 
Republican Leader really understands the mandate voters gave us last November to make drastic change.

There's been plenty of hot rhetoric on the Senate floor about freeing states from federal mandates.

But under the Dole welfare compromise, states would be denied the chance to make even the most basic 
decisions. 

In many cases, Senator Dole would simply leave us with watered-down version of current law. 
<P>  
For example, Senator Dole's compromise would continue to set the minimum level a state must spend on 
welfare. 

A similar, so-called "maintenance of effort requirement" in current law is what's preventing me from 
saving taxpayers $3 million a week. 

Why would a Republican committed to fundamental change support a federal mandate like that?

Congress has no business dictating terms like that to the states. 

California is a proud and sovereign state, not a colony of the federal government. 
<P>
In another concession to Senate liberals, Senator Dole has agreed to extend federal disability benefits to 
individuals whose only disability is self-inflicting drug and alcohol abuse.

Today, nearly 100,000 individuals collect such benefits.  And the number grew nearly six-fold in five years.

But why should that surprise us?

What alcoholic would pass up a chance to have the taxpayers pick up their bar tab?
<P>
That's why the House welfare bill ended this absurd practice next month.

The budget I just signed would end these benefits on the same day.  But Senator Dole's bill would force us 
to continue paying these benefits for more than a year. In California alone, that would cost taxpayers more 
than $1 million a week.

That's not only an insult to taxpayers, it's an outrage for the federal government to be subsidizing 
someone's addiction.  As the head of one homeless shelter described it, it's "suicide on the installment 
plan."
<p>
It's wrong and it's got to stop.
<P>
Yet, even as Senator Dole is imposing these indefensible mandates on the states, he's ignoring the one 
crisis that deserves national attention -- the epidemic of out-of-wedlock teen births.

Today, one in tree children is born out of wedlock. In some of America's largest cities, more children are 
born to unmarried women than into two-parent families.

And the 14-year-old girl who becomes an unwed mother is all too likely to give birth to a girl who will 
become a 14-year-old unwed mother herself, or a boy who will become a 14-year-old triggerman for a 
drug gang.
<P> 
If Senator Dole is truly concerned about the crisis of values in America, he should not be content with 
talking about the perverse values promoted by our popular media.  He should start doing something about 
the perverse values promoted by the federal welfare system.

The Contract with America included many reforms we've made in California to stem this crisis of 
illegitimacy.

It stops rewarding women with bigger welfare checks for having more and more children out-of-wedlock.

Yet, Senator Dole excluded this important change from the Senate version of the bill.  He was unwilling to 
include this fundamental reform.
<P>
It is not leadership to settle for less than the fundamental change we need by cutting deals which 
compromise our values.

We must demand nothing less than the courage and conviction to make fundamental change in policy...if 
we're to have any hope of changing a tragically permissive culture.

America deserves better, and must demand it.
<P>
If we make these changes, we'll free millions of Americans from the chains of dependency that stifle 
opportunity.

We'll renew the dream of a nation where work is respected and rewarded and where rights are balanced by 
responsibility.
<P>
The biggest mistake we can make is to be too timid in our reforms.  The task we face is great, but we dare 
not miss this opportunity.  It may not come again soon.

Thank you, very much.  Now, I'd be happy to take your questions.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<CENTER><H2>Guess the Bureaucracy</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight provides you with the chance to learn a little bit about some more of the organizations that run on your hard earned money--government bureaucracies.
 More bureaucracies were featured in last week's Spotlight, and they are now labeled and linked to relevant articles.  <a href="/townhall/infotain/12-11-95/answers.html">Check it out!</a>

<br>

<A HREF="8.jpg"><IMG SRC="8.gif" ALT="PHOTO" align="left"></A><h3><a href="http://www.dot.gov">US Department of Transportation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This department was created in 1966 to oversee the growth in urban mass transit programs, air traffic, and construction of the Interstate Highway System.
<li>Because each member of Congress tries to assure that his or her state or district recieve as much pork as possible, this department regularly funds expensive, low-priority projects over more sensible, appropriate ones.
<li>Congress earmaked 129 surface projects, at an annual cost of $250 million in FY 1995. During the same year, $1.5 billion was appropriated for airport grants-in-aid, including nearly $5 million for the Jimmy Stewart Airport in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.
<li>19% (18,000 workers) of its civilian staff was furloughed in the first government shutdown.

<A HREF="9.jpg"><IMG SRC="9.gif" ALT="PHOTO" align="left"></A><h3><a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/defenselink">US Department of Defense</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Made infamous in the 1980s for purchasing $12 "portable language inscribers" (a.k.a. "pencils"), $45 hammers, and $130 toilet seats, this bureaucracy has shaped up considerably in recent years.
<li>The Clinton Administration underfunded even its own Bottom-Up Review of this Department by $100 million in 1995, and neglected to budget for unexpected emergency actions, like the one to Haiti.
<li>258,000 civilian employees (31% of its overall staff), labelled non-essential, didn't show have to commute to this 5-sided building during the first shutdown.

Hall</h2>
This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading into 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

<center><h2>ON EVE OF SUMMIT, ASIAN COUNTRIES QUESTION U.S. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<P>
	<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1996</b> -- When President Clinton attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines next Monday, he'll have some explaining to do. Specifically, he'll have to tell America's Asian trading partners why his administration seems so much less committed to free trade than it used to be, according to a Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
<P>	"The president's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region," says Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a>. In fact, the administration's vacillation on free trade has damaged U.S. credibility so badly that one Asian leader, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, has revived the idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. 
<P>
	Open trade with the 18 APEC economies (including Canada, Mexico and Chile) is crucial to America's future, O'Quinn says. Taken together, APEC economies have a gross domestic product exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. Nearly two-thirds of America's two-way merchandise trade is with APEC countries, and exports to APEC countries provide jobs for 7.3 million American workers. 
<P>	For this reason, O'Quinn says, it is important that President Clinton take <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc144.html">specific steps</a> to reassure Asia about America's commitment to free trade with the region, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Asking Congress for "fast-track" authority to negotiate free-trade agreements without getting bogged down in contentious labor or environmental issues;
<P>
<LI> Bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of 1997, which would show other APEC countries America's willingness to embrace free trade with a country not on the U.S. border;
<P>
<LI> Inviting other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Peru, to join APEC, which would shift the balance of power within the trade group away from the "go slow" countries of China, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia; and
<P>
<LI> Asking Congress to eliminate agriculture-export subsidies and the sugar and dairy programs, which would improve relations with a number of APEC nations (and save U.S. taxpayers $10 billion a year).

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>HERITAGE CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> <FONT SIZE=4>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1996 --</FONT></B> The 105th
Congress should take full advantage of the revolution in telecommunications
technology to make available on the Internet all disclosable information
having to do with the laws it passes and how it conducts its business,
a pair of Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1098.html">said today</a>.
<P>
 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, director of Heritage's Government
Reform Project, and research assistant August Stofferahn, &quot;By
taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on
the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of
specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more
complex freedom of information procedures established for the
executive branch.&quot;
<P>
 In addition, the analysts say, the move would provide a needed
reform. &quot;Through key institutional and procedural reforms,
the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network
of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades,&quot;
Weinstein and Stofferahn said. &quot;A Congressional Freedom of
Information Act (CFOIA) would complete and confirm the move toward
open access to Congress.&quot;
<P>
 In addition to areas that already have been opened to the public
through the Internet -- such as THOMAS, the Library of Congress'
on-line legislative information service, and the GPO (Goverment
Printing Office) Access system, which features 58 information
databases produced by the federal government -- the U.S. House
of Representatives' Task Force on Committee Review already has
recommended that Congress' new open-door policy be expanded. Specifically,
the task force has called for amendments to bills, committee and
subcommittee prints and reports, and oversight plans and activities
to be placed on the Internet. Similarly, the U.S. Senate has sought
to use information technology to publicize its activities more
extensively through its &quot;Operation Daylight.&quot; 
<P>
 But Weinstein and Stofferahn say Congress should go further.
Under a CFOIA, all information currently made available to the
public would become available through the Internet. In addition
to the committee documents detailed by the House task force, Congress
would add issue briefs, spending reports, voting records, the
content of mass mailings, financial and lobbying disclosure documents,
and a host of other items.
<P>
 &quot;Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means
to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected
representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back
room politics than any other single reform,&quot; the analysts
say. &quot;The 30 million American families with personal computers
would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the
activities of Congress and their particular representatives. In
addition, other citizens could take advantage of the numerous
possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university
libraries to find timely information on current legislation that
may affect their lives.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Overall,&quot; Weinstein and Stofferahn say, &quot;these
changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive
to the average citizen.&quot;

<title>Next Administration Can Restore U.S. Free-Trade Leadership in Latin America -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>
NEXT ADMINISTRATION CAN RESTORE 
U.S. FREE-TRADE LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1996 </b> -- The most important trade goal for the next administration should be the creation of a hemisphere-wide <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1092.html">free-trade area</a> linking the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the South American Common Market (Mercosur), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and other countries into a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the collapse of the Mexican peso on Dec. 20, 1994, but the United States has not," according to Latin America and Trade Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John P. Sweeney</a>. "The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization and efforts to create an FTAA. However, the United States appears to have turned its back on Latin America, allowing U.S. relations with important trading partners to deteriorate significantly on issues such as trade, Cuba, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and allowing countries like Brazil to fill the leadership vacuum."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sweeney says U.S. reluctance to expand NAFTA to other countries such as Chile has not interrupted hemispheric trade expansion -- it has simply left the United States out. "Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Mercosur also wants to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union," Sweeney points out. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"No one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free-trade express in the Western Hemisphere," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Among the 10 steps Sweeney says the next U.S. administration should take to regain its leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America:<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track trade negotiating authority.</b> "No country will invest the time or human or financial resources necessary to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress," Sweeney points out. "Making renewal of fast track one of the first actions of a new administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the United States has re-engaged in the FTAA process," he says.
<p>
<li><b>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.</b> "The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur," Sweeney says. Also, NAFTA has enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the United States, causing the rate of growth for apparel imports from the CBI countries into the United States to fall from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996. Apparel imports from Mexico grew by 41 percent during the same period. To redress this unforeseen imbalance, Sweeney says, the CBI countries should be included in NAFTA. 
<p>
<li><b> Launch a dialogue for integrating NAFTA and Mercosur into an FTAA by 2005.</b> "The United States has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing," Sweeney says. "Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade practices as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005."
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis, and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration is reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on track," Sweeney says. "If the administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline."

<title>Poor Children Would Benefit From School Choice, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2> POOR CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM 
 SCHOOL CHOICE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 26, 1996</b> -- As the new school year begins, Congress will be considering legislation that would allow tax dollars to be used for special scholarships so poor children can attend the schools of their choice, private or public. According to a Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1088.html">study</a> released today, such scholarships could make a real difference in the lives of children from poor families. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The proposed legislation, called Title II, The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would allow each locality to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maximum value no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education in the local public school district.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose schools they prefer," says <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>, senior fellow in education at Heritage and author of the study. "The  reason why the Clintons and the Gores, as well as other members of the nation's social and political elite, select private schools is simple: Empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority students," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For example, Doyle says compelling research by the late Johns Hopkins and University of Chicago scholar James Coleman points out that Catholic schools have benefitted poor and minority children in numerous ways. Coleman's research found, for example, that Catholic school sophomores scored 10 percent higher in science, 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading and vocabulary than their public-school+ counterparts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A recent study by Harvard University and the University of Houston confirmed Coleman's research, showing that elementary school students who participated in the nation's first school-voucher program in Milwaukee scored higher on math and reading tests after four years than youngsters who stayed in public schools. In Milwaukee, 99 percent of the students receiving vouchers were black or Hispanic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Unfortunately for poor children, their only current educational choice lies in selecting between failed and failing public schools. The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996 offers a good first step toward giving poor children and their parents more and better educational options," Doyle says.

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 1996</b> -- A new approach to local police management emphasizing high recruitment standards, "community policing," and a high-tech focus on crime "hot spots" and repeat offenders -- coupled with a judicial system that keeps criminals behind bars -- can win the war on crime, according to a major Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">analysis</a> co-authored by former Attorney General <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III.</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
	The 33-page report, released today, proposes 21 specific actions local, state and federal officials can take to achieve the same dramatic reductions in crime that have been achieved in cities like New York, where in 1994 the murder rate declined 45 percent and major felonies dropped 12 percent (and 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995). 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident," according to Meese and co-author <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a>, Ph.D., Heritage's deputy director of domestic policy studies and the son of a Philadelphia police detective. "They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The most important lesson taught by the experience of the past several decades of rising crime, according to Meese and Moffit, is that police must be: 1) Well-paid, high-quality individuals in both achievement and character, actively recruited from the communities they patrol or from the military; 2) savvy peacekeepers, known personally by the neighborhoods they serve, able to spot troublemakers and, more often than not, quell disturbances before criminal acts occur; and 3) allowed to do their jobs, and not be constantly second-guessed by department higher-ups, nor demoralized by judges whose ideas of social justice put criminals back on the streets. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"If we're going to spend billions of dollars on combating crime," Meese and Moffit write, "we ought to use that money in the ways that have been shown to work and stop wasting them on ways that don't." For example, Meese and Moffit point out that the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which President Clinton vowed would place 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets, has increased the number of officers by just 17,000, and even these aren't necessarily in areas hardest hit by violent crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the advice Meese and Moffit offer to local police:
<p><ul>
	<b><li> Target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> "Successful police departments should focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place," according to Meese and Moffit. "Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. These areas should by the targets of short-term, unpredictable crackdowns that tell the criminal he stands a serious chance of getting caught. Police should also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime. They should be a routine target of police," they say.
<p>
<li><b> Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> "Too many metropolitan areas in the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical and character standards within police forces," Meese and Moffit say. If local police departments expect to make a dent in crime, they need to insist on high standards in both cognitive ability and personal integrity. 

<p>
"Responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits," Meese and Moffit say. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, "psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical strength and stamina requirements are also essential," they say. Most important of all, "background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, current and past associations and financial and marital stability, as well as evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse."
<P>	<li><b> Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> "Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies," Meese and Moffit say. These officers should be put "on the beat" and their administrative duties performed by clerical or other qualified personnel.  
<p>	<li><b> Aggressively recruit police officers from the ranks of the military, which would expand the number of well-qualified black and other minority applicants. </b> It is important that police departments reflect the demographic composition of their communities, especially in minority neighborhoods. This enables officers to understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit information vital to effective law enforcement, Meese and Moffit say. 

<p>
But local officials "should not be deceived by the false god of 'diversity' at the cost of excellence in the field." Instead, they say, local police departments "should aggressively seek out those members of minority groups who meet the high cognitive, physical and moral standards of the department, and offer them a pay level that will make law enforcement an attractive career option."	
<p>	The military offers a pool of personnel -- many of them minorities -- with many skills that would be useful in police work, they say. 
<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> "The most effective police officer is an insider; someone local residents know and respect. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible," say Meese and Moffit. Better still, "if the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors." For this reason, Meese and Moffit say local officials should consider offering low-cost housing loans as an incentive for police to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 
<p><li><b>Make police commanders directly accountable for results and police conduct.</b> It is absolutely essential, Meese and Moffit say, for police commanders to be held personally accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions, as well as the integrity and honest of their officers. This method, strictly followed by former NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton, resulted in "precincts that operated as miniature police departments," and managers who "rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity." </ul><p>
<b>What Washington Can Do</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Among the steps Congress can take that will truly aid state and local governments in combating crime, Meese and Moffit say, are the following: <ul>
<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety, and reform criminal procedure so it once again serves the purpose of putting criminals behind bars.</b> The Senate, which approves nominees to the federal judiciary, should refuse to give its consent to nominees who have a history of rulings that result in the release of criminals. 
<p>	In addition to what it has already done -- putting a stop the federal imposition of "prison caps," which commonly resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminals -- Congress should review the impact of the Miranda ruling, the so-called exclusionary rule, and reform the law to allow a good-faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations Meese and Moffit say. "As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of police," they say. 
<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those that impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> "Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities," Meese and Moffit say. "The Clinton administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more ... Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- and allow states and cities to solve their own problems."
<p><li><b>Provide more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> Meese and Moffit say this would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime," Meese and Moffit say. "In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	But success, they say, rests ultimately on intangibles as "courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community."

<h2> THINK TANK ECONOMIST IDENTIFIES
<br>THE "WORST TAX OF ALL" </h2></center>

<u>Calls for Estate-Tax Repeal</u>
<p>


	WASHINGTON, AUG. 19, 1996</b> -- It may be absent from political radar screens this election season, but a Heritage Foundation economist has identified what he considers the "worst tax of all."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It's the estate tax, and in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">new study</a> released today Heritage John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says it should be repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Consider the evidence, Beach says. The estate tax can confiscate a crushing 55 percent of an individual's lifetime assets, yet is so inefficient it may cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue. The estate tax slows the economy by encouraging consumption over investment and by keeping interest rates artificially high. And the estate tax punishes some of the very people "progressive taxation" is supposed to help: female and minority business owners struggling to enter the economic mainstream.<p>
<b>A Paltry Revenue Source</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Along with the gift tax, which requires payment of taxes on the value of lifetime gifts from parents to children, the estate tax brings in less than 1.7 percent of the federal government's total revenue. In 1995, for example, the tax generated just $14.7 billion in revenue -- but may have lost up to $11 billion, Beach says, as individuals shed their assets by giving them away to charities and others. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the primary reasons for this paltry revenue figure is the extraordinary lengths to which individuals will go to avoid paying estate taxes, Beach says. Not only do individuals spend an inordinate amount of time and money on "estate planning," which has become a euphemism for tax avoidance, but when that proves insufficient they resort to the next defensive measure: spend as much of their money as they can. In this way, Beach says, individuals only pay tax on their wealth as income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent, compared to the maximum rate of 55 percent under the estate tax (which, on top of the income tax, results in a tax bite of almost 70 percent).<p>
<b>Spend It Before You Die</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It doesn't even matter what they spend the money on -- cars, boats, second homes, even presidential elections. "The fact is," says Beach, "that the estate tax encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment on which he'll pay a 55 percent tax. The thinking behind this behavior is quite rational: Since you refuse to let me pass on my assets to my children, I'll spend them."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It is this kind of behavior that also helps explain why the estate tax acts as a drag on the economy, Beach says. The more individuals spend and consume, the less they save and invest. What's more, to the degree that individuals do continue to save and invest, they demand higher returns [interest rates] to offset the steep future tax they will pay. This raises the cost of capital to businesses, Beach says, which translates into lower levels of investment in plant and equipment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Perhaps most perniciously, the estate tax also hurts small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. Women re-entering the work force often find starting their own business the best economic opportunity, and minorities view businesses as a way to establish economic independence and give their children a boost up the economic ladder, Beach says. But businesses also constitute estates, raising the prospect that all the financial security these small-business owners have worked to achieve will evaporate once the owner dies. In fact, a 1995 survey highlighted by Beach showed that 58 percent of minority business owners believe their business will fail or have difficulty surviving after estate taxes kick in. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, there are approximately 16 million non-corporate family-owned businesses nationwide that may be affected by the estate tax. California, for example, has approximately 2.2 million; New York, 950,000; Texas, 1.6 million; Florida, 835,000; Illinois, 620,000; and Alabama, 208,000. In many cases, Beach says, these businesses won't survive the estate tax. The child who inherits the business will face such a crushing tax bill that the only viable option will be to sell it.<p>
<b>Repeal Would Boost Economy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In addition to chronicling the problems with the estate tax, Beach also asks what would happen to economic growth if it were repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Using two respected computer models of the U.S. economy -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 model by the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) -- he found that repeal would cause the economy to grow by an extra $3 billion (WEFA) to $11 billion (WUMM) per year between 1997 and 2005.  This translates into job growth over the same period of between 130,000 (WEFA) and 145,000 (WUMM). Using the WUMM model, Beach also estimates that repeal would boost household disposable income by $12 billion over the nine-year period; generate 49,000 new housing starts in its first year; and lower the cost of capital to business by at least two-tenths of a percent. "These numbers aren't huge," Beach says, "but they also are low-ball estimates. It may be that repealing the estate tax would produce much higher economic growth."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"In the end," Beach says, "the estate tax fails the cost-benefit test. Both the social and economic costs of the tax far exceed the revenue it produces for the government. If it were repealed, no one would miss it."

<title> Legislation Creating New Urban Policy Would Revive Poor Areas, Analysts Say - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> LEGISLATION CREATING NEW URBAN POLICY WOULD REVIVE POOR AREAS, ANALYSTS SAY
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 31, 1996</b> -- Congress is holding hearings this week on the American Community Renewal Act, a comprehensive bill to bring economic and moral renewal to the nation's most impoverished areas. A new <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib228.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> of the bill calls it "an excellent opportunity" to reverse 30 years of failed social policy.
<p>
	While the separate welfare reform legislation moving through Congress represents a step in the right direction, it omits many of the policy changes needed to aid the urban poor, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector. By providing tax and regulatory relief to economically depressed areas and by boosting the role religious institutions can play in addressing social ills, the American Community Renewal Act would do much more to help the poor overcome the poverty, drug abuse, family disintegration and crime that plague their communities, according to study authors Rector and Policy Analyst Christine Olson.
<p>
	Sponsored by Reps. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., and Jim Talent, R-Mo., the legislation "rejects the premise that all that is needed for our poorest communities are larger government benefit checks," the analysts say. Specifically, the bill would make the following policy changes:  <ul>
	<p><li>Reduce regulations and eliminate capital-gains taxes on assets held in 100 "renewal communities" across the nation. Research has shown that reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in impoverished areas can reduce unemployment by a third or more, the analysts say.
	<p><li>Provide poor parents with education scholarships that can be used to send their children to any school -- public, private or religious. "Giving poor parents the same choice in education enjoyed by middle- and upper-class families would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education and reduce the rate of school failure," Rector and Olson say. And by allowing parents to send their children to religious schools, "the sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is not only the most important aspect of a child's education but critical to solving social problems," they say.
	<p><li>Allow religious organizations to use federal funds to perform social-service work such as drug treatment. The social-science research shows religiously based drug-treatment programs are more effective than strictly secular programs, the analysts say. By prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations that have a proven track record of successfully treating substance abusers, Rector and Olson say, the bill would make the most of an underused solution to one of  the country's most pressing social problems.
	<p><li>Create a new charitable tax credit for donations given to charities whose primary purpose is to help the poor. "The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers are better able to decide where funds should go in their local communities than are bureaucrats in Washington," the analysts say. "The bill would encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social-service programs to help the poor."
	</ul><p>The American Community Renewal Act "gives Congress and the administration an opportunity to change the way the federal government has practiced community development for 30 years," the analysts say. "It respects the fact that low-income Americans want to help themselves, it builds on the successes of local organizations and community groups, and it harnesses the energy of the nation's churches and religious organizations in combating social ills."

	WASHINGTON, JULY 30, 1996</b> -- If history is any guide, the federal government's Aug. 1 estimate of how fast the economy grew in the second quarter of 1996 will be like most quarterly growth estimates of the past 20 years -- wrong. Probably very wrong.
<p>	According to a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi114.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the Commerce Department's regular quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP), the figures released by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have been off by an average of 50 percent during the nearly 20-year period beginning in 1976.
<p>	In some cases, the BEA couldn't even accurately say whether the economy had grown or contracted, economist William Beach found. From 1978 to 1991, for example, the BEA had to revise its numbers for 12 percent of all quarters to show that a "shrinking" economy had actually grown or that a "growing" economy had actually shrunk.
<p>	Citing the real effect the BEA's initial GDP forecasts can have on business decisions, Beach, the former chief economist for Sprint Corp., urges that the agency delay the release of growth numbers for at least 60 days, when fuller data will yield a more accurate picture of the economy.  "The federal government is forcing businesses to make decisions about jobs and investment based on faulty estimates of the economy's strength," he says. "In this regard, the GDP forecasts do more harm than good."
	<p>Frequently, the difference between the Commerce Department initial GDP estimates and the actual performance of the economy is extraordinary. For the first quarter of 1996, for example, the BEA initially said the economy grew by 2.8 percent.  Later revisions, however, put first quarter GDP growth at only 2.2 percent, a 20 percent downward revision.  More glaring was the error for the first quarter of 1992.  The BEA initially reported 2.0 percent growth, when later revisions showed the economy had grown 4.7 percent -- a 135 percent correction. 
	<p>The Heritage Foundation analysis found that the BEA underestimated the growth rate during President Reagan's two terms 63 percent of the time, while it has overestimated the growth rate 70 percent of the time during President Clinton's presidency.
	<p>Beach, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in political economy, does not fault the BEA. After all, he says, estimating quarterly GDP for the huge and highly complex U.S. economy will inevitably require "guesswork." What he does fault is the near-obsessive focus on quarterly GDP by politicians and the media, since the numbers tell so little about the actual strength of the economy. 
	<p>To get an accurate picture of the nation's economic health, he says, it is necessary to look at longer-term economic trends.
<p>	The GDP estimate for the second quarter of 1996, for example, may look good on paper, he says, but will mask the underlying economic trend -- which is downward. Beach notes that economic growth rates increased significantly from the first quarter of 1992 to the final quarter of 1994, but have been on a decline ever since. The fact that both the expansion and the slowdown have been punctuated by "spikes" in individual quarters does nothing to change the overall trend, he says.
<p>	The lesson? "Americans shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of economic prosperity, or insecurity, based on how the economy is supposedly performing during a single quarter," Beach says. "They also shouldn't be fooled by the political posturing that surrounds economic growth numbers. What counts is the longer term direction of the economy, and right now it's down."

<title> Credit Goes To Congress For Lower Deficit, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> CREDIT GOES TO CONGRESS FOR LOWER DEFICIT, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>



	WASHINGTON, JULY 26, 1996</b> -- If Congress hadn't stopped President Clinton from passing his 1996 budget, rejected his plans for $200 billion deficits well into the next century, and pushed through substantial cuts of its own, this year's deficit would be nowhere near the $117 billion recently projected  by the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113.html">according to Heritage Foundation budget analyst Scott Hodge</a>, the deficit would have come in at about what the Clinton administration originally proposed for 1996: a deficit of $211 billion.
<p>
	"It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting President Clinton's proposed deficit nearly in half," Hodge says. "Furthermore, had the president not vetoed Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for fiscal year 1996, this year's deficit would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which he now claims credit."
<p>
	Hodge says the domestic discretionary spending cutbacks pushed through by Congress in the face of White House opposition have gone practically unreported in accounts of the 104th Congress' legislative record. "Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, fiscal year 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969," he points out. "More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third."
<p>
	Other reasons cited by Hodge for the lower projected 1996 deficit numbers include:<ul>
	<p><li>The savings and loan bailout, which is now generating revenue instead of adding to the deficit. "This program -- which has accounted for 10 percent of the deficit change between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 -- is expected to bring in more than $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector";
	<p><li>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum. "President Clinton is reaping a windfall from the auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry, estimated to generate more than $10 billion in new revenues for fiscal year 1996";
	<p><li>A one-time tax revenue windfall caused by "investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax";
</ul><p>	"At every turn, the Clinton administration has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the rate of spending growth," Hodge says. "Incredibly, the president now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it was Congress that kept the president from pushing through spending that would have kept deficits higher than $200 billion for the foreseeable future."

<h2> GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF PARENTAL RIGHTS
ALL TOO COMMON, HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>




WASHINGTON, JULY 23, 1996</b> -- Legislation moving through Congress would protect parents from a growing number of government attempts to prevent them from raising their children as they see fit, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib227.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	With "parental rights" under siege on all fronts -- from legislatures, courts, government agencies, even the "helping" professions -- the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act" would restore to parents what the Supreme Court has deemed their "fundamental right" to direct the upbringing of their children, say study authors Patrick Fagan, Heritage's William FitzGerald fellow in family and cultural studies, and Wade Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative. Fagan is former deputy assistant secretary for social services policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Horn is former U.S. Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families.
<p>	To underscore the deteriorating status of parental rights -- and the need for legislation to correct the problem -- Fagan and Horn point to a number of recent abuses:<ul>
	<p><li>Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., tried in 1994 to require parents who educate their children at home to obtain state teacher certification, a step that would have all but abolished a practice already recognized as a parental right;
	<p><li>The Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1995 ruled that local school boards could deny parents the right to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distributions for their children;
	<p><li>The Michigan Supreme Court in 1993 denied "secular parents" the right to educate their children at home, even though it upheld the right of "religious parents" to do so;
	<p><li>The county of Durham, N.C., in 1995 drew up guidelines for determining the presence of child abuse in the home that could lead to investigations of parents for practices such as confining children to their rooms. The county also crafted a list of guidelines for "suitable" parenting, which included dictating such minutiae as what time parents must be home if a baby-sitter is watching their children (9 p.m. in the case of 12-14 year olds, for example);
	<p><li>A school nurse and doctor in East Stroudsburg, Penn., recently administered physical examinations -- including examination of the genitalia -- to about 60 girls aged 11 and 12, without permission from many of their parents; and
	<p><li>Even groups like school counselors and the American Library Association (ALA) have shown hostility toward parental rights; counselors by claiming they can counsel minors without parental consent, and the ALA by opposing parental efforts to prevent their children from checking out R- and X-Rated videos.
	</ul><p>Fagan and Horn say that even though the Supreme Court has ruled decisively in favor of parental rights, violations of those rights still occur with alarming frequency. To correct the problem, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.) would buttress the Court's settled opinion by clarifying parental rights to:<ul>
	<p><li>direct or provide for the education of the child;
	<p><li>make a health or mental-health decision for the child (with exceptions to "prevent an imminent risk of serious harm or remedy serious harm to the child");
	<p><li>discipline the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as defined by the Supreme Court; and 
	<p><li>direct or provide for the religious and moral formation of the child.
	</ul><p>The analysts are careful to point out that the legislation would in no way hinder states from protecting children from child abuse. Parental rights are fundamental, but they are not absolute, the analysts say. "No parent has a right to abuse a child," they say, "and the state has the duty to protect the child." The analysts say the real threat of child abuse stems not from the legislation, but from the "family preservation philosophy" of social workers who repeatedly try to reunite children with clearly abusive parents.
<p>	To those opponents of parental rights who will nevertheless raise the child-abuse issue, the analysts again cite the Supreme Court, which said in 1979 that "the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." 
	<p>It is this "repugnant" disregard for parental rights that must be corrected, the analysts say. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would do just that, they say, "erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights."

<title> Study Shows Wasteful Spending Still Abounds In Washington - Heritage PR</title>

        WASHINGTON, JULY 22, 1996</b> -- Even in an era marked by concern for how taxpayer dollars are spent, boondoggles still abound in Washington, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi112.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	In the second of a series of reports on "How Government Wastes Your Money," Heritage Senior Fellow in Economics Ronald Utt casts the spotlight on some particularly outlandish recent examples, such as:<ul>
<p><li>The 260 public housing residents, officials and employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who took an all-expenses-paid trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- courtesy of the taxpayers. The official purpose of the trip was to attend the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization. But HUD's inspector general said the event showed a marked "lack of programmatic content." Perhaps, says Utt, that's because the participants were too busy taking advantage of the numerous amenities offered at the Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort: gambling, snorkeling, dancing, touring, shopping and a beauty salon. The total cost of the excursion: $325,000.
<p><li>The telephones at the Department of Agriculture, which were being used to make calls to adult phone-sex lines, many to the Dominican Republic. What's more, the General Accounting Office found that during one four-month period roughly half the collect calls accepted by department employees (nearly 600 calls costing $2,600) were from inmates at 18 jails and prisons, with many of the calls rerouted illegally to the department's long-distance lines. 
<p><li>The decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to install a sophisticated new radar system at 47 airports at a cost of $373 million. The problem: The system doesn't work very well. At the 16 airports where it is already in place, the system has suffered frequent shutdowns. Since it was installed at Washington's National Airport in January 1996, for example, the system has failed nearly once every week and has proven incapable of detecting dangerous wind conditions (as it was supposed to).
	 </ul><p>"Washington would like to think these stories are isolated incidents," Utt concludes, "but they happen every day. It's just too easy to spend -- and misspend -- somebody else's money."

<h2> AFL-CIO "VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT" VIOLATES WORKER RIGHTS, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1996</b> --  The AFL-CIO's $35 million "voter education project" violates the rights of union workers by using their mandatory union dues to pay for political activities aimed at defeating Republican members of the 104th Congress, two <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1087.html">Heritage Foundation analysts said today.</a>
	<p>They called on Congress to allow union workers to choose not to have their mandatory dues used for partisan political activities. A bill to accomplish this, The Worker Right to Know Act, is scheduled for a vote in Congress July 24 or soon thereafter.
	<p>According to Kenneth R. Weinstein, director of the think tank's Government Reform Project and Research Assistant Thomas M. Wielgus, union members split their vote roughly 60-to-40 between Democrats and Republicans, respectively, in 1994. Since virtually all of the AFL-CIO's effort is aimed at unseating Republicans, this means as many as 40 percent of  AFL-CIO members may be forced to finance political activities with which they disagree. 
	<p>"Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 per year per union member," Weinstein and Wielgus estimate. As things now stand, the authors note, unions are not required to account for how much of union dues are used for political versus other activities. Some unions don't even fully report the amount of their dues income to the government, they say.
<p>	What's more, Weinstein and Wielgus say "most union members may not realize that under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Communications Workers of America v. Beck they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree." 
	<p>Under the Beck decision, unions must refund to their members any dues not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration and grievance processes. Unfortunately, the Heritage analysts say, this decision remains largely unenforced. An April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain such a refund, and that once they realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund. 
	<p>To rectify the situation, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., has introduced the Worker Right To Know Act, which would require a union to obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and that used for other activities such as "voter education." It also would make it clear that if workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to political activities, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
	<p>"It is time to make workers aware of their rights under the applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely," the Heritage analysts say. "The Worker Right to Know Act would give union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes."

	WASHINGTON, JULY 18, 1996</b> -- With the 1996 presidential campaign rekindling the debate over taxes, a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says tax rate reductions historically have had none of the negative consequences ascribed to them by tax-cut opponents.
<p>
	Daniel Mitchell, Heritage's McKenna senior fellow in political economy, examined the three major periods of tax-rate reductions in U.S. history -- the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s -- and found in each case that lower taxes not only boosted economic growth, but yielded the federal government more revenue and resulted in high-income Americans bearing a larger share of the tax burden. Consider:<ul>
	<p><li>In the 1920s, tax rates fell across the board, dropping from a top rate of 71 percent to 24 percent. As a result, the economy grew by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, government revenue from personal income taxes increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.2 billion in 1928, and the share of the tax burden borne by the rich ($50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. 
	<p><li>In the 1960s, President Kennedy again lowered tax rates across the board, reducing the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. In response, the economy experienced its longest expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, and tax collections from those making more than $50,000 climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966.
	<p><li>In the 1980s, President Reagan signed across-the-board tax cuts, paring the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. From 1982 to 1989, the economy responded with its longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew by 99.4 percent, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners rose from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988</ul>.
	<p>By contrast, Mitchell says, periods of tax increases have had a damaging effect on the economy.  He notes that since Reagan left office, the top tax rate has risen from 28 percent to 42 percent. The result: The economy has suffered its worst seven-year period of economic growth since World War II, with family income $2,000 lower today than it was in 1989. 
	<p>Likewise, tax increases imposed by President Johnson, combined with the "bracket creep" of the 1970s, caused the growing economy of the Kennedy years to lapse into a period of stagflation, notorious for rampant inflation and anemic economic growth. As for the 1920s tax cuts, they were followed in the 1930s by tax increases that boosted the top rate first to 63 percent, then to 79 percent. "To put it mildly," Mitchell says, "the 1930s are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades."
	<p>"The economy is lagging, incomes are falling, and tax revenues are stagnant," Mitchell says. "History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates."

<h2>
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION RAISES WHITE FLAG IN WAR ON DRUGS, NEW HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

        WASHINGTON, July 11, 1996</b> -- Dispatches from the front line of the war on drugs carry bleak news: The United States is going down to defeat, in no small part because the Clinton administration has failed to make combating drugs a high priority, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup279.html"> study released today.</a>
<p>
"After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush administrations, almost every available indicator shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs," say study authors John Walters and James O'Gara, respectively the president and director of research for the New Citizenship Project. Walters previously served as deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
	<p>Specifically, the analysts fault the president for lackluster appointments to key anti-drug positions, from the "invisible" former drug czar Lee Brown to the "embarrassing" former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who favored outright legalization of drugs. In addition, the administration has cut staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 and allowed 227 agent positions at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to disappear from September 1992 to September 1995.
	<p>Efforts to interdict drugs before they reach U.S. shores also have lagged under the Clinton administration, Walters and O'Gara say. All told, interdiction flight hours in the "transit zone" between the United States and South America have dropped by 50 percent, and ship "steaming days" have fallen by a third. 
	<p>These actions reflect the administration's intentional shift in strategy away from drug interdiction and law enforcement toward therapeutic treatment of drug users, the analysts say. But the new policy has a price: Almost as soon as it went into effect, cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard plummeted, from 51 metric tons in fiscal 1993 to 15 metric tons in fiscal 1994. During the same period, the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104, which, ironically, coincided with increased drug use among the very hard-core addicts the administration's new policy was supposed to help.
	<p>The result: Hard-core drug users are "cycling through emergency rooms at record rates," Walters and O'Gara say. Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the first half of 1995 were 65 percent higher than in the first half of 1991; for heroin, the figure was 120 percent higher; and for methamphetimine the figure was an astonishing 321 percent higher.
	<p>Perhaps even more distressing, the spike in drug use under the Clinton administration is not limited to addicts and "hard" drugs. Citing research from the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Michigan, Walters and O'Gara note that the number of kids age 12 to 17 using marijuana has almost doubled since 1992, from 1.6 million to 2.9 million. Nearly one in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 12 percent of the class of 1995 had taken LSD. 
	<p>Given the administration's record, Walters and O'Gara say the appointment of Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar is a step in the right direction but that much more needs to be done if the president hopes to retake lost ground in the war on drugs. Specifically, he should:<ul>
	<p><li>Use the "bully pulpit" to send a powerful anti-drug message to the nation's youth, something he thus far has failed to do;
	<p><li>Support anti-drug efforts in Latin America. For $50 million, for example, the administration could provide new tracking aircraft to Peru, a country that has proven its commitment to fighting the drug war by shooting down or disabling 20 trafficker airplanes since March of 1995;
	<p><li>Permit the Defense Department to spend more than the currently allowed 0.3 percent of its budget on drug interdiction;
	<p><li>Block future proposals by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to ease prison sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine; and
	<p><li>Allow federal funds to flow to religiously based drug-treatment programs, which in some cases are far more effective than programs where addicts decide how long and rigorous their treatment will be. 
	</ul><p>In the end, Walters and O'Gara say the Clinton administration cannot escape at least partial responsibility for America's recent losses in the war on drugs. "President Clinton has demonstrated little leadership on the drug issue and has failed to send an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans," they say.

<title>New Strategy Required for Cleaner Air -- PFF</title>

<h2>New Strategy Required for Cleaner Air</h2>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation today released a white paper urging for the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.

"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled <i><a href="/pff/clean/exec.html">Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas</a></i>.  "Alternative fuel -- or non petroleum-based -- vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions strategies for meeting clean air goals."<p>

The white paper calls for an end to Federal fuel taxes that discriminate against alternative fuels.  In their place it urges incentives for states and regions to design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels in their area.  The authors also argue that alternative fuel vehicles are a lower-cost way to improve automobile efficiency than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.<p>

"By removing barriers to expanded alternative fuel vehicle use and development of other improved technologies, these proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and national energy security goals," argues the paper.<p>

Copies of the white paper are available from the Foundation by calling 202/289-8928 or on its Internet homepage:  www.pff.org.  The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center established in 1993 to create a positive vision of the future founded in the historic principles of the American Idea.  It brings together a diverse group of thinkers and policy experts and shares their work with the American people through seminars, conferences, publications and broadcasts.<p>

<title>Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL
TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT, STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 18, 1996</b> -- The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110.html">a new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.
	<p>As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits. To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, says <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm"> Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies.
	<p>The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse. Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent). Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent. With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
	<p>Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition, Butler says.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is "allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years," the Heritage Foundation executive says. By that point, "the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic," he says.
	<p>Butler says Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program.  First, turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  Second, allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  And third, reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.
	<p>Calling the Medicare Trustees report "grim reading," Butler says policy-makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms. "Only the third choice makes any sense," Butler says. "The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be."

<h2> REPUBLICANS WRONG TO BELIEVE 104th CONGRESS A FAILURE, ANALYST SAYS </h2>
<p><b>Bigger Budget Cuts than Reagan's</b>
</center>
<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 14, 1996</b> -- It's one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it's quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109.html"> a new Heritage Foundation analysis.</a><p>
	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ron Utt</a>.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  <p>
	"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war." 
	<p>Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.
	<p>Utt's conclusion: Congress' accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency's budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan's goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress' 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.
	<p>Granted, there's much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress' performance was," Utt says, "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress' cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country's four "power marketing administrations."
	<p>With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress' goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There's no reason it can't cut spending a second time." <p>

<h2> INS CONSIDERS "DUMBING DOWN" STANDARDS FOR CITIZENSHIP, ANALYST CHARGES </h2>
</center>

        WASHINGTON, JUNE 13, 1996</b> -- This Fourth of July, 2,000 immigrants will swear-in as U.S. citizens at the World Trade Center in New York City, 10,000 will naturalize in Los Angeles a day earlier, and another 4,000 will swap their green cards for citizenship papers in El Paso, Texas.
	<p>Like the waves of immigrants that rolled upon America's shores on the eve of World War I, these immigrants have been immersed in the language, culture and history of their new nation, the better to help them become naturalized U.S. citizens. Now, proposals under consideration by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would tamper with this highly successful assimilation formula, lowering naturalization standards and devaluing citizenship "like a worthless peso," according to a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/miller.html">new article</a> in The Heritage Foundation magazine <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.</a> 
	<p>Specifically, the INS is considering making it easier -- too easy -- to become a U.S. citizen, writes John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. Not only is the INS studying whether to ease the English language requirement for citizenship, it is contemplating exempting entire classes of immigrants from the U.S. history and government tests newcomers traditionally have to pass. 
	<p>Granted, the INS has had to deal with a flood of new applications for citizenship -- 1.2 million in 1995 versus an average of just 230,000 a year in the 1980s.  But the way to cope with the volume of applications is not to lower naturalization standards to the point that immigrants begin to take citizenship for granted, Miller says.  
	<p>Yet that, he says, is what is happening. "Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates," he says.
	<p>To some organizations, this is a welcome development, because easy naturalization translates into political power. For example, Miller says, more Hispanic citizens means more Hispanic votes, which explains why the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials promotes easing naturalization standards. 
	<p>But such views not only diminish the value of citizenship, Miller says, they may also inflame the anti-immigrant sentiment that bubbles just below America's multicultural surface.  Citing a recent poll that shows 66 percent of Americans already feel America is no longer a "melting pot," Miller says a robust naturalization process is the only means the country has to "decide who is an American and who is not ... Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations." 
	<p>Fortunately, Miller says, an antidote to the INS's lackadaisical attitude toward naturalization can be found in a Seattle program that puts immigrants through an intensive, 10-week course in the basics of U.S. citizenship.  Applicants who pass an English fluency screening are grilled in preparation for the standard INS exam, and are rewarded with an INS interview at the end of 10 weeks, compared to the usual six-month wait.  Particularly encouraging to Miller is the fact that the Seattle program -- which requires immigrants to give up three hours a night, four nights a week -- has a waiting list hundreds of names long.
	<p>Miller concedes the INS lacks the resources to run such a program itself, but then he doesn't want it to. Instead, he envisions a nationwide network of private and local public institutions that "would revive the old-fashioned idea of civic instruction for immigrant adults."  In this way, he says, immigrants can become Americans, and America can remain the melting pot it was intended to be. <p>

<title>Department of Defense Bears Brunt of Government "Downsizing" - Heritage PR</title>

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEARS BRUNT
OF GOVERNMENT "DOWNSIZING"
</h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 29, 1996</b> --As Congress and the White House lock horns over the fiscal 1997 budget, both sides should take note of an important fact:  Most of the government downsizing that has occurred so far has been in the Department of Defense. 
	<p>In fact, of the 200,000 government jobs eliminated to date, some 60 percent have been defense jobs. If one counts all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of fiscal year 1992, more than 89 percent  -- almost 760,000 total -- come solely from the Department of Defense, according to Heritage Foundation Senior Defense Policy Analyst Baker Spring and Policy Analyst  John S. Barry, authors of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bgup278.html">a study released today.</a>
<p>	Defense budget cuts, in turn, have led to a drop in private-sector defense industry jobs, according to Spring and Barry. By the end of fiscal year 1997, there will be 795,000 fewer such positions than in 1992. "In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. By comparison, Internal Revenue Service employment has dropped by only 6 percent, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] positions have dropped by less than 5 percent and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] positions have increased by more than 2 percent," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>Barry and Spring recommend "restoring balance" to federal employment policy by:<ul>
<li>Freezing military personnel reductions at 2.4 million, the level recommended by the Clinton administration in its 1993 "Bottom Up Review" of U.S. military requirements
<li>Limiting further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts
<li>Increasing a defense procurement budget that has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985, severely damaging America's future military readiness. The steady stream of procurement cuts have cost 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the defense employment peak in 1987
<li>Concentrating federal work force reductions within non-defense departments by eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies.</ul>
	<p>"President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA and ATF watching their every move. They do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War," write Spring and Barry.

<title>Legal-Aid Groups Defy Ban on Lobbying and Helping Criminals, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

LEGAL-AID GROUPS DEFY BAN ON LOBBYING
AND HELPING CRIMINALS, STUDY SAYS  </h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 21, 1996</b> -- Faced with new rules that prevent them from lobbying and defending drug dealers and illegal aliens, groups that use taxpayer dollars to provide legal assistance to the poor have devised a number of loopholes allowing them to continue these banned activities, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html">according to a new report</a> from The Heritage Foundation.
	<p>Rules imposed by Congress last year bar groups that receive grants from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from using any part of their budget -- including private funds -- to lobby against welfare reform, file class-action lawsuits, represent criminals, and engage in other politically motivated activities. The new rules were necessary, says Kenneth Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center and author of the report, because "in the past legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, their own money for prohibited activities."  
<p>	But with this loophole now closed, Boehm says, legal services groups have invented a new evasive tactic: They swear off banned activities in order to remain eligible for federal money, then set up new shadow organizations that will use the groups' non-federal money to pursue a political agenda.  
<p>	For example, the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center was recently formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services (CLS), which receives money from the LSC. The new center, housed in the same building as CLS, will handle non-prohibited cases and receive taxpayer subsidies; CLS, meanwhile, will continue to handle prohibited political and ideological cases. "The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused," Boehm says.
<p>	Legal services lawyers also have incurred the wrath of Congress for representing drug dealers who face eviction from public housing projects. Boehm cites a case pending in New York City where representatives of the city's 500,000 public housing tenants have sided with the New York Housing Authority in support of expedited evictions of drug dealers. Defending the drug dealers is the Legal Aid Society, which is supposed to use the federal money it receives from the LSC to represent the interests of the poor. 
<p>	With Congress likely to impose a new round of tough restrictions to deal with this problem, the LSC board defensively drafted a new regulation that supposedly bans legal groups receiving federal funds from representing drug dealers facing eviction, Boehm says. The problem, once again, is that the regulation is so full of loopholes it does nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from participating in drug-eviction cases, he says.
<p>	The ability of legal services groups to flout attempts to rein in their political activities is evidence to Boehm that Congress was right last year when it decided to end all federal funding for the LSC by 1998. Besides, he notes, the LSC has been successful raising funds for its activities from other sources, blunting the charge that elimination of federal funding would deny legal services to the poor. For example, the LSC will receive $278 million from the federal government this year, down from $400 million last year, a substantial cut. Yet the LSC also collects $250 million a year from non-federal sources, Boehm says, raising the question of whether federal funding is needed in the first place.
<p>	When the bill that funds the LSC for fiscal year 1997 comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is expected to leave open the option of "zeroing out" the agency -- something Boehm says would be a wise policy decision. "The 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of legal services groups to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense," Boehm says. Now, he says, "it is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program."

Ever-Increasing "Tax Wedge" 
Between Labor Costs And Wages

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 17, 1996</b> -- Instead of increasing the minimum wage, which would only destroy jobs, lawmakers addressing worker anxiety over lower take-home pay should reduce the costs imposed by government on employers, Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi102.html">said today</a>.
<p>	"There is a huge 'wedge' between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck," according to Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, deputy director for economic policy. "These costs are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess consumes their take-home pay."
<p>	For example, the analysts point out that in 1995 private-industry employers paid an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep a worker on their payrolls. But after deducting the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes and optional benefits, workers took home an average of only $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less that the total cost of employing them. "The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation," the analysts say.
<p>	For minimum-wage workers, the "wedge" is just as bad: In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire such a worker. But after the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03 per hour) is deducted, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, this worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total cost of their employment, and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>	These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study cited by the analysts estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per year. "This equals somewhere between $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker," the analysts say.
<p>	"The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage," say Wilson and Antonelli. Instead, "Government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay." Such policies -- cuts in payroll and income taxes, reductions in the regulatory burden on businesses, a cut in the capital gains tax -- also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities and real earnings.	  
<p>	"Politicians who blame 'corporate greed' for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government," the Heritage analysts say.

Congress, White House
Urged to Boost Spending

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 16, 1996</b> -- The refusal of the White House to adequately fund its own national security programs is undermining America's ability to guarantee victory in defense of its freedom and global interests, a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says.
<P>	Even the passage by the House yesterday of a defense budget $12 billion higher than what President Clinton has requested for fiscal year 1997 is not enough, not when the White House has underfunded its own military strategy by $130 billion over the next six years, Heritage Senior Policy analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> calculates. The Senate, Spring says, has an opportunity to begin to correct the administration's grave funding shortfall when it considers the fiscal 1997 Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>	Spring says the existing gap between what is needed to fund the administration's military strategy -- which calls for the United States to be able to fight two Persian Gulf-sized wars "nearly simultaneously" -- and actual spending plans will leave the United States unable to fulfill its commitment to security alliances in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  He estimates that under the president's defense budget fighting just one Persian Gulf-sized war in the future would require 87 percent of America's army divisions and 75 percent of its aircraft-carrier battle groups, leaving little left to fight a second conflict and uphold security commitments.
<p>	While Congress has attempted to provide adequate funding for the administration's defense plan in the short term, it has failed to address the long-term implications of the budget shortfall on U.S. military strategy, Spring says.  Despite the House-approved increase in defense spending for the coming fiscal year, Congress' overall defense budget actually would spend less than what the White House proposes in 2001 and 2002, he says.  Even last year's decision by Congress to spend $7 billion more on defense than the White House, while politically costly, fell far short of the $20 billion Spring says is necessary to fully fund the administration's defense plan.
<p>	By way of example, Spring notes that Operation Desert Storm required seven active army divisions and six aircraft-carrier battle groups.  Yet the administration's defense budget, Spring estimates, provides for only eight of each.  The result: If a U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf were attacked by either Iran or Iraq, the United States could respond but could not also maintain its commitments elsewhere in the world.
<p>	Although critics claim reductions in military spending are only natural now that the Cold War is over, Spring notes that those reductions are being made without regard for the fact that U.S. security commitments to NATO, Japan and others remain intact.  "All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services," he says.  Without increased defense spending, up to the level needed to fund the administration's military strategy, "the time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments." 
<p>	The task for Congress, Spring says, is to begin a national debate over the proper role and size of America's defense forces.  To stimulate such a debate, Spring offers a draft resolution that Congress could consider, outlining in detail a global defense strategy and the specific force levels necessary to fulfill that strategy -- down to the number of troops, ships and aircraft required.  The resolution could be considered as an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill, he says.  
<p>	But the time to begin the debate is now, Spring says, for if defense spending is left at current levels it could well mean "the end of America as a global military power ... and the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort Americans have not known since the first half of this century."

<h2>FOREIGN AID RECIPIENTS CONSISTENTLY VOTE AGAINST THE U.S. IN THE U.N., STUDY SHOWS</h2>

Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1996</b> -- Despite claims by the Clinton administration that foreign aid bolsters support for America around the globe, nearly two-thirds of the countries that received U.S. foreign aid last year voted against the United States a majority of the time in the United Nations, according to a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi101.html">new analysis</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	All told, 75 of the 118 countries that received foreign aid last year voted against the United States more than half of the time, reports Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a>. "It's clear from the data," he says, "that foreign aid fails to win friends where it counts -- in supporting U.S. diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations."
<p>	The 10 countries that voted against the United States most often -- an average of 73 percent of the time -- will pocket more than $212 million in foreign aid this fiscal year. And of the 10 countries that will receive the most money, only three of them voted with the United States a majority of the time.
<p>	Some of America's biggest aid beneficiaries were consistently hostile to U.S. positions in the United Nations. Egypt, for example, receives more foreign aid ($2.1 billion) than any country except Israel, yet voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. And the country that voted against the United States the most -- India, 83 percent of the time -- is America's fifth-largest foreign aid recipient, pulling in $157 million.
<p>	Even Haiti and Mexico, two countries the United States has helped considerably, consistently opposed U.S. positions in the United Nations. On top of the $1 billion America spent on a military operation to restore democracy to Haiti, the island nation will get another $124 million this year. Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the time. The same holds true of Mexico, which benefited from a $40 billion economic bailout funded largely by U.S. taxpayers and is slated to get another $25 million this year, yet voted against the United States 58 percent of the time.
<p>	"Why is the United states spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?" Johnson asks. He recommends that Congress make significant cuts in the $13 billion foreign aid budget this year, even abolishing the agency that hands out most of the money.

<h2>CONGRESS SHOULD BACK WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO LET POOR MOVE OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 7, 1996</b> -- Congress should end antiquated housing policies that concentrate the poor in deteriorating neighborhoods and embrace a Clinton administration plan that gives tenants a choice of where to live, a Heritage Foundation analyst says in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1081.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	"To his credit, President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from projects to tenant-based vouchers that let the poor rent the housing of their choice," says Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow at the prominent think tank.   
<p>	Yet rather than embrace what Utt calls the most innovative housing-reform proposal in 25 years, Congress drafted new legislation that largely preserves the current system of public-housing projects. While such a move is sure to please the construction and public-housing lobbies, he says, it guarantees that thousands of poor families will remain trapped in substandard government apartments.
<p>	Under the president's plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would end multibillion-dollar payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with vouchers going directly to tenants living in housing projects. Utt says tenants then would have a range of options: continue to rent housing from the PHA, rent better housing elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better project managers. The end result is that PHAs would be stripped of their government-sponsored monopoly and forced to compete for tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. 
<p>	But Congress is blocking the reform, Utt says, devoting much-needed funds to traditional public housing projects rather than to vouchers. For example, the $2.5 billion proposed by the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over HUD to modernize housing projects could have provided vouchers to more than 475,000 poor families. Another example: HUD plans to spend $115 million in Baltimore to construct just 338 new housing units, money that could provide a year's worth of safe, decent, privately-owned apartments to as many as 80 percent of the 25,000 poor families on the city's housing-assistance waiting list.
<p>	On average, Utt estimates, project-based assistance costs twice as much as vouchers for each family helped. Instead of empowering tenants, such an approach enriches local bureaucracies at the expense of both the poor and the taxpayers, he says.  
<P>	Vouchers, by contrast, would allow poor families to rent the housing of their choice, as long as the rent stays within established limits. "This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities," Utt says. "Families can move to safer neighborhoods with better schools, the unemployed can move where the jobs are, and the elderly can move closer to their families and shopping." 
<p>	"Congress needs to seriously reconsider its preservation of the status quo in public housing," Utt says. Project-based housing is a proven failure, he says, resulting in the warehousing of large concentrations of the poor in dismal neighborhoods marked by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect and other pathologies. Far better, he says, to switch to a voucher system giving the poor the freedom to live where they want.

<CENTER><B><h2>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES 1996 JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIPS</h2>
<h3>$50,000 GOLD AWARD AND $20,000 SILVER AWARD</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
Potomac, MD, May 7, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced the winners of its 1996 journalism fellowship awards.  Stacy Mattingly captured the $50,000 Gold Award for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi.  Daniel Richardson won the $20,000 silver award to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.  
<p>
Mattingly and Richardson were introduced during an awards dinner last night at the University Club in Washington, D.C., attended by prominent journalists.
<p>
During her one-year fellowship which commences on September 1, 1996, Stacy Mattingly will research and write a book on <I>Lisa Herdahl v. Pontotoc County</I>, a Mississippi school prayer case currently in the courts.  Last year, she wrote an extensive article on the case for <I>The Oxford American </I>magazine in Mississippi.  She has spent a great deal of time in Pontotoc County, and her article was widely praised as the most thorough and balanced reporting on the case.  She will write a book in narrative form, beginning with the Herdahl family's move 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi and ending with the trial on the school prayer case.
<p>
Mattingly, 25, is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta.  She writes articles for <I>Crisis</I> magazine and the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I>.  She served as contributing editor and writer for <I>The Oxford American</I> and as staff reporter for <I>The Oxford Eagle</I> newspaper.  She graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in English.
<p>
For his fellowship project, Daniel Richardson will focus on the Patriot movement in this country.  He believes the Patriot "subculture" is becoming too large to be ignored.  He will investigate the many groups which comprise the Patriot subculture, and he will examine the single defining thread running through all Patriot ideas:  the subversion of the Constitution by internal and external foes leading to greater government authority at the expense of individual freedoms.
<p>
Richardson, 23, is a freelance journalist in Gresham, Oregon.  He writes articles and news stories for <I>The Oregon City News</I> and <I>East County Magazine</I> in Gresham.  He graduated from the University of Puget Sound last year with a B.A. in History.  For his senior thesis, he wrote "A Military History of the Hundred Years' War."
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism.  The Foundation established its journalism fellowship program in 1994 to provide annual grants for journalism projects supportive of American culture and a free society.  The fellowship program is open to working journalists with less than five years of professional experience.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation served as judges for the competition.  The Trustees are:  Thomas L. Phillips, President of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.

Clear "Intervention Criteria" Needed
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 2, 1996</b> -- The United States has been squandering its limited military resources on "missions without a purpose" around the globe, making it difficult for American forces to keep up with their other security commitments, the Heritage Foundation's chief foreign policy spokesman said today.
<P>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a>, the think tank's vice president and director of foreign policy and defense studies, the Clinton White House desperately needs to formulate, spell out and "codify" a policy on where, when, and under what circumstances the United States will intervene militarily in the future.
<p>	Congress, meanwhile, should reassert its "oversight" responsibilities in this area, he said.
<p>
<b>Intervention Criteria</b>
<p>	Holmes made his remarks during a briefing on a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">policy paper</a> on American military intervention. Written by Defense Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a>, a decorated Gulf War veteran, the report says any U.S. decision to intervene militarily should be based on whether U.S. interests are at stake, America's ability to decisively affect the outcome, and the resources available for the task. 

<p>	Hillen proposes five criteria for determining whether and how the United States should intervene in any given situation:
<p>
<b>	1) Whether national security interests are at stake. </b>
<P>	The United States, Hillen says, must be able to distinguish between such vital interests as "protecting America's territory, borders and airspace" and other interests "that are merely important or marginal." Not all American interests are "high priority" national security interests that must be defended through military intervention, he stresses. 
<p>	The United States should always be prepared to use military force to defend its vital interests, Hillen says. But since U.S. military resources -- both tangible assets such as troops, carrier battle groups, fighter wings, and spare parts and equipment, and intangibles such as "public support" -- are available only in limited supply, the president must realize that not all interests are equally important and choose wisely where and when to dispatch U.S. troops.
<p>	America's vital interests, he says, include: protecting America's territory, borders and airspace; protecting American citizens at home and abroad; preventing a "major-power" threat to Europe, East Asia or the Persian Gulf; preventing "hostile interference by an outside power" in the Western Hemisphere; and ensuring access to foreign trade and resources.
<p><b>	2) Whether the proposed intervention will "jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet more important security commitments."</b>
<p>	There is "an enormous gap," Hillen says, between America's national commitments and objectives and the military resources available to achieve them. 
<p>	The administration's own proposed military force, (presented in the Pentagon's "Bottom-Up Review" of U.S. military readiness) is not only "inadequate" for America's stated strategy, but is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion over five years. Such a force, he says, simply can't do everything the administration expects it to do. 
<p>	"Military interventions in support of peripheral interests," he says, "should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests -- a perilous situation that many believe the United States is rapidly approaching today."
<p><b>	3) Whether the military goals are clearly defined, decisive, attainable and sustainable.</b>
<p>	Military objectives, Hillen stresses, should support political objectives. "For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from ... Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task ... the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored." 
<p>	While "working towards clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point," Hillen says, the Clinton administration has consistently done otherwise. Indeed, when U.S. troops were sent to Haiti and Bosnia, he notes, about the only goal the administration clearly articulated was "setting deadlines for troop withdrawals." This approach, he says, "is a gross misuse of American military power."
<p><b>	4) Whether Congress and the public support the action.</b>
<p>	As the Vietnam experience showed, "only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the United States hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad," Hillen cautions. In the absence of such support, the United States is forced into humiliating withdrawals like the Somalia debacle in 1994.
<p><b>	5) Whether the U.S. military can create "the conditions for their success" -- enabling U.S. forces to achieve their objectives.</b>
<p>	"This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just 'the big ones'," Hillen says. "Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli, Libya, can have a decisive effect." 
<p>	However, he warns, there is always the temptation in limited military interventions to greatly restrict the operational latitude and resources made available to the military command, "because the purpose of the intervention is to send an indeterminate political signal."
<p>	In any intervention, Hillen says, "the military must be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well trained, and that will make a difference, once attained."
<p>	"There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention," the Heritage Foundation report concludes. "However, by establishing workable criteria for military interventions, the United States can minimize those risks, or, at the very least, ensure that the risks are consistent with the costs of the intervention," Hillen says.

<head><title>1993 Tax Hike Dampening U.S. Economy - Heritage PR</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>Washington, D.C. 20002<br>(202 546-4400<br><p><hr><h2>1993 TAX HIKE DAMPENING U.S. ECONOMY,
NEW STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

		WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1996</b> -- Along with the recent news that the U.S. economy grew by only 0.5 percent during the final quarter of last year comes a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">new study</a> from The Heritage Foundation that helps explain why: the $241 billion tax hike enacted in 1993.
<p>		Employing one of the computer models of the economy used by the federal government and many leading U.S. corporations, Heritage Foundation economists found from 1993 through the end of 1996 the tax increase will cost the economy $208 billion in total output, reduce the number of new jobs by 1.2 million, and cost the typical family approximately $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings.
<p>		With economic security shaping up as a key issue in the 1996 elections, these findings shed light on the widely observed economic "anxiety" felt by many Americans, say study authors <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs, and <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, visiting fellow in tax analysis.  "People are right to feel they should be better off today than they are," the authors say.  "The 1993 tax increase deprived them of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth."
<p>		Heritage arrived at its findings by essentially "deleting" the tax and spending changes contained in Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) from the computer model -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM). This generates a simulation of how the economy would have performed if these factors had not been changed. No other variables were changed, and only mainstream economic assumptions were made where necessary.
<p>		In addition to slower growth and fewer new jobs, the Heritage analysis also indicated that employee wages and salaries will be reduced by $112 billion, automobile and light truck sales will fall short by 1.3 million vehicles, and businesses will invest some $42.5 billion less in durable goods.
<p>		Taking a specific year -- 1995 -- the study found that the economy would have grown by an additional $66 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were it not for the 1993 tax hike. And for the entire period between 1993 and 1996, the total loss in economic growth is an estimated $208 billion, or $2,100 for every household in America.  
<p>		As for the 1.2 million jobs not created as a result of the 1993 tax and budget changes, nearly 17 percent were the result of new businesses not formed. For every $1 billion in economic growth, roughly 195 new businesses are created.  This means the loss of $208 billion in GDP prevented nearly 40,600 businesses, and 203,000 jobs, from being created. The other 1 million missing jobs are likely the result of existing businesses hiring fewer employees due to the tax increase. Hodge and Beach say that although an otherwise healthy economy has created 8 million new jobs over the past three years, the fact remains that "1.2 million Americans who could have been working today are not because of the 1993 tax increase."
<p>		Not only are fewer Americans working than would have been, but those who are working are earning less.  Of the $112 billion in lower wages and salaries caused by OBRA-93, $46.5 billion will be lost in 1996 alone, according to the Heritage projection using the WUMM model.  That translates into roughly $465 for every household in America, more than the average U.S. household's monthly housing bill of $440.
<p>		Specific industries also are suffering from OBRA-93. In the automobile industry, for example, the loss of 368,000 vehicle sales in 1996 alone means $4.8 billion in lower revenue and 60,100 fewer jobs in auto-related fields.  And as for computers, more than one-third of the $42.5 billion shortfall in durable-goods purchases by businesses will be reflected in lost computer sales, the Heritage study indicates.
<p>		Far from being the healthiest economy in 30 years, as President Clinton has said, "the current economy is lousy compared to past recoveries and lousy compared to what it would have been without the 1993 tax increase," Beach says. "The first rules of economics should be the same as it is in medicine: First, do no harm."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> On April 15, the day Americans' increasingly burdensome tax bill is due, The House of Representatives will vote to make it harder to increase taxes in the future.  The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.159:">Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment</a> would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes rather than the fifty percent plus one currently required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"In 1950, families paid only 5 percent of their income in federal taxes," said Herger.  "In 1990, that number jumped to 24 percent and when combined with state and local taxes, families lose almost half their income to taxes.  If a two-thirds tax increase amendment had been in place since 1980, the American people would have been spared more than $660 billion in new taxes, all of which were used to pay for more government spending."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Over the past three decades, Washington has paid for wasteful and excessive federal spending by simply raising taxes on working families and small businesses," added Herger.  "These excessive taxes stifle business growth, hurt families, and hinder our nation's economy.  It shouldn't be easy to take money from families and businesses -- it's their money not Washington's."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"A two-thirds requirement to raise taxes would go a long way toward reining in runaway federal spending and putting a check on excessive taxation," said Herger.  "The requirement would also become a valued component in our efforts to reform the entire tax system."

<h2>DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN FORCES NEW U.S.-PRC-ROC STRATEGIC BALANCE, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 12, 1996</b> -- Taiwan's new democratic status will force the People's Republic of China (PRC) to treat her with much greater caution and respect, and U.S. policy-makers to take America's commitment to her safety more seriously, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a>, a policy analyst with Heritage's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, the new situation "forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance." For the United States, "democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking better relations with China." From now on, "U.S. policy-makers will be freer to stand up for Taiwan because they will more clearly occupy the moral high ground," Yates says, "whereas China will have to be more circumspect in its belligerence where Taiwan is concerned." In fact, he says, "Taiwanese democracy strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy." 
<p>
	"It will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese who elected him," Yates says. On a practical level, this means "if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative," the answer no longer can be "that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese." In fact, Yates says democracy on Taiwan "challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan."  
<p>	Meanwhile, "democracy is of great strategic importance to Taiwan -- more important than any weapon system it could acquire," Yates points out. "It makes the ROC much more likely to draw support from the United States and other developed democracies in the event of a hostile threat from mainland China."
<p>	Yates offers a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup272.html">game plan</a> U.S. policy-makers should follow to protect American interests in the Far East, and promote stability in the region. Among the proposals:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue, so that China and Taiwan have a forum to discuss and resolve issues;<p>
<li> Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank, even if the PRC objects;<p>
<li>	  In accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, continue to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, and assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile-defense system;<p>
	<li>  Avoid linking renewal of the PRC's most favored nation (MFN) trade status with Taiwan issues, since such linkage would be counterproductive and would probably hurt Taiwan and Hong Kong, which have manufacturing concerns on the mainland; and<p>
<li> Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement, perhaps one whereby Taiwan would pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time, and Beijing would agree to renounce the use of force during that same period.<p>
</ul>
	"The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy," Yates observes. "Despite large-scale military and rhetorical intimidation from Beijing, the election ran smoothly.  Now the United States, China and Taiwan must establish a new equilibrium that will be successful in the new strategic environment."

<h2>DESPITE VICTORIES, CONSERVATISM FACES TOUGH FIGHT, HERITAGE PRESIDENT SAYS</h2>
</center><b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 11, 1996</b> -- President Clinton's State of the Union pronouncement that "the era of big government is over" seemed to cement conservatism's position as the dominant political philosophy in America.  
<p>	Not so fast, says the president of The Heritage Foundation in his latest annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," released today. It's true conservatives have scored some important victories, but "the war is far from over," according to <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, head of the well-known conservative think tank.  
<p>	"Liberalism is not dead," Feulner says, "because it is just too much fun to spend other people's money." He notes that after President Clinton's eulogy for big government, one of his first actions was to demand $8 billion in new spending from Congress for the current fiscal year. 
<p>	What's more, he says, the Washington establishment's response to many of the proposals for conservative change has been a resounding "no": no term limits, no balanced budget, no welfare reform, no entitlement reform, no significant regulatory relief, and no end to the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services Corporation and numerous other non-essential programs and agencies.
<p>	While Feulner is not prepared to declare the end of liberalism as a political entity, neither does he agree with those "perpetually melancholy conservatives who subscribe to the headline 'We Lost.'" After all, he says, Congress passed both a bold, seven-year balanced budget plan and real welfare reform (both vetoed by President Clinton). And even in the face of threatened retaliation from the powerful senior-citizen lobby, Congress tried to reform Medicare -- a valiant effort that would have saved the program from impending bankruptcy.
<p>	Of course, Congress also committed its share of blunders in the past year, Feulner says. For example, lawmakers dallied on the passage of the line-item veto. "Without sounding too much like the liberal League of Women Voters or Common Cause," he says, "the line-item veto languished for 18 months because the GOP Congress didn't want to hand this weapon to President Clinton." Calling the veto central to getting control of the budget, Feulner says, "The credibility of all of us who truly believe in smaller, less intrusive government suffered while Congress dragged its feet on this promise." The legislation finally was approved this spring and signed into law on April 9.
<p>	Feulner also criticizes some of his fellow conservatives for their short-sightedness on tax reform. "Reforming the tax code to produce a flat -- or at least a flatter -- tax was to have been the driving issue in the '96 election," Feulner says. Instead, the GOP presidential hopefuls earlier this year used the issue to attack one another.  "What were these Republicans -- self-proclaimed conservatives all -- doing playing upon class warfare and class envy, positions long the domain of the left?" he asks.
<p>	Despite these short-term setbacks, the Heritage Foundation chief executive remains upbeat about the direction in which the country is moving politically. The reason: "Most Americans realize liberalism has been a failure." Citing a <I>Washington Post</I> series bemoaning the fact that many Americans have lost confidence in government, Feulner says, "Of course they have; any sane person would." After all, what other reaction can there be to stories like the one cited by Feulner on how Minnesota's Medicaid program is paying for sex-change operations?  Transsexuals may complain that they are "trapped" in the bodies of the opposite sex, he says, "but what about the average American who is trapped inside the body of a taxpayer?"
<p>	As long as such liberal excesses continue -- and there is no reason to believe they will cease -- Feulner believes the conservative case will remain as strong as ever. "I am optimistic," he says, "because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not on wishful thinking." 
<p>	"People genuinely want to get this country back on the right track," he says. "The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America."

<title>Heritage Offers Blueprint for Dismantling U.S. Department of Education - Heritage PR</title></head>

<h2>HERITAGE FOUNDATION OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR DISMANTLING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Heritage Public Relations<p>

	WASHINGTON, APRIL 5, 1996</b> -- Congress should take the funds now going to the U.S. Department of Education and send them back back to states, localities and parents, Heritage Foundation analysts said in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1076.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	To assist lawmakers in this task, the study's authors, Visiting Fellow in Education Denis Doyle and Policy Analyst Christine Olson, have put together a comprehensive plan that would eliminate many federal education programs outright, transfer some programs to other government agencies, and roll others into block grants to be administered by states and localities.
<p>	Doyle and Olson recommend a host of programs for termination, including Goals 2000, President Clinton's education reform initiative, the Bilingual and Immigrant Education program (to be phased out over three years), college Work-Study, and Direct Student Loans. Programs that would be transferred to other government agencies include student financial-aid, such as Pell Grants and Federal Perkins Loans. These would go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A host of programs are recommended for either full or partial conversion into state or local block grants, including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Title I, the federal aid program for school districts with high concentrations of poor students.  
<p>	Doyle and Olson say the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, sponsored by Reps. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., and Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, "is an excellent vehicle to dismantle the department because it would entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the states and the people." The bill would abolish the Department of Education one year after its enactment; roll all elementary and post-secondary education programs into two separate block grants; and eliminate major portions of the federal education bureaucracy. 
<p>	According to Doyle and Olson, "Since its creation in 1979, the Department of Education has done precisely what its severest critics envisioned: It has usurped state and local control of education by slowly imposing a steady stream of bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive rules and requirements and has inserted itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts."  
<p>	The result, besides taking control away from parents, teachers and local officials, is "practically no positive impact on student performance." In fact, as the federal government's role in education increased, academic performance of the nation's students has declined. Since the Department of Education was created in 1979, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have stagnated, the high-school dropout rate has risen from 8 percent to 12 percent, and, despite spending more money per pupil on elementary and secondary schools than any other county, math and science test scores of American 13-year-olds still lag behind those of other industrial countries. 
<p>	"Taxpayers should recognize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to 'federalize' the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of our children's education," say Doyle and Olson. The federal role in education -- currently subsidized to the tune of more than $31 billion per year -- has expanded from 100 programs in 1980 to more than 240 today.	
<p>	Yet, the federal government does have an important role to play in education, the authors say. "Washington should limit its role to doing things states and localities cannot do themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose," they say. For example, "the federal government has an overriding responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school or out." In addition, they acknowledge a federal role for "data collection, dissemination, analysis and research, and in helping poor school children get a good education (through creation of school voucher systems, for example). All of these jobs can be handled at the agency level, the analysts say. 
<p>	 "One the other hand," they say, "when it comes to such basic educational matters as management of classroom instruction, adoption of curricula, and text book selection, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice."
<p>	"It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education. States and localities are the 'laboratories of democracy'; educational reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high from a bunch of Washington bureaucrats," Doyle and Olson say.

<center><B>Executive Summary</B><P>
</center>

<b><i>Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>

The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>

Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>

In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p></b></i>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  
<b><i>The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>

<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot;

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
   
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  
<b><i>The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>
   
<hr>
<a name="Two"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>
  </pre>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>

Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.</i></b>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, MARCH 29, 1996</B> -- Congress approval today of legislation 
scrapping Depression-era crop programs that make U.S. farmers dependent on government and 
cost taxpayers billions of dollars was immediately praised as a &QUOT;dramatic and welcome&QUOT; step in 
the right direction.<P>
	&QUOT;For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the 
government,&QUOT; said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of the Heritage Foundations Agriculture Policy 
Project and one of the architects of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">reform plan</a>. &QUOT;Consumers win with more competitive 
prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the 
freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market.&QUOT;<P>
	The legislation, while it doesnt go as far as Frydenlund had recommended, will replace 
open-ended subsidies for crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and rice with a system of &QUOT;transition 
payments&QUOT; -- guaranteed payments that decline and eventually cease by the year 2002.<P>
	When Frydenlund first proposed the elimination of agriculture subsidy programs in an 
April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, &QUOT;Freeing Americas Farmers,&QUOT; few in Washington gave 
his recommendations much chance of passage. Yet the House-Senate conference report on 
agriculture, which is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton, pushes policy 
dramatically in the same direction -- eliminating government programs that rob American 
consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars and deny farmers the ability to profit from the 
explosive growth in the global demand for food.<P>
	Frydenlund says that although the farm bill failed to reform the costly sugar and peanut 
programs, &QUOT;it is a dramatic and welcome departure from 60 years of command-and-control 
agriculture policy.&QUOT;<P>
	The reform plan proposed by Frydenlund, had it been adopted in its entirety, would have 
phased out all crop subsidies and support payments over five years and, according to a detailed 
computer analysis, would have added $35 billion to the economy of rural America over that same 
period of time.<P>

<hr><h2>HOUSE HEALTH-CARE REFORM PLAN BETTER THAN KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PLAN
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 27, 1996</b> -- A health-care <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bgup271.html">reform bill</a> scheduled for a 
vote in the House of Representatives this Thursday would go a long way toward solving the 
problems of availability, portability and affordability of health insurance, more so than the 
Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.<p>
	&quot;Anxiety about todays health-insurance coverage stems from the fact that coverage is 
tied to the workplace,&quot; says Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. &quot;Workers and dependents are covered 
by an employer-based health-insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same 
employer. If a worker loses his job, he gets no tax break if he buys individual coverage, and if he 
takes another job, he may encounter difficulties getting new coverage if he has a pre-existing 
medical condition.&quot;<p> 
	The Senate bill tries to address these problems, Liu says, but it fails to treat the problems 
at their source: the fact that health insurance -- unlike other types of insurance -- is owned by 
employers, rather than individual workers. This anomaly, he notes, is encouraged by the tax 
code.<p>
	Sponsored by eight House members, the Health Coverage and Affordability Act would 
enable Americans to keep their health insurance when they change or lose their jobs, allow 
individuals to purchase health insurance outside of the workplace, and allow self-employed 
individuals to deduct 50 percent (up from the current 30 percent) of the amount paid for health 
insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House legislation is being coordinated by 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.<p>
	Effective health-care reform, Liu says, would offer the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Group-to-Group portability/tax equity. The best way to achieve portability, Liu says, is 
to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance independent of their employers, and 
still receive the tax breaks they get for employer-based insurance. This would benefit most of 
todays uninsured, especially the self-employed and those working at small firms that are  unable 
to provide health insurance, the Heritage analyst says.<p>
	<li> Limits on exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions for those who lose employer-
based coverage. Liu says Kassebaum-Kennedys guaranteed availability and renewability of 
health insurance is &quot;a welcome and long-overdue improvement in todays health insurance 
market.&quot; The House proposal would similarly limit the ability of insurance carriers to impose 
eligibility or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience or medical history.<p>
	<li> Group-purchasing arrangements to allow small employers and associations to pool their 
purchasing power and get reasonably priced coverage. Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts -- through 
creation of so-called Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) -- to make insurance more 
affordable for small employers and the self-employed. But, Liu says, because HPPCs would 
receive more favorable treatment from certain state laws than other types of plans, they would 
have an unfair advantage. &quot;Instead of creating an uneven playing field, Congress should ensure 
that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or not, are treated equally,&quot; Liu says.<p>
</ul>
	&quot;To achieve true health-insurance reform, Kassebaum-Kennedy must incorporate key 
proposals from the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act now making its way 
through the House. Only then can Congress give working Americans what they want from 
health-insurance reform: true portability and more choice through the purchase of  individual 
policies that provide long-term protection against catastrophic illness. If Americans are allowed 
to comparison shop among a variety of health plans, costs can be controlled,&quot; Liu says.<p>

<h2>U.S. SHOULD OPPOSE CHINA'S EFFORTS TO DELAY<BR>
GLOBAL FREE TRADE WITH TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 22, 1996</b> -- In addition to threatening Taiwan militarily, the Peoples Republic of China is trying to prevent the island nation from gaining entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before China itself does -- a move the United States <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html">should oppose</a>, says an Asia analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	One of Americas largest trading partners, Taiwan is taking steps to meet the economic requirements for entry into the WTO, the organization that sets the rules for international free trade, says Heritage Asian Trade and Economics Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert OQuinn</a>. These include lifting all import bans and slashing tariffs on foreign goods, which would boost trade between Taiwan and other countries, including the United States. 
<p>
	But theres a problem. &quot;The most significant obstacle to Taiwans membership in the 
WTO is not economic, it is political,&quot; OQuinn says. &quot;China insists that Taiwan should not join 
the WTO before China does.&quot; This is true even though Taiwans economy is more advanced than 
Chinas. For China, however, the chief concern is that the world recognize its status as a global 
economic power and its primacy over Taiwan, something it feels is threatened if Taiwan gains 
entry to the WTO first.<p>
	Although the United States cannot unilaterally set the terms for WTO admittance, it 
should &quot;be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwans membership, even 
in the face of Chinas determined opposition,&quot; OQuinn says. In addition, the United States 
should work closely with the European Union and Japan -- the other key players in the trade 
organization -- to build a consensus within the WTO for admitting China only on &quot;commercially 
viable&quot; terms, not for political reasons.<p> 
	Unfortunately, OQuinn says, the Clinton administration seems willing to bow to Chinas 
demands, a position at odds with U.S. economic goals. &quot;As the worlds largest exporter, the 
United States has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO 
applicants,&quot; he says. &quot;Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTOs economic 
criteria should be free to join.&quot;<p>
	This is not to say the administration shouldnt look for ways to let both countries join the 
WTO at the same time, which would &quot;be the best outcome for all parties,&quot; OQuinn says. But 
that may not be possible. China -- with its high tariffs, strict import controls, and anti-
competitive industrial policy -- must do much more to reform its economy than Taiwan before it 
can qualify for entry.<p>  
	OQuinn says there is a way the Clinton administration might get China not only to speed 
up its economic reforms, but to drop its opposition to Taiwan-first WTO entry: Offer China 
permanent &quot;most-favored nation&quot; (MFN) trading status. This is something China values highly, 
so much so that it might be willing to make concessions. OQuinn says the administration should 
ask Congress for the authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, the 1975 
law that requires Chinas MFN status to be renewed every year.<p>
	In the meantime, OQuinn says, the administration should continue to insist that Taiwans 
entry into the WTO not be held hostage to Chinas demands. &quot;Taiwan should join the WTO 
when it is ready,&quot; he says, &quot;not when Beijing says it can.&quot;<p>

<h2>GOVERNORS' WELFARE REFORM PLAN FAILS<BR>
TO TACKLE ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>

NGA Plan a Poor Model<br>
For Upcoming Legislation<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 19, 1995</b>  -- The welfare reform plan developed by the nations governors for use  as a reform model on Capitol Hill completely ignores illegitimacy -- the No. 1 problem experts have identified as perpetuating the welfare culture, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1075.html">Heritage Foundation</a> analyst said today.

<p>
According to<a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm"> Robert Rector</a>, senior analyst for welfare and family issues, &QUOT;Illegitimacy and 
family collapse are the keys that open the door not only to perpetual welfare dependency, but to a host 
of other problems such as crime, poverty, drug abuse and school failure. Yet the National Governors 
Association (NGA) not only has abandoned the goal of reducing illegitimacy, it has devised a plan that 
would  provide even more government-funded support services to an expanding population of single 
mothers.&QUOT;<P>
	Thus, the NGA plan, &QUOT;sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social 
service spending in the future,&QUOT; Rector says. A combined welfare-Medicaid reform package is expected 
to be introduced in Congress this month and taken up by the House and Senate in May. Rector says 
Congress would do well to &QUOT;just say no to the welfare reform plan offered by the NGA and pass instead 
legislation that makes reducing illegitimacy, encouraging marriage, and requiring work top priorities.&QUOT;<P>
	&QUOT;By refusing to acknowledge or even mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are 
implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. 
They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out 
of wedlock and raised in government-supported day care centers,&QUOT; Rector warns. &QUOT;This is not reform; it 
is a national disaster.&QUOT;<P> 
	Rector points out that nearly a third of all children born in America last year were born out of 
wedlock. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. The 
illegitimate birth rate among whites is nearly 25 percent, almost equaling the black rate in the 1960s 
when policy-makers -- notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., -- warned of the consequences 
associated with the erosion of marriages in black families. <P>
	Rector says children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those 
born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more 
likely to give birth out of wedlock themselves when compared to girls from intact families not on 
welfare. Often, they repeat the mothers pattern of having a child and applying for welfare, thus 
continuing the generational cycle of dependence. A poor boy from a single-parent home in the inner 
city is twice as likely to engage in crime compared to a similar boy living with both parents.<P>
	Not only does the NGA plan fail to address illegitimacy, it also guts the work requirements 
from the last House-Senate conference bill, according to Rector.<P>  
	&QUOT;There are so many loopholes in the NGA plan that no welfare recipients would be required to 
work,&QUOT; he says.  Just one example: Up to 20 percent of recipients counted as working can be enrolled in 
vocational education, a remedy that has proved ineffective in the past.<P>
	&QUOT;Just as it did in 1988, the NGA is offering cosmetic welfare reform,&QUOT; Rector says. &QUOT;The public 
was told that welfare would be replaced by work. Then, as now, the NGA opposed real work 
requirements. As a consequence, welfare reform resulted in an explosion of day care funding, and 
welfare caseloads grew by some 30 percent. Now, it looks like history is about to repeat itself.&QUOT;<P>

<h2>FLAT-TAX PLAN WOULD LOWER TAXES<br>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1996</b> --  A Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">analysis</a> of the 17-
percent flat-tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., shows &quot;no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class 
Americans when compared with their current tax burden.&quot;<p>
	In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups, 
according to the report by William Beach, visiting fellow in tax analysis, and Daniel Mitchell, 
McKenna senior fellow in political economy.<p>
	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90t1.gif">table</a> provided by the Heritage analysts, based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, shows 
that under a 17 percent flat tax, households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income 
will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in their tax burden. In fact, &quot;About 24 million families 
who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented 
Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the analysts say, &quot;and nearly everyone else below $30,000 in taxable 
income will see their taxes fall.&quot;<p>
	For example, households whose taxable income ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 per 
year would see nearly a 36 percent drop in federal taxes. Those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range 
would pay almost 16 percent less; and those in the $50,000 to $75,000 taxable-income range 
would pay almost 12 percent less.<p>
	Will lower taxes mean higher deficits for the federal government? Not according to the 
Heritage analysts, who say the loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-Shelby 
plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. &quot;Corporate 
income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the Heritage analysts point out. &quot;This 
largely offsets decreases in individual income tax payments during the two years it will take to 
implement this tax reform. Taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from 
corporations will rise by $52 billion.&quot; <p>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


                        WASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1996</b> -- Hailed as a bold move to roll back big 
government by returning power to the states, the Medicaid-reform plan touted by the nations 
governors actually preserves some of the worst elements of the program and creates a costly new 
state entitlement to federal money, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi89.html">analysis</a>.<P>
	Unless changes are made to the plan, which forms the basis of legislation being crafted by 
the congressional leadership, it &QUOT;will be a disaster rather than a reform,&QUOT; says Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. To prevent this outcome, he says, Congress should limit the 
categories of Americans guaranteed coverage under Medicaid and cancel the open-ended state 
entitlement to federal money.<P>
	According to Liu, the governors plan claims to scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor 
of a system of block grants (or cash payments) to the states, yet preserves a long list of benefits 
that must be provided to a large, entitled population.  In fact, of the 33 million Americans on 
Medicaid in 1993, fully 71 percent would still be guaranteed benefits under the governors plan.<P>
&QUOT;The governors plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and 
costly entitlement feature of Medicaid,&QUOT; Liu says.<P>
	Since the governors decision to guarantee Medicaid coverage to so many people will 
impose heavy burdens on state budgets, Liu says, they also included an &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; 
provision that entitles states to federal money.  If states experience an unanticipated rise in the 
number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government would bear the cost, which 
almost certainly would increase the federal deficit.  &QUOT;The states have figured out a way to write 
blank checks on the federal treasury,&QUOT; Liu says.  This is hard to justify, he says, when the federal 
share of Medicaid costs is projected to reach $100 billion this fiscal year.<P>
	If Medicaid reform is to go beyond merely cosmetic changes, Liu says, Congress must fix 
these problems. First, lawmakers should sharply limit who is entitled to what under Medicaid, 
focusing benefits on the truly needy such as the homeless and mentally ill.  Second, Congress 
should turn the state entitlement to &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; into an annual appropriation with a 
fixed amount of money. This would give states needed protection from sudden increases in the 
Medicaid population, but not an open pipeline to the federal treasury.<P>
	&QUOT;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then 
Medicaid ... will require more, not less, fiscal discipline,&QUOT; Liu says.  Without changes, he says, 
the governors Medicaid reform plan &QUOT;should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of 
the open-ended entitlement status of todays program.&QUOT;  <P>

<h2>"TEAM B" ADVISES CONGRESS: WITHDRAW FROM ABM, BUILD MISSILE DEFENSES<br>
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

Administration &QUOT;More Interested In Defending<BR> 
ABM Treaty Than Defending America&QUOT;<p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 12, 1996</b> -- The United States should withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and adopt a plan for defending America from ballistic missile attack by building effective sea-based and space-based defenses, the Heritage Foundations "Team B" missile defense study team <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1074.html">said today</a>.<p>

	Top priority, the study panel said, should be given to expanding the Navys Aegis air-
defense system with a missile-defense component able to protect wide areas of the United States 
and other countries from incoming ballistic missiles by the year 1999. Ultimately, America 
should aim for cooperation among allied nations in building the kind of international anti-
ballistic missile system called for by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this 
weekend, the panel said.<P>
	Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to introduce missile-defense 
legislation on Thursday of this week, and both houses of Congress will hold hearings shortly 
thereafter, extending into April.<P> 
	The Heritage Foundation panel, led by former Strategic Defense Initiative Organization 
Director Amb. Henry Cooper, says in its report that Congress needs to face up to the fact that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of defending Americans against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack. In short, the administration considers the 1972 ABM Treaty more important than 
missile defenses -- a conclusion with which the panel sharply disagrees.<P>

ABM Treaty or ABM/TMD Treaty?<p>
	The Team B consensus is that no long-term, effective defense of the American people 
against ballistic missiles can be built within the constraints of the ABM Treaty. &QUOT; The ABM 
Treaty is stifling the development of todays most capable and effective defense systems and 
perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases and allies 
overseas,&QUOT; Team B says. &QUOT;Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations 
delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;The time has come for the United States to exercise its right under Article XV of the 
ABM Treaty to give six months notice to Russia, withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and build the 
needed defenses,&quot; the blue-ribbon panel says in the 1996 edition of &quot;Defending America: Ending 
Americas Vulnerability To Ballistic Missiles.&quot; <p>
	Yet, the Clinton administration not only exhibits &quot;a slavish adherence&quot; to a treaty signed 
with the now defunct Soviet Union, it even appears committed to expanding the treatys reach so 
it prevents the building of theater missile defenses (TMD). The administration reportedly has 
accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater missile 
defenses. It has even &quot;dumbed down&quot; the capabilities of theater defense systems rather than 
make them as capable as available technology will permit<p>. 
	In short, &quot;if the administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be 
built. The administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending 
Americans,&qupt; Team B concludes.<p>
Administration Obfuscation<p>	
	&quot;The administrations actions over the past year, characterized chiefly by the presidents 
veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization bill, demonstrate that the American people cannot 
depend on the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the 
common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow,&quot; the Team B report says.<p>
	&quot;While publicly claiming it is vigorously pursuing missile defenses, the administration
has quietly canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive 
missile defense programs, while supporting more expensive, less effective ones and extending 
their development time, thereby increasing costs,&quot; Team B says. &quot;It has become regrettably clear 
that the Clinton administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy.&quot;    <p>
The Threat<p>
	The United States still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic 
missiles (ICBMs). &quot;Contrary to what most Americans believe,&quot; the Team B analysts say, &quot;if  an 
ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single 
thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their 
targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possible millions, of Americans.&quot;<p>
	The Clinton administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American 
homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat 
develops. &quot;Yet, American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles,&quot; Team 
B points out. &quot;A Chinese official recently threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the United States 
interfered with Chinas feud with Taiwan. North Koreas nuclear and missile programs recently 
prompted the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea to request that theater missile defense 
development be expedited. Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last 
year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away. Rogue states could 
threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- sooner if they chose to 
accelerate their development plans,&quot; Team B analysts say. <p>
What Congress Should Do?<p>
	Team B says &quot;America should indicate clearly to the Russians that the United States 
intends to provide effective wide-area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops 
and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russias agreement.&quot; However, if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, &quot;Congress should use all available powers and prerogatives to move 
America toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months notice, which it has a 
right to do under Article XV,&quot; say the Team B analysts. <p>
	Then, Congress should &quot;press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-
term defenses technically feasible. This means a de-emphasis of ground-based defenses -- since 
they can be overcome by countermeasures, are expensive, and are difficult to deploy. Highest 
priority should be assigned to expanding and converting the Navys Aegis air-defense system to 
missile defense and deploying theater defenses based on this model by the year 1999.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;For an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 Aegis 
cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile-defense capability for the 
United States and for U.S. forces and allies overseas,&quot; the Team B analysts say. &quot;These highly 
mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile 
strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas.&quot;<p>
	In addition, the development of space-based sensors and defenses, both kinetic-energy 
interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated, the Team B analysts say. &quot;With the 
necessary funding support, deployment of such systems can begin shortly after the year 2000. 
For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.&quot;<p>
	&quot;The Clinton administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind 
a smokescreen of positive-sounding but meaningless policy declarations,&quot; the Team B analysts 
conclude. &quot;It is clear that the Clinton administration will remain derelict in the duties required of

must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the 
improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executives dereliction of

<h2>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>




                WASHINGTON, MARCH 11, 1996</b> -- Although the 1996 budget battle between 
Congress and the White House is still unresolved, President Clinton has already released a new 
1997 budget that boosts spending by $361 billion and tax revenues by $526 billion over the next 
seven years, according to a<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1071.html"> new report</a> by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	For every household in America, the new White House budget means $1,927 in higher 
taxes and $3,155 in higher spending over seven years, compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget 
Act that the president vetoed last fall, says Heritage budget specialist <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.<P>
	Moreover, the White House budget would add $119 billion more in deficits through 2002 
than Congress Balanced Budget Act, the equivalent of increasing the debt burden on the average 
household by $1,227, Hodge says.<P>
	&quot;Just weeks after telling the nation in this years State of the Union address that the era 
of big government is over, President Clinton [has] indicated that the obituary notice was 
premature,&quot; says Hodge, Heritages Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs.<p>
	He says while the White House plan would, on paper, balance the budget by 2002, it can 
only do so &quot;by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.&quot;  For 
example, the budget claims to save $596 billion over the next seven years, but fully 60 percent of 
that deficit reduction is scheduled to happen after President Clinton leaves office.<p>
	Whats more, the family tax cuts in the presidents plan come in the early years, then 
screech to a halt in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget. The result: Families depending on a 
planned $500-per-child tax credit would get hit in 2002 with a $17 billion tax increase.  Whats 
more, the president offsets the $98 billion he proposes in tax cuts with $59 billion in tax 
increases.  The resulting net tax cut of $39 billion represents just 3 cents of every $1,000 
taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years, Hodge says.<p>
	While tax relief under the White House budget is negligible, spending on entitlement 
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare steams ahead, increasing by $365 billion, or 50 
percent, over seven years.  All told, spending on mandatory programs under the White House 
budget would rise from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar 
in 2002. <p> 
	And although the president proposes to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 
billion over seven years, thats not nearly enough to save the program from impending 
bankruptcy, Hodge says.  In fact, the news that in 1995 the Medicare Hospital Insurance program 
paid out $36 million more in benefits than it took in from payroll taxes shows the program could 
face a financial crisis even sooner than the projected bankruptcy in 2002.<p>
	The situation with Medicaid is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, 
Hodge says, states probably will need to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion over seven 
years to pay for it. The White House response is to slow Medicaid spending increases by $59 
billion over the same period, which does little good when maintaining the programs entitlement 
status could cost states more than $47 billion.<p>
	There is, Hodge says, one area of the budget where the White House does propose real 
changes: spending for social programs is greatly expanded.  While short on details -- which are 
scheduled to be supplied in the administrations full budget due later this month -- the current 
White House budget &quot;outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as 
education, high technology, crime fighting and the environment,&quot; Hodge says. Compared to the 
Balanced Budget Act, the president proposes spending an extra $111 billion over seven years on 
discretionary programs.<p>
	Yet oddly, Hodge says, the White House also claims to &quot;save&quot; $297 billion in 
discretionary programs over seven years.  Of course, these savings are calculated by using the 
Congressional Budget Offices &quot;baseline,&quot; which assumes automatic spending increases every 
year.  Under this accounting system, simply freezing discretionary spending at 1995 levels would 
&quot;save&quot; $258 billion over seven years.  The extra $39 billion the president proposes to save? 
Hodge says 95 percent of these cuts come in 2001 and 2002, when President Clinton can no 
longer be in office.<p> 
	&quot;The administrations repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys ... casts doubt on 
its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress,&quot; Hodge says. &quot;The Clinton 
budget is not the end of big government,  it is the embodiment of it.&quot;<p>

<title>White House Retreat on Free Trade Bodes Ill for U.S. - Heritage PR</title>

BODES ILL FOR U.S., ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1996</b> -- Bowing to protectionist pressure, the White House is backing away from its commitment to free trade in the Western Hemisphere, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1070.html">policy shift</a> that could derail the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), damage relations with Mexico and discredit U.S. leadership on free trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	Opponents of free trade have accused NAFTA of causing everything from the Mexican economic crisis and declining U.S. wages to increased illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The fact that the White House has allowed such charges to go unanswered shows that "free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton administration," says Heritage Latin America Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>.
<p>
	On the contrary, over the past year the White House has taken steps to downgrade NAFTA, first by reneging on a promise to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996 and then by violating key provisions of the trade pact such as allowing Mexican trucks to operate in U.S. border states. 
<p>	If the Clinton administration continues to shirk its obligations under NAFTA, Sweeney says, it will establish "a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada and other countries could follow in the future." Even now, Sweeney says, political leaders throughout Latin America are questioning the administration's commitment to free trade. The possible result: "If Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide," he says.
<p>	To prevent NAFTA from falling into disrepute, Sweeney says the White House must take a number of steps to strengthen the treaty. Not only should the administration respect NAFTA's provisions, it should complete the trade pact's unfinished business with Mexico, which includes forgiving Mexico's public debt and working out solutions to immigration, labor and law-enforcement problems. In addition, the White House should reverse course and speed up the process of admitting Chile to NAFTA.
<p>	Sweeney says the administration has nothing to fear from critics of NAFTA, whose charges have proven untrue. For example, the claim that NAFTA caused the Mexican economic crisis couldn't be more wrong. "The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency," he says.  "If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious."
<p>	NAFTA also remains crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the new global economy, Sweeney says. U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than exports to the rest of the world. Even in 1995, when the Mexican economic crisis was at its worst, the United States still exported more to Mexico than it did before NAFTA. All told, the United States exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America every year -- more than half of that to Mexico -- supporting nearly 2 million U.S. jobs.
<p>	By backing away from free trade, and NAFTA, the White House is also threatening U.S. relations with Mexico, Sweeney says. NAFTA is crucial if Mexico is to emerge from its economic crisis. If that crisis continues, he says, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow, with conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking displacing cooperation on trade and investment. Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in seeing Mexico become a stable, capitalist democracy. But "without NAFTA, [Mexican President Ernesto] Zedillo's chance of advancing political reforms would be very poor," Sweeney says.
<p>	If American relations with Mexico deteriorate through half-hearted U.S. support for NAFTA, the Clinton administration faces the risk of forfeiting America's leadership role as the champion of free trade in the Western Hemisphere, Sweeney says. In fact, the dream of creating a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone by the year 2005, ostensibly shared by the White House, could collapse.  
<p>	"The Clinton administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere," Sweeney says. "The task for American policy-makers now is to correct the current drift in policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible."

<html><title>Architect of Free-Market Farm Bill Assesses Congress' Reform Bill -- Heritage PR</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
               214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>                     Washington, D.C. 20002<br>                              (202) 546-4400<br><hr><h2> ARCHITECT OF FREE-MARKET FARM PLAN
ASSESSES CONGRESS' REFORM BILL</h2>
</center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1996</b> -- A principal architect of the agriculture-reform plan moving through Congress praised the effort to replace America's Depression-era farm policy with a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">market-based system</a>, but said Congress' failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs would cost consumers billions of dollars per year in higher prices. 
<P>
	The House of Representatives last week passed the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which incorporates many of the major structural changes proposed in the April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, "Freeing America's Farmers." The Senate passed similar legislation earlier this year.
<p>
	The legislation would end government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops through quotas and planting restrictions. Most dramatically, farm subsidies would be replaced by steadily decreasing "market-transition" payments that would end after seven years.  The House and Senate are expected to iron out differences between the two bills in conference this week.
<p>	"For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the government," said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project.  "Consumers win with more competitive prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market."
<p>	Published in advance of last year's congressional debate over reauthorizing America's farm programs, the Heritage farm policy blueprint also called for the elimination of the Farmer-Owned Reserve -- a surplus cache of crops the government uses to hold down commodity prices artificially by flooding the market.  This recommendation also was adopted by both the House and Senate.
<P>	While the farm bills mark a dramatic, and welcome, departure from command-and-control agriculture policy, Frydenlund says Congress should have adopted other elements of the Heritage plan as well. The failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs is one glaring omission, he says, as is leaving intact a component of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/em448.html">dairy program</a> that will force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk. "A truly free-market approach to farm policy would have ended these programs," he says.
<P>	Frydenlund also says Congress should have done more to reform the Conservation Reserve Program, an environmental program that too often pays farmers to take productive land out of use. "The least Congress should do is let farmers remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program," he says.
<p>	Another problem: Under the new system, market-transition payments will actually cost the government more in the first few years than traditional subsidies, an outcome Frydenlund warned against in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib216.html">Heritage paper</a> in September of last year. At the time, he urged Congress to set a "trigger price" for commodities that, if exceeded, would cancel or reduce transition payments for a given year. This can be easily fixed, however, in the House-Senate conference, he says.
<P>	Despite these shortcomings, Frydenlund says the farm bills go further than any piece of legislation in U.S. history to create a free market for agriculture. "Outdated farm programs are robbing American consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars a year and denying farmers the right to take advantage of explosive growth in the worldwide demand for food," he says.  "Congress has taken a huge step toward correcting these injustices."

<title>U.S. Shouldn't Rule Out Use of Force if China Attacks Taiwan - Heritage PR</title>

<b>Clinton's Weak Signals <br>
Risk Crisis In Taiwan Strait</b>

<center><h2>U.S. SHOULDN'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE
IF CHINA ATTACKS TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<b> For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>	WASHINGTON, MARCH 4, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan in response to the island nation's first-ever presidential elections March 23 -- nor should it rule out the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html">use of force</a> in case of such an attack, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>, senior analyst with Heritage's Asian Studies Center, the administration should order the U.S. Navy to hold exercises near Taiwan during the period before and after the March 23 presidential election to deter Chinese military action. Also, it should sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, including advanced air-to-air missiles, conventional submarines, and missile-defense systems.
<p>	"By failing to assure China's leaders of U.S. intentions in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could do incalculable damage to Taiwan, U.S.-China relations and U.S. leadership in Asia," Fisher warns.
<p>	President Clinton therefore must take "strong but measured steps" to convey to Beijing America's clear interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Fisher says that in addition to warning China that U.S. force is an option, and deploying the U.S. Navy to deter Chinese military action, the Clinton administration should:
<p><ul>
<li>	 In compliance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, inform Chinese leaders that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States";<p>
<li> Tell China it may face economic sanctions, ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo;<p>
<li> Maintain the balance of power in Asia by deploying missile defenses to protect U.S. forces stationed there, thus offsetting China's demonstrated willingness to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan; and<p>
<li> Recognize Taiwan's democratic reforms and urge China and the Republic of China (ROC) to resolve their differences peacefully.
</ul><p>
	Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway as the presidential election approaches. "China fears the emergence of Taiwan as a model for political reform on the mainland, and continues to reserve the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare independence," Fisher points out.
<p>	Fisher says President Clinton's failure to respond adequately to recent Chinese saber-rattling in the South China Sea and against Taiwan "fosters an impression of American weakness, and lends encouragement to Chinese hard-liners." He adds that "Several statements by Clinton administration officials to the effect that the United States will not defend Taiwan if it is attacked are potentially even more destabilizing."
<p>	"At stake is not only peace and security in the region, but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. Also, with a population of 21 million and trade with the United States totaling $47 billion per year, the ROC is the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, right behind China itself," Fisher says.
<p>	"The United States cannot afford to let the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorate further without grave consequences for U.S. stature in Asia," he says. "The Clinton administration must make clear the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan."

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MARCH 1, 1996</b> -- Congress should identify and eliminate a host of government programs that special-interest groups use to fund lobbying and political activities many taxpayers would not willingly support, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<P>	 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/griffin.html">Charles Griffin</a>, deputy director of Heritage's Government  Reform Project, Congress' 1995 effort to stop what he calls "taxpayer-funded political slush funds" fell far short of what is needed to solve the problem. "Not only are many political lobbying groups still able to draw billions of taxpayer dollars into their coffers," Griffin says, "such groups also tend to be the strongest supporters of bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation -- which guarantee them continued funding."
<p>	Griffin identifies the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1069.html">top 10 government programs</a> that give taxpayer-funded grants to hundreds of special interests, which then use the money for political purposes. For example, by law, participants in AmeriCorps, President's Clinton's national service program, are barred from engaging in partisan political activities. Yet, in one reported instance, a nonprofit group, the Cole Coalition in Cole, Colo., used AmeriCorps volunteers to draft campaign fliers attacking a local politician and distribute them door-to-door. "We realized there was something politically partisan," said 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor. "Although the Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding," Griffin says, "the AmeriCorps program lives on -- as does the potential for abuse." 
<p>	Another major violator, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) -- funded at $400 million per year -- was originally established to provide legal services to the poor in civil and non-criminal matters. Griffin says the LSC uses its budget to funnel federal taxpayer dollars to 323 private groups around the country that use the money to fight legal battles having clear political objectives. "Through litigation, advocacy and lobbying, the LSC has helped to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending and the addition of hundreds of millions of people to the welfare rolls," Griffin says. 
<p>	For example, LSC grantees have sued governments at all levels to stop welfare reform and have worked to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. "It's not that people don't have a right to engage in such activities," Griffin adds. "It's that they shouldn't be allowed to do so with the taxpayers' money."
<p>	 A third example from the top 10 list, the Department of Health and Human Services' Discretionary Aging Projects, is funded at $26 million per year. While the stated purpose of the project is to provide trained personnel and programs that improve the quality of life for the elderly, Griffin says the money in the program is often used to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest groups. 
<p>	"The National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 percent of its budget from federal funds and is one of many such groups that promote government interventionism," Griffin says.  Other grantees benefiting from the program in 1994 included groups that actively opposed Medicare reform, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
<p>	Griffin says funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests to subsidize their political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse of the public's money and the public trust. 
<p>	"If the situation were reversed and millions of taxpayer dollars were going to conservative activist groups, the response would be sheer outrage. Political orientation aside, Congress needs to put an end to this egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars," Griffin says.

TOUGHER RESPONSE TO CUBA</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 29, 1996</b> -- Calling economic sanctions against Cuba an insufficient response to the island nation's downing of two U.S. civilian aircraft, a Heritage Foundation analyst today outlined a series of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi88.html">tough measures</a> the United States should take to further isolate Fidel Castro.
<p>
	"In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force," Heritage Latin American Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a> says in a new paper.
<p>	Specifically, Sweeney says the U.S. government should:
<p><ul>
	<li> Warn Cuba that the United States will enforce international law in the region.  Any attacks by Cuba against civilian aircraft or boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit established by international law should be met with a "prompt, immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces," he says.  U.S. warplanes should patrol the waters between Florida and Cuba to enable a rapid response.
<p>
<li> Ban the flow of all cash from the United States to Cuba, which props up the Castro regime with more than $500 million a year in hard currency.
	<p><li> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by U.S. citizens -- including journalists, academics and business people -- and ban travel to the United States by all Cubans until the Castro regime extends the same travel privileges to opposition leaders as it does to communist officials.
<P><li> Impose strict controls over the activities and movements of Cuban officials in the United States.  The Castro regime bans democratic and human rights groups from meeting freely in Cuba; the U.S. government should deny Cuban officials those same freedoms in the United States, expelling all violators.
<p><li>Warn Castro that the United States will view any attempt to spark a new refugee crisis as a hostile act against the national security of the United States.
<p><li> Use Radio Marti to inform Cubans that U.S. actions are aimed at Castro, not at them, to counter Castro's anti-American propaganda.
<p><li> Publicly oppose the activation in Cuba of a nuclear reactor based on an unsafe East German design, which would present a security threat to the Southeast United States.

<h2>AS BIG GOVERNMENT WITHERS, LEADING
THINKERS PONDER A REPLACEMENT</h2>
</center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 12, 1996</b> --  If the era of big government is over, as 
President Clinton proclaims, what will replace it? 
<p>
	Lots of things. In the <a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/toc.html">latest issue</a> of 
<I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>, 20 prominent thinkers and 
reformers describe private institutions they would like to see emerge over the next two decades 
to rebuild American community and culture in the wake of the welfare state. 
<p>	<a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/symp.html"> Their suggestions</a> run the gamut 
from police-training programs for kids (proposed by New York City Police Commissioner 
William Bratton) to structured group homes for welfare mothers and their children (Myron 
Magnet, editor of the <I>City Journal</I>, New York City, and author of  "<I>The Dream and the 
Nightmare.</I>" Uniting the proposals is a common belief that reliance on Washington to solve 
society's problems has done more harm than good. American culture and society must be 
renewed the old-fashioned way: by private citizens working hands-on in their own communities.
<P>Not surprisingly, many of the suggestions concern improving America's government-run 
education system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wants all parents to have the 
right -- and the financial ability -- to send their children to any school, public or private. William 
Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton who now teaches at the University of Maryland's 
School of Public Affairs, proposes a new funding system for charter schools, which are quasi-
public but free of much of the stifling bureaucracy that plagues the broader government school 
system.  
<p>	Two participants -- New York Lt. Gov. Elizabeth McCaughey Ross and Jim Pinkerton, 
former Bush administration official and author of "<I>What Comes Next: The End of Big 
Government - And the New Paradigm Ahead</I>" -- even proposed the same idea: a rating 
system for schools (Pinkerton envisions a <I>Consumer Reports</I> for education) that would 
empower parents with information on how money is being spent and how well students are 
performing on standardized tests.
<p>	But education reform is not enough. Bratton, for example, believes many kids need to 
learn respect for the law and law-enforcement officers. His dream of a structured police career 
path for kids -- summer "youth academies" and a police-oriented version of the Boy Scouts 
called Law Enforcement Explorers -- would give young people positive interactions with the 
police, deepen their respect for the law, and even guide some into police careers themselves.
<p>	Myron Magnet envisions group homes for welfare mothers and children where the focus 
is not on the job prospects of young women but on providing structured, caring environments for 
kids. He believes that by the time today's underclass children reach school, it's too late to give 
them the foundation in cognitive and moral skills they will need to succeed. That's what the 
group homes could do.
<p>	Higher education is ripe for some new ideas as well. Harvey Mansfield, professor of 
government at Harvard, longs for a "great books junior college" to give students the education 
they didn't receive in high school and won't receive in politically correct four-year institutions.  
And Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and author of "<I>Hollywood vs. 
America</I>," would go even further, creating an "elite" private university that would go back to 
teaching a classic liberals arts education and compete with the politically correct Ivy League 
schools. 
<p>	Other innovative ideas rounding out the list include: private science funding (perhaps by 
corporations) to reduce the scientific community's dependence on the federal government; 
private, non-profit job-training programs; effective homeless programs run by representatives 
from the religious and business communities; and even new television shows devoted to 
exposing government violations of citizens' rights and celebrating individuals who have 
overcome personal hardships.

<h2> FLAT TAX REDUCES TAX BILLS
IN EVERY STATE, STUDY SHOWS</h2></center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 9, 1996</b> -- Taxpayers in every state would send less of their income to Washington under a 17 percent flat tax, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a>.
<p>	The average annual savings would range from a high of $1,856 per taxpaying household in Connecticut to a low of $318 in California, the study showed. And in 33 states, the average household would see its income-tax bill drop by more than $1,000 per year.
<p>	Nationwide, the 17 percent flat tax would reduce the average household's yearly federal tax bill by more than $1,100, a savings of 25 percent compared to the current system, said Heritage economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>. Taxpayers in many states would save even more. In addition to Connecticut, the top 10 include: New Jersey ($1,521), Illinois ($1,511), North Dakota ($1,506), Virginia ($1,463), Indiana ($1,415), Rhode Island ($1,406), Washington ($1,385), Michigan ($1,372) and Florida ($1,335).
<p>
	With the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes built around the flat tax, tax reform has already emerged as a key 1996 election issue. House Majority Leader Richard Armey,  R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., both have introduced bills that would replace the current tax code with a flat rate that taxes income only once. 
<p>	Contrary to claims that a flat tax might increase the tax burden on middle-income taxpayers, Beach and Mitchell found that "a properly designed flat tax would provide much-needed tax relief" for the average filer.  
<P>	Their analysis of the impact on taxpayers under the Armey-Shelby plan found that households in every state would see their tax bills drop not only in dollar terms, but in percentage terms as well. South Dakota taxpayers would benefit the most, with an average tax decrease of 38 percent. Other states would see big drops too, including North Dakota (33 percent), Indiana (31 percent) and Florida (30 percent).  
<p>	All told, a 17 percent tax rate on individual income would decrease federal tax payments by $125 billion, with the largest savings going to individual taxpayers in New York ($10 billion), Texas ($8 billion), Illinois ($8 billion) and Florida ($8 billion).
<p>	The Heritage analysts also examined the impact on taxpayers of a flat tax rate of 20 percent. At the higher rate, they found, the average tax bill would rise in two states. In California the average increase would be $417; in Montana: $9. In the rest of the states, even a 20 percent rate would result in a tax decrease for the average taxpayer; nationwide it would yield the average household a tax cut of more than $500. 
<p>	In addition, a flat tax of 20 percent -- which is the initial rate under the Armey-Shelby plan -- would be revenue neutral, adding nothing to the deficit. According to Beach and Mitchell, reductions in individual income taxes would be offset by increases in corporate taxes (in the belief that business income should be taxed only once, at the corporate rather than individual level).
<p>	To ensure accuracy, the Heritage analysis was based on actual tax records contained in the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the latest year for which data are available. The Public Use File is a statistically accurate sample (155,000 returns) of all individual income-tax returns for a given year.
<p>	"The evidence shows that those who say a flat tax would make Americans pay more haven't looked at the numbers," Beach says.

DEMISE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, FEB. 6, 1996</b> -- The NATO security alliance that protected Europe from Soviet attack during the Cold War is veering so far from its original mission that it may not survive, according to a defense expert at The Heritage Foundation.
<P>
	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1067.html">paper</a> released today, Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen says NATO's recent foray into "peacekeeping" in Bosnia -- a country not even part of the alliance -- is just the latest example of how NATO is losing sight of its original reason for existence: protecting Europe against domination by a hostile power or bloc of powers.
<P>
	"Who is to say whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe 10 or 20 years from now?" he asks. "It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest in the basic security of Europe."
<p>	To ensure NATO remains a bulwark against threats to Europe's security, Hillen recommends that Congress consider a "NATO Revitalization Act" that would do four things: explain to the American people why U.S. involvement in NATO is vital; define the U.S. role in the alliance as limited to deterring aggression; clarify when U.S. military force should be used; and call for the quick expansion of NATO to include the newly democratized Central European countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.	
<p>	The fact that Europe faces no immediate threat is no argument for expanding the alliance's role, Hillen says. After all, NATO is an insurance policy, designed to protect against catastrophe no matter how remote the threat might be. "It is far better to have 100,000 troops deployed peaceably now than have to commit a million troops later to fight a war," he says.
<p>	Besides, Hillen says, the United States is already involved in an organization designed to handle lower-level security tasks such as peacekeeping, and it is not NATO. The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors sanctions and leads observer missions in the former Yugoslavia and other countries. And while it is true that the OSCE has proven incompetent at dealing with problems like Bosnia, NATO nevertheless should not be thrust into missions for which it is poorly suited.
<p>	But once NATO decides to act, Hillen says, the U.S. role must be clearly defined to promote a sensible "division of labor" with America's allies. He says U.S. forces should be deployed only when they can make a unique contribution -- one no other country is able to make -- and when they can produce a decisive victory. In this way, America can ensure that its military role is limited to serving NATO's core mission of "collective defense" (protecting Europe against hostile domination) and not "collective security" (peacekeeping, nation-building and other humanitarian missions).
<p>	To drift from this core mission in search of new roles for NATO would not only create rifts between NATO members over whose troops should serve in peacekeeping operations, but would diminish support for NATO from an American public that questions why the United States should be the world's policeman.
<p>	By contrast, expanding NATO to include new democracies in Central Europe would strengthen the alliance and "bring a level of stability and security ... that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history." The only obstacle to such expansion, he says, is the Clinton administration, which fears Russia opposition. 
<p>	"NATO needs to get back to basics," Hillen concludes. "In the absence of a clear and present danger to Europe it has lost its focus. ... A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe."

<h2>U.S. PEACEKEEPING MISSION TO GOLAN
HEIGHTS ILL-CONSIDERED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<P>


	WASHINGTON, JAN. 30, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration's plan to launch a "peacekeeping" mission to the Golan Heights once Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement would place both U.S. troops and Israel itself at considerable risk, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1066.html">new paper</a> by foreign-policy experts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>. 
<p>	A U.S. presence in the strategic buffer zone between Israel and Syria would be a double-edged sword, say Heritage Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies Thomas Moore and Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a>.  Not only would U.S. troops face possible attacks from terrorist groups in the area, but Israel's ability to defend itself could be diminished. 
<p>	The analysts urge Congress to hold hearings immediately on the costs and benefits of embroiling the United States in a Golan peacekeeping mission.  They say U.S. negotiators trying to broker an agreement between the two countries should not promise foreign aid to Syria as an enticement to reach peace.  And even if a deal is reached, under no circumstances should American troops participate in a peacekeeping force.  "The United States cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit," they say.  
<p>	Moore and Phillips argue U.S. troops in the Golan Heights would be prime targets for terrorist groups based in nearby Lebanon, such as Hezbollah.  Just as Syria's strongman Hafez al-Assad supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut), so too might he pursue a similar strategy in the Golan to drive U.S. troops from the area. And even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, the analysts say, nothing would prevent Iran, Iraq or Libya from sponsoring terrorism against U.S. troops on their own.
<p>	In addition, a U.S. presence on the Golan would effectively halt Israel's ability to respond with force to attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists or from Syria itself.  "Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria," the analysts say.  Since American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked, "the real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts," they say.
<P>	Moore and Phillips also say a U.S. presence in a Golan peacekeeping mission is not needed.  "Other countries are willing and able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces," they note. Peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland and Poland have been stationed on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, making U.S. participation in any future peacekeeping force unnecessary, they say.
<p>	But if U.S. troops are dispatched to the Golan, their situation would be far more precarious than that of the U.S. peacekeepers stationed along the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula.  In the Sinai, where U.S. troops have been since 1982, a broad desert separates two sides that are allies of the United States and at peace with each other.  In the Golan, U.S. troops would be confined to a much smaller area flanked by the large armored forces of two avowed enemies.
<p>	Any peacekeeping mission to the Golan also would divert critically needed  U.S. forces, the analysts say. A credible long-term Golan peacekeeping mission would likely require three brigades, or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength.  That is a "prohibitively high" burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission, one that could place the United States in jeopardy if conflict arises in Korea, the Persian Gulf or any other place where vital U.S. national interests are at stake, Moore and Phillips say.
<p>	Citing these and other concerns, the analysts say congressional hearings are imperative. They note in both Haiti and Bosnia, swift action by the Clinton administration to send troops stifled congressional debate.  This time, Congress must address the peacekeeping issue before the negotiators reach a deal, or risk receiving another "diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>" from the White House.
<p>	"The United States should not jeopardize important national security interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic," the analysts conclude.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE CAN BE EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST AMERICA'S SOCIAL ILLS, STUDY FINDS</h2></center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 25, 1996</b> -- As Washington policy-makers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">paper</a> released today, <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems. Religion, the majority of studies conclude, "is the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation," according to Fagan, the William H. G. FitzGerald fellow.
<p>	Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgment; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime and divorce. 
<p>	"Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in large part, determined by its religious roots. Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences," Fagan says.
<p>	He cites "Middletown," a classic sociological research project that studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1980s. The study  found that "church-going members were more likely to be married, remain married, and to be highly satisfied with their marriages." 
<p>	Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that "84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families." The same study also indicated that "parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance."
<p>	Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that  religious belief and practice  encourage optimism among socially at-risk children. Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression. 
<p>	Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policy-makers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation. "Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policy-makers," he says.
<p>	Fagan offers several steps that both Congress and the president can take to encourage religious practice. Among them:
<p><ul>
	<li> Congress should initiate a national discussion on the need to restore the  role of religion in American life. "The Senate used to be the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It should take up that role again and discuss the relationship between the practice of religion and the health of the nation,"  Fagan says. 
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that census data on the extent of religious practice can also help inform the public debate on America's most difficult social problems.  Such a resolution would also remove the excuse that it is not permissible to fund research on the  religious aspect of American life. 
	<p>
<li> The president should appoint judges who are at least more sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Fagan says it weakens society and makes no sense to crowd religion out of every activity in which government is involved. "All future candidates for federal court appointments  should be asked to clarify their views regarding both the role of religion in politics and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue," Fagan says.  
</ul><p>	While the study discusses  the role the nation's policy-makers should play in encouraging religious practice, it also spells out actions that America's religious leaders and individual citizens can take.
<p>	Fagan says religious leaders must draw attention to the foundational role religion plays in supporting families and schools. He says religious individuals need to emphasize the need for religious training in adolescents who are most at risk of losing their anchoring in the community and turning to crime, drugs or other social ills.
<P>	"Social research demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It offers a powerful answer to many of the nation's most serious social problems. The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation," Fagan says.

<title>Russian Control of Oil-Rich Regions key to Chechen Conflict, Analyst Says -- Heritage PR</title>

<hr><h2>RUSSIAN CONTROL OF OIL-RICH REGIONS KEY
TO CHECHEN CONFLICT, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 23, 1996</b> -- Overlooked in the current conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya is the larger Russian goal of dominating the oil-rich states of the former Soviet Union, according to a new <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1065.html">Heritage Foundation paper</a>.  
<p>	The Chechen conflict is just one of many efforts by Russia to create a sphere of influence in the strategic regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>.  If Russia succeeds, he says, it could establish a monopoly over the region's vast oil supply (estimated at 25 million barrels, larger than reserves in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined) and drive up energy prices across the globe.
<p>	The U.S. response, Cohen says, must be to ensure that all interested parties, including American oil companies, have free and fair access to the region's oil fields.  The United States can do this in a number of ways, principally by working to preserve the economic independence of former Soviet republics in the region -- such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- and by opposing any efforts of the Russian military to control the oil fields and pipelines through force.
<p>	In a worst-case scenario, Cohen says, Moscow would grab full control of the oil fields, increasing Western energy dependence on a country that has not always been friendly toward the West.  Disturbingly, Russia is already setting up military bases in the region -- four in Georgia and three in Armenia -- to cement its control over all future oil pipelines built in the region.  Such a strategy has support in Russia not only from ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but from the powerful military and "security services."  Cohen describes the intent of these factions bluntly: "The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control."  If Russia dominates this vital region, Cohen even sees the possibility of a Russian alliance with anti-Western regimes Iran, Iraq and Lybia to drive up the price of oil.  
<p>	Cohen says the challenge for the United States is to convince Russia that its national interest lies not in a confrontation with the West over oil, but in cooperation with the West to develop the economic potential of the oil-rich region.  The United States should reassure Moscow that Russian companies, which currently lack the resources to tap the oil, will nevertheless be included in any future ventures.  In this way, Cohen says, Russia will get the economic help it needs from the West, and the West will get the assurance of stability in the region.

<h2>POLICY REVIEW MAGAZINE WILL GREET 1996 
WITH NEW MISSION, FORMAT, FREQUENCY</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<P>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 1, 1995</b> -- As Americans debate how to rebuild their communities in the wake of a receding federal government, one of conservatism's most influential voices is charting a new course for reinvigorating private-sector and local government alternatives to the centralized welfare state. The Heritage Foundation's flagship magazine, <i>Policy Review</i>, is redefining its mission to articulate and advance the conservative vision of "civil society."
<p>
	Beginning with the <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html">January/February 1996</a> issue, the magazine, renamed <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, will feature new departments with a new design and appear six rather than four times a year. <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, the magazine's editor for 12 years, plans to make <i>Policy Review</i> a clearinghouse of information and analysis about civic leaders who are solving America's most pressing social and cultural problems without relying on the federal government. "The central challenge for conservatives over the next 20 years is to restore the tradition of American citizenship by rebuilding the institutions of civil society -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, schools, civic associations, businesses, and local governments," Meyerson explains. 
<p>	The new format builds on one of the current magazine strengths: its long-time focus on stories that show the failures of big-government liberalism and illustrate the successes of private and local government initiative. "By becoming Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship, we are simply clarifying our mission, improving our product by building on what we already do best," says Heritage Foundation President and Policy Review Publisher <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner Jr</a>.
<p>	The magazine seeks to make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of society. "Unlike liberals who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives see religious fervor as one of the most important engines of civil society," says Deputy Editor Joe Loconte. The new Policy Review will feature a regular department, "One Nation Under God," which will show the involvement of religious institutions in repairing America's social fabric.
<p>	Unlike liberals, conservatives also see business as an essential part of the citizenship movement. Frequently the most creative answers to social problems come from businesses that can profit by solving them. Another new department, called "The Blessings of Liberty," will show how economic freedom and marketplace competition contribute to civil society.
<p>	The new Policy Review will feature several other regular departments as well. "Home Front" will identify character-building organizations that promote responsible parenthood. "We the People" will tell about remarkable acts of generosity by ordinary people and community institutions. "Abuses and Usurpations" will show how federal and state executive agencies, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions. <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/tsquare.html">"Town Square"</a> will provide news about the best books, papers, and seminars that promote citizenship. And "Profiles in Citizenship" will look at Americans who have built great civic institutions in the past.
<p>	The January/February issue features a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">symposium with presidential candidates</a> Robert Dole, Phil Gramm, Richard Lugar, Lamar Alexander, and Robert Dornan. Candidates respond to the question, "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" The answers are as varied as the candidates themselves: Dole on "The Establishment Clause"; Gramm on "The Takings Clause"; Lugar on "Enumerated Powers"; Alexander on "Presidential Powers"; and Dornan on "Government by Judiciary."
<p>	Also in this issue, former Attorney General and Heritage Ronald Reagan Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> and special counsel Rhett DeHart show "How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff" in their article about the bipartisan assault on local law enforcement. Meese and DeHart urge national lawmakers to resist the temptation to make ordinary crime a federal issue. They argue that nationalizing crime contradicts constitutional principles, incurs unnecessary expense, and does not allow for states to experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention of crime.
<p>	"Can Congress Revive Civil Society?" Yes, says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Along with William J. Bennett, Coats has introduced the "Project for American Renewal" -- comprised of 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. In this article, Coats details his plan and Gertrude Himmelfarb, Don Eberly, and David Boaz offer their comments.
<p>	In "Clinton's AmeriCorps Values," John Walters of The New Citizenship Project says President Clinton's citizenship is defined  "with subsidies, centralized government, and self-esteem." While Clinton incorporates a message of personal responsibility and citizenship into his rhetoric, his vision is "deeply flawed," says Walters. The president has sought justify his efforts to expand the welfare state and to reinvigorate civic life by trying to re-legitimize government. Walters points to Clinton's AmeriCorps program, which uses federal resources to promote voluntarism and "contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Walters asserts that Americans should revitalize citizenship by getting the federal government out of the areas of public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. 
<p>	Articles by Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and others appear in the January/February issue as well.
<p>	 Policy Review began publishing in 1977 and now has a paid circulation of 30,000. It is indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the Public Affairs Information Service, and the Social Sciences Index. The full text of the magazine is available on NEXIS and on the "Internet" at <a href="/heritage/">http://www.heritage.org</a>.
<p>	A one-year <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">subscription</a> to the magazine costs $19.95; two-years costs $34.95. To subscribe, call 1-800-304-0056.

<P>
<I>&quot;The 'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an important
benchmark for evaluating Hong Kong's future success after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 1995</B> -- Hong Kong's economy has been
rated as the freest in the world by the prestigious American research
institute The Heritage Foundation. 
<P>
 The economies of just 10 other countries -- three from the Asia-Pacific
region -- also were rated as &quot;free&quot; in the Washington-based
think tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy in the
world. New Zealand tied for fourth place. And the Republic of
China on Taiwan tied for eighth. Japan, whose economy was in the
&quot;mostly free&quot; category, was 15th (tied with Austria).

<P>
 The economies of Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines also earned ratings
of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 The People's Republic of China (PRC), on the other hand, ranked
near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and the Congo for 121st
place. India's score was only slightly better, and earned India
a tie (with Armenia, Sierra Leone and Yemen) for 117th place.
 
<P>
<I><B>Government House Presentation</B></I>
<P>
 Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr. will present
a copy of the book-length report, &quot;The Index of Economic
Freedom,&quot; to The Honorable Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor,
at ceremonies at Government House today.
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph.D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; would provide &quot;an important benchmark for evaluating
Hong Kong's future success after it reverts to Chinese control
in 1997.&quot;
<P>
 Hong Kong was characterized in the report as &quot;one of the
most accessible markets in the world,&quot; with &quot;very few&quot;
barriers to imports and &quot;virtually no barriers to foreign
investors.&quot; In addition, the authors wrote, &quot;The government
does not interfere in the marketplace; taxes are low and predictable;
government spending increases are closely linked to economic growth&quot;;
and regulations are &quot;applied uniformly and consistently.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
in the think tank's annual survey of economic freedom, while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told,
the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or
&quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of
&quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; In all, 142
countries were rated in the new 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; up from
101 in the previous edition.
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States stood in seventh place in the new 1996 edition
of the &quot;Index.&quot; Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among
former communist countries, the Czech Republic did the best by
far, and was ranked 12th in the world.
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of
Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>

<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment

those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,

'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>

<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

<I>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic
freedom produces economic prosperity. No
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>

<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- Just 10 other countries around
the world provide businesses and individuals with a degree of
economic freedom similar to America's, The Heritage Foundation
reported today in its annual survey of global economic freedom.
The economies of 142 countries were rated, up from 101 countries
a year ago.
<P>
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the
Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings on
Heritage's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while
Cuba, Iraq, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All
told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; Each country
was rated on 10 economic factors: banking, foreign investment,
monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies, the size of
its government sector, property rights, regulatory restrictions,
and black- market activity. Countries were given ratings of one
to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Japan ranked 15th, tied with Austria. The
Czech Republic, in 12th place, remained far ahead of any other
former communist country. Estonia, which came the closest to the
Czech Republic, ranked 26th. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide Congress with guidance on
foreign-aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international investment
community. Washington Post economics columnist James T. Glassman
 (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful clues for
investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide which
countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I> </I>magazine
(June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some surprising
insights on why some markets may be chained to the ground while
others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of Commerce Publisher
Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson to be drawn from
this survey is clear. The more economic freedom people are allowed,
the less interference there is from government, the faster the
nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors --
including political stability, market size, external debt, infrastructure,
currency convertibility, and domestic savings -- to those countries
whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot; had improved most
during the past year. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;

trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically

freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare

poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when Congress debated foreign-aid reform. The House and Senate
both included language in the &quot;foreign operations&quot; appropriations
bill requiring the Agency for International Development (AID)
to report to Congress annually on the relative economic freedom
and prosperity of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid.  
<P>

<P>
<I>&quot;Economic assistance  is wasted when it is given to
countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary for countries with free economies.&quot;-- </i>Co-authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy
<P>
<P>
Johnson and Sheehy, co-authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic assistance is wasted when
it is given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of economic aid alike, such
'assistance' is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided an estimated $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. The recipients of the largest
amounts of aid, in addition to Israel and Egypt -- which, for
geopolitical reasons, receive a combined $5 billion per year --
are almost all countries with unfree economies.
<P>
 &quot;Most economic development aid is wasted; it is money down
the drain. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; Holmes said.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Cuba and Ukraine
are not poor because the people in the West don't share their
riches. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive
economic policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation
of wealth. 
<P>
 &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom
of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free
market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president said, &quot;will
true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything
short of this is not only economically unwise, but is cynically
cruel.&quot;

<P><P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of 13 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today.
<P>
 Just 11 countries in the world received ratings of &quot;free,&quot;
none in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean.
<P>
 The Bahamas, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago
received the best ratings in the region on the influential think
tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; Haiti and
Cuba received the worst ratings, the only two economies in the
region characterized as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told, the
economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Among the former communist countries, the
Czech Republic received the best score and was ranked 12th overall
(tied with the Bahamas and Canada). 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Regional Data</B></I>
<P>
 The Bahamas' economy earned a score of 2.0, putting it just over
the line separating the countries with totally free (a score of
1.0 to 1.99) and &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99).
Panama earned a score of 2.4. Chile and El Salvador scored 2.45.
And Trinidad and Tobago scored 2.5. 
<P>
 Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean whose economies
were rated as &quot;mostly free&quot; were Argentina (2.65), Paraguay
(2.65), Belize (2.7), Jamaica (2.7), Bolivia (2.75), Costa Rica
(2.8), Uruguay (2.8), and Guatemala (2.85). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were Barbados (3.0), Colombia (3.0), Peru (3.0),
Ecuador (3.15), Honduras (3.15), Mexico (3.35), Guyana (3.4),
Brazil (3.45), Dominican Republic (3.45), Venezuela (3.5), and
Nicaragua (3.6). Haiti (4.2) and Cuba (5.0) were the only two
countries in the region whose economies were characterized as
&quot;repressed.&quot;

<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually

U.S. foreign aid.

 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic assistance

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of just five
countries in sub-Saharan Africa received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today. Of the 11 countries in the
world with ratings of &quot;free,&quot; none was in sub-Saharan
Africa.
<P>
 Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin and Zambia received the best
ratings in the region on the influential think tank's annual &quot;Index
of Economic Freedom.&quot; Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire, Angola and
Somalia received the worst ratings, with their economies characterized
as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of its economic-liberalization policies, Botswana
was identified as one of a handful of countries around the world
that stood out as a possible future investment prospect.
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. 
<P>
 All told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, five countries received &quot;mostly free&quot;
ratings, 23 received ratings of &quot;mostly unfree,&quot; and
five received ratings of &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom, which tied
for eighth place. 
<P>
 Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received
the best score and was ranked 12th overall, tied with the Bahamas
and Canada. Like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
also received ratings of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa 
<P>
 The economy of Botswana earned a score of 2.8, the best in the
region and 47th overall (tied with Costa Rica). Other African
countries with &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99)
included Uganda (2.83), Swaziland (2.9), Benin (2.95) and Zambia
(2.95). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were South Africa (3.0), Kenya (3.05), Gabon (3.06),
Mali (3.1), Ghana (3.2), Ivory Coast (3.25), Nigeria (3.25), Guinea
(3.35), Madagascar (3.35), Malawai (3.4), Senegal (3.4), Cape
Verde (3.44), Tanzania (3.45), Cameroon (3.6), Ethiopia (3.6),
Lesotho (3.65), Burkina Faso (3.7), Niger (3.7), Zimbabwe (3.7),
Sierra Leone (3.75), Congo (3.8), Mauritania (3.8) and Suriname
(3.9).  
<P>
 Points to Hong Kong 
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a Nov. 27 speech in Hong Kong, Holmes pointed out that 30
years ago Hong Kong and Gabon were equally poor countries, with
per-capita incomes of $2,279 per year and $2,770 respectively.
Hong Kong then pursued a bold economic liberalization program,
while Gabon's government pursued the opposite course. Today, the
average per capita income in Hong Kong is $10,223. The average
in Gabon: just $3,502.
<P>
 &quot;Hong Kong's economic miracle should provide a lesson to
the less-developed world,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;You don't need
gold and silver deposits, or oil wells, or rich, arable land,
or American foreign aid to create wealth and prosperity. All you
need is a climate of economic freedom.&quot;
<P>
 Resource for Investors 
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;
as an investment tool, the authors applied nine additional investment
factors to those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored the best. While some of the 24 countries are
rated as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 Foreign-Aid Reform 
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
 <i>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic 
freedom produces economic prosperity. No 
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</i> 
-- Kim Holmes, Vice President, The Heritage Foundation 
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted when it is
given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign aid alike, economic
aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic development
assistance is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and
it certainly doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a
highly regarded foreign-policy specialist.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti and Cuba  are not
poor because the people in the West don't share their riches.
They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic
policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation of wealth,&quot;
Holmes said. &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic
freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of
the free market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president
said, &quot;will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the
world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise,
but is cynically cruel.&quot;
<P>
 Highlights 
<P>
 The authors of the Heritage Foundation  report made a number
of important observations. They found, for example:
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide, however; its
overall average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that
Panama's improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized
its money supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve
system and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency.
As a result, the Panamanian government can no longer print money
for political purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in the Latin America/Caribbean region and one of the
three most repressed in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.

<title>Clinton's Family Tax Cut Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children -- Heritage</title></head>

<h2>CLINTON'S FAMILY TAX CUT DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>


<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 11, 1995 --</b> President Clinton's budget plan,
released last week, would give much less tax relief to low-income
working families than the congressional plan he recently vetoed,
according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation. This finding
directly contradicts the president's claim that his budget would
be better for these families.         
<P>
Overall, Clinton's tax credit denies any tax relief to 10.4 million
working families that would receive relief under the plan he vetoed,
according to Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal
budgetary affairs. In other families, some children wouldn't qualify
for tax relief under Clinton's plan, but would qualify under Congress'
plan. 
<P>
Taken together, the Clinton plan would deny $15 billion in tax
relief to 23 million children who would qualify for it under Congress'
$500-per-child tax-credit plan.
<P>
Particularly hard hit are lower-income working families. In order
to claim the  Clinton tax cut, low-income families must first
reduce their tax bills by the amount of their Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) subsidy. Thus, 5.4 million families earning less
than $30,000 would be denied tax relief under Clinton's plan;
they would get $2.3 billion in tax relief under the plan he vetoed.
A typical single parent with one child, earning below $30,000,
would receive almost $200 less in tax relief each year under the
Clinton plan.
<P>
In addition, Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit does not apply
to children more than 12 years of age. Since roughly 25 percent
of all children are more than age 12, millions of families will
be denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising a child becomes
most expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to families
of at least 2.8 million children earning less than $30,000 per
year. In fact, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton
plan is $442, the average tax cut under Congress' plan is $856
per family.
<P>
&quot;This is bait-and-switch tax policy,&quot; says Hodge. &quot;Clinton
says he is helping lower-wage families with children more than
Congress is, but that is absolutely untrue. The fine print in
his plan denies tax relief to millions of families who are being
told by the White House that they qualify.&quot;

<h2>CAPITAL
GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BENEFIT LOWER, MIDDLE CLASS MOST, HERITAGE
STUDY FINDS</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 6, 1995 --</b> Contrary to what opponents
say, the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax rate -- as
proposed in Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995 --would go mostly
to lower- and middle-income taxpayers, a Heritage Foundation analyst
said today. 
<P>&quot;The typical household declaring a capital gain
had income from sources other than capital gains of $58,729 and
realized a gain of about $973,&quot; according to William Beach,
a visiting fellow in tax analysis at Heritage. &quot;This is hardly
what anyone would consider 'rich,'&quot; he says. In fact, Beach
says, more than 50 percent of the benefits from cutting the capital
gains tax would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income
taxpayers. 
<P>Beach's findings are based on an analysis of 1991 tax
returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal
Revenue Service. 
<P>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would permit
individual taxpayers to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains
from taxation. That exclusion effectively cuts the tax rate on
capital gains in half. 
<P>For corporations, the act decreases the
capital gains rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent.
  Furthermore, Beach says when critics claim that capital gains
go mainly to the wealthy, they often mislead the public by including
the gain as part of a person's income. For example, a retiree
living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000
capital gain one year from selling his house is classified &quot;as
a person with a $42,000 income who received a capital gain.&quot;
&quot;This sleight of hand allows opponents to 'fudge' the number
of rich in their favor,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>According to Beach,
a balanced budget and a lower capital gains tax rate will stimulate
economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code and increase
federal revenue by encouraging individuals to take gains they
might not otherwise take because of a high tax rate. He points
to the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model -- one  of the
nation's most independent and respected models of the U.S. economy
-- which found that balancing the budget with tax cuts would produce
immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing
in long-term economic activity. 
<P>Other leading private economic
firms (Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, DRI/McGraw-Hill
and others) predicted that balancing the budget and cutting taxes
would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more
spendable household income. &quot;This, more than any other factor,
helps poor and middle-class Americans,&quot; Beach points out.
<P>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model
developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer and Associates to
analyze the impact of a balanced budget plan. The model found
that over a seven-year period (1996-2002), most of the economic
benefits of the plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
The model predicted a loss of more than $80.2 billion in potential
gross domestic product, higher unemployment rates and slower household
income growth if the capital gains tax rate remains the same.
<P> Finally, Beach says that experience over the past 25 years shows
that rate decreases lead to more declarations of capital gains
and therefore more revenue from capital gains taxes. &quot;Owners
of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on
to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the
rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up,&quot; he
says. &quot;In other words, you can lower the rate and increase
revenue,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>Economists estimate that Americans
are holding trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains.
&quot;Lowering the capital gains rate could produce substantial
economic benefits and create  revenue windfalls for federal and
state governments as well as average Americans,&quot; Beach says.

<h2>SINGAPORE ONE OF JUST 11 COUNTRIES WITH FREE ECONOMIES, SAYS 1996 &quot;INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM&quot;</h2>
<i>Ranks Second Overall, Ahead of U.S., Britain, Japan</i>

<P>




 <B>SINGAPORE, DEC. 4, 1995</B> -- Singapore has the second-freest
economy in the world, the prestigious American research institute,
The Heritage Foundation, reported today in its annual survey of
global economic freedom.
<P>
 Singapore &quot;has made remarkable [economic] progress by maintaining
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business
regulatory system; political stability; an efficient, strike-free
labor force and tax incentives for foreign investors,&quot; the
report said. Singapore's &quot;average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent,&quot;
it maintains &quot;no import quotas and non-tariff barriers to
foreign trade&quot; and investment laws &quot;are clear and fair
and pose few problems for businesses.&quot; 
<P>
 Just 10 other countries around the world provide businesses and
individuals with a degree of economic freedom similar to Singapore's,
the Washington-based think tank said in its 1996 &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 The report was released Nov. 27 in Hong Kong. It was presented
to leaders of Singapore's business community at a luncheon today
at Traders Hotel. 
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. The economies
of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind Switzerland, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. 
<P>
 Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among former communist countries,
the Czech Republic scored the best: in 12th place (tied with the
Bahamas and Canada).
<P>
 In addition to Japan, other Asian and Pacific Basin countries
whose economies received ratings of &quot;mostly free&quot; were
 Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia and the Philippines.
<P>
 In all, 142 countries were rated in the new 1996 edition, compared
to 101 countries in the previous edition. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And New York Journal
of Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries are rated
as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds of
destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the &quot;free&quot;
to &quot;mostly free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased
banking regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul><P>
 Heritage Foundation Vice President Kim Holmes said that &quot;The
'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an especially important benchmark
for evaluating the future success of Hong Kong after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997. Any backsliding will obviously be
noted.&quot;
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With better banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; six were in Africa.</ul><p>

<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</B>, December 1, 1995-- More than 400 state
legislators from across the country, many of them newly elected,
will attend an orientation conference in Washington, D.C., December
5-9 at the Washington Renaissance Hotel that will be key in the
continuing liberation of America from six decades of intrusive
public policy.
<P>
&quot;This is the perfect opportunity for us to impart to these
new legislators the importance of limited-government, free-market
principles that are our nation's Founders' legacy and the standards
of a just and prosperous nation,&quot; said Colorado State Senator
Ray Powers, the National Chairman of the American Legislative
Exchange Council (ALEC), which sponsors the National Orientation
Conference (NOC) every year. &quot;By educating the new legislators
in the Jeffersonian principles, we are pushing the conservative
movement beyond last year's revolution. What we accomplish at
this conference will shape public policy in the states and nationally
for years to come.&quot;
<P>
<B>Confirmed speakers</B> at this year's NOC include: US. SENATOR
SPENCER ABRAHAM (R Mich.); US. SENATOR JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D-Conn.);
retired SENATOR MALCOLM WALLOP, former ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN
MEESE, MINNESOTA GOVERNOR ARNE CARLSON; CONGRESSMEN ERNEST ISTOOK
(R-Okla.) and JOEL HEFLEY (R Colo..); ED CRANE, President and
CEO of the Cato Institute; JOSEPH BAST, President of the Heartland
Institute; PAUL WEYRICH, President Of the Free Congress Foundation.
<P>
Speakers who are invited but have not yet accepted include U.S.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SENATORS BOB DOLE
(R Kan.), JOHN McCAIN (R Ariz.) and TRENT LOTT (R Miss.), CONGRESSMEN
JOHN KASICH (R-Ohio), THOMAS BLILEY (R-Va),   PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR
TOM RIDGE, MICHIGAN GOVERNOR JOHN ENGLER, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR WILLIAM WELD, VIRGINIA
GOVERNOR GEORGE ALLEN, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR BEN NELSON and UTAH GOVERNOR
MIKE LEAVITT.
<P>
Also scheduled for the NOC is the presentation of the <B>1995
Warren Brookes Award for Excellence in Journalism</B> to Don Lanbro,
chief political correspondent for the Washington Times. Lambro
will be honored at a luncheon Friday, December 8 beginning at
12:15 p.m.
<P>
Last year's NOC was the largest one in ALEC's history. Attended
by 412 legislators, it was more than twice the size of any previous
NOC. About 250 private sector members attended, as well. Similar
attendance is expected at this year's meeting.
<P><a name="cred"></a>
<B>Credentialing Procedure</B>:
<P>
Anyone considering covering any parts of the meeting should pre-register

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1995</b> -- The U.S. delegation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting this weekend in Japan should work to revive the group's commitment to free trade in the region, which is being seriously undermined by the protectionist policies of Japan and China, according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	Leaders from Asia and the Americas will meet under the auspices of APEC, an organization of Asia and Pacific Rim countries that have pledged to create free trade in the Asia and Pacific Rim by 2020.  President Clinton is expected to attend the meeting if  the budget battle with Congress does not keep him in Washington.<P>
	According to Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Robert O'Quinn, author of the study, 	 Japan's proposal to allow APEC nations to exempt "sensitive economic sectors" like agriculture from free trade is an ominous sign for the future of APEC. "The proposal has become a flash point, dividing APEC into two warring camps. On one side are Japan and China, who want exemptions; on the other side are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, who oppose exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization," O'Quinn says.<P>   
	At the meeting, the U.S. delegation should:<P>

<ul><li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that selective exemptions to trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national interests. "Once one member is permitted to exempt a sensitive sector of their economy, other members will follow suit with their own protectionist demands," O'Quinn warns.
	<P><LI> Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand to block Japan's protectionist proposal. O'Quinn says the United States has some leverage here because most other APEC members disagree with Japan's protectionist approach. "The key will be to forge a consensus," says O'Quinn.   
	<P><li>Stress that blocking or delaying comprehensive trade liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. "Backsliding on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization," O'Quinn warns.</ul>
	<P>The importance of APEC to the U.S. economy is illustrated in a related paper by Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Dori. For example, Dori says, "in 1994, U.S. exports to East Asia and the Pacific Rim totaled more than $150 billion. More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans." He says that in 1994, more than three million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.<P>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 13, 1995</b> -- Families would gain $32 billion in real disposable income over seven years, wages would increase faster and first-time home buyers would spend less on new mortgages if the congressional plan to cut taxes and balance the federal budget is approved, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/beach.html">Heritage Foundation computer model study</a>.
	<P>"Over the next seven years, Congress's budget plan would lead to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth," Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says in the study, which is based on one of the same econometric models of the U.S. economy used by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Board and other government bodies. Beach testified about the study today before a House Republican Policy Committee hearing on how the congressional budget reconciliation bill will affect the economy.
	<P>"Critics of balancing the budget by 2002 and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession," Beach says. "But this study shows that not only does no recession result at any time during the seven-year period, but the economy grows faster with these proposed budget changes than it would without them."
	<P> Beach says when lower federal taxes and a balanced federal budget are fed through the econometric model, developed by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, the result is higher household spending, lower interest rates, increased productivity, greater capital investment, and less inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<P>
	Housing starts and investment in new business machinery would increase by 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, the study says. The computer segment of business durable equipment purchases would increase 2.9 percent, compared to current policy.
	<P>The study projects a slightly higher unemployment rate under the balanced-budget plan, due chiefly to a loss of public-sector jobs and lowered government demand for goods and services. The study notes, however, that its assumptions do not include action by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and thus create additional private-sector employment growth to absorb former public-sector workers.
<P>	Beach says the study's results may surprise both supporters and opponents of the congressional reconciliation package. "Supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately, but the study indicates that the primary effect of balancing the budget is a steady, long-term improvement in the economy, not a short-term boost. Congress also would need to enact major reforms of the tax code to spur the very large level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict."
	<P>Opponents of the reconciliation bill "should take comfort in the likelihood that the plan will not undermine economic growth, and will lower interest rates and inflation," Beach says.<P>

<h2>U.S.-Led Missile Defense System Urged for Asia</h2>
<h4>U.S. Critical To Shielding
Asian Allies From China</h4></center><P>


<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>


	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 24, 1995</b> --  America can best protect itself and its Asian allies against growing nuclear threats from China and North Korea by deploying as soon as possible both a national missile defense system for the continental United States, and theater missile defenses to protect U.S. naval and ground forces throughout the Pacific region, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	Congress is currently considering alternative deployment schedules for missile defense systems as part of the 1996 military spending measure. A national missile defense system would intercept enemy missiles aimed at targets within the continental United States, while a theater missile defense system would knock down enemy missiles targeted against American militiary forces operating overseas or against U.S. allies.
<P>	Japan, South Korea and Australia should also be encouraged to buy and field their own American-made theater missile defense systems, while U.S. officials also should pressure China to limit its offensive nuclear missiles in exchange for sharing U.S. missile defense data, says the study's author, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>.
<p>	"A national missile defense system is needed not only to defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail," says Fisher. "The administration can enhance security in Asia by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile attack and extends that umbrella to protect America's allies and friends throughout the region."
<p>	Failure to take these actions risks allowing The People's Republic of China or North Korea to use their own growing offensive missile capabilities to checkmate U.S. military strength in the Pacific region, and to intimidate U.S. allies throughout Asia, as occurred earlier this year when China "in a blatant act of intimidation" tested several of its weapons barely 100 miles from The Republic of China on Taiwan, Fisher says.
<p>	"Armed with nuclear warheads, these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases or naval formations in Asia," Fisher points out. "China is believed to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. By the year 2010, according to one estimate, China could have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States from bases in China," notes Fisher.	China also is developing two new mobile missiles capable of hitting the western United States, and may have hired Russian technicians to aid in producing cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk. China has even bought 60 Russian-made missile interceptors similar to the U.S. Patriot.
<p>	At the same time, North Korea is proceeding with work on its Taepo Dong missiles, which, Fisher says, "would give Pyongyang the capability to target U.S. forces in Guam, and possibly the western half of the continental United States, plus Europe, East Asia and Australia."
<p>	Fisher believes a national missile defense system would protect America's heartland against these emerging Chinese and North Korean  threats,  while theater defenses would provide a shield for U.S. forces stationed throughout the Pacific region and the U.S. allies they are defending. Without a credible U.S. response, America's Asian allies will be forced to seek their own deterrents to such intimidation.
<p>	Both houses of Congress have approved 1996 defense authorization bills that devote more than $3.5 billion to both national and theater missile defense systems, including the "Brilliant Eyes" space-based sensor system used to identify and track enemy missiles. That amount is about $1 billion more than requested by the Clinton administration.
<p>	The bills now in House-Senate conference would accelerate deployment of the two major theater systems -- the Navy's "Upper Tier" system and the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system -- to 1997. By contrast, the Clinton administration has set no official date to begin THAAD deployment, and sought only minimal Upper Tier funding.
<p>	Fisher says U.S. officials should urge U.S. allies in Asia to purchase American theater missile defense systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. "By cooperating with Washington to develop and fund missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries from nuclear missile threats," Fisher says.
<p>	Finally, Fisher recommends that the United States inform China that it must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and should join the Missile Technology Control Regime backed by the United States that limits the export of offensive missile technology. "Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsensal, the United States will make available to China early warning data from U.S.theater missile defense systems," Fisher says.
<p>	These actions must be taken by the United States because it is the only nation with "the technical capability and the moral vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation," Fisher says.

	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 23, 1995</b>  -- To reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations while maintaining employment protections and workplace safety, Congress should abolish the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and shift its legitimate functions to the states, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1058.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> released today.
<p>	"The proliferation of DOL regulations, while failing to make things significantly better for American workers, present a serious barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs," says <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy. "Closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department and shifting virtually all of its functions to the states could save as much as $10.5 billion during the next five years," he says.
<p>	In his comprehensive plan for abolishing the Labor Department, Wilson points out that about 75 percent of the department's current $38.8 billion budget is made up of funding for unemployment insurance and for employment services to the states, with job training constituting another 20 percent. "By turning over responsibility for these programs to the states, Congress could take 95 percent of what the DOL does away from far-away Washington bureaucrats and place responsibility for these tasks in the hands of state governments, which are closer to the real problems," Wilson says. This would enable states "to limit the duration of unemployment benefits, reduce payroll taxes, increase jobs, and try new ways to privatize many of DOL's functions," says Wilson.
<p>	Among the job-training programs for the economically disadvantaged that Wilson says should be consolidated into a single block grant to the states are the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, and Indian and Native American Employment and Training. Wilson says states should be required to focus resources for these programs on job placement and to objectively measure the effectiveness of each.
<p>	All other present DOL-funded job-training programs, he says, could be folded into another block grant, which would include programs for dislocated workers, the School-to-Work and Adult Technology Learning programs, Wilson says. "Even DOL itself has acknowledged that making block grants of these programs would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars," he says.
<p>	Wilson says Congress, as part of the process of dismantling DOL, should repeal outdated labor laws, executive orders and regulations, reform the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It should repeal the executive order for affirmative action and related regulations governing federal contractors and subcontractors, he says.
<p>	Under Wilson's plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau would be shifted to a newly-created sub-Cabinet agency called the Bureau of National Statistics, as proposed earlier this year by The Heritage Foundation in a proposal for reorganizing the federal government and balancing the federal budget.
<p>	At the same time, DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration should be combined, Wilson says, and the newly formed agency made subject to an independent workplace standards-setting board. The new board would "redefine the role of the federal government in workplace safety from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner with the private sector," Wilson says. 
<p>	"Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed dramatically since the days when most of America's labor laws were written and the Labor Department that enforces them was created," says Wilson. "Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions and compensation packages than current law and regulations allow. This means a fundamental rethinking of DOL and federal labor policy is needed."
<p>	"Congress should move aggressively to abolish DOL and reform federal labor law to insure that excessive regulatory burdens are removed, labor market flexibility is increased for workers and businesses alike, and basic workplace safety protections are made more effective," Wilson says.<p><p>

<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION
 SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, OCT. 17, 1995</b> -- The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) should be abolished because it routinely engages in political advocacy and frequently lobbies at taxpayer expense for expanded welfare spending, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html">study</a>  released today.
<p>	Among the causes LSC supports with taxpayer funds are adoption rights for homosexuals, preventing drug dealers' evictions from public housing, racial quotas in higher education and protecting welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, according to the study's authors, Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty, who are, respectively, chairman and president of the Vienna, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center.
<p>	Reforming LSC is not feasible, say Boehm and Flaherty, because it is virtually unaccountable to taxpayers who fund it and beyond effective oversight by either Congress or the president.
<p>	"For the past 30 years, LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through its litigation, advocacy and lobbying, LSC has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending, and helped add millions of people to the welfare rolls," say Boehm and Flaherty. "LSC cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. It should be abolished," they say of the federal corporation that is supposed to help poor people who can't afford to hire an attorney.
	<p>LSC-supported groups have successfully sought countless federal and state court decisions to nullify "moral" conditions connected to welfare benefits such as identifying fathers of illegitimate children, the authors say. Too often, such cases are pursued by LSC-funded groups at the expense of genuine problems facing poor people such as bankruptcy, child-support, custody and guardianship proceedings, landlord controversies, and employment issues, Boehm and Flaherty say.
<p>	At the root of the problem is LSC's legal structure and the unaccountability that structure fosters. Chartered by Congress in 1974 as a independent, private, non-profit corporation,  LSC receives about $400 million in federal funds annually. The way the corporation distributes its money "makes it immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending," say Boehm and Flaherty. 
<p>	The LSC distributes the money it gets from Congress in the form of grants to 323 private lawyers' groups across the country. At the same time, these groups also receive funds (about $225 million annually) from state and local governments, lawyers groups, and other private sources.
<p>	Even though Congress gives LSC millions of federal dollars every year, LSC employees are not considered federal employees under the corporation's federal charter. As a result, LSC's "status as a private corporation exempts it from provisions of the federal criminal code, including the Anti-Deficiency Act that makes it a felony for government workers to misappropriate public money," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Further removing LSC from even minimal scrutiny is the fact that nobody outside of the corporation knows how it spends public funds, since its attorneys keep no time sheets, and it is impossible to judge how well LSC attorneys represent clients because all case records are kept secret under a claim of attorney-client privilege.
<p>	"Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of LSC lawyers, and there are no provisions for waiving the attorney-client privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Taken together, these factors mean "it makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress or on the LSC's governing board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a political agenda that serves the interests of the welfare state and its allies against those of productive taxpayers," contend Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	"Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds given LSC. For the sake of the American taxpayer and for the sake of America's poor, it is time to abolish LSC," Boehm and Flaherty say.

$123 BILLION MORE PER YEAR, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 16, 1995</b> -- If Medicare is not reformed,  industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors, consumers and taxpayers and $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages to workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis released today.
<p>	The authors of the study, senior fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a> and domestic policy research analysts Christine Olson and Rea Hederman, have included an industry-by-industry analysis showing how much businesses, employees and consumers will have to pay each year as a result of an additional 3.52 percent Medicare payroll tax the program's trustees say will be necessary to finance the current system without reform. 
<P>	Topping the industry list are retail trade, educational services and public administration, which together will shoulder nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the yearly cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers and investors. "Businesses and employees in the retail trade industry alone will pay more than $13.3 billion in extra payroll taxes each year -- with employees picking up more than $12.5 billion of that tab -- if Medicare is not reformed," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	"The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience shows that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation," according to the study. 
<p>	"Without significant reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt," the analysts say. "For Medicare to remain financially solvent and able to pay for hospital care for today's 'baby boomers' when they retire, Congress needs to either find additional money or slow down its rate of spending."

<title>Flat Tax Earns High Marks -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FLAT TAX EARNS HIGH MARKS 
IN STUDY OF TAX REFORM PLANS</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b><br>
<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 26, 1995</b> -- Of all the tax-reform proposals ready to be considered by Congress, the flat tax proposal sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Selby, R-Ala., received the highest marks in a Heritage Foundation study released today. <p>
	The study, conducted by Heritage economist <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>, McKenna senior fellow in political economy, is aimed at assisting lawmakers, who must decide which of the major tax-reform proposals is best for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. 
<p>	"Tax reform is gaining momentum. The existing income-tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul," Mitchell says. "Of all the plans currently being considered in Congress, the Armey flat tax addresses the most serious problems in the simplest, most straight-forward way."
<p>	The Armey plan would ensure fairness by taxing individuals and businesses with a 17 percent flat rate on all income. The plan, which is based on the model developed by Stanford Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka, would ensure simplicity by allowing taxes to be filed using a postcard-sized return. By contrast, the current income-tax system has more than 400 different forms.
<p>	Mitchell says the flat tax's low rate would encourage economic growth by increasing the value of income-producing assets, such as rental property and investments of all kinds. On the other hand, he says, the flat tax would reduce the incentive to invest in tax shelters, a practice that keeps huge amounts of capital from circulating and producing wealth in the U.S. economy. "With these extra billions in circulation, all Americans will benefit," Mitchell says. 
<p>	The flat tax also would end the practice of using the tax system for social engineering. Mitchell says by removing the progressive component from America's tax structure, the flat tax would stop penalizing economic success. It would encourage savings and investment by taxing income only once, and would significantly reduce the number of preferences and deductions now available under the existing income tax code.
<p>	Another version of the flat tax, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also received high marks from Mitchell. But the Specter proposal seeks a slightly higher rate (20 percent) and would allow for some limited deductions for charitable contributions, including the full deduction for home mortgages. Mitchell says the Specter flat-tax plan is less attractive because it would still allow for government micromanagement of the economy.
<p>	But either way, Mitchell says the time is ripe for reform of the current tax system. "Its complexity forces even the most sophisticated Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms; one study put annual compliance costs at nearly $200 billion." The current system subjects some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, to as many as four different levels of taxation. "For example, under the current tax system, a single dollar of income can be subject to the corporate income tax, the personal income tax, the capital gains tax, and estate taxes," he says. 
<P>	"Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties and deductions," Mitchell says. Such complexity is inevitable in a system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy. Mitchell says the system will never change as long as politicians are able to collect large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code. 
<p>	"While other reform proposals, such as the value added (VAT) tax and the national sales tax, have some advantages, they contained features that more closely resembled the current system, offering little or no improvement over the status quo," he says.

<h2>FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM SUCCESS IS LESSON
 FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center><hr>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1995</b> -- Medicare reformers in Congress should heed important lessons on consumer choice and health insurance cost controls demonstrated by the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"The FEHBP has shown a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four-tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent," says Heritage Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a> in a study released today. FEHBP contrasts sharply with the current  Medicare system's 10.5 percent per year average increase. Annual private-sector price increases have averaged 6 percent per year during a comparable period, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers FEHBP.<p>
	House Republicans recently proposed a package of Medicare reforms that "take some modest steps" in directions suggested by Heritage health care experts. But the FEHBP experience ought to provide further policy direction for congressional reformers, Moffit says.
<p>	The vivid contrast between Medicare's spiralling costs and FEHBP's successful cost controls is due to the fact that FEHBP -- which covers nine million members of Congress and their staffs, federal employees, retirees and their families -- holds down premium costs by depending primarily upon consumer choice and competition among about 400 coverage providers, says Moffit.
<p>	Significantly, FEHBP's ability to hold costs down is achieved despite covering what is far from an ideal insurance pool, he says. "Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. The federal workforce is older than the private-sector workforce: the average federal worker is almost 44 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is about 38 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily during the past several years, so that nearly 40 percent of all FEHBP subscribers are retirees," according to Moffit.
   <p>	 By comparison to Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, "FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs," Moffit says.
<p>	Government workers and retirees would have fared even better in FEHBP in recent years if Congress had changed the program to a defined contribution that is indexed to inflation, rather than retaining the current complex formula, Moffit says. The formula is based on the average premiums for the six largest FEHBP insurance providers, with a statutory ceiling of the government's share of premium costs set at 75 percent.
<p>	Converting FEHBP to a defined contribution consisting of "a clearly defined annual dollar amount" with future increases tied to the Consumer Price Index "would give private insurers a powerful incentive for offering attractive packages of benefits at a price equal to or even less than the amount of the government's contribution. This would reduce the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increase their savings even more," says Moffit.
<p> 	In a related study released today, Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> says Congress is now considering Medicare reforms that would set up a system somewhat like FEHBP.  But further reforms are needed to complete the task of creating "a Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs, while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care."
<p>	The most important provision of the House Medicare reform plan, for example, is the Medicare Plus option, which allows seniors to choose a private-sector health plan paid with a government contribution based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors, Butler says.
<p>	But other features of the House plan "raise concerns," according to Butler, including a provision "to use the failed approach of price controls" to limit government Medicare spending. The House plan also makes the "serious mistake" of making Medicare Plus plans cap their deductibles and co-payments at the same level required by the traditional Medicare plan.
<p>	Butler also faults the House plan for requiring Medicare Plus plans to match the benefits offered by the traditional Medicare program. Congress should instead follow FEHBP's statuatory language requiring insurers to provide a basic core of benefits, but otherwise leave them free to group benefits, medical procedures, treatments, and costs in packages as they see fit.
<p>	"These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement," says Butler.

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 22, 1995</b> To end the nation's vulnerability to ballistic-missile attack as quickly as possible, congressional conferees should reject the House version of the defense authorization bill and endorse the Senate bill's "clear, concise and detailed instructions" for deployment of a national missile-defense system in the year 2003, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"Without a specific deployment date and a detailed plan, nothing will be deployed because the Clinton administration -- since it is against erecting missile defenses in the first place -- will use the lack of a timetable to put off deployment indefinitely," according to Heritage Senior Defense Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a>. Because of this factor, Spring says "Congress cannot afford to give the administration much leeway, and the Senate bill doesn't give it."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill includes detailed instructions that are much needed but lacking in the House bill. For example, he says in addition to instructions for National Missile Defenses (NMD), the Senate measure fixes the same starting date for deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD), to protect U.S. allies and forces stationed overseas, and defines the core programs the Pentagon will need to erect both systems.   
<p>	For the NMD system, Spring says, the Senate bill includes instructions for "deploying interceptors at more than one site, establishing both interim and initial deployment dates, and setting forth specific options for upgrading existing radars and streamlining acquisition procedures." For TMD systems, the Senate bill designates as core programs "an upgraded Patriot Missile, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier defense systems and the Army's Theater High-Altitude-Area Defense system." The House version, by contrast, contains no instructions for TMD deployment or requirements.
<p>	"Further, the Senate bill would insure that TMD systems are capable of working together so several systems could be used against the same missile attack," Spring points out. Also, the Senate measure lets TMD systems use data from external sensors, including those based in space, to identify and track targets, and "requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress next year on the options available for augmenting ground-, sea- and space-based defenses." This last requirement, Spring says, "will force the Pentagon to examine the advantages of sea- and space-based over more expensive ground-based defenses."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill takes the proper approach toward the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. "By requiring a comprehensive review of the pact to determine its continuing value and validity," the Senate bill creates an opening for eventually doing away with the ABM treaty, since it was signed with the former Soviet Union, and is often used to make a case against missile defenses.
<p>	On all of these issues, Spring says congressional conferees should "move as quickly as possible; otherwise the nation will remain needlessly vulnerable to ballistic-missile attack."

<P>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 20, 1995</B> -- The combined general and payroll tax hike that will be needed to save Medicare -- if Congress doesn't restructure the system -- will increase the tax burden by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years, according to analysts at The Heritage Foundation. The other alternative would be a steep cutback in services.
<P>	The options before Congress are limited, say Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu and David Winston in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">report</a> released today. Congress must either restructure and reform the program along the lines of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which allows consumer choice and market competition to keep health-care prices down, dramatically increase payroll and general taxes on American families and businesses, or drastically cut back on services for the elderly.
<P>	"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already projects that during the next five years Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in general taxes," the Heritage analysts say. On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right now, when you look at the  combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."	
<P>	Yet, the Heritage analysts say transforming Medicare into a health-care program that would work like FEHBP, the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers, "would allow Medicare users to pick government-certified private insurance plans and receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. What Heritage proposes is a far more attractive alternative than strangling American workers and businesses with enormous new taxes," the analysts say.
<P>  	They also warn of the possible effects of such taxation. "Any new payroll tax assessed to shore up Medicare ultimately will be felt by America's working families in the form of reduced wages or compensation and in some cases, even the loss of jobs."
<P>	The Heritage analysts point out that while Congress is focusing mainly on fixing Medicare Part A, it must also deal with Part B in order to come up with a permanent solution for Medicare's financial plight. Again, without a major restructuring of the entire Medicare system, CBO projections indicate that the taxes needed to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.
<P>	The Heritage analysts used 1993 earnings data to compute the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/wel-62mp.html">state-by-state impact</a> of a 3.5 percent payroll tax increase -- the estimated figure needed to achieve long-term actuarial balance for the Medicare system -- on workers throughout the country. They found that if such a payroll tax increase had been in effect in 1993, employees and employers would have faced more than $123 billion in new taxes that year. Under this scenario, wage earners in Wyoming would have faced a total of $101.2 million in additional taxes, the low range, while California wage earners would have paid an additional $7.7 billion.
<P>	Even worse, employees would have suffered more than $115 billion in lost earnings. On average, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would have ranged from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. Similar significant losses were projected throughout the country.
<P>	"No one wants to drastically cut back Medicare services or impose yet another biggest-in-history tax hike on the American people," the Heritage analysts warn. "That's why it's so important that Congress take a serious look at the only viable alternative: restructuring of Medicare along the lines of  market competition and consumer choice."

<H2> FREEING FARMERS WOULD PRODUCE
$135 BILLION BOOST, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>
<h3>State-by-State Analysis
Reveals Billion-Dollar Winners</h3>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19, 1995</b> -- Freeing America's farmers by ending New Deal-era crop subsidies, price supports and land reserves would generate $135 billion in new income distributed throughout all 50 states during the next decade, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	The study  -- based on a computer model of the nation's economy developed by Heritage to measure the impact of ending the federal farm program -- comes as Congress considers reforms of a wide range of agriculture programs.
<p>	"Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use, and generate a $135 billion expansion of the nation's economy," say Heritage Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, co-authors of the Heritage study. "Every state would share in the economic expansion -- even those that are not agriculture producers -- because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products."
<p>	Increased farm production would fuel demand for seed, fertilizer and equipment such as tractors, as well as generate expansion of the food processing, packaging, transportation and shipping industries, the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	Earlier this year, Frydenlund wrote Heritage's comprehensive proposal for agriculture reform, called "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." The Heritage proposal suggests ending the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that keeps more than 36 million acres of farm land idle. This government attempt to control farm prices limits the supply of a wide variety of crops and products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, sugar, peanuts and milk.
<p>	The Heritage plan would phase out CRP over a five-year period, thus freeing U.S. farmers to return the now-idled acres to production to meet worldwide food demand that experts say will triple in coming years.
<p>	"If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict their output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account," Frydenlund and Winston say. In the first year alone, more than $2 billion net additional farm income would result, with the annual total reaching $4 billion by the year 2001, and more than $18 billion annually thereafter.
<p>	In Kansas, for example, farmers (primarily wheat producers) would enjoy a $1 billion boost in the first year, while in Iowa, a leading corn producer, the first-year increase would exceed $800 million. For Texas, a major producer of most farm products, the increase would exceed $1 billion, Frydenlund and Winston say.
<p>	Non-farm states like Rhode Island "would reap large benefits" as a result of increased demand for shipping and transportation services, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they would gain through increased agricultural production," observe Frydenlund and Winston. A state-by-state analysis is included with the study.
<p>	 In a related study to be released later this week, Frydenlund says the sugar, peanut and dairy programs are perfect examples of why reform is needed. All three programs are "beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can fix them," says Frydenlund, because each uses complex systems of quotas and allotments to limit who can produce how much for sale at what price, as well as where it can be grown and where it can be sold.
<p>	The sugar program, for example, "is big government and corporate welfare at its worst. Almost half of the estimated $1.4 billion in federal benefits created by the program go to 1 percent of the sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and a Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone," says Frydenlund.
<p>	"Incremental changes in these programs will not be reform. Instead, Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs by either eliminating or gradually phasing out the quotas and allotments that benefit so few at the expense of consumers," the Heritage analysts say.<p>

<h2><center> HOUSE SPENDING BILLS FALL FAR SHORT OF PROMISED  GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL, ANALYSTS SAY</h2> </center>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>





	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15, 1995</b> -- Instead of  carrying out the voters' mandate for a radical overhaul of the federal government, the new House spending bills "merely downsize the status quo, leaving the door open to return to bloated, wasteful spending in a few short years," according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	The study focuses on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills approved by the House since May when the chamber approved a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years. While savings achieved by those bills total about $24 billion, many more billions could be saved if the House terminated obsolete programs, as suggested by Heritage earlier this year in a detailed study showing how to reduce the number of Cabinet-level departments from the current 14 to five.
<p>	Rather than terminating obsolete programs, however, the House imposed relatively equal across-the-board spending cuts that otherwise leave the programs alive and well, according to the study by Heritage's Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> and budget analyst John Barry.
<p>	"Congress is leaving in place hundreds of obsolete federal programs that ought to be shut down, but that will instead continue to waste taxpayer dollars, just at reduced spending levels," say Hodge and Barry. "This leaves the door open for government to return to the path of increasing deficits and burdensome taxes, as happened when Reagan-era spending cuts were restored by the Bush and Clinton administrations."
<p>	In May, Hodge and Barry point out, Republicans "promised to downsize the government by terminating programs that do not work, eliminating those that have become obsolete or outmoded, consolidating programs that duplicate others, ending corporate welfare, and transferring to state and local governments programs more appropriately carried out by them."
<p>	But instead, appropriations bills adopted since May show the House merely shaved relatively equal amounts from all programs in order to achieve the savings required to balance the budget on schedule, say the Heritage analysts.
<p>	The House agriculture spending bill, for example, "merely trims perennial sources of pork-barrel outlays by 4.3 percent overall," but triples funding for the office of the Agriculture Secretary, boosts by 33 percent the obsolete Rural Electrification Administration's budget, and adds 8 percent to Natural Resources Conservation Service spending.
<p>	Similarly, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation includes only "modest trims" averaging  4.5 percent, but the Maritime Administration's budget is hiked 23 percent, and programs that ought to be terminated outright like the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration are kept alive.
<p>	The Energy and Water Development appropriation imposes a "mild 5.5 percent cut on the Army Corps of Engineers, another favorite source of pork-barrel projects," say Hodge and Barry. But the measure pours more tax dollars into other needless spending projects -- like $4.2 million for maintenance of the Sam Rayburn Dam and Lake in Texas -- and puts another $3.3 billion in the Energy Supply, Research and Development program that has received more than $70 billion since 1977 with little or nothing to show for it.
<p>	If Congress is truly serious about restructuring government, Hodge and Barry say, it will use the upcoming conferences on the appropriations bills to terminate such outmoded and obsolete programs as: Job Corps ($1.2 billion); Amtrak subsidies ($628 million);  Appalachian Regional Commission ($142 million),  and Legal Services Corporation ($278 million).
<p>	Corporate welfare programs Congress should cut include: Rural Electrification Administration ($122 million); Export-Import Bank ($786.5 million); Public Broadcasting Facilities Grants ($19 million); Manufacturing Extension Partnership Programs ($81 million),  Small Business Administration ($590 million), and Federal Transit Administration ($3.9 billion).
<p>	If Congress fails to terminate such programs, Hodge and Barry say, there will be a replay of events during the Reagan administration when 94 federal programs were recommended for termination. According to a congressional study, only 12 were actually shut down, and some of them were later replaced by larger, more expensive programs.
<p>	The Small Business Administration (SBA), for instance, was slashed starting in 1981 during Reagan's first term from more than $2 billion to $557 million by 1986. But SBA rebounded during the Bush and Clinton administrations to a budget of nearly $1 billion. Merely trimming agency budgets leaves in place a federal bureaucracy that works hand-in-hand with special-interest groups to pressure Congress to restore funding to previous levels, say Hodge and Barry. This is what they believe may happen if the current House budget passes.
<p>	The Heritage budget analysts praise only two of the House-passed appropriations bills:  Education, Labor and Health and Human Resources, which eliminates 170 programs, and the Interior Department, which eliminates six agencies and 49 programs.

<h2><center>U.S.-ASIAN COMMERCE ON THE RISE  <br>
DESPITE TRADE WAR FEARS<br><br></h2></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8, 1995</b> --  America's exports to Asia totaled $153 billion and sustained 3.1 million American jobs in 1994, according to the 1995 edition of the U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook, compiled by analysts at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center (ASC). The just-released Handbook shows a 12 percent increase in exports over the previous year, and the number of Asia-related jobs grew by 500,000.<p>
	ASC analysts caution that this positive trend will be reversed unless the Clinton administration adopts a more non-threatening trans-Pacific free-trade policy. "The confrontational approach to Japan is an example of brinkmanship," says James Przystup, ASC director, "which, were it not for last-minute compromise, almost led to a full-scale trade war."<p>
	
Such a trade war would quickly spread from one Pacific rim nation to another, ASC analysts believe. The resulting bitterness and economic tension would inevitably pit America against its allies - - just at a time when U.S.-Asia multilateral cooperation on security issues is most needed. This is because many countries are concerned about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) growing military strength and the assertive way in which it challenged the Philippines' claims over the Spratly Islands. In addition, the PRC's recent long-range missile exercises near the Republic of China on Taiwan have reinforced Asia's anxiety about Chinese intentions. <p>
	The PRC's muscle-flexing is not the only challenge to existing regional security alliances. "The administration's response to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program has caused consternation among our Asian allies," says ASC Senior Policy Analyst and Handbook Editor Richard D. Fisher. "Throughout 1995," says Fisher, "the administration acted as if its managed-trade agenda held precedence over regional security." <p>
	Fisher says the U.S. policy of trade confrontation - - combined with frequent administration flip-flops on diplomatic issues - - has left Asians confused about the firmness of America's commitment to the goal of open markets. This, in turn, jeopardizes U. S. leadership on global trade, crucial to forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization. Leaders of the major Asian economic powers already are preparing for the scheduled November APEC summit at Osaka, Japan. <p>
	Most governments and businesses in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region at last agree that free-trade is the cornerstone of continued economic growth. "There is opportunity presented by this victory over Asia's long-held protectionist policies," says Fisher, "but we might lose that opportunity because of the administration's seeming abandonment of free trade."<p>
	Handbook data demonstrate how Asia's initial round of market-opening reforms are benefiting  American businesses. A country-by-country analysis reveals that sales of "Made In USA" goods and services are growing in the region's increasingly affluent countries: Malaysia's imports reached $7 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the 1993 level. The level of South Korea's imports from the United States was $18 billion, a 22 percent increase. Singapore's $13 billion represented an 11 percent increase. American exports to Thailand reached $4.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent over 1993.<p>
	Handbook statistics show several states are reaping substantial economic benefits from this explosion of commerce. More than 828,000 California jobs are dependent on Asia-bound exports - -  which rose by 20 percent in 1994 and reached $41.4 billion. In Texas, 247,000 jobs were sustained as exports rose 19 percent above 1993 levels, reaching $12.4 billion. Illinois' $6.6 billion worth of exports - - supporting 131,000 statewide jobs - - represents a 23 percent increase.<p>
	Pacific-bound commerce accounts for a significant share of jobs and income in other states. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oregon, and New York all witnessed at least 10 percent growth in the value of their Asian exports. Furthermore, the Handbook shows many smaller states are also gaining from this boom. For example, Maryland's $3 billion worth of exports reaching Asian consumers represented a 40 percent increase over the level in 1993, and supported 28,000 jobs.<p>
	Key social, political, military, and economic statistics on all Asia-Pacific nations are included in the Handbook. This year's edition also contains data on 19 Asia-Pacific countries adapted from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.<p>
	According to Przystup, "the data show that free-trade is a driving force for the economic growth that leads to democratization and security. America dares not lose historic diplomatic and economic opportunities through lack of a coherent policy towards Asia."<p>

<h2><center>BENEFITS "CAP" DECREASES<br>
OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br>
<h3>Abortions Didn't Increase <br>
Under New Jersey Program<br><br></h3></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 7, 1995 </b>-- New Jersey's "family cap" policy -- which denies increases in cash welfare benefits to single mothers who have additional children while already receiving welfare -- has resulted in a significant decline in out-of-wedlock births with no corresponding increase in abortions.<p>
	According to Heritage Foundation welfare analyst Robert Rector, the evidence from New Jersey indicates that in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, there was an average decrease in out-of-wedlock births of 10 percent. This, even though the average decrease in benefits came to just 4 percent of the monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits received by the typical welfare mother. There was no statistically significant corresponding increase in abortions, according to Rector, who obtained his information from New Jersey's Department of Human Services in Trenton.<p>
	"The New Jersey data show why Congress should consider imposing a similar cap on benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children as part of an overall welfare-reform strategy for reducing illegitimacy," says Rector, Heritage's senior analyst for welfare and family issues.<p>
	The family cap went into effect in October of 1992, and gave affected mothers -- those already enrolled in AFDC -- a 10-month grace period, meaning the limit on benefits applied only those who bore children after July 1993.    <p>     
	"In the year before the cap, the average monthly number of births was 1,331; in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, average monthly births among AFDC mothers fell to 1,197. The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 births per month, or 10 percent," Rector concludes.<p>	
	"Critics claim that the family cap has not caused an actual decrease in the number of illegitimate births, but merely a delay in welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office," Rector says. "But mothers on AFDC in New Jersey still have a huge economic incentive -- in the form of an increase in food stamp and Medicaid benefits for each additional child born -- to notify the welfare department of a childbirth." Moreover, Rector says the official data from New Jersey are adjusted to include births reported late, and still show a decline in illegitimacy.<p>
	Rector says previously reported data leaked to the press by scholars at Rutgers University -- data that supposedly showed no decrease in out-of-wedlock births as a result of New Jersey's policy -- were not conclusive. Rector points out that the Rutgers scholars have yet to finish their evaluation, have yet to issue an official report, and that their study did not, in fact, show zero effect on out-of-wedlock births. "In fact, the Rutgers analysis shows a lower rate of out-of-wedlock births after the cap went into effect," says Rector.<p>

<center><h2>HOUSE FARM BILL A "GOOD FIRST STEP"<br>
 BUT MORE NEEDED, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br></center><br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<h4>Study Projects $135 Billion Economic
Boost From  Phasing Out Farm Programs</h4><br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>	<br><br>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 6, 1995 </b>-- House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Pat Roberts' farm reform bill is "a good first step" but the Kansas Republican's proposal needs major changes to achieve real benefits for American farmers and consumers, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
	In a paper released today, John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agricultural Policy Project, says the bill -- which is scheduled for markup by the House Agriculture Committee September 13-15 -- needs a definite date when current farm programs and payments will end. The termination date should be in five years, Frydenlund says, not the seven suggested by the Roberts bill.<p>
	Nevertheless, he says, the Roberts bill, if implemented, would "significantly enhance the opportunity for farmers to meet the growing demands of the world marketplace." By extricating America's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, the bill would "allow farmers to produce to meet domestic consumer demand rather than to satisfy the dictates of the federal government," says Frydenlund.<p>
	Roberts' "Freedom to Farm Act" eliminates supply-control programs such as the Acreage Reduction Program, ends the Farmer-Owned Reserve for excess crop production, and replaces current target and deficiency payments with a new seven-year system of declining transitional payments, Frydenlund says.<p>
	But he believes the bill can work only if it locks in a deadline for phasing out these programs. "While Roberts' bill locks in fixed declining payments to farmers for the next seven years, there is no guarantee that these payments will cease at the end of the seven years," Frydenlund says. "The result could be buying a few years of time under the guise of real reform, only to slip back to the status quo when reducing the federal budget is no longer a top priority in Congress. In future years, supporters of centrally planned agriculture could point to any slight downturn in prices or land values as justification for a return to the current system of government controls," he says.<p>
	 The Roberts bill also should be changed to cap the transition payments for particular crops to prevent their "becoming an exorbitant windfall" if prices soar before the end of the phaseout period, and to "eliminate or at least drastically reduce" the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps up to 36 million acres of otherwise productive land idled, Frydenlund says.<p>
	Finally, Frydenlund believes Congress should impose a spending cap on the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and limit its borrowing authority. Under the current CCC,  there is little to constrain the Secretary of Agriculture's ability to "spend whatever is necessary regardless of what has been provided by Congress in budget authority" on deficiency payments to wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers.<p>
	"Not only does open-ended borrowing authority mean there is no real limit to potential farm program spending at present, but this nearly unlimited source of funds also allows the Secretary to raid CCC to cover mismanagement of other farm programs," Frydenlund says.<p>
	In a related Heritage study to be released later this week, Frydenlund and Heritage Senior Fellow for Statistical Policy Analysis David Winston conclude that the nation's economy would expand by nearly $135 billion within a decade as a result of ending the current farm program.<p>
	The study measures the "multiplier effect" on the economy that would result as farmers increase production, earn higher incomes through expanded exports, and generate new economic activity in farm-related industries such as equipment manufacturing, fertilizer, seed, livestock feed, food processing, transportation and shipping.<p>
	"In a 10-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state contributing to the expanded economy. Every single state will win under this plan," Frydenlund and Winston say.<p>
	Their conclusion was based on data generated by an econometric computer model developed by Heritage for the think tank's report, "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." That plan -- which proposed phasing out all federal farm programs by the year 2001 -- was made public earlier this year.<p>
	"In fact, the nation's economy would expand by $10.9 billion just in the first year, and this is a conservative estimate," according to Frydenlund and Winston.<p>
