<h3>December/January 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>: 

<h4><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h4>
</center>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, Vice President for Educational Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.<hr>
<p>
<I>Policy Review</I>, the magazine of The Heritage Foundation,
has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic
new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship
by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to
the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<P>
Our new name is <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html"><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></a>.
We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will
focus on the institutions of civil society-families, communities,
voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations,
business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments-that
are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized,
bureaucratic government.
<P>
We think of our mission as &quot;Applied Tocqueville,&quot; in
honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832
wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>, still the best book about our
country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that
was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most
prosperous, most charitable country on earth-with limited national
government and active citizen involvement in local government.
It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business
leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens
were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their
communities. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders
today who are carrying on this tradition.
<P>
We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the
most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism
over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left
America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block
of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's
poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities.
Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship
in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<P>
Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But
merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives
must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments,
and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills
left untreated by failed liberal programs. 
<P>
The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington
to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this
about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures
are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in
the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted
by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities
share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the
United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable
than government.
<P>
Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative
public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family
collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government
cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children
to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will
be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building
institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire
them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<P>
Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary
but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root
cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes
a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective
institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that
create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and
behaviors.
<P>
The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century
saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs,
and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened
character and addressed the failings of their communities. America
is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the
lead. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success
stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.

<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
<P></center>


<i>Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution</i><br>
By Lee Edwards, Regnery Publishing 1995, 572 pp.<hr>

	Lee Edwards’ Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution is an insightful and important look at the man who is more responsible than any other for the growth and success of the conservative movement in America. This biography is all the more timely, given the conservative congressional sweep of November 1994. It portrays a Goldwater who is every bit as fiesty as legend tells, and quite a bit more complex.<P>
	Edwards, who was a veteran of the 1964 Goldwater campaign, provides a thorough examination of Goldwater’s life, starting with his childhood and his days at Staunton Military Academy. Special attention, of course, is paid to Goldwater’s career in the U.S. Senate, his Presidential campaign of 1964 (and the Draft Goldwater effort that drew him into it), his role in the “making and unmaking of presidents” from 1968 through 1976, and his more recent  pronouncements on social issues. <P>
	While Goldwater delivers a wealth of information, three particularly important and interesting points stand out. First, the reader is reminded that some things are so old that they seem new. The “negative campaigning” that journalists often decry today was pioneered by Lyndon Johnson’s reelection campaign—with the tacit approval of the major media. Indeed, in three decades of presidential elections since 1964, no campaign of any party has matched Johnson’s for sheer dishonesty, demagoguery, and meanness.  Edwards methodically reminds the reader of the infamous Daisy Girl advertisement, as well as the less-well-remembered but still devastating Ice Cream Girl and Social Security ads. Johnson’s whole “Anti-Campaign,” complete with political espionage and possible misuse of the FBI, not only set a sad precedent for CREEP but almost certainly exceeded it in scope and (needless to say) efficiency.<P> 
	Edwards also reminds us that the savage and unwarranted attacks on Goldwater in the fall of 1964 were made more plausible by the drubbing he received at the hands of fellow Republicans during the nomination contest. While Edwards concedes that no Republican could have defeated Johnson in 1964 (a fact Edwards maintains was well understood by Goldwater himself throughout the campaign), he makes a powerful argument that the attacks of liberal Republicans like Rockefeller, Romney, and Scranton, helped turn a mere defeat into a landslide.<P>
	Second, Edwards thoughtfully illuminates the complexity of Barry Goldwater. Edwards argues that, far from being a recent phenomenon, Goldwater has always been torn between a “traditionalist” side and a “libertarian” side, the side that today surprises conservatives with exclamations of pro-choice and pro-gay sentiment. This split could be seen even in Goldwater’s earliest political involvement: one of his first political acts was to urge the city of Phoenix to reject the “evils” of dog racing, yet one of his first votes after being elected to the Phoenix city council was to approve a liquor license for a supermarket 1200 feet from West Phoenix High School over the objections of local parents and religious leaders.    <P>
	Edwards argues that this complexity has been often intertwined with another factor: to Barry Goldwater, a personal connection often meant more than philosophical consistency. His lack of a deeply personal connection to Ronald Reagan, for example, may largely explain Goldwater’s often-cool relationship with his heir as leader of the conservative movement. His recent stand on social issues may have been influenced not only by his latent libertarianism but by his daughters’ abortions and the homosexuality of a grandson and grandniece. Barry Goldwater is an intensely human figure, and the human relationships of day to day life have almost certainly affected his politics to a greater degree than most conservatives have understood.  <P>
	Finally, and most importantly, Edwards succeeds in reminding his readers of the unpayable debt that conservatives owe to Barry Goldwater, regardless of the meanderings of his latter years. Edwards catalogues a fraction of the multitude of individuals who began their political lives inspired by Barry Goldwater and who went on to carry forward the conservative cause. He imagines, plausibly, all the good that would not have happened without a Senator Barry Goldwater and a campaign of 1964, and imagines equally plausibly all the good that might have happened had he won. <P>  
	As Edwards shows, sometimes Goldwater himself was unaware of the potential impact of his actions: he did not anticipate how his 1957 Senate speech criticizing the Eisenhower budget would catapult him to leadership of the conservative movement, nor did he anticipate that Conscience of a Conservative would have any appreciable effect on the nation’s politics. At other times, especially in 1964, Goldwater understood well that he carried on his shoulders the aspirations of millions of freedom-loving Americans. Always, however, he made a difference. As Edwards concludes, Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign “marked the true beginning of a tectonic shift in American politics— from East to West, from the cities to the suburbs, from big government to limited government, from containment to liberation, from liberal to conservative— that continues to shape the nation, as the historic elections of 1994 attest.”<P>

<P>
<B>Selected Foreign and Defense Policy Issues for the '96 Presidential
Campaign</B>, by Thomas Henriksen
<br>
<I>Briefing</I>, Pacific Research Institute

<P>
President Clinton has not only failed to craft a coherent international
mission for the United States, but he has also failed to resolve
a host of independent conflicts, according to Thomas Henriksen,
Senior Fellow &amp; Associate Director at the Hoover Institution.
This study surveys several foreign policy issues facing America
as it enters the 1996 national election campaign, including: the
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons; counter-terrorism;
the role of the United States in the new international order;
human rights; continuing trouble spots (e.g. North Korea &amp;
Bosnia); and defense cutbacks and pentagon reorganization. 22

<B>The Rising Threat of Revolutionary Islam <BR>
in Algeria</B>, by James Phillips 
<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1060, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
If the bloody civil war in Algeria is not halted, argues Heritage
Senior Policy Analyst James Phillips, the resulting political
chaos could destabilize the entire region. According to Phillips,
the only thing worse than the present situation would be victory
by Islamic radicals over the Algerian army. Such an outcome would
pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in North
Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. Phillips
provides a history of Algeria's political breakdown and a view
of the current stalemate and grim future. He then points out how
a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests and describes
a policy that he believes the Clinton administration should adopt.

In a speech given at The Heritage Foundation, President &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
G&ouml;ncz asserted that Hungary must set off on the road to Euro-Atlantic
integration, including full-fledged membership in NATO and the
European Union. President G&ouml;ncz surveyed the history of his
country since the end of the Cold War, and concluded that Hungary's
speedy integration into a Euro-Atlantic alliance should continue
despite criticism that the change is occurring too fast.  The
President also stated that it is his country's responsibility
to avoid delays and &quot;to drop anchor as soon as possible,
and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven.&quot;

<B>Holbrooke Horror: The U.S. Plan for Bosnia,  <BR>
</B>by Ted Galen Carpenter 
<br>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 37, Cato Institute

<P>
Cato Institute's Director of Foreign Policy Studies, Ted Galen
Carpenter, contends that the Clinton administration foolishly
insists on maintaining the fiction of a united Bosnian state while
accepting a de facto ethnic partition.  Carpenter declares that
the inherent contradiction between those two objectives will doom
the peace agreement and pose a grave danger to the proposed U.S.-led
NATO peacekeeping force.  The author then lists specific problems
with <BR>
the peace plan and describes the multiple sources of danger  a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force will face. The paper concludes with
a recommended alternate plan of action advocating that the belligerents
themselves reach a durable agreement reflecting battlefield realities
and the balance of political and military forces.  Carpenter writes
that under no circumstances should the United States send troops
to enforce an inherently unworkable peace accord. 15 pp. CONTACT:

<B>How to Close Down the Department of Energy,</B> <BR>
by John Barry
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1061, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Barry calls for shutting
down the Department of Energy (DOE) and outlines the Heritage
proposal to do so. Among the provisions of the plans are: selling
off DOE assets such as the Strategic and Naval Petroleum Reserves;
terminating unnecessary DOE programs, privatizing government owned
laboratories, and transferring all defense-related nuclear weapons
functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. According
to Barry, closing down DOE and making the related reforms would
save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five
years, including $16 billion in asset sales. 21 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The Telecom Revolution: American Opportunity</B> 
<br>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation 

<P>
The United States should replace and modernize its existing telecommunications
regulatory policies, argue the authors of this comprehensive study.
The study notes that the telecommunications industry already constitutes
one-seventh of our economy and, by the early 21st century, the
global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion market.
Furthermore, in 1995, one-half of all capital investment in America,
broadly defined, will be in computers and telecommunications equipment.
Despite these facts, the telecommunications industry must comply
with a  statutory and regulatory system erected in the 1930's.
The study outlines recommendations that, according to the authors,
would provide for a modern and effective government to complement
market forces, speeding the development of new products and services
for Americans. 111 pp.  CONTACT: The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Human Cost of Regulation: the Case of Medical Devices and
the FDA, </B>by David Murray
<br>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper </I>No. 183, The Hudson Institute

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's current system for approving
medical devices has been marred by regulatory snags that unnecessarily
delay the introduction of lifesaving and life-enhancing products
to the market, according to Hudson Research Analyst David Murray.
Meanwhile, the European Community's medical device approval system
allows new products that are no less safe than in the United States
to reach the market far more quickly. The author suggests that
the U. S. should adopt a system similar to that used by the European
Community for medical device approvals. Such a system would terminate
FDA's monopoly on the premarket approval of medical devices and
establish a mainly privatized process, based on a quality systems
approach to evaluation. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman

<B>Regulatory Reform in the Electric <BR>
Power Industry,</B> by Vernon Smith
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 3, The Barry Goldwater Institute.

<P>
According to University of Arizona Professor Vernon L. Smith,
the public is finally challenging the notion that certain industries,
most specifically the electric power industry, are &quot;natural
monopolies.&quot; Smith looks at how various countries are seeking
to deregulate their electric power industries, and shows that
countries that only a few years ago were using a central planning
approach are now surpassing the United States in establishing
competitive electric power industries. The report concludes that
policy makers should begin thinking seriously about reforming
our approach to the electric power industry. 20 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Dangerous Excesses: A Look at the Food <BR>

<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 13, Citizens for a Sound <BR>
Economy Foundation

<P>
Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, shows that the Food and Drug Administration-originally
designed to protect the health of U.S. consumers-has increasingly
become an obstacle to providing consumers with potentially life-saving
drugs and medical devices. Pierce notes that delays in approvals
by the agency are ballooning, as the new drug approval process
now takes some 13-15 years. At the same time, the agency has been
growing, with a budget nearing the billion dollar mark. Peirce
illustrates how FDA has dramatically enlarged its authority, and
cites several instances where it has dramatically delayed the
development of new medical devices and medicines. The paper also
shows that FDA has been expanding its limits on the speech of
pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers. Pierce, concludes
with a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving FDA,
including: prioritizing functions, allowing private organizations
and laboratories to issue medical device approvals; and contracting
out testing to the private sector. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: Has Food Packaging Law Gone Too Far?</B>
<B>Part 1,</B> by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 196, Reason Foundation

<P>
According Alexander Volokh, Assistant Policy Analyst at the Reason
Foundation, food packaging regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration aimed at preventing contaminants from entering
our food may discourage the use of recycled materials. Volokh
writes that FDA operates under the assumption that all substances
diffuse over time, that everything that makes up your Coca-Cola
bottle will <I>eventually</I> become part of your Coke, and vice
versa. Therefore, FDA regulates the components of food packaging
as <I>indirect</I> food additives. Because FDA scrutinizes recycled
materials so closely, it usually takes a half a year or more and
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain FDA approval for
recycled packaging material. Volokh suggests that deregulation
of the approval process would be a way to expand recycling markets.

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: How RCRA has Recyclers Running Around
in CERCLAs, Part 2</B>, by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 197, Reason Foundation

<P>
Part 2 of &quot;The FDA vs. Recycling&quot; shows that federal
hazardous waste regulations, such as the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund, have burdened the hazardous
waste recycling industry, damaging the economic viability of recycled
products like lead batteries and used oil. For example, a company
that wants to get a permit to send their industrial waste, such
as car batteries or scrap metal, to be recycled faces a huge liability.
Under Superfund-which regulates the cleanup of toxic waste sites-if
a recycling facility is declared hazardous, whoever arranged for
the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance can be liable
for the cleanup of the entire site. The paper concludes that if
products are heavily regulated after they are thrown out or in
the process of recycling, it should not be a surprise that people
will prefer to use virgin materials rather than recycle. 24 pp.

<h2>TAXATION &AMP; BUDGET
</h2>
<P>
<B>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to
the Economy,</B> by William Beach and John Barry
<br>
<I>F.Y.I. </I>No. 69, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead, over
the next seven years, to greater business investment, higher earnings
per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law, according
to William Beach, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and
John Barry, Heritage Research Assistant. Beach and Barry conducted
an interim analysis of Congress's balanced budget plan with tax
cuts using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer
&amp; Associates, the same model used by the Clinton administration's
OMB and the Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cause an economic
downturn as some critics of the plan believe, the Heritage analysis
predicts that the following economic boons to American families
and businesses would result over the next seven years: an additional
$32.1 billion in real disposable income; an additional $66.2 billion
in consumption expenditures; an additional $88.2 billion in real
non-residential fixed investment; and an additional 103,700 housing

<B>Direct Student Loans: Putting Taxpayers at Risk,</B> by Michael
Cannon
<br>
<I>Issues and Answers</I> No. 14, Citizens for a <BR>
Sound Economy
<P>
Through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), the
federal government insures against defaulted loans made to students
by private lending institutions. According to Michael Cannon,
Citizens for a Sound Economy Policy Analyst, this program has
proven costly, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for billions
of dollars in defaulted loans. The administration's response to
the problem has been to offer all loans directly to students-bypassing
traditional lending institutions. Cannon contends that government
control of student loans will not only cause default rates to
skyrocket but will also place all the risk on the shoulders of
taxpayers. The author suggests that the federal government limit
taxation and government spending so that students will have more
money to put toward college tuition and more private sector jobs
waiting for them upon graduation. Cannon concludes that Congress
must reject any plan to nationalize the student loan industry
if they are serious about protecting taxpayers from wasteful government
spending. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H

<B>Public vs. Private: Stadium Financing, <BR>
Operation and Development,</B> by Grant Gulibon
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
According to Grant Gulibon, Allegheny Institute Research Assistant,
the power that professional sports teams are able to wield over
their local governments comes from overrated economic and psychological
value to the given municipalities. Gulibon demonstrates that professional
sports' economic contribution to local communities is exaggerated
and that only privately financed and owned stadiums remain a profitable
investment. His study also shows that government owned and operated
stadiums are rarely run efficiently and remain a taxpayer burden.
This theory is applied to Pittsburgh's current stadium situation
and threats by team owners to leave town if a new stadium is not
built. Gulibon concludes that if a new stadium is built it should
be a private venture and not be financed by public money or owned
by the local government. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute

<B>Politics and the Power of the Purse,</B> by Dwight Lee
<br>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I> No. 75, Center for the Study
of American Business

<P>
In this essay, University of Georgia Economics Professor Dwight
Lee asks what the prospects of halting and then reversing federal
spending are. Lee points out that the problem of an excessive
and increasingly out-of-touch federal government is explained
by two interconnected problems. First, since the 1930's, political
power has become increasingly centralized in Washington, with
the federal government taking over more and more functions that
were not traditionally government responsibilities at any level.
Second, the federal tax system takes a large percentage of the
taxes paid by Americans. Lee writes that the type of reform necessary
to control the tax and spend power of the federal government cannot
be realized by congressional legislative fiat. This is serious
reform, according to the author, the type that has to be imposed
on reluctant politicians.  Lee calls for tax reform that is backed
by a constitutional amendment. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the

<B>The Allegheny Regional Asset District Tax,</B> <BR>
by Jake Haulk
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
This report analyzes the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD)
and the local option sales tax which funds it. RAD is a program
similiar to programs in large American cities that uses dedicated
tax revenue to subsidize cultural and recreational organizations,
usually stadiums for professional sports franchises. The report
details specific damage that the RAD tax has caused. Included
is evidence that the added sales tax will cause a shift of some
sales and jobs out of one county and into neighboring counties.
Furthermore, according to Allegheny Institute's Jake Haulk, a
supposed tax reform component of the RAD program is largely a
redistribution from better off suburbs to poorer municipalities.
By lumping this redistribution effort with the RAD program, the
opportunity for real tax reform as well as tax and expenditure
reductions by local governments has been largely foreclosed. 18

<B>Why Congress Must Reform Welfare, <BR>
</B>by Robert Rector
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1063, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
discusses why Congress must reform welfare. Rector begins by addressing
the claim often times presented to the public that the current
welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. Rector's
research shows that: 1) the 4.7 million families currently receiving
AFDC have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare;
2) when past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined,
the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families
currently receiving benefits, is 13 years; and 3) among the 4.7
million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will
spend more than two years on the AFDC caseload. Next, Rector shares
the results of recent research by Congressional Budget Office
Director June O'Neill, which shows that increasing the length
of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by
as much as 20 percent. Rector writes that the more welfare income
received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the
boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families
with identical non-welfare income. Furthermore, Rector demonstrates
how receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during
childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among
young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
Rector concludes by outlining the basic themes of the House/Senate
conference proposals to reform welfare. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris

<B>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House <BR>

<br>
<I>Issue Bulletin </I>No. 220, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Liu illustrates why Medicare needs
serious reform if taxpayers are to be spared future tax increases
or deep cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly. Liu believes
the current reforms being proposed in Congress are only stop-gap
measures to ward off fiscal disaster when the &quot;Baby-Boom&quot;
generation qualifies for Medicare. This paper compares the components
of the House and Senate Medicare reform proposals and identifies
the best policy in each area. For example, while both bills establish
consumer choice in health plans, Lui believes that they should
also expand the options available to senior citizens. Liu also
describes how certain provisions within the current proposals
could have harmful consequences for the healthcare market and
the elderly if they are not modified and recommends provisions
that he thinks should be included in a final bill. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Charting Florida's Educational Future, <BR>
</B>by Jonathan Hage
<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 3, Foundation for Florida's Future


<P>
Director of Research for Foundation for Florida's Future, Jonathan
Hage, supports charter schools as a way to solve the problems
facing Florida public education. Charter schools are independent
public schools formed under a &quot;charter,&quot; or contract,
made between <I>organizers</I> (e.g., teachers, parents, colleges,
local organizations, or others) and <I>sponsors</I> (e.g., local
school boards, state boards of education or some other legislatively
approved and publicly accountable body). Hage provides examples
of successful charter schools in other states and addresses several
concerns that communities might have about them. Among the concerns
Hage addresses are: &quot;Charter schools won't be regulated and
children will be hurt&quot;; &quot;Charter schools are just another
passing fad&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will take money from
traditional public schools&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will open
the door to religious involvement&quot;; and &quot;Charter schools
will serve the 'elite' students, not the poor at-risk.&quot; Based
on his research, Hage concludes that charter schools will empower
parents to have more control over their children's education and
that schools will be held more accountable for their performance.

<B>How Much More do We Have to Spend to Achieve a Totally Illiterate
Society?</B> <BR>
by Dwight Williams 
<br>
<I>Independence Issue Paper</I> No. 9, Independence Institute


<P>
Dwight Williams, Research Associate at The Independence Institute,
sheds light on the perplexing question: &quot;Why has academic
achievement declined or stagnated in Colorado and the rest of
the United States despite the tremendous increase in education
spending in recent decades?&quot; Williams shows that there is
no correlation between more school spending and higher achievement.
For example, total spending on education in Colorado grew 1730
percent from 1964 to 1994, despite this, over the same period
of time, Colorado student's national test scores remained static.
Also, because so much school revenue is spent on social conditioning
and other non-academic pursuits, only 41 percent of school days
are devoted to core academic work. Williams details steps which
public schools could take to reduce overhead, improve efficiency,
and free up resources for actual teaching-without increasing the
burden on taxpayers. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute,

<B>Making Schools Work: Spending and Student Achievement, </B>by
Eric Hanushek
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 68, The Heartland Institute

<P>
Eric Hanushek, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the
University of Rochester, found that real spending on public education
in the U.S. is rising rapidly.  Despite this, student-teacher
and student-staff ratios have fallen, and student achievement
is either flat or falling. According to the study, three problems
largely explain the inefficiency of public education today: 1)
disregard for efficiency and productivity; 2) absence of performance
incentives; and 3) public schools don't learn from experience.
Hanushek concludes that only when public educators focus on making
efficiency and productivity a priority among educators and administrators
will student achievement improve. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The Heartland

<B>Natural Resource Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis,</B>
edited by Richard B. Stewart
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
This book addresses the emerging area of environmental law known
as &quot;natural resource damages&quot;(NRD), in a series of legal
and economic essays. Natural resource damages is a form of environmental
liability established by Superfund, the Oil Pollution Act, and
other federal and state statutes. These laws provide that public
(principally governmental) &quot;trustees&quot; can sue those
entities (principally private) held liable for damages to natural
resources.  As the monograph's Editor, Richard B. Stewart, former
head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Environment and Natural
Resources Division, points out that natural resource damages law
is an awakening &quot;sleeping giant.&quot; He writes that it
will become increasingly important for American businesses to
become aware of NRD's implications. According to Stewart, NRD
threatens U.S. business with potentially enormous liabilities
and massive transaction costs. This book attempts to identify
serious flaws in the existing system and suggests alternative
approaches that would protect natural resources without placing
an enormous liability upon U.S. businesses. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

<P>
Land trusts were originally a perfect vehicle for privatized environmental
protection, according to retired civil and environmental engineer
Carol LaGrasse. Today, however, colossal environmental land brokerage
organizations are a channel for innocent, environmentally minded
citizen donors to unknowingly pool their resources with the taxing
power of state and federal governments to wrest land from private
ownership. LaGrasse writes that land trusts are exempt from the
possible subjection to demands by citizens for information under
the Freedom of Information laws. So, these groups can, in effect,
perform government functions without public scrutiny or responsibility.
LaGrasse points out that non-profit land trusts are serving primarily
as real estate brokers for government and asks the question: &quot;why
should local citizens, economically restricted by land preservation,
grant a tax exemption to land trusts to absorb a tax shift caused
by their wholesale land acquisitions, contrary to the community
interests?&quot; 16 pp.  CONTACT: The Property Rights Foundation

<br>
<I>Policy Review </I>No. 75, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Edwin Meese, III, former Attorney General under President Reagan,
and Rhett DeHart, Special Counsel to Mr. Meese, show how Congress's
massive federalization of crimes has served to undermine local
law enforcement. According to the authors, the case against federalization
of crime includes the following: nationalizing crime contradicts
constitutional principles; violates double jeopardy; incurs unnecessary
expense; undermines state experimentation; and shifts accountability.
The proper role of the federal government, according to Meese
and DeHart, can best be described by the word &quot;limited.&quot;
There are only two broad areas of criminal jurisdiction where
the federal government should be involved. The first, crime against
the sovereignty of the United States, is concerned with clearly
federal issues such as treason, counterfeiting, and national security
violations. The second area of federal criminal jurisdiction is
limited to narrowly defined, significant interstate, or international,
crime. Furthermore, the federal government is best suite to provide
local officials with technological assistance and a database of
crime statistics as well as criminal histories and fingerprints.
Although both authors recognize that crime is a problem that affects
the entire nation, they write that &quot;both constitutional tradition
and practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively
fought at the state and local level.&quot; CONTACT: Brendan O'Scannlain,

Jackson Institute

<P>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, presents
a case for the policy known as &quot;Truth in Sentencing.&quot;
This policy seeks to fix the critical problem of early release
of violent offenders. Truth-in-Sentencing would abolish parole
and other early release programs for violent criminals and would
keep them incarcerated for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
Such an approach, similar to that in place in the federal prison
system, would greatly strengthen Tennessee's criminal justice
system by ending the current practice of allowing the majority
of violent offenders sentenced to prison to serve only a fraction
of their sentence, writes Wootton. The study illustrates that
the direct costs of allowing a violent criminal to remain on the
streets far outweigh the costs of keeping an offender in prison.

<P>
This paper evaluates the prison expansion program which has been
underway in Wisconsin since the late 1970's. Among its findings:
1) increased incarceration is a major reason for an 18% cut in
Wisconsin's crime rate between 1980 and the end of 1994; 2) while
prison costs are a growing share of the state's budget, on a per
capita basis they were a modest $46 a year in 1994; and 3) more
unskilled youths, a continuing increase in unstable, single parent
families, and an apparent departure from the state's successful
prison expansion policy, all portend an increase in crime in Wisconsin.
The study concludes that Wisconsin's prison policy has been effective
and that it warrants review as the state decides whether additional
prison space should remain a priority. 32 pp.  CONTACT: Wisconsin

<B>Three Years of the Americans With Disabilities Act: Lessons

<P>
The broad and far-reaching language of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) left many employers uncertain and confused about its
requirements when it was first enacted five years ago, according
to former NLCPI staff member Mark Parenti. In order to determine
where the law has become more settled and clear, and where it
still presents employers with uncertainty, the first part of this
paper examines how the courts and the executive branch have applied
and enforced the ADA. The second part of the study addresses the
overlap and conflict between ADA provisions and other federal
laws governing the workplace. The paper concludes that the courts
are doing the job of staking out limits to the Act's uncertain
requirements and defining its vague language-a job that Congress
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission neglected. 67

<br>
<I>Research Memorandum</I> No. 10, Manhattan Institute

<P>
The class action format can serve objectives of practicality and
fairness, yet at the same time it is recognized that the device
poses dangers, including dangers to members of the plaintiff class
themselves, according to Lester Brickman,  Professor of Law at
Cardozo Law School. Brickman sheds light on the landmark decision,
<I>Matter of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.</I>, that could mean the
end of abuse in class-action claims. &quot;Even if the usefulness
of the class action device in some cases is conceded,&quot; says
Brickman, &quot;it is entirely proper to regulate its use to curb...its
rich potential for 'blackmail' settlements.&quot; The settlement
in <I>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer</I>, according to Brickman, will be
an essential founding document in the coming fight to restore
such constraints on a sector of the litigation system that has
&quot;long since spun out of control.&quot; 5 pp.  CONTACT: Manhattan

</B>by David F. Forte
<br>
<I>The World &amp; I</I>, October 1995

<P>
David Forte, Professor at Cleveland State University, reflects
upon the past year in the Supreme Court, most notably, the emergence
of Justice Clarence Thomas as an intellectual dynamo of the conservative
bloc. Specifically, Forte describes the following significant
developments during the 1994-95 term: 1) the constitutional rules
affecting race, free speech, religious expression, congressional
powers, and federalism were tilted sharply to the right; 2) Justice
Thomas's intellectual emergence was rooted in the thought of the
framers; 3) the four-justice liberal bloc looked wistfully to
the judicial activism that characterized the Court from 1937 on;
and 4) only 82 opinions were written last term, fewer than in
any year since 1956, but, comments Forte, they were among the
best-crafted in decades. 6 pp. CONTACT: <I>The World &amp; I</I>,

<B>Taking Aim at Gun Control</B>
<br>
<I>Executive Summary</I> No. 69, The Heartland Institute

<P>
This report attempts to debunk the myths of gun control, offering
an overview of several pivotal issues in the gun control debate.
Several researchers reveal their findings that there is little
or no connection between gun control and crime and help explain
why the record on gun control is so poor. The paper concludes
that firearms are not the root of the problem of violence and
arguably are almost completely divorced from it. &quot;As long
as some people have little or nothing to lose by spending their
lives in crime, dispositions to violence will persist-and increasingly
strict gun controls will do little if anything to improve matters.&quot;

scholars and colleagues discuss and debate the issue, Summit participants
developed a list of four approaches to be explored to help restore
balance between the states and the federal government: 1) a federalism
act to enhance the political safeguards of federalism and give
states more voice in congressional deliberations; 2) a mechanism
to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures,
the power to require the Congress to reconsider laws, specific
provisions of laws, or regulations that interfere with state authority;
3) a mechanism for the states to propose specific amendments to
the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the U.S. Congress;

the problems of conditions attached to spending grants, regulations

<B>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: One Philanthropy's Web of State
Health Care Initiatives, </B>by Genevieve M. Young
<br>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, August 1995

<P>
State health reform proposals were especially prominent during
the 1992 election campaign and again in 1993. The effect of those
high profile proposals created an impression in the media and
among the public that rhetoric concerning a &quot;crisis&quot;
in health care had an objective, verifiable reality. However,
Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, demonstrates that
this &quot;crisis&quot; was the creation of a well-funded, highly
organized campaign by special interests bent on imposing their
vision of health care on the rest of us. Chief among these special
interests was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Young sheds
light on the Foundation's activities, particularly its efforts
at the state level. She exposes a complex web of relationships
between the Foundation and various government entities, working
groups, commissions, and contractors-all designed to further the
cause of government-run health care.<I> </I>6 pp. CONTACT: Capital

<B>Justice Department's Efforts at Social Engineering Defeated</B>
<P>
ALF represented New Jersey firefighter candidates who had taken
a 1995 physical performance test to determine which candidates
were eligible to be hired as firefighters and in what order. The
Justice Department, however, did not like the results of the test
because not enough minority candidates did well and instructed
Newark to ignore the 1995 list and continue to hire from a list
generated by a 1992 exam.
<P>
The United States District Court of New Jersey agreed with ALF's
position and pointed out to the Justice Department that a test
had been devised several years earlier based on the best technical
advice and that that test had been approved by the United States,
the State of New Jersey and 12 cities of New Jersey which were
subject to an earlier consent decree concerning &quot;goals&quot;
for hiring firefighters. He further pointed out that when the
test had been given in 1992, the Justice Department had not objected
to the results. The <I>same</I> test was given in 1995, but because
the Justice Department did not like the results, it objected even
though the test was the one that it helped set up and approve.
The judge ordered that the State of New Jersey certify the 1995
list for hiring and scrap the 1992 list.

<B>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</B>

<P>
<B>Defenders Bring Suit Against City of Pacific Grove and State
of California for Violating Constitution  </B>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has filed suit in United States District
Court on behalf of Pacific Grove property owner Stephen J.L. Page.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the City of Pacific
Grove, certain city officials, and the California Coastal Commission
denied him the approvals to build a home on residential property
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution
<P>
These constitutional violations stem from Mr. Page's 1989 decision
to purchase a 1.08-acre parcel of oceanfront property in a subdivided,
fully developed residential area of Pacific Grove.  He was forced
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours
attending duplicative hearings and responding to unnecessary conditions
imposed upon his attempt to use his land.  Yet-six years later
-he still lacks the necessary government approvals to build his
home.  
<P>
Pacific Grove's desire to keep the land as &quot;open space&quot;
was evident when Mr. Page first intended to purchase the land,
and voluntarily agreed to delay his purchase for an entire year
in order to allow the city time to collect money to buy the lot
itself.  Having failed to raise the requisite funds to legitimately
acquire the land, the city deliberately schemed to maintain the
land as open space without paying for it by refusing to grant
a building permit.
<P>
Chief among the tactics employed by both the city and the Coastal
Commission was the imposition of multiple, onerous, and costly
conditions that must be met to obtain a permit.  For example,
Mr. Page must set aside eighty-five percent of his land as &quot;open
space&quot; (while paying taxes on 100% of the land).  Even if
he is allowed to build a home, he will not be able to: erect any
fencing on his land, including fencing to exclude trespassers;
erect any exterior light or even a flagpole without prior government
approval; repair his septic system; or remove any hazardous substance
or diseased plants from his yard.

<B>Defenders in Face Off with FAA over Proposed Taking in Farmland</B>
<P>
Defenders helped win a victory in a recent dispute involving the
Federal Aviation Administration in New Bloomfield, Missouri. The
FAA, in attempting to purchase air rights for a new radar tower,
was taking more than the air space: property owners were told
that their continued use of the underlying property could interfere
with the radar's well, although the FAA was not going to compensate
them for the loss of those rights.
<P>
After intense media scrutiny and public opposition, the FAA decided
that it did not need to purchase the air rights after all, and
have assured the property owners that the present and intended
future use of their farmland will not be restricted due to the
radar.
<P>
<B>Defenders Obtains Day in Court for <BR>
Property Owner</B>
<P>
In <I>Sudarsky v. City of New York,</I> Defenders argued that
the City of New York unconstitutionally took Peter Sudarsky's
property through zoning regulation, and urged the court to hear
the merits of the case. In 1986, Mr. Sudarsky attempted to develop
a seventeen-story building on prime commercial real estate in
Manhattan. The City of New York held up the development under
the guise of needing an easement to expand the subway, and in
the meantime downzoned the property, foiling Mr. Sudarsky's development
plans.
<P>
After several years and several courts, including a petition to
the United States Supreme Court (which was denied), the case still
has not gone to trial. Nevertheless, the New York Supreme Court
has just reversed a grant of summary judgment for defendants and
reinstated the claim. Mr. Sudarsky will finally get his day in
court and a chance to prove his takings claim.

Through a negotiated settlement engineered by the Institute for

removed licensing requirements from Teen Challenge in San Antonio;
allowing the nationally acclaimed program to continue its healing
work on behalf of those addicted to drugs and alcohol. The consent
decree expressly recognizes Teen Challenge's right to continue
its current method of operation without a license or other state
imposed requirements that would interfere with Teen Challenge
ministry. Teen Challenge, which has an outstanding track record
in assisting addiction through a Christian faith-based program
was forced by the State of Texas to comply with secular credentialling
and training requirements which treat addiction as a disease that
can never be fully cured and that requires extensive psychological
counseling and therapeutic treatment.

<B>Landmark Wins Key Education <BR>
Reform Victory</B>
<P>
In another victory for education reform, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has ruled in favor of Landmark's client, the Wilkinsburg
School District, and has allowed the continued private management
of the district's Turner Elementary School.
<P>
The school district is undertaking a remarkable effort to restructure
the education program at one small elementary school. Against
the backdrop of one of the most dismal educational achievement
records imaginable, the school board is allowing a private firm
to manage and operate the school.
<P>
Despite repeated attempts by the National Education Association
to prevent it, Turner Elementary School opened under private management
on September 5, 1995 pending review by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. This is believed to be the first time in the nation that
a public school has been totally privatized.
<P>
The state supreme court upheld the district's effort by dissolving
a preliminary injunction, dismissing contempt charges against
school board members and ordering the trial court to hold another
hearing on the union's pending motion for a permanent injunction.
However, in its remand to the trial court, the supreme court took
the unusual step of addressing certain constitutional issues prior
to the hearing. Agreeing with the position advanced by Landmark,
the majority stated that &quot;even if the School Code were to
be interpreted to prohibit subcontracting of teachers...there
may be other conditions, which the school district insists there
are, which would render this application of the Public School
Code unconstitutional.&quot;

<B>Court's Price of Admission too High</B>
<P>
In a petition for <I>writ of certiori </I>filed recently, MSLF
requested that the Supreme Court hear <I>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v.
Carol M. Browner, et al., </I>a case in which a New Mexico man
has been driven out of business by a cease and desist order issued
by EPA following its determination that the man's land is &quot;waters
of the United States&quot; under the Clean Water Act.
<P>
For years, Larry Squires used his land to dispose of waters produced
by southeastern New Mexico's important oil and gas industry. Although
EPA had told Squires previously that his lands were not &quot;waters
of the United States,&quot; in 1991 it changed its mind. In 1992,
EPA served Squires with a cease and desist order preventing him
from using his land. When his company was driven out of business,
Squires asked MSLF to represent him in suing EPA.
<P>
Squires contended that EPA's decision that his land fell under
the Clean Water Act was illegal. EPA asserted that Squires could
not sue until he violated the cease and desist order. If Squires
violated the EPA order, he would face penalties of $25,000 and
three years in prison, administrative fines of up to $125,000,
and a &quot;knowing&quot; penalty of $50,000 per day, plus three
years in prison.
<P>
A federal district court agreed with EPA. An appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded the following decision in June:
&quot;Laguna's policy argument that it should not be necessary
to violate an EPA order and risk civil and criminal penalties
to obtain judicial review is well taken. Nevertheless...we reject
Laguna's conclusion such a situation is constitutionally intolerable.&quot;
<P>
In asking the Supreme Court to hear Laguna's case, MSLF asserts
that the Tenth Circuit's decision conflicts with the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment requirement that &quot;[n]o person shall...be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law,&quot; as well as numerous Supreme Court decisions that &quot;individuals
must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Government deprives them of property.&quot;

<B>OREGONIANS IN ACTION</B>

<P>
<B>City of Tigard Rebuffs U.S. Supreme Court </B>
<P>
On August 29th, the Tigard City Council voted to reinstate the
same bikepath/greenway conditions on the Dolan's A-Boy plumbing
store building permit that the United States Supreme Court struck
down in the highly publicized landmark property rights case, <I>Dolan
v. City of Tigard</I>.
<P>
In June last year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the city had
failed to prove &quot;rough proportionality&quot; between the
impact of an expanded plumbing store building and the city's requirement
that the Dolans give up 10% of their land for a public bikepath
and greenway along Fanno Creek. Although the U.S. Supreme Court
was skeptical that Tigard could meet the proportionality test,
it remanded the case back to the city to give it an opportunity
to do so. During the months of inaction on the part of the city,
it did not withdraw the unconstitutional conditions, revise them,
or try to justify them. The Dolans then filed a legal action in
circuit court for damages caused by the city's unconstitutional
actions.
<P>
The city eventually instituted proceedings in which they attempted
to establish the required connection between impact of the building
and the bikepath/greenway conditions.
<P>
The Dolans have tried to settle with the city by agreeing to conditions
that would accommodate the city's bikepath and greenway needs
as well as the building. In fact, the city's staff proposed virtually
the same compromise, but later the city decided to reimpose essentially
what it had imposed four years before.

<B>Texas Immigration Suit Supported on Appeal</B>
<P>
Joined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jack
Fields, WLF filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit in support of Texas'
position in <I>Texas v. U.S.</I>, the lawsuit brought to compel
the federal government to enforce immigration laws adequately
or to compensate Texas for the fiscal burdens resulting from inadequate
enforcement. WLF argued in its brief that if the federal government
fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is
a massive unfunded mandate imposed upon the states to provide
for the immigrants' education-a mandate that the federal government
cannot impose without compensatory funding.  
<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Injunction Supported in California Supreme Court</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the California Supreme Court in support of
the City of San Jose's position in <I>People v. Carlos Acuna</I>,
a suit over the constitutionality of an injunction to stop gang
activity by the defendants.  The defendants were found to have
been part of two street gangs, the &quot;Varrio Surreno Treces&quot;
(VST) and &quot;Varrio Surreno Locos&quot; (VSL), that maintained
a reign of terror in the community of Rocksprings, a neighborhood
in San Jose. The City obtained an injunction to abate these activities
as a public nuisance. The state appellate court, however, struck
down many provisions of the injunction as a violation of the gang
members' First Amendment rights, WLF argued that the First Amendment
did not forbid an injunction to limit the congregating of known
gang members.

<h3>Heritage Foundation Balanced Budget Talking Points</h3>
<P></center>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi69.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #1</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,</b> by William Beach and John Barry. <BR>

<P>
See Taxation &amp; Budget page 6, 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#69)<BR>

<P>
<li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi76.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #2</a>: <b>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes? </b> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
Beach points out that there are three major reasons why adopting
capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balance Budget Act
of 1995 will benefit nearly every American. First, the benefits
of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income
tax-payers rather than to the wealthy. Second, economists who
have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget
while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains
tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread
economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy.
And third, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would
increase tax revenues from tax-payers who own most appreciated
assets. 4 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#76)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi77.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #3</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Family College Costs,</b>
by John Barry <BR>

<P>
Among Barry's findings, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress
would mean the following: American families, over time, could
save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund
college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax
credit; and an average student could save more than $414 over
the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest
rates. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #77)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi75.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #4</a>: <b>The $500-per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage For a Typical American Family</b>
by Scott Hodge <BR>

<P>
Scott Hodge, Heritage Foundation Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs,
points out that a $500 tax cut for each child in working families
is not an insignificant amount of money, as many liberals believe.
Hodge shows that this tax cut would pump over $22 billion per
year into family budgets across the country. According to Hodge
millions of families will benefit, and Congress's $500-per-child
tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5
million taxpayers caring for 8.7 children. 19 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>
#75)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi78.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #5</a>: <b>Clinton's $300-per-Child Tax Cut Plan Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children,</b> by Scott Hodge<BR>

<P>
Hodge shows that the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by President Clinton
on December 6th (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children
in families earning up to $110,000) compared with Clinton's budget
(with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent
children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000)
would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with
children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the
$300 child tax credit under the Clinton plan. 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>
#78)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi79.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #6</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Current and Future Retirees,</b>
by John Barry
<P>
Barry has found that under the congressional balanced budget plan
current retirees would gain additional after-tax income from a
reduction in the capital gains tax; and retirees have a significant
increase in real purchasing power over the next ten years due
to decreased inflation. Future retirees would benefit under the
Congressional proposal with the proposed &quot;super IRA&quot;
compared with saving the same amount in a conventional IRA; a
young couple raising one newborn child could save significantly
for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit,
while a young couple buying a home could save more for their retirement
from decreased monthly mortgage payments. 6 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>
#79)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi80.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #7</a>: <b>What Congress's Balanced Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Housing,</B> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
According to an econometric analysis by William Beach, adoption
of the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to: 104,000 additional housing
starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002; new
or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans; a drop in mortgage
interests rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about
$10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage
purchased under current budget and tax law; and a 4 percent drop
in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases
in the cost of capital and lower interests rates), with the value
of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the
growing demand for new homes. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #80)

<title>November Insider - "On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court - Heritage Foundation</title>

<h2>November <i>Insider</i>: On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court</h2></center><p>
by Roger Clegg, Vice President, National Legal Center for the Public Interest  <br>
<hr>
<br>


Following its usual practice, the Supreme Court commenced its new term on the first Monday in October. Decisions in the cases argued before the Court should be handed down before the 1995-96 term is completed at the end of next June. Here is a brief overview of the cases to watch.
<P>
One of the most controversial cases is Romer v. Evans, where a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring protected status for homosexuals is being challenged as a denial of "equal protection of the laws," in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. When the case was argued last month, the Colorado official defending the law got a chilly reception from the Court. But it can be risky to predict a case's outcome based only on how the oral argument goes.
<P>
Another case that was recently argued is BMW of North America Incorporated v. Gore, which spotlights out-of-control jury damage awards. An Alabama jury awarded $4 million to a doctor who complained about his new car's paint job. The state supreme court cut it back to "only" $2 million, which understandably enough did not satisfy the defendant. The Court has taken a number of punitive damage cases in recent years, but has yet to offer clear guidance to the lower courts on how to tell when an award is unconstitutionally "excessive."
<P>
Last term the Court handed down a number of important civil rights cases, most of them conservative victories, as a slender majority of the justices insisted that racial preferences of all kinds be given strict scrutiny. This term's most important cases in this category_Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera_involve voting rights, and in particular the practice of drawing district boundaries with an eye toward "politically correct" racial outcomes. With the Clinton administration committed to racial preferences, and Congress so far unwilling to act, the Court appears to be the only branch of the federal government willing to resist racial balkanization.
Another important civil rights case, which the Court just recently 
agreed to hear, is United States v. Virginia. This is the "VMI case," challenging the constitutionality of single sex, state-run military academies, namely the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. This controversy drew a great deal of attention last summer when Shannon Faulkner briefly attended the Citadel.
<P>
Two other cases likely to generate publicity are Bennis v. Michigan, in which a wife is challenging the forfeiture of the family car when her husband used it to pick up a prostitute, and Lewis v. Casey, in which Arizona's state-prison libraries were ordered by a federal judge to provide inmates with a variety of amenities. Bennis is important because law-enforcement agencies have been very aggressive recently in using forfeiture laws, especially against drug dealers. Lewis provides the Court with a chance to cut back on the federal judiciary's micromanagement of state prison systems_just as it cut back on its micromanagement of school systems last term in Missouri v. Jenkins.
<P>
Other important cases which the Supreme Court will hear this year involve Indian gambling casinos, whether there is a jury-trial right in patent cases, claims against the manufacturers of Agent Orange, whether the federal census illegally undercounted members of minority groups, the First Amendment implication of limits on liquor advertising, the extent to which some computer software can be copyrighted, the sentencing in the Rodney King case, and whether telephone companies can be prevented by the federal government from getting into the cable television business.
<P>
Finally, keep in mind that the Court has so far scheduled relatively few cases to be heard this term, even considering the fact that its docket has shrunk dramatically from just a few years ago. Consequently, the Court is expected to add quite a few cases to its agenda over the next few weeks and months.

<b>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</b><br>
by David J. Armor, Oxford University Press (1995)
<P>
In his new book, <i>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</i> (Oxford University Press), David J. Armor, Research Professor at the Institute of Public Policy at George Mason University, offers his readers a thoroughly professional overview of one of the most controversial areas of public policies of the last forty years -- school desegregation. A conservative, Armor writes in a non-threatening, academic style that allows him to tread in controversial academic waters and reach conservative conclusions without scaring away the ideologically liberal reader. One suspects that even the most defiant apologist of forced busing and race-conscious education policies will, upon reading this book, be forced to admit that the world is a more complicated place than it appeared to be in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Brown undoubtedly contributed to the sea change in popular opinion on racial issues in this country, as illustrated by polling data that shows the steady upward movement in the percentage of whites who believe that black and white students should attend the same schools -- from about one-third in 1942 to 95 percent in 1990. But the decision also legitimized one of the most pernicious legal developments of our time, the judicial use of social science theory in deciding important constitutional law cases. In this case, the Court accepted the questionable "harm and benefit" thesis, which Armor defines as the notion that: 
<P><bq>
"school desegregation is harmful to the social, psychological, and educational development of children, both minority and white, and that school desegregation is beneficial for undoing or at least ameliorating the damages from segregation and discrimination." 

</bq><P>
Have the last four decades been kind to this thesis? After an exhaustive review of the research literature, Armor concludes that academic achievement among blacks is most strongly related, not to whether the student sits in a desegregated classroom, but to the "educational and economic characteristics" of his family and even to federal compensatory programs such as the Chapter 1 program. Armor also summarizes the research findings on the question of whether desegregation enhances black self-esteem, another key element of the harm and benefit thesis, and concludes: 
<P>
The research on black self-esteem over the past thirty years not only fails to support the harm and benefit thesis, then, but indeed seems to turn the thesis on its head. First, school segregation appears not to harm self-esteem of black students in the first place...and in many cases segregated black students have higher self-esteem than white students. Second, desegregation not only fails to improve black self-esteem but may in fact <b>lower it</b>. (emphasis added)
<P>
If, in 1954, the Court had resisted the temptation to substitute shaky social science for sound constitutional principles, how many young schoolchildren, both black and white, might have been spared those long and painful bus rides to distant schools to fulfill the social engineer's dream of perfect racial integration in the schools?  
<P>
What does the research literature tell us about whether whites abandon public school systems that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans, the so-called phenomena of "white flight"? As Armor describes it, in 1975 social scientists began to suspect that "desegregation was accelerating white flight above and beyond that caused by other demographic processes." Armor himself conducted a comprehensive study of fifty-four court-ordered plans and found:
<P><bq>
"In central-city school districts with higher percentages of black enrollment, I found mandatory busing to raise white loss rates by three to five times that due to underlying demographic processes...[T]his study estimated that over a five-year period about half of the total white enrollment loss was due to the busing plans and the other half was due to normal demographic processes such as declining birth rates and net out-migration rates."
</bq><P>
Armor suggests that inconvenience, rather than racial prejudice, may account for much of this result: "the highest no-show rate is for Los Angeles, which had the longest average busing distance of any of the plans [55 minutes for a one-way bus ride]." Elsewhere, he points to data that parents weigh the quality of the individual school, rather than race, most heavily before deciding to move their children to other schools.
<P>
Try as he might to present both sides of a rather complicated argument, Armor nonetheless leaves the reader feeling quite frustrated with the current state of affairs, both politically and in the courts.
<P>
Thanks to David Armor, we now have a better understanding of the strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of school desegregation.

The House-Senate Conference Should Agree to Rapid Deployment of Missle Defenses</b>, by Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder No. 1054, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Baker Spring, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, recommends that the members of the House and Senate military oversight committees who make up the conference committee should not settle for a weak bill that postpones deployment or takes the US ballistic missile defense program down a dead-end road. Spring recommends the committee adopt the following in order to send a clear message to the administration: deploy affordable and highly effective theater missile defense systems as soon as possible; deploy at the earliest possible date an affordable and highly effective national missile defense system that can be augmented to provide a layered defense; and improve existing cruise missile defense capabilities. This paper includes an appendix detailing recommended changes to the House and Senate versions of the bill as well as outling recommended goals for the conference committee, broken down into the following areas: statements of policy; theater missile defense; national missile defense; the future of the ABM Treay; interpreting the ABM Treaty; reporting requirements; and funding for missile defense. 11 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Mexico: Policy Failure, Moral Hazard, and Market Solutions, </b>by W. Lee Hoskins and James W. Coons<br>

Policy Analysis No. 243, Cato Institute
<P>
Lee Hoskins and James Coons, respectively the CEO and vice president of the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, point out that for the fourth time in the past 20 years, the Mexican economy is in financial distress, largely due to the poor monetary policies pursued by Mexican officials. The authors suggest that the consistent American practice of lending money to the Mexican government has created a set of perverse incentives which ensure the "crisis" will reappear on an even larger scale. Hoskins and Coons suggest that the best course for the future is to encourage market forces, stronger private property rights, price stability, and a floating exchange rate for the peso. The authors write, "The United States should pass legislation that eliminates the Treasury's ability to make foreign loans and that removes the ability of the Federal Reserve to extend credit to foreign central banks directly or indirectly by funding the Exchange Stabilization Fund." 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Ukraine: Back from the Brink, </b> by Taras Kuzio
<br>
European Security Study No. 23, Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<P>
Taras Kuzio, research fellow for the Centre for Russian and East European studies at the University of Birmingham, argues that Ukraine, more so than any other former Soviet Republic, was left with one of the most difficult legacies. According to the author, Ukraine is divided between an eastern region with a large population of Russian speakers and culture and a western area in which traditional Ukrainian language and culture predominate. Kuzio presents his analysis of the tenure of the Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk and describes his efforts to handle the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, stressing reconciliation and consensus and thus avoiding ethnic tension and social instability. The author then presents a look at how the new president, Leonid Kuchma, has been able to address the problems that Kravchuk did not deal with effectively: economic and social stagnation and an increasing drift in Ukrainian foreign policy. The latter half of this paper addresses three lingering problems for Ukraine: 1) the building of a truly democratic political system is still inhibited by electoral apathy and the weakness of political parties; 2) while regional tensions have abated, the evolution of a generally accepted Ukrainian identity will be necessary; and 3) progress towards the settlement of the Crimean issue and Ukraine's general security might  be threatened by a more aggressively nationalistic Russian leader in the future. Kuzio concludes, "Western support for an independent Ukraine confident within its borders will ensure European security and stability at a crucial moment in the post-soviet transition process." 37 pp. CONTACT: Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, W1P 3FP ENGLAND, 0171-637-2152, or fax 0171-637-2155.

America's Stake in Hong Kong, </b> by Brett C. Lippencott
<br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 137, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Brett Lippencott, policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that the strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's October legislative elections is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Lippencott demonstrates that Hong Kong is America's 12th largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion. The paper maintains that the US has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Lippencott suggests the following conditions of the Basic Law which Beijing must respect after 1997: continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity; the existence of a free market; commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press; preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service; the rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties; maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

How to Close Down the Department of Labor</b> by Mark Wilson
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1058, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Luken's Fellow in Labor Policy, reveals that the Department of Labor has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government.  Wilson advocates closing this Cabinet-level department and moving key national functions to sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Wilson recommends that Congress take the following steps: 1) devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance Services to the states; 2) consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant; 3) consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant; 4) reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 5) transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration; 6) repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations; 7) combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau in a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics; and 8) close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (striker replacement). Wilson writes, "The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. The primary objectives of this effort should be: reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety, and improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employee protections." 29 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Saying Goodbye When the Job is Done: The Coming Privatization of Government-Sponsored Enterprises, </b>by Thomas H. Stanton
<br>
IPI Policy Report No. 133, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Tom Stanton, a fellow of the Center for the Study of American Government at the Johns Hopkins University, states that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae pose a needless $1.5 trillion liability to taxpayers and should be privatized. Stanton writes, "Today, Farmer Mac is requesting changes to its charter that would increase taxpayer risk, and give it advantage over its private competitors. As proven by the Savings and Loan debacle, such massive taxpayer liabilities are not risk-free." The report addresses the individual situations of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and the Farm Credit System. Stanton concludes that, if the GSEs are not privatized, the taxpayer liability of GSEs will continue to grow at a rapid rate, and will only add to the total hidden taxpayer liability that lurks beyond the national debt. 22 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Archer Daniels Midland: A Case Study in Corporate Welfare</b>, by James Bovard
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 241, Cato Institute
<P>
James Bovard, an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, reveals that the Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been one of the most prominent recipients of corporate welfare in recent years, funding both political parties with millions of dollars of handouts in return for billion dollar windfalls from taxpayers and consumers. Bovard writes, "Thanks to federal protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies, subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period." This paper demonstrates how ADM has received at least 43 percent of its annual profits from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Bovard puts these figures in perspective with the current debate over corporate welfare, examining the dynamics of corporate welfare by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such "rent seeking," and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the political life of a nation. 48 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Constraints Upon Privatization: A Case Study of the Israeli Experience, </b> by Avi Naider
<br>
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
Avi Naider provides a short history of the rise of state-owned enterprises throughout the world in the post-World War II era, and the general trend of governments subsequently to divest themselves of those interests. Naider then presents a case study of privatization efforts in Israel, an example of an advanced industrial country which has generally failed to meet its own goals and standards, according to the author. This paper suggests that the most significant constraints on Israel's privatization program have been political and social, and, although technical constraints have contributed to delays, they are unable to account for the fact that despite the government's stated commitment to privatization, the number of state owned enterprises in the 1990s have actually increased. Naider probes several obstacles to reform: 1) Israel's fragmented and contentious political system; 2) the maneuvering of ministers and bureaucrats to "protect their turf;" 3) the power of the country's federated labor union; 4) the preoccupation with national security; and 5) the country's socialist legacy. To further illustrate Israel's unique experience, a chapter is dedicated to a case study of Israel Chemicals, Ltd., a pivotal divesture failure. 68 pp. CONTACT: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Beit Milken, 13 Tel Hal Street, Jerusalem  92107, ISRAEL, fax 972-2-619112.

Metropolitan Economic Development in Wisconsin</b>
<br>
Report Vol. 8, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
This report, developed by the Urban Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, examines the impact of the recent economic growth in Wisconsin's largest metropolitan areas. The report, which uses jobs data from the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, reveals several significant trends: Kenosha expands by creating jobs through small compaies, while its neighbor, Racine, remains stagnant; metropolitan Milwaukee continues to develop jobs, but at a slower rate than other large metropolitan areas; and smaller areas are experiencing a far more significant rate of job creation than the larger metropolitan areas. This report analyzes which industries grew most rapidly, whether single-site employers added more employment than establishments associated with multiple-site employers, whether existing employers are universally responsible for most employment gains in all regions, how important to overall growth employers are that added large numbers of employees, which size employer added the most employees, whether suburban areas are growing at the expense of the central cities, how much firm migration is occurring, and what are the earnings patterns. 32 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 N.

FDA Hazards: How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy, </b> by Raymond J. Keating

Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Foundation, reveals that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has generally been held in high regard by Americans, has recently squandered much of this goodwill. At the cost of the consumer, the FDA, according to Keating, has stifled growth in many areas, including entrepreneurial medical devices, vitamins, and foods. Keating recommends bold reforms for the FDA: 1) the FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education; 2) efficacy should be left to the marketplace; 3) manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system; 4) FDA bans on information about off-label uses of drugs should be lifted; 5) the US should negatiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals; and 6) incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need to be enhanced. 25pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 Eighteenth Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238.

Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America? </b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1055, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, McKenna senior fellow in political economy at The Heritage Foundation, analyzes and grades the six current proposals for major tax reform: the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Specter flat tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax. Mitchell evaluates the tax proposals on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly. This paper concludes that the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution senior fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest; direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. 16 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Eating Out Our Substance: How Taxation Affects Saving, </b> by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<br>
Policy Report No. 131, The Institute for Policy Innovation in cooperation with Center for the New West
<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin senior research fellow at IPI, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley senior research fellow at IPI, find that in order to stimulate economic growth by increasing private savings, America's tax policy must be changed to remove the penalties on saving and investment. This report confirms that America's private saving rate has declined precipitously in recent years: between 1947 and 1994, private savings averaged 12.9 percent of aftertax income; today the savings rate hovers around 7 percent. The authors report that there is a significant historical relationship between the private saving rate and the tax treatment of capital: specifically, a 10 percent increase in the aftertax rate of return to capital will result in a 7-11 percent increase in saving. The authors conclude that reducing the difference between average and marginal tax rates will reduce the adverse effect of taxes on the economy, and moving to a system that ends the multiple taxation of capital will lead to higher rates of saving, labor productivity, and economic growth. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax, </b> by Stephen Moore and John Silvia
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 242, Cato Institute
<P>
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, and John Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, examine the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the finding of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. The authors conclude that a capital gains tax cut would: 1) substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich; 2) increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation throughout the year 2000; 3) unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital; and 4) expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities. Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient_because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment_that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Stephen Smith, an economist with the Institute for the Research on the Economics of Taxation, suggests that repealing or at least raising the Social Security earnings limit would produce important benefits, including simplifying the tax code, lowering administrative costs, and greater choices for the elderly. Smith explains that, "even if the impact on the federal budget is negative, this concern is overbalanced by the tredmendous benefits to be had from this reform and can be alleviatedby other minor adjustments to benefit computation rules."

Rumsfeld makes five suggestions: 1) define the core business of the federal government; 2) cut sharply and rapidly; 3) eliminate bureaucracies; 4) redesign the organizational chart, eliminating non-central departments that are no longer needed; and 5) avoid micromanaging. Rumsfeld then recommends three proposals for Congress: 1) stop giving members of Congress credit for pork; 2) privatize where possible; and 3) sell under-utilized assets. 12 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palatine, IL  60067, 708/202-3060.

Stress Claims in Michigan: Worker's Compensation Entitlement for Mental Disability</b>, by Jurgen Skoppek
<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy
<P>
Jurgen Skoppek, an appeals judge on the Michigan Worker's Compensation Appellate Commission, explains that the worker's compensation system was developed as a way for workers who suffer on-the-job physical injuries to be compensated fairly and quickly for medical expenses and loss of income. In recent years, according to the author, it has expanded into a new area fraught with vagueness: mental stress. While this report focuses on Michigan, which has been in the forefront among states in mental stress claims, its searching analysis of the inherent difficulty in evaluating these claims may have implications throughout the country. 36 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

A Taxpayer's Guide to the Medicare Crisis</b>, by John C. Liu and Robert E. Moffitt
<br>
Heritage Talking Points, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Liu, Heritage Foundation policy analyst for health care, and Robert Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies at Heritage, provide insight into the search for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program into a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. This report examines the inherent flaws in the current system, revealing that from its inception, the current Medicare system encouraged central planning and price controls, bureaucracy and red tape, and government standardized benefits. Liu and Moffitt offer readers ammunition to the complicated questions that result from reforming the Medicare system in terms of funding and benefits for the elderly. The report also addresses questions of how reform will affect doctors and competition for services. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Improving Medicare: Nine Ways the House Medicare Bill Does It, </b> by John S. Tottie
<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, writes, "The Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 proposed by the House leadership provides just what President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare program recently called for, `prompt, effective, and decisive action' to save Medicare." Tottie lists the following nine aspects of the House plan as major improvements in the Medicare plan: 1) the plan saves Medicare from bankruptcy by reducing the rate of spending increases; 2) it offers many private-sector alternatives, including medical savings accounts; 3) it would make it possible to provide more benefits at no extra cost; 4) it would allow beneficiaries to limit their out-of-pocket spending; 5) it allows insurers to offer beneficiaries financial incentives to spend wisely; 6) it  reduces fraud, waste, and abuse in several different ways; 7) it reduces government subsidies to Medicare recipients who do not need them; 8) it reduces unnecessary bureacracy and high administrative costs; and 9) it enable beneficiaries to escape the rationing in government-run Medicare. The author contends the House plan results in a "win-win" proposition: a better Medicare system for beneficiaries and increased savings for taxpayers. 9 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

Let Florida's Churches Sponsor Our Schools, </b> by Patrick Heffernan

Outside the Lines No. 2, Foundation for Florida's Future

Patrick Heffernan, executive director of the Archdiocesan Education Foundation in Miami, contends that there is a balance to be struck between religious intitutions and public life and that the separation of church and state has hurt schools, churches and families. Heffernan supports allowing churches to operate, in a non-sectarian manner, local schools, if chosen in an local election to do so.

Recasting the Safety Net: An Evaluation of Proposals for Welfare Reform, </b>by Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder

IPI Policy Report No. 132, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder, both professors at Ohio University, suggest that as the legislative conferees work out the differences on a welfare reform bill to send to the president, they should highlight a comparison between the House Republican plan and last year's plan from the Administration. According to the authors, the conferees should highlight the following issues: total expenditures, work requirements, teen-age illegitimacy, the entitlement mentality, perverse additional incentives, and shifting power to the states. Gallaway and Vedder write, "Any welfare reform must take a hard line against autopilot spending increases, the entrenched Federal bureaucracy, and teen-age illegitimacy.

Restructuring Medicare: A Long-Term Plan to Save the Medicare Program, </b> by Mark E. Litow and Peter G. Hendee
<br>
Council for Affordable Health Insurance
<P>
Mark Litow, consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson, Inc., and Peter Hendee, consulting actuary for Odell and Associates, developed a plan that would save the Medicare program for those beneficiearies who want to remain in the system and, at the same time, offer an array of choices to those who want other choices. Under this plan, individuals would have to choose between the Medicare program and a private voucher system. For those who choose to opt out of the Medicare program, the voucher amounts could be used to purchase private health insurance coverage such as a managed care plan, a medical savings account (MSA), or any new product the market develops. Any remaining voucher balance would be deposited into an MSA and the balance could be withdrawn to pay for routine medical care, or saved for long-term care expenses. This plan would produce a savings of $297 billion over the next seven years and meets the FY 1996 Budget Resolution reducing Medicare spending growth by $270 billion over seven years. 30 pp. CONTACT: Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 112 S.

The Endangered Species Act: A Train Wreck Ahead, </b> by Thomas Lambert

Center for the Study of American Business
<P>
Thomas Lambert, adjunct research assistant at the Center for the Study of American Business, writes that without major reform of the Endangered Species Act, land use conflicts between regulators and property owners will only increase in frequency. Lambert finds the number of listed endangered domestic species will likely grow from 962 to more than 3,000 in the coming years_due to the listing of subspecies, or "bugs and slugs"_further restricting development on private land. Lambert proposes that regulators should: a) compensate landowners whose property is devalued through the Act's restrictions; b) mandate minimum scientific standards for endangered species listing decisions; and c) limit protection to "full-fledged" species. 24 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuses, </b> by Jonathan Tolman
<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Jonathan Tolman, environmental policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that environmentalists have overlooked one of the largest sources of water pollution: agricultural runoff. Tolman states that agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nation's rivers, streams, and lakes. The author argues that the farm programs, developed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers, and modern farming techniques, have had and continue to have detrimental effects on the environment. Tolman cites damage to the Everglades from the US sugar program and damage to peanut crops from the USDA peanut program. The author concludes, "Overall, consumers, taxpayers, and the environment would be better off under a free market agricultural policy. Direct and indirect payments to farmers should be eliminated and all supply control programs should be ended." 16 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 1250, Washington, DC  20036, 202/331-1010.

Going Against the Flow: The Case for Competition in Solid Waste Management, </b> by Angela Logomasini

Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy

Angela Logomasini, adjunct analyst with Citizens for a Sound Economy, asserts that local governments' imposition of solid waste flow control_the practice of mandating that trash haulers dispose of waste at government designated facilities_creates monopoly providers of waste disposal services within a community. Logomasini demonstrates how such economic protectionism in the waste management industry has imposed huge costs on consumers, taxpayers, and the economy in general, while reducing innovation and subsidizing inefficient enterprises. The paper states that despite evidnce to the contrary, Congress is considering legislation that would bolster such laws. Logomasini advocates, "promoting a competitive system that allows the industry to seek the lowest cost options and operate efficiently." 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

CIR Challenges Racial Quotas at UT Law School</b>

The Center is representing non-minority applicants to the University of Texas Law School in the first substantive constitutional challenge to racial preferences in student admission since Board of Regents v. Bakke (1978). In August 1994, a federal district judge in Austin, Texas held that certain aspects of the law school's admission process were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the consideration of minority applicants by a separate minority admissions subcommittee deprived the plaintiffs of equal protection of the law. The court also noted in dicta that separate cut-off scores for minority applicants violated the equal protection clause. However, the court failed to award meaningful monetary or injunctive relief and the case is now pending on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

In response to the residents' constitutionally protected activities of publishing articles and circulating a newsletter explaining the problems with the project, HUD unleashed a lengthy investigation of the residents' activities. At one point, HUD offered to close the investigation in return for the residents' agreement not to engage in similar activities in the future.

CIR Wins Sex Discrimination Appeal Before 4th Circuit</b>

The school justified this special salary increase for women by pointing to the results of an internal "Salary Equity Study" which indicated that women made $1,900 per year less, on average, than men if one fails to take into account such factors as teaching performance, publications, teaching load, and service to the community. Last year, the U.S. District Court in Richmond granted summary judgment to VCU and dismissed the case in the eve of trial. However, on August 24, 1995, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision and ruled that the case should be heard by a jury.

NELF to Help Immigrant Workers in New Hampshire</b>
<br>
NELF will represent a group of New Hampshire women who sew garments in their homes. The Department of Labor (DOL) says these women are "employees" not "independent contractors." If DOL wins, these women will lose their jobs.
The case involves Gale River Designs ("Gale River"), a small clothing maker, located in Franconia, N.H. which makes garments for catalogue retailers such as Orvis and Motherwear. Gale River employs about 20 to 25 people at its offices and factory. In addition to 8 to 10 in-house workers, it contracts out sewing to about 16 at-home "sewers" in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Gale River ships unassembled pieces to the sewers who finish the garments and ship them back to Gale River. Sewers are paid on a piece-work basis. They estimate that their compensation works out to $12-15 per hour spent sewing, well above minimum wage. Most are women, some refugees, who simply cannot work outside the home because they live in remote locations or care for small children or elderly relatives. Home work for Gale River is their only employment option.
After a lengthy investigation DOL charged Gale River with $38,000 in minimum wage and overtime violations. If DOL succeeds, Gale River's costs will increase and it will have to use only in-house sewers. That will mean unemployment and a return to poverty for the sewers.

 NELF Brief Supports WalMart's Right to Enter Vermont</b>
<br>
NELF is filing an amicus brief with the Vermont Supreme Court challenging the Vermont Environmental Board's rejection of an application to construct a new WalMart in St. Albans, Vermont. The Board overruled local approvals of the project in order to impose on St. Albans its view of how the local economy should grow.
WalMart has secured a site in St. Albans already zoned for commercial use. It has obtained all required state and local permits, except the one required by ACT 250, Vermont's strict land use law. The citizens of St. Albans voted 7-1 in favor of WalMart in a recent, non-binding referendum. Nonetheless the state Environmental Board denied WalMart the needed Act 250 permit. The Board's main objection to WalMart is that the new store would have a negative "net economic impact." The Board credited two economists' testimony that WalMart's superior service and prices would cause the failure of nearby retailers. WalMart vigorously contests that projection. Even if true, that kind of impact is not within the Board's mandate nor is it a decision a state-wide agency should be making.
The Environmental Board was created to weight traditional environmental issues like wetlands or endangered species. By rejecting WalMart, the Board is seeking to transform itself into a super economic planning agency. Without any statutory authority, the Board wants the power to decide a new business is "negative" and bar it. NELF's brief will rebut the Board's right to impose its views on the local community. The people of St. Albans can use their zoning and planning powers to select the mix of large and small stores they want in the town. They have decided in favor of WalMart and the Board has no business second-guessing that decision.

 Court of Appeals Decides Preseault Case</b>
<br>
After almost two years of deliberation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. decided Paul Preseault's precedent-setting "takings" case. By a 2-1 vote, with a very strong dissent, the court held that Mr. Preseault was not entitled to compensation from the United States for the federal approval of a bike trail over an abandoned railroad line across his Vermont property.
The court relied on a 1920 law which, it held, put purchasers on notice that federal law might "someday" be changed to allow such conversions. Since trains continued to run over the Preseaults' land for 55 years after the 1920 act, the court seems to be, as the dissent put it, attempting to duck the constitutional issue. When this case was last in the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Mr. Preseault was entitled to compensation. NELF is drafting a petition to return the case to the Court, the only forum where the appeals court's error can be corrected.

Tight Restrictions Sought on LSC-Funded Representation in Drug Evictions</b>
<br>
In one city after another, efforts by public housing managers to stop drug dealing and drug abuse in low-income housing projects have repeatedly been frustrated by federally-funded legal services attorneys, who have used the courts to prevent evictions of tenants engaged in drug activity. In response to a recent Legal Services Corporation proposal to restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to represent public housing tenants who are being evicted for drug activity, WLF argued that the LSC's proposal did not go nearly far enough. WLF pointed out that the proposal would prohibit such representations only in cases where (1) an actual criminal prosecution for drug activity has been initiated, (2) the particular drug activity forming the basis of the prosecution threatened the health or safety of public housing residents or workers, and (3) the leaseholder is the person being prosecuted, not another member of the leaseholder's household (such as a relative or boyfriend). WLF argued that these limitations should be removed from the proposed rule because they make the overall prohibition essentially toothless.

OSHA has created a powerful barrier to such initiatives by failing to recognize a privilege of confidentiality for employers' self-critical audits of workplace conditions. The petition also points out that OSHA has extensive record-keeping requirements and inspection powers with which to identify violations, without the need to deter self-evaluations.

<h2>October <i>Insider</i>: Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</h2></center><p>
by Rick Dearborn, Director of Congressional Relations, U.S. Senate at The Heritage Foundation<br>
<hr>
<br>

Last week the U.S. Senate passed a welfare reform package that was solid on creating strong work requirements, but was weaker than the House of Representatives' version on the debate over curtailing the rampant illegitimacy rate. Both bills will now go to a conference, possibly lasting well into November, between both houses in order to iron out the differences.
Unless the Senate accedes to the House on its provisions denying additional monies to teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children, the bill that comes out of conference is likely to do little to discourage illegitimacy. On the flip side of the coin, it will be in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer for the House to adopt the Senate's position on work requirements for able-bodied individuals on the public dole. <P>
The Senate provisions on work contain an important provision not currently found in the House bill, known as pay for performance.This provision states that welfare recipients may not receive their direct cash benefits until completing the work requirements. Under current law, if welfare recipients worked 80 percent of their required hours there would be no commensurate reduction in benefits. Special hearings to bring hours paid in line with hours worked nearly always favor the welfare recipients. The Senate bill does away with this problem by forcing welfare workers to do their work first and then be paid on the basis of how many hours they have completed. The House bill lacks the same commitment to stricter work requirements.<P>
Despite efforts by Senators Faircloth, Gramm, and Ashcroft, the Senate welfare reform package did not incorporate House reforms intended to ameliorate the problems of illegitimacy (many of which were first proposed by Heritage senior analyst Robert Rector). These three Senators fought hard for the inclusion of many of their bill's provisions. Among the amendments offered by the Faircloth/Gramm/Ashcroft team, expected to be issues in the conference committee, were policy proposals to cut off additional funds for teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children out-of-wedlock; provisions to deny only federal funds, not state funds, to minor mothers who are currently eligible to receive direct cash benefits in the mail or down at the social welfare center on the condition that they have children out-of-wedlock; a provision known as the illegitimacy ratio, that would provide an additional block grant to reward those states who curtail their ever-rising illegitimacy rate without increasing the rate of abortions within their state; and applying a four-day a-month work requirement to single, able-bodied males who currently receive food stamps and do not do any work.<P>
Although the illegitimacy ratio was adopted in the Senate bill, and a modified amendment regarding work requirements for food stamp recipients offered by Senator Jesse Helms was accepted, the denial of federal cash benefits to unwed teenagers, and the denial of federal cash benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have additional children (family cap) were not accepted by the U.S. Senate. <P>
The House conferees will be fighting to include their family cap provision. The Senate appointees appear unlikely to support the family cap but are likely to fight for stricter versions of workfare.<P>
 
Because of the many contentious items in both the House and Senate bills, the key to getting a strong reform proposal will be the appointment of conferees to the welfare Conference Committee. The House leadership plans to appoint members who are strong on both the work and illegitimacy issues. If Senator Dole places reform-minded individuals committed to solving America's welfare dilemma on the conference committee, he will help ensure that the end result will be a solid welfare reform package.

October <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review<p>
</h2>
<i>By Corinne T. Coldwell</i><br>
<hr>

<b>Fatherless America</b>, by David Blankenhorn<br>
234 pp. BasicBooks, 1995
<P>
In <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn does not just list the repercussions of an ever-widening void of fathers in this country, he explains in frightening detail how society now regards fathers as superfluous. America  now has a society where the nuclear family is a rarity and divorce and single motherhood are commonplace. Now, children of fragmented families represent today's young generation. And unless this trend is reversed, nothing will repair the damage of fatherlessness. No amount of economic growth, welfare reform, prison construction, or school reform can cure the deeply rooted problems of male violence and lack of child well-being. Domestic policy reforms will fail when enacted upon a weak family structure. What can be done to restore and encourage strong two-parent families? Blankenhorn first discusses how the choices Americans made over the last few decades have denigrated traditional fatherhood. Then he elaborates on how these often selfish choices have not only affected society's perception of fatherhood, but have made them acceptable -- if not ideal. <P>

According to Blankenhorn, the fatherless crisis began during and after World War II when draft quotas could no longer be filled by only single men and married men without children. The Selective Service had to turn to fathers (approximately 6 million men) to fulfill their needs. During the war years,  fathers left home out of duty and loyalty to their country, and their memories were kept alive in a more positive light. Today's fathers, however, are largely absent from the home by choice. When fathers die due to illness or are killed at war their presence still looms over their children. The 1940s child could say: "My father had to leave for a while to do something important." The 1990s child must say: "My father left me permanently because he wanted to." This fatherless crisis did have  negative effects on the family, because many men came home feeling ill-prepared for fatherhood (in some cases the children were born while they were away) and many women had to find work in factories in order to survive. These circumstances sometimes led to tensions in the home, separation, or divorce. But this was only the first tier of problems that brought us to our situation today. The second fatherless crisis is more of "an unorganized dispersal of men for private purposes, regrettable but acceptable."<P>

Blankenhorn gives analysis of several types of fathers as viewed in academia and described by the media: the Deadbeat Dad, the Visiting Father, the Sperm Father, the Stepfather, and the Nearby Guy. Mr. Blankenhorn devotes the most insightful evaluation of the deadbeat dad in the wake of his notorious villain status in society that began in the late 1980s. Yet, as Blankenhorn points out, the deadbeat dad is really a caricature of the traditional male role. Even though he is absent, he is expected to be a provider. However, the new father (the cultural experts' ideal father) repudiates the traditional male role because he is more concerned about being a partner than worrying about monetary gain for his family. The descriptions of the new father and the deadbeat dad, as defined by the scholars and perpetuated in the media, obviously contradict one another. The distinct message coming from the "wanted: deadbeat dads" signs is that absent fathers can still be fathers as long as they write the checks. The deadbeat  dad is essentially the unnecessary father who refuses to pay. And "from the child's perspective, child-support payments, even if fully paid, do not replace a father's economic provision. More fundamentally, they do not replace a father." The necessity to hunt for deadbeat dads is tragic. What is even worse is the fact that we just want their money, not everything else that fatherhood provides for children. The money will allow for some things the children need and places they want to go, but only mothers and fathers can help shape children's character.<P>

 The danger in the status quo is making these lowered standards permanent. Mr. Blankenhorn illustrates that defeatist attempts to solve the problems of single motherhood lack an understanding of the root causes of fatherlessness in this country. The most important aspect of parenthood, "development of competence and character in children," needs to be understood first before any policy is initiated. One parent cannot do that alone: "If fatherhood has anything to say to men, it is that human completion is not a solo act."<P>

Blankenhorn offers a dozen initiatives to help inject the value of fatherhood back into communities. He suggests: the President should give an annual report on the state of fatherhood; communities should ask married fathers play a part in transforming public housing; Congress should pass a resolution stating that the first question of policymakers regarding all domestic legislation is whether it will strengthen or weaken the institution of marriage; well-known professional athletes could be drafted to promote the virtues of fatherhood; and prominent family scholars could write new textbooks for high school students about marriage and parenthood. Blankenhorn admits that his proposals are not answers, but attempts to ask a new question: "Does our society wish to recover the fatherhood idea?" If the answer is no, then proposals like his will go nowhere. But if the answer is yes, then his proposals will at the very least lead us  away from "a culture of fatherlessness" to a culture of fatherhood.<P>

<b>Dirty Tricks or Trump Card: US Covert Action and Counterintelligence</b><br>
 by Roy Godson<br>
National Strategy Information Center, Inc.<P>
Roy Godson, professor of government at Georgetown University, contends that covert operations are the missing element in the discussions about the future of US intelligence. Godson traces the history of US covert action and counterintelligence as well as its successes and failures. This volume suggests that the potential uses of covert action and counterintelligence amid new security challenges have rarely been discussed. Godson states that, although controversial, covert operations can be seen as simply one among many instruments of foreign policy_that they are neither "exceptional tools nor magic bullets." 342 pp. CONTACT: Kelley Beagher, Brassey's, 1313 Dolly Madison Blvd., Suite 401, McLean, VA 22101, 703/442-4535,  fax 703/442-9848.

<b>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</b><br>
 by Joe Cobb<br>
Backgrounder No. 1049, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Joe Cobb, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in economics, notes that the 1996 budget resolution's call for the elimination of the US Department of Commerce is both symbolic of the change in philosophy in Congress and a practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Cobb supports Congress's idea of closing the Department of Commerce, suggesting that the Department is "little more than a collection of disparate programs" which are beyond reinvention. This paper notes that the Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments. Cobb's recommendations include the following: a) close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration; b) consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistical Administration, within a single new independent agency; c) transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration; d) close the domestic offices of the US and Foreign Commercial Service; e) establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation; and f) privatize the National Technical Information Service. Cobb supports allowing the Department, which would be the first in history to be dismantled, three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property. 23 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>How to Privatize Orange County's Airports</b> by Robert W. Poole, Jr.<br>
Policy Study No. 194, Reason Foundation<p>

Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, cites two major problems with Orange County's decision to sell John Wayne Airport: 1) the potential of serious competition from a future airport at El Toro, which might prematurely draw traffic away from John Wayne; and 2) the likelihood of litigation by the airlines who contend that a municipality may not legally make use of the proceeds from the sale of an existing federally aided airport. This study identifies several different types of airport privatization, including contract management, lease, and sale, and outlines the legal status of each with respect to federal grants and constraints. Poole recommends two types of privatization, in a coordinated fashion, to solve Orange County's dilemma_the county should seek a single firm that will enter into two separate agreements: 1) a long-term contract to manage John Wayne airport and 2) a purchase or lease agreement under which the firm will develop a commercial airport at El Toro. The author notes that development of the latter will be closely coordinated with future activities at the former, to ensure the continued financial viability of John Wayne Airport through the years needed to retire its outstanding bonds. 15 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Designing a Comprehensive State-Level Privatization Program: How-To Guide #1</b><br>
 by William D. Eggers<br>
Washington Institute for Policy Studies<P>

William Eggers, director of the Reason Foundation's privatization center, presents this guide as the first in a series of seven  on the topic of state government privatization. Eggers recommends that states develop comprehensive, forward-looking privatization programs rather than adopting piecemeal approaches. This paper offers nine basic steps for designing a systematic, comprehensive program: 1) develop the institutional structure for privatization; 2) set up a program of adjustments and incentives for public employees; 3) identify privatization techniques; 4) identify state services and assets that offer opportunities for privatization; 5) determine the legislative and executive barriers to privatization and revise or rescind these; 6) consider introducing mandatory competitive incentives into the delivery of certain state and local services; 7) evaluate the feasibility of privatizing identified privatization opportunities; 8) determine the potential cost savings from privatizing services and assets selected for privatization; and 9) prepare a plan for implementation. 28 pp. CONTACT: Washington Institute for Policy Studies, 999 Third Ave., Suite 1060, Seattle, WA 98104, 206/467-9561.<P>


<b>A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal Immigration</b><br>
 by John J. Miller and Stephen Moore<br>
Policy Analysis No. 237, Cato Institute<p>

John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, and Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, describe the efforts by some legislators in the House and Senate to create a national computer registration system for all American workers as "Orwellian." Miller and Moore write, "The computer registry and national ID card, which would confer on the federal government vast new police-state powers, is highly incompatible with the Republican theme of expanding freedom and reducing government." This paper cites three major problems with the current proposals: 1) the identification system could be easily expanded to include other purposes beyond deterring illegal immigration, such as implementation of Clinton-style health security card, conducting background checks on individuals, and enforcing affirmative action laws and other government regulations; 2) the system would cost the federal government between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to administer; and 3) error rates that are commonplace for government databases would lead to hundreds of thousands of Americans being denied legal access to the workforce. The authors conclude that a computer registry would impose large costs on American citizens in terms of both dollars and lost liberties. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<b>How to Solve Mandatory Auto Insurance</B><br>
 by John Semmens<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 5, Goldwater Institute<P>

John Semmens, winner of the Goldwater Institute's Reinventing Government competition in 1994, proposes privatizing automobile registration and driver's licenses. In this plan, private insurance companies license drivers and register automobiles, allowing drivers to deal with a single, private agency. Semmens also proposes requiring full insurance for drivers that insurance companies choose to cover, stating that private registration, along with full coverage of drivers, is likely to do a better job of taking irresponsible drivers off the road and make those who cause accidents fully liable for the dollar damage they cause. The author criticizes the current system for allowing underinsured and uninsured motorists to escape liability for much of the damage they cause to others and their property. Semmens contends that uninsured motorists will be easy to identify since they will have no privately issued license tag. 10 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<b>Taxpayer Choice: A Common Sense Solution to the Crisis of the Welfare State</b><br>
 by John C. Goodman<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 4, Goldwater Institute<p>

John Goodman, the 1995 John M. Olin winter fellow at the Goldwater Institute, offers evidence that the only way to reform welfare is to end the federal government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars. In order to combat the perverse incentives inherent to the current welfare programs, Goodman recommends allowing individual taxpayers to give up to 40 percent of their personal income taxes (the amount currently spent on federal welfare programs) to any qualified charity, public or private. According to the author's plan, the government would then be required to subtract a dollar from public welfare programs for every dollar given. 51 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<B>Combatting Illegitimacy and Counseling Teen Abstinence: A Key Component of Welfare Reform</B><BR>
 by Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle<BR>
Backgrounder No. 1051, The Heritage Foundation<p>

Joseph Piccione and Robert Scholle, both former policy analysts in the Office of Population Affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, address the role of soaring illegitimacy rates in America's social fabric. The authors recommend abandoning the pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. Instead the authors support the "abstinence approach," which incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. Piccione and Scholle support a three-pronged approach for young people to avoiding poverty and dependency: complete high-school; get a job, even a low paying one; and have children only within marriage. The authors recommend funding education for such a program with $200 million in block grants to the states through the Maternal and Child Health Services. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>What Welfare Should Be</b><br>
 by Larry P. Arnn and Thomas G. West<br>
California Journal July 1995, The Claremont Institute<p>

Larry Arnn, president of The Claremont Institute, and Thomas West, a senior fellow at The Claremont Institute, posits the question, "What should be the welfare system of California 25 years from now?" The article answers the question with ideas that support family and work, respect for education and marriage, disdain for illegitimacy and compassion for the deserving poor. The authors write, "It [California's welfare system] must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and organizations; in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy. In short, it must be everything the current system is not." 4 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825.<P>

<b>Reforming Medicaid</b><BR>
 by James R. Cantwell<br>
Policy Report No. 197, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>
James Cantwell of the Congressional Budget Office argues that any attempt to balance the budget will be futile without reforming Medicaid. Cantwell presents six steps to achieve Medicaid savings of $185.4 billion over seven years without any reduction in benefits for needy people: 1) changing incentives for recipients through Medical Savings Accounts and/or managed care would produce a $37.2 billion savings in acute care programs and $64 billion in long term care; 2) enforcing estate recovery provisions would produce savings of $35 billion; 3) redirecting and capping disproportionate share hospital payments would produce savings of $13.9 billion; 4) reducing administrative costs would produce a savings of $3.7 billion; 5) making Medicaid the payer of last resort would produce savings of $31.5 billion; and 6) reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through greater state vigilance would produce savings of an unknown but substantial amount. This paper presents statistical evidence and analysis for each of the points, concluding that the savings for seven years would total at least $185.4 billion. 14 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>FDA Censorship Can Be Hazardous to Your Health</b><br>
 by David R. Henderson<br>
Policy Brief No. 158, Center for the Study of American Business<p>

David Henderson, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is censoring valuable information about drugs that could help doctors treat their patients more effectively. Henderson reports that the FDA routinely challenges drug companies that distribute articles from medical journals reporting positive, but not necessarily FDA-approved, uses of their drugs. According to the author, no matter how close the recommended off-label use is to an approved use, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing will stop a drug company from sending out medical journal articles that recommend, or even mention such an application. Henderson notes that 40 to 50 percent of all drugs are prescribed for off-label uses. This paper suggest that this new, expanded role of the FDA is the result of bureaucratic ingenuity, not congressional action, which could result in the loss of life. Henderson endorses eliminating the role of the FDA as a censor for advertising, returning this function to the Federal Trade Commission, which was responsible for this regulation before 1962. 17 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.<P>

<b>Outcome-Based Education: Miracle Cure or Plague?</b><br>
 by Brunno V. Manno<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Hudson Institute<P>
Brunno Manno, a senior fellow in Hudson's education policy studies program, attempts to explain why enormous conflicts over outcome-based education exist, suggesting that the original intent of outcome-based education was productive. Manno maintains that when states began efforts to institute these programs, they turned over the crucial task of defining outcomes over to the very education establishment figures threatened by the process. Having adopted in principle the focus on results (originally intended to be academic results), the educators presented lists of outcomes that emphasized values, attitudes and behavior, and often reflect quasi-political or ideologically correct positions. Dr. Manno shows how this process occurred in various states, then proposes a twofold policy strategy that provides a way out of the dilemma: establish high, uniform academic standards and a system of accountability with real consequences for success and failure; and create greater diversity in the kinds of schools we finance, how we pay for them, and the ways educators provide solid academic achievement, with parents free to choose the schools that best meet their needs. 24 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Teacher, Inc.: A Private-Practice Option for Educators</b><br>
 by Janet R. Beales<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Reason Foundation<P>
Janet Beales, policy analyst with the education studies program of the Reason Foundation, discusses private-practice teacher contracts as an option to schools and communities looking for new ways to provide education. Beales describes private-practice teachers as professional educators who provide their services to schools or other entities, on a contract basis, helping school officials strengthen accountability, cut costs, and increase flexibility. In turn, according to the author, the contract arrangement elevates the professional status of teachers, allowing teachers to take control of their own careers, negotiate their own compensation, and make their own decisions about how to use time, resources and methodologies. This study profiles the experiences of a number of private-practice educators and discusses the benefits that schools may realize by contracting for instruction. In addition, this study presents results from two national surveys about the legal authority of school boards to contract for instruction and also provides a chart to help administrators identify the fully allocated costs of in-house and contract service. 23 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

Denis Doyle, president of his own education research organization, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation and formerly associated with the Hudson Institute, asserts that public school teachers and administrators are in a unique position to assess the quality of public education for their own children. Doyle writes, "The data is clear: in the largest urban areas, public school teachers are more likely than the population at large to enroll their children in private schools. By and large it is the poor and dispossessed, particularly in large, troubled urban areas, who are forced into the nation's public schools. But these schools are so unattractive that the teachers pay significant sums of money to send their children elsewhere. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>The Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195): Key Changes Will Improve Potential for Serious Agriculture Reform</b><br>
by John Frydenlund<br>
Issue Bulletin No. 211, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project, praises the Freedom to Farm Act as a good first step toward reforming agricultural policy. Frydenlund points out that the bill accomplishes several significant goals: replacing traditional payments for commodity programs with transition payments that decline over a period of seven years; eliminating supply controls; and extricating the federal bureaucracy from the decision-making process of planting requirements. Frydenlund, however, makes several recommendations to strengthen the Act and to dramatically reform the current system:1) specify an exact date when programs will end, preferably no later that the year 2001, by deauthorizing current law; 2) prevent transition payments from becoming an unjustified windfall by specifying a trigger or price level for each commodity that would reduce or eliminate transition payments for a given year; and 3) eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program or at least drastically reduce the number of acres in the program. He suggests two methods for assuring that reforms embodied in the Freedom to Farm Act and other proposals are not circumvented: cap annual Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) spending at levels provided in the budget resolution and reduce CCC borrowing authority from $30 billion to $15 billion. Frydenlund forecasts that these changes will greatly improve and provide long-term reform for the agricultural system in America. 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

Hudson Briefing Paper No. 182, Hudson Institute
<P>
Dennis Avery, director of Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, and Dave Juday, an agricultural businessman, observe that increasing budget restraints no longer allow Washington to hand prosperity to America's farmers by way of farm subsidies. The authors write, "Changes in US agricultural tax, trade, and regulatory policies could enhance the nation's rural prosperity quickly, not only for farmers but for off-farm rural residents who have too often been driven from their communities by cropland setasides." In order to correct the problems created by current agricultural policies, the authors  suggest that Congress broaden the focus of farm policy by passing an eleven point Contract with Rural America. The eleven points would focus on regulatory and tax relief and expanded trade opportunities. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

Leal presents the findings from his studies of the economic and environmental performance of county and state foresters in Minnesota and Montana compared with that of Forest Service lands in the same region. Leal made comparisons between Superior National Forest and the St. Louis County forestlands and found that the county made more than $2 million from timber sales while Superior lost over $5 million on timber sales.

<b>Cleaning Up Superfund: The Case for State Environmental Leadership</b><br>
by J. Winston Porter<br>
Policy Study No. 195, Reason Foundation
<P>

Winston Porter, president of the Waste Policy Center, describes the Superfund program as one of the nation's most visible site remediation programs. Since the inception of Superfund in 1980, the program has received many criticisms, especially given that only 150 of the 1,300 designated sites have been cleaned in 15 years. According to the author, an undeservedly large portion of the funds have been used for legal proceedings. Porter examines an alternative approach to Superfund; the author recommends allowing the states to deal with the sites_at a fraction of the time and costs. Currently states are spending about $700 million annually working on about 11,000 sites, while the EPA spends approximately $1 billion annually dealing with about 1,000 sites. In this study, the author briefly reviews Superfund and the similar programs of the states; presents how-to steps to turn much of Superfund over to willing and able states; and recommends methods of state certification, funding provisions, EPA's continued role, and modification of the Superfund statute. 14 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Superfund Unplugged</b><br>
by Wayne T. Brough<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Wayne T. Brough, director of research for Citizens for a Sound Economy, contends that the Superfund program_created in the wake of public concerns over toxic wastes at Love Canal_imposes billions of dollars in costs on consumers and local communities while providing few benefits in return. Brough suggests that the program's liability rules delay the clean-up process and impose inequitable costs on businesses and communities. Brough states, "The Superfund program requires fundamental reforms that implement sound risk management practices and a more cost-effective allocation of resources. At the same time, liability rules should be changed to eliminate perverse incentives that divert resources from environmental cleanups." This paper outlines the basics of Superfund reform as follows: allow states to play a greater role; privatize as many sites as possible; repeal retroactive liability; reform joint and several liability; institute no new taxes for Superfund; utilize risk based management and sound science; and create new mechanisms of public finance. 19 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

<b>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory Reform</b><br>
by Kent Jeffreys<br>
Policy Report No. 194, National Center for Policy Analysis
<P>

Kent Jeffreys, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, argues that the solution for current environmental problems requires the government to act in accordance with certain pre-defined rules before enacting environmental legislation or approving any environmental regulations. The author suggests the following guidelines: 1) The Federalism Rule, which would require that all regulatory decisions be made by the smallest possible government entity; 2) The Cost-Benefit Rule, which requires that objective studies weigh the benefits against the costs of new regulations; and 3) The Compensation Rule, which requires the government to compensate innocent property owners for the loss of property rights or non-negligible losses of value. This study examines abuses of the three rules cited above in specific federal environmental programs and explores solutions that would bring the programs into compliance with the rules. 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Making Government Work: How Congress Can Really Reinvent Government</b><br> by Donald J. Devine<br>
Backgrounder No. 1050, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Donald Devine, former director of the US Office of Personnel Management and adjunct scholar at Heritage, recommends that the federal government should "return to the pre-Carter system of decentralized authority." Devine describes several problems with the administration's current proposals to reinvent government, writing that the plan: will weaken policies on hiring, promoting, and rewarding federal employees based on individual merit and performance; will eliminate presidential standards for job performance; will enhance federal agency and union control over setting salary levels; will weaken long-standing "veterans preference" standards; and will create a new role for federal unions that would undermine management authority for defining and assigning work. Devine makes specific recommendations for defining government's proper functions: devolve power to the states; define agency missions; privatize government functions; protect the merit system; establish responsibility; clarify rules; re-establish merit selection; make the hiring process rational; re-establish pay for performance; rationalize federal benefits; end duplication stop Clinton's devaluation of management responsibility; and consolidate the management of federal resources. 18 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences</B><br> by Bradley A. Smith<br>
Policy Analysis No. 238, Cato Institute<P>

Bradley Smith, assistant professor at Capital University Law School in Ohio, acknowledges that while efforts to limit political contributions and spending are extremely popular, no evidence exists that campaign finance regulation has achieved or will achieve its goals of reducing the influence of money, opening up the political system, and lowering the costs of campaigns. The author maintains that efforts to limit contributions and spending have been based on two faulty assumptions: that candidates spend too much per vote (total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible voter every two years) and that large donations are undemocratic (most challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements have been financed by wealthy donors). Smith argues that, "Our current campaign finance regulations favor incumbents, stifle grassroots activity, distort and constrict political debate, and infringe on traditional First Amendment freedoms. There is little reason to believe that still more regulation and public funding will yield positive results." 26 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<B>Only A Piece of Paper?: The Social Significance of the Marriage License and The Consequences of Cohabitation, Divorce and Stepfamilies</b><br> by Glenn T. Stanton<br>
Focus on the Family<P>

Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst for the public policy division of Focus on the Family, presents a compilation of statistical data, gathered since the 12th century, which reveals that marriage matters in the lives of children, adults, and societies. The results consistently show that marriage improves the physical and mental health as well as the  longevity of men and women. On the whole, this data shows that married people do better in every measure of specific and general well-being than their unmarried counterparts. The research reveals information about the benefits of marriage, the disadvantages of cohabitation, and the effects of remarriage and stepfamilies. Stanton concludes that, based on the statistical evidence, it is critical to rediscover a cultural norm for family life in America and hold it up as an ideal. Stanton writes, "The ideal should be the traditional two-parent family where mother and father strive for a healthy marriage and both participate in the daily care and nurturing of their biological or adopted children." 36 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400.<p>

<b>Multiculturalism and Economic Growth</b><br> by Gerald W. Scully<br>
Policy Report No. 196, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>

Gerald Scully, senior fellow of the National Center for Policy Analysis, contradicts conventional wisdom by acknowledging that the work of most anthropologists identifies cultural diversity as a universal source of social conflict and often as a barrier to economic progress as well as personal freedom. Scully finds that cultural relativism has made the study of the role of culture in human progress controversial, but he points out that intergroup enmity is widespread in culturally heterogeneous societies. This study shows that cultural diversity and a lack of economic freedom go hand in hand. Scully writes, "For all its problems, the West has managed cultural conflict better than the rest of the world because it has free economic, civil and political institutions...despite this success, we are moving away from the notion of individual freedom to that of group rights in the United States." Based on his study of cultural conflict and economic progress, Scully recommends that the Third World move towards freer economic institutions and a reduction of cultural heterogeneity to transform its economic progress. 19 pp., CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<h3>Defenders of Property Rights</h3>

<B>Defenders Moves Forward with an Aggressive Litigation Program</B><P>

Defenders has been engaged by the United Property Owners of Washington (UPOW) to serve as co-counsel in the case of United States v. Washington. At issue is an 1850s treaty between the then-territorial governor and sixteen Indian tribes regarding the harvesting of shellfish. Even though most of the tideland area of Washington is privately owned (it is one of only a few states with such private ownership) and has been tended and enhanced over the years by its owners, the tribes and the federal government believe that certain Indian tribes share the right to harvest the shellfish. In an interim order, a federal district judge awarded the tribes the ability to take half the harvest. The tribes and the government, however, are seeking a larger take of the shellfish and full access to the tidelands. UPOW has intervened in the hope of protecting their right of "exclusive possession and clear title" to their property.<P>

<b>Defenders Fights Charge of Hunter Harassment</B><P>

Defenders has also filed a complaint in a state court in Minnesota seeking just compensation on behalf of a property owner. In James F. Peternell v. State of Minnesota, the private property owner was criminally prosecuted for attempting to exclude state officials from his property. Mr. Peternell bought 160 acres of land in 1972, 140 of which are considered wetland. A 1984 state law designated the wetland area as a "protected water basin," making it "public waters." Although he had previously been told by the Department of Natural Resources that his land was still privately-owned, he was later indicted on charges of "hunter harassment" when he tried to remove uninvited hunters--including an undercover DNR official--from his land. While the criminal charges against Mr. Peternell were dismissed by a jury, a court did find that his land can now be considered public domain under the 1984 law.<P>

<B>Defenders Supports Rights of Hog Farmer</B><P>

In City of Chesapeake v. Earl Warren, Defenders represents a hog farmer in Virginia. The city officials have now decided that his hog farm constitutes a "public nuisance", even though his land has been used for over 120 years and he follows sound industry practices on his farm. At stake in this case is the extent to which local governments can characterize historically typical and productive uses of land as a "nuisance" (as the city has in this case by passage of an ordinance directed at his activities) and thereby destroy that use of land without incurring the constitutional duty to pay the owner just compensation for that taking. On September 8, 1995, the court rejected the government's request for a permanent injunction that would have shut down the hog farm and instead offered to work with the property owner in an attempt to remedy the situation short of closing down the farm. Another hearing has been set for December 7, 1995.<P>

<B>Defenders Challenges Gas Company</B><P>

In Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation v. Deana Wingfield Drain, Defenders is challenging in federal court the utility company's practice of unilaterally expanding its right-of-way from 8 inches to 50 feet without compensating property owners for that taking. In this case, Columbia Gas forced the property owners to move their mobile home and shed (both of which were anchored to cement foundations) out of the newly-claimed right-of-way, at their own expense. Moreover, the enforcement of the right-of-way has been selective; in fact, one home actually sits atop the gas line but those home owners have not been asked to move the house. Discovery is underway in the case.
On September 20, 1995, Defenders will be filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the court to review the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court. At issue in the case, United Employer Benefit Corporation v. Department of Insurance and Finance (Oregon), is whether personal property is protected to the same degree as is land against uncompensated takings and also whether threats which have the effect of destroying an ongoing business trigger the duty of government to pay for the taking.
Defenders will also file a brief on behalf of itself and other co-amici curiae in the case of Stubblefield v. City of Sand Bernardino on September 20, 1995, in the United States Supreme Court. At issue in this case is whether government actions which were clearly arbitrary and designed to target a small developers project violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

<h3>Institute for Justice</H3>

<B>Runstrom, et al. V. City of Kalamazoo</B><P>

On September 7, 1995, the Institute filed a constitutional challenge to the City of Kalamazoo's housing inspection law that allows government inspectors to enter apartments without tenant consent or a validly-executed search warrant. The Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit on behalf of 13 Kalamazoo apartment tenants. The case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice when landlord Jerry Speedy was brought up on criminal charges for refusing to provide access to rented apartments unless the tenants consented to the building code inspections.
The constitutional rule that the Institute for Justice seeks to establish in this lawsuit is: If government inspectors wish to enter tenants' homes, they must ask for and receive their explicit consent. If the tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable suspicion (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.<P>

<B>Teen Challenge of San Antonio Wins Battle Against Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)</B><P>

The Institute represents Teen Challenge of San Antonio, in its effort to continue its faith-based drug and alcohol treatment program, which was threatened with the secular requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse licensing requirements.
Teen Challenge, a thirty-five year old program with an excellent track record of success, believes the key to solving chemical dependency problems lies in the spiritual dimension of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It accepts no government funding for treatment and all participants come to this program voluntarily.
TCADA views addiction as a disease of the body that can be treated, but never cured. TCADA's secularized, disease-based model for addiction and treatment--and the regulations that implement this model--did not allow Teen Challenge to carry out its salvation, Christ-centered model of treatment. Based on this incompatibility, Teen Challenge objected to being forced to meet the licensing and regulatory requirements of TCADA. The Institute for Justice, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is providing legal representation to Teen Challenge in ongoing negotiations with Texas and is prepared for litigation if necessary.<P>

<B>Battle for Expanded Choice Continues in Milwaukee</B><P>

Despite substantial disruption as a result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's injunction of the recently expanded school choice program, most students have received privately funded scholarships through Parents Acquiring Values in Education (PAVE) to allow them to enroll in their chosen private schools. This resulted from the generous contributions made by caring individuals, parents, schools, and the business and philanthropic communities.
Over the next month, the lawyers in this case will meet to determine whether there are factual issues in dispute. Assuming the Wisconsin Supreme Court does not remand the case to the trial court, the Court could (a) rule in favor of the IJ on all issues, (b) rule against the IJ, but decide that the religion clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution are the same as the First Amendment, (c) rule against the IJ, finding that the Wisconsin Constitution is more restrictive than the First Amendment, (d) rule against the IJ on the other grounds under the Wisconsin Constitution. Under the first two scenarios, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would be possible, but an appeal would be precluded under the third and fourth scenarios. The Institute was granted intervenor status on behalf of Parents for School Choice and eight individual families, and will continue to play an active role throughout the litigation.

<B>"Don't Worry-Be Happy" Feds Tell Local Sheriffs</B><P>

In response to a lawsuit by the Wyoming Sheriff's Association challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs. Despite the clear provisions of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs. Despite the clear penalties, federal lawyers maintain that sheriffs have no reason to fear prosecution. MSLF maintains that the law is outside the authority of Congress in Article I of the U.S. Constitution; violates the Tenth Amendment; violates the Appointments Clause of Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution; and violates the Sheriff's Fifth Amendment right to due process by being overly vague.<P>

<B>Western Road Case Goes to Trial</B><P>

The attempt by Millard County, Utah, to obtain jurisdiction over a public right of way in rural south central Utah, in accordance with a long standing federal law, is now before a federal judge after a three day trial. The federal statute in question permits counties to exercise authority over roads across federal lands. The federal government has sought to prevent counties from exercising their rights by claiming the roads are really "ways" and including them in wilderness study areas.<P>

<B>Political Contribution Case Goes to Trial</B><P>
MSLF's lawsuit against the Cherry Creek School District in Denver, Colorado, will go to trial following the trial court's ruling that MSLF has legal standing. MSLF is challenging the use, by Cherry Creek, of public funds and resources to assist the Colorado Education Association's Political Action Committee and the Cherry Creek Education Association's Political Action Committee in collecting political contributions through the school district's payroll system and distributing political material through the school district's inter-school mail service. MSLF asserts that these activities violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment as well as Colorado's Campaign Reform Act.

<B>Boston Taxi Medallion Fight Returns to State Court</B><P>

Nine years after beginning a seemingly quixotic struggle to drive his own taxi in Boston and four years after his precedent-setting victory in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Robert Lynch, represented by NELF, has returned to the Massachusetts courts in order to try to reap the fruits of his struggle.
Robert Lynch is a partially disable man who has supported himself for years by driving taxi cabs in Boston. Ten years ago, he tried to acquire a taxi "medallion", the legal right to operate his own cab, rather than just drive cabs owned by others. Since World War II, the number of Boston medallions had been fixed at 1525 and their price had risen over $50,000, far in excess of his resources. The resulting shortage of taxis led to higher fares and reduced taxi availability, particularly in minority and low income areas which are more dependent upon taxi service than other parts of the city.
Mr. Lynch went to the public library and found a 1934 law, never before use, which gave a state agency the power to require Boston to issue new medallions and he appealed to the agency. In 1990, it ordered Boston to issue hundreds of new medallions "immediately." The order was appealed by taxi owners to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court, but Mr. Lynch, represented by NELF, prevailed in 1991.
Since then, NELF and Mr. Lynch have negotiated with Boston in an effort establish reasonable ground rules for issuance of the 300 new medallions called for by the agency's order on remand. Gradually, Boston hardened its position and finally decided that it could legally ignore the state agency order.
NELF has now filed a mandamus action on Mr. Lynch's behalf. While Mr. Lynch concedes that Boston has the right to establish reasonable rules as to who shall be permitted to operate taxis in the city, it cannot simply flout its legal obligation to issue new medallions. Issuing the new medallions is not only required to comply with the city's legal duty but also it will begin the opening of a rigid and inefficient system to competition and free enterprise, which will benefit the taxi-using public.<P>

<b>NELF Supports High-Tech Manufacturer</b><P>

The New England Legal Foundation has filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, supporting Houghton-Mifflin Company's effort to retain its status as a "manufacturing" company for purposes of state tax law. The basic issue in the case is whether a state should use its tax law to encourage or discourage a business' effort to move away from traditional labor intensive "manufacturing" in the direction of more modern high-technology, knowledge-intensive operations.
For over thirty years, Massachusetts has classified Houghton-Mifflin Corporation, a nationally-known book publisher, as a "manufacturing corporation," which entitles it to a tax credit for new equipment purchases and other tax benefits. In 1991, the state Department of Revenue notified Houghton-Mifflin that this classification had been revoked, retroactive to 1986. The basis for that action was that Houghton-Mifflin no longer printed its textbooks in the state, having shifted that aspect of its business to independent contractors while retaining in Massachusetts its more intellectual activities including writing, editing, preparing art work, designing and preparing computer materials and compact discs.
Houghton-Mifflin appealed the Department's action. The state Appellate Tax Board ruled in Houghton-Mifflin's favor, holding that its operations in Massachusetts continued to meet the state's statutory tests for constituting "manufacturing" as well as the Department's own regulations on that subject. The Department appealed to Massachusetts' highest court, arguing that, as a matter of law, Houghton-Mifflin's operations could not constitute manufacturing.
NELF's amicus brief argued that the Board had been correct. When the legislature originally amended the state's tax laws to encourage "manufacturing", it had n o intention of binding business into a straightjacket irrevocably tied to then-current technology. Rather, its obvious goal was to use the tax laws creatively to encourage businesses to take actions that would benefit the wider community. In today's economy, Houghton-Mifflin's actions in shifting its operations in the direction of cleaner, high wage, high technology jobs are precisely the sort of positive transformation that Massachusetts should be encouraging.

<h3>Pacific Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Bureaucratic Land Grab Averted</b><P>

State of California ex rel. State Lands Commission v. Superior Court (Lovelace). In a key victory for property rights, the California Supreme Court agreed with Pacific Legal Foundation arguments and thwarted a major land grab by the State Lands Commission. As a result, the private ownership, use, and enjoyment of properties along the banks of rivers, streams, or lake shores in the state have been preserved.
In California, as in all other states, new land that is formed by slow accretion to a shoreline or riverbank becomes the private property of the adjacent upland owner. Accretion is the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes. This process can occur either by the washing up of sand or soil from a body of water, such as the sea or a river, or by the gradual subsidence of water which leaves land uncovered. Thus, if a river gradually shifts its course by the accumulations of silt, sand, grave, and other sediment, and land is created where there was once only river bottom, the owner of the adjacent upland gains title to the newly formed land.
During the mid to late 1800s, hydraulic mining both enriched the economy of the state and wreaked havoc on the downstream reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watershed by depositing vast amounts of gravel, sand, and silt into the waterways. As this material worked its way downstream, it was deposited in the slower reaches of these waterways causing the river bottoms to gradually rise by many feet, creating dry land where there once was river bottom.
Richard Lovelace owns property which includes a 12-acre parcel that was created by accretion when the river bottom rose between 12 and 15 feet during the heyday of California's hydraulic gold mining era. The State Lands Commission tried to snatch that property from Mr. Lovelace on the theory that the accretion was the result of "artificial" rather than natural causes.
The California Supreme Court agreed with PLF's arguments and held that title to land formed in the last century as a partial result of the sediment washed downstream by hydraulic mining would be determined according to the rule of accretion. That is, if it was deposited slowly and imperceptibly over time, title would inure to the adjacent upland riparian owner onto whose land the accretion occurs. Had the state bureaucracy gotten its way, the settled status of thousand of acres in California would have been destroyed.<P>

<b>Defending Voters' Right to Cut Back Government Spending</b><P>

Atiyeh v. Oregon. In this case, PLF is defending Ballot Measure 8, enacted by Oregon voters to roll back lavish pension plans for state workers.
Oregon law has long required that public employees contribute 6% of their gross pay toward their retirement pension plan. However, in 1979, the state Legislature enacted a Pension Pick-Up Law requiring the government employer (i.e., the taxpayers) to "pick up" the 6% tab. Thus, since 1979 most Oregon government workers have not actually contributed to their annual pension premiums, although "on paper" they have been credited with making a 6% contribution! Under the Pension Pick-Up Law, Oregon taxpayers not only bear the full pension cost for public employees, but also guarantee a minimum 8% return on pension investments. In addition, pension benefits can be increased by unused sick leave.
Recognizing that this generous pension plan was not akin to most private sector pension plans, Oregon voters enacted Ballot Measure 8. A major objective of this initiative is to reverse the 1979 Pick-Up Law by amending the Oregon Constitution to require public employees to contribute 6% of their salary toward their pension plan. To ensure that taxpayers no longer pick up the 6% tab, Measure 8 prohibits government employers from contracting to relieve public employees of their contribution duty or to increase their salaries or benefits as an offset. Among other restrictions, Measure 8 also bars government contracts from guaranteeing the interest rate on public pensions funds.
The Pacific Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief in the Oregon Supreme Court opposing a lawsuit seeking to block Ballot Measure 8. The suit does not challenge the substance of the measure, but the legality of the whole initiative process as applied to Measure 8.

<h3>Washington Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Michigan Supported in Motor Voter Litigation</B><P>

Joined by three Members of the Michigan delegation to Congress (Representatives Richard R. Chrysler, Nick Smith, and Fred Upton), the Washington Legal Foundation filed an amici curiae brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in support of Michigan's position in ACORN v. Miller, a suit brought to force the state to carry out the unfunded mandates in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the "motor voter" law). WLF argued that the Act is not within the power of Congress to determine the "Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives." Among other mandates, the Act requires a state to offer assistance in completing a voter registration form to all clientele visiting welfare and unemployment agencies. <P>

<b>Supreme Court Urged To Limit Abusive Class Action Suits</B><P>

In a brief filed in the Supreme Court in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, WLF argued that a corporation should not have to defend against more than one class action suit based on alleged violations of securities law where the different lawsuits arise from the same transaction. When a corporation settles with one group of plaintiffs who purport to represent shareholders, another group of plaintiffs should not be permitted to extort additional settlement funds by claiming to represent the same shareholders, WLF argued.<P>

<b>Limits On Judicial Campaign Contributions Proposed</B><P>
WLF filed a petition with California Bar authorities recommending that trial lawyers be prohibited from making judicial campaign contributions. Studies cited by WLF show that in California and elsewhere, plaintiffs' trial lawyers have contributed enormous amounts to judges before whom they practice, creating the impression that justice can be bought. Fifteen top California trial lawyers gave almost $1 million to candidates for judicial office.<P>

<B>FDA Requested To Ease Rules on Direct-to-Consumer Ads</B><P>
A citizen petition filed by WLF with the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to adopt a policy recognizing that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs can play a helpful role in providing consumers with truthful information about prescription drugs and also recognizing that truthful, non-misleading advertising of prescription drugs receives significant protection under the First Amendment. WLF recommended that the agency replace its current case-by-case review of such advertising with rules setting out "a very limited, very clearly-defined" set of improper advertising practices, giving manufacturers fair notice of what advertising is impermissible.

<html><title>No Free Lunch for Lobbyists -- Heritage</title>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></center>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>September Insider : No Free Lunch for Lobbyists</h2><br></center>
  by Charles P. Griffin, Deputy House Liaison at the Heritage Foundation<p><hr><P>

The best-kept "dirty little secret" in Washington these days may be the millions of taxpayer dollars that are siphoned off each year to fund welfare for lobbyists. Over the past forty years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<P>
Almost every interest in America from agriculture to zoology has one or more organizations receiving government funding. Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar Association, which received $2.2 million. This subsidy forces the taxpayer to foot the bill for a range of ideologically driven organizations.<P>
The coercive power of the federal government should not be used to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or other government entities.Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. <P>
Every federal dollar frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives more than $70 million 96 percent of its funding from the federal government. While enjoying a generous federal subsidy, this proponent of big government actively engages in a broad range of overtly partisan political activity.<P>  
Unfortunately, the NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY 1994, 22 percent of its budget. In addition to opposing economic development nationwide, the Trust recently sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to "vote no" on a possible amendment in the House to reduce their taxpayer subsidy. It is no wonder that this nation has a multi-trillion dollar debt when federally-funded organizations can so blatantly lobby Congress for more money.<P>
Existing auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse. The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to curb current abuses:<P>
To solve this problem, no advocacy organization that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status. The consequences for violating the prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the standards. Under no circumstances should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions receive further federal funding.<P>
In addition, to shed more light on this "dirty little secret," witnesses testifying before Congress should be required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light<P>.
It's time for this Congress to end welfare for lobbyists. Taxpayers should no longer be forced to subsidize political activity with which they disagree. Thomas Jefferson anticipated this debate over two hundred years ago when he correctly stated, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."<P>
Mr. Jefferson must be spinning in his grave.<P>

<b>NATO's Role in European Stability</B>,edited by Stephen A. Cambone
<br>The Center for
Strategic & International Studies<p>

The Center for Strategic
and International Studies addresses the current political debate
over the redefinition and transformation of NATO, which dates
back to the very beginnings of the post-Cold War era. The report
examines the question of how to restructure the transatlantic
partnership in light of the recent discussions surrounding the
future membership of Eastern European nations into NATO. The report
also considers how NATO should have responded to the situation
in Bosnia. CSIS compiles the opinions of various academics and
foreign policy experts on the rightful course for NATO during
its transformation period. Walter Slocombe, US undersecretary
of defense for policy, lists four basic principles that must be
kept in mind during NATO's expansion: &quot;First, NATO is an
effective alliance, not a system of paper guarantees. Second,
it is an alliance of free nations and is committed to the principles
of liberty. Third, it works by consensus. Fourth, NATO is ultimately
a military organization.&quot; 67 pp. CONTACT: The Center for

<b>The
B-2 Bomber: Failure to Buy More Could Compromise Security in the
Next Century</B>, by Jim Courter and Loren Thompson
<br>Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution presents the
case for why the production of the B-2 bomber, popularly know
as the stealth bomber, should not be curtailed as it is essential
to the maintenance of US security. The report warns against terminating
the production of the B-2 after the government has committed over
$20 billion to its development since the last decade of the Cold
War. The study concludes that it would be more cost effective
to continue the production of the bomber, despite its high price
tag, because the cost of every available alternative that can
achieve future military objectives is considerably higher. Courter
and Thompson also espouse the belief that possession of the B2
is critical to US security in light of the trend towards the globalization
of advanced technologies; this suggests that the present generation

The
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies issues a conference
report from their February 1995 conference held to discuss the
prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation in today's political
environment. Policy makers, industrialists, and academics met
to investigate the possibilities of establishing cooperative measures
between the US and Europe in the areas of military research, development,
and production. In this report, CSIS attests to the positive gains
made toward establishing transatlantic partnerships for future
US defense programs, to enable more programs to come to fruition.
The conference did conclude, however, leaving some ambiguity:&quot;the
interoperability argument for transatlantic defense cooperation
has shifted from enabling allied forces to meet a possible joint
threat in a cohesive and efficient manner to enabling alliance
members to undertake multinational operations outside NATO's area.&quot;

<b>The Purposes of Russian Aid: Supporting Democratic

Foundation<p>

Ariel Cohen, a Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, advocates re-examining the
aid that the US plans to give to Russia and the Newly Independent
States in FY 1996 and in FY 1997 which will be up for a vote in
the Senate shortly. Cohen points out that US-Russian cooperation
is ebbing due to the following: Russia's intervention in Chechnya,
Moscow's refusal to end the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran,
and the lack of free-market reforms that have been enacted, since
Gorbachev's perestroika began ten years ago. The author recommends
that the Senate preface the allocation of the aid based upon six
contingencies: &quot;1) demand that the Administration suspend
negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western
creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is
completed; 2) condition US support for IMF credits to the Russian
government on a cease-fire in Chechnya; 3) create an independent
board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS; 4) reprogram $225 million
to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities
Import Program and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program; 5)
make democratic development a top priority; 6) target grants directly
to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS.&quot; 13 pp.

<b>The United States and Future Bosnias</B>,
Jonathan G. Clarke
<br>Foreign Policy Briefing No. 36, Cato Institute<p>
Foreign
policy studies research fellow Jonathan Clarke of the Cato Institute
equates the importance of US foreign policy towards Bosnia as
setting the precedent for future policy towards other Eastern
European nations where conflict is erupting. Thus, according to
the author, the manner in which the US proceeds is paramount.
The author advocates a policy of nonintervention towards Bosnia
based on three main arguments: 1) the war in Bosnia is an intracommunal
dispute and is not an aberration from past, present, or future
conflicts that comprise Europe's history; 2) unlike Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union, conflicts such as Bosnia do not pose a threat
to US security; 3) intracommunal conflicts make it difficult for
the US to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Clarke
concludes that &quot;failure to draw the appropriate lessons from
the Bosnian debacle will cause the United States to end up repeating
the same mistakes elsewhere in Europe.&quot; 12 pp. CONTACT: The

No. 1042, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Baker Springs, a senior policy
analyst at The Heritage Foundation, attests that more base closings
are still needed despite the latest round of base closing, which
insufficiently reduced the size of military forces, personnel,
and budgets down to the size recommended by the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission. The author explains that insufficient
base closings pose a very grave threat to US security; moneys
spent maintaining excessive bases only detract from vital military
readiness and modernization programs. Thus, the author advocates
extending the base closure process for another two rounds to ensure
that base infrastructure, which has only been reduced by 15 percent
since 1985, approaches the 25 percent cuts in military personnel
during the same time period. The paper also recommends that additional
oversight be made in any upcoming base closings so that the procedure
does not become politicized by the upcoming presidential race;
the electoral map and presidential politics should not influence
which bases are selected to be closed. 8 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<p>Venezuela has long since passed its
days of economic prosperity that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 70s.
Mark Falcoff, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,
outlines the causes of  this collapse and the political, social,
and economic policies that continue to sabotage efforts to put
Venezuela back on track. The author reveals that President Caldera
has supported dangerous economic reforms that include the following:
1) price controls that will increase shortages of basic foodstuffs
and articles on necessity; 2) foreign exchange controls that hurt
businesses by creating shortages of needed raw materials and parts;
3) and finally, a deliberate effort to stall any effort that move
towards privatization. These policies do not bode well for the
Venezuelan economic crisis that continues to worsen, fostering
even more support for a military coup that could truncate Caldera's
presidency. 4 pp. Contact: American Enterprise Institute, 1150

<b>How to
Close Down the Department of Transportation</b>, by Ronald D. Utt
and Wendell Cox
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/bugettax/bg1048.html">Backgrounder No. 1048, The Heritage Foundation</a>
<P>
Ronald
Utt, visiting Heritage Fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state
policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council,
present the process through which the Department of Transportation,
created in 1966, has grown into the enormously inefficient bureaucracy
that exists today. Utt and Cox state that this fiscal year's budget
allocates $39 billion to the DOT, with nearly $19 billion going
to highways. According to this study, much of the department's
spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished
by the federal fuel tax paid by motorists at the gas pump, and
the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket
tax and several lesser aviation taxes. Utt and Cox demonstrate
that the DOT has remained mostly unchanged in its structure and
purpose since 1966; however both the Congress and the White House
now agree that major reform is necessary. Even modest reform proposals
have met opposition with House Republicans, but the Senate Republicans
have proven their commitment to fundamental reform, urging greater
privatization and federalism in transportation issues. This report
argues that the reforms emerging from conference are not enough,
further reforms in the following areas are necessary: surface
transportation; the end of federal mandates which have inflated
state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative,
low-cost transportation solutions; and urban mass transit. This
paper suggest the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration;
privatizing Amtrak; privatization of air traffic control and the
devolution of federal control to the states; and the transfer
of Coast Guard responsibilities to the Department of Justice.

Risk Analysis Vol. 15 No. 3, Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis<p>
The team of experts who produced this
important paper gathered information on the cost-effectiveness
of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly
available economic analyses. &quot;Life-saving interventions&quot;
were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategies
that reduce the possibility of premature death among a specified
target population. This paper defines cost effectiveness as the
net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved.
The 587 interventions identified in this work ranged from those
that saved more resources than they cost, to those costing more
than $10 billion per year of life saved. This paper finds the
median intervention costs $42,000 per lifeyear saved; the median
medical intervention costs $19,000 per life-year saved, the median
injury -eduction costs $48,000 per life-year, and toxin control
costs $2,800,000 per life-year saved. 21 pp. CONTACT: The Harvard

Policy Analysis
No. 233, Cato Institute<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting
Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental
studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, maintain that
the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided
because it fails to account for current pollution trends and is
based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This
misguided policy, according to this paper, has led to &quot;regulatory
overkill&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Jones and
Adler state that this particularly affects the Ozone Transport
Region, the twelve states from Virginia to Maine, imposing emissary
control strategies that are not only unnecessary, ineffective,
and expensive, but are also scientifically insupportable. The
authors write, &quot;control for control's sake pollution control
strategies pursued by the EPA and the OTC are largely inappropriate
because they are neither costeffective nor equitable means of
achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be
necessary.&quot; The authors conclude that legislative action
is necessary to alleviate unneeded and costly regulatory mandates.

the House Republican Joint Economic Committee and House Republican
Policy Committee Briefing on the Dollar to produce this paper.
Reynolds gives a &quot;graphic&quot; demonstration of how the

a new boat of stagflation. This paper compares the state of the
current economy with the conditions of 197475, 197982, and 199091.
Current actions by the federal government point towards stagflations:
America's increasingly hostile tax climate for domestic savings
and foreign investment. Reynolds suggests that the decline of
the dollar is not the result of budget deficit or the Federal
Reserve's interest rate; but that the steady decline may be halted
with appropriate tax and monetary policies, including tax incentives

overspending at a vastly greater rate than the US. The paper recommends

avoid the collapse of program, Congress has only two choices:
1) Do not change significantly the way Medicare is run by the
government, and assure future new revenues through higher payroll
taxes and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs;
or 2) Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run so that benefits
are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding future tax increases
or a diversion of money from other programs. This approach would
aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated to grow. This
paper assesses the proposals from the Clinton administration,
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, National Center for
Policy Analysis, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security

Patrick
Fagan, the William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and

must be part of any plan to reform welfare. Fagan cites statistics
which show outofwedlock births reaching nearly 40 percent by the
year 2000 and 50 percent by the year 2012, and he questions why,
out of the 500,000 children in the foster care system, only 50,000
were cleared for adoption each year. Fagan suggests that adoption
addresses many of the current problems with the welfare system:
unwed mothers, children in abusive homes, children in foster care,
and costs to the state and federal governments. Fagan argues,
&quot;Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive
capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life
chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money
for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents.
It is good for all involved. Adoption works.&quot; 30 pp. CONTACT:

<b>Should
We Worry About Ozone</b>, by Jane S. Shaw and Richard L. Stroup<BR>
Policy
Report No. 191, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>Jane Shaw and
Richard Stroup, senior associates with the Political Economy Research
Center, challenge the theory held by some scientists that the
depletion of stratospheric ozone is substantial and will grow
to alarming levels unless the use of CFCs and some related chemical
compounds is eliminated. The authors argue that the theory of
largescale depletion caused by human use of these chemicals is
not yet supported by solid scientific evidence. This paper presents
five areas of unresolved issues regarding the ozone: 1) it is
not clear that stratospheric ozone is being significantly depleted
worldwide, or that any depletion that may have occurred is permanent;
2) if the ozone layer is being depleted, it is not clear that
CFCs are the major cause or that reducing their use now will stop
or even slow depletion; 3) it appears that the &quot;ozone hole&quot;
above Antarctica is caused by unique conditions, and it is uncertain
whether additional or reduced chlorine from CFCs would affected
it; 4) even if ozone depletion does occur, there is no reliable
evidence that it will represent a grave threat to living things
on earth; and 5) the cost of eliminating CFCs for refrigeration
and cooling are higher than most people realize, with estimates
reaching nearly $100 billion over the next 10 years in the United
States alone. The authors conclude that the Montreal Protocol
banning CFCs should be changed to make the phaseout more gradual,
and the costs (including such social costs as the loss of safety)
of halting CFC production should be weighed against the small
and uncertain benefits. 21 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

<B>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory
Reform</b>, by Kent Jeffries<BR>Policy Report No. 194, National Center
for Policy Analysis<P>

National Center for Policy Analysis senior
fellow Kent Jeffries suggests that any regulatory reform bill
approved by Congress will only be a first step toward removing
governmental abuses without sacrificing overall environmental
quality. Jeffries argues that Congress must still reauthorize
or review a host of environmental programs individually, including
Superfund, pesticide regulations, the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. This paper recommends
three guiding principles with which to examine these programs:
the federalism rule, which requires regulatory decisions to be
made by the smallest possible government entity; the costbenefit
rule, which considers whether the costs of a proposed regulation
reasonably reflect it benefits; and the compensation rule, under
which property owners are compensated for their losses if property
rights are taken or diminished by a regulation. Jeffries writes,
&quot;The regulatory reform bill is important, but if Congress
is to make the reform truly meaningful, it must define a role
for government in environmental regulation that gives people the
right incentives, that protects property rights, and that spends
the public money wisely.&quot; 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center

Rangeland Reform</b>, by Karl Hess Jr. and Jerry L. Holecheck<BR>Policy
Analysis No. 234, Cato Institute<P>
Karl Hess, Cato senior fellow
in environmental studies, and Jerry Holecheck, professor of rangeland
studies at New Mexico State University, argue that the results
of more than a century of grazing on public land are testimony
to the failure of landuse socialism. This paper asserts that taxpayers
have paid for federally supervised and subsidized grazing, and
ranchers, the intended beneficiaries, have gained little except
debt, insecurity, and mountains of regulations, while environmental
quality has suffered. Hess and Holecheck address Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt's plan, arguing that &quot;it ignores the institutional
impediments that have made overgrazing and land abuse official
programs of the federal government, and it leaves unchanged the
federal policies that discourage rancher stewardship and pay stockmen
to overgraze and reward them for poor management practices.&quot;
This article presents four methods of reform: 1) placing the fiscal
burden of maintaining these lands on the ranchers; 2) opening
access to these lands for purposes other than grazing livestock;
3) decentralizing control over federal lands in selected areas
on a trial basis; and 4) extending the local control and opening
debate on partial or full divestiture of public rangelands. 27

<B>Securities Law Reform:
A Half Step in the Right Direction</b>, by William H. Lash III<br>
Contemporary
Issues No. 73, Center for the Study of American Business<P>
William
Lash, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business,
finds that Congress, fearing an &quot;economic apocalypse where
millions of fleeced investors withdraw from securities markets
that fail to adequately protect them&quot; is reluctant to pass
pending legislation that would provide some protection to companies
facing groundless securities litigation. Lash proposes six aspects
of reform: 1) institute a loser pays all court cost provision;
2) require a meaningful investment by plaintiffs in strike suits;
3) require specific allegations of actual fraud or recklessness;
4) abolish RICO liability for securities suits; 5) limit the number
of lawsuits that may be brought by professional plaintiffs to
five cases in a three year period; and 6) require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to adopt rules providing a &quot;safe
harbor&quot; for corporations making positive, forwardlooking
statements in their corporate reports, so that companies are not
forces to play down bright prospects to investors simply to protect
the firm from possible frivolous securities lawsuits. Lash concludes
that the constant specter of groundless securities litigation
deters many worthy individuals from joining corporate boards and
wastes corporate resources while rewarding a handful of unscrupulous
attorneys. 20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

Thomas Lipping, vice president for
policy and director of the Center for Law and Democracy at the
Free Congress Foundation, describes the &quot;Madisonian Dilemma&quot;
as the initial incongruity of an antidemocratic institution like
an unelected, lifetenured judiciary having the power to invalidate
the actions of elected officials. Jipping maintains that judicial
review seems &quot;fundamentally inconsistent with republican
government under a written constitution. The solution to this
dilemma, the only way in which judicial review retains its legitimacy
and remains consistent with the political theory underlying our
form of government, lies in how judicial review is conducted.&quot;
This paper addresses the constitutional problems of a proactive

<B>The
1995 Crime Bill: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?</b>,
by Jarett B. Decker<BR>
Policy Analysis No. 229, Cato Institute<P>
Jarett
Decker, a Minnesota attorney, accuses the new Republican Congress
of fighting crime by expanding federal power, just like past Democratic
Congresses. Decker argues that, despite the April 26 Supreme Court
ruling on the Lopez case, the 1995 GOP crime bill continue the
trends of recent years by making every local crime a federal crime.
According to this paper, federal prosecutors would be given even
more power under the GOP crime bills, while the rights of defendants
and the powers of judges would be curtailed. The authors demonstrates
that &quot;both the House and Senate bills give a green light
to government lawlessness,&quot; weakening constitutional protections
against invasions of private homes, raids on businesses, and detentions
of citizens in the course of criminal investigations. Decker concludes
that the 1995 crime bills are a step in the wrong direction, further
removing the US from constitutional checks and balances toward
a regime of unchecked power. 33 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000

Morgan Reynolds, director
of the Criminal Justice Center at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, reports that the rate of serious crime has tripled since
the 1960s, and the author suggests that one explanation lies in
the fact that &quot;crime pays.&quot; Expected punishments have
been steadily declining, roughly an 80 percent decline since the
1950s. This paper uses Texas' and California's imprisonment rates
as examples of the correlation between crimes and expected punishments.
The author demonstrates that the cost of building and maintaining
prisons is high, but the investment pays off with lower levels
of crime. 26 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis,

<B>Orphanages:
Did They Throttle the Children in Their Care?</B>, by Richard B. McKenzie<BR>
Center
of the American Experiment<P>

Economist Richard McKenzie presents
his preliminary findings from a survey of several hundred former
orphans, all of whom are now middleaged or older. Despite the
claims of child care professionals who condemn orphanages, the
survey found that when compared to their counterparts in the general
population, the orphans have: a lower divorce rate; a higher level
of education; a higher mean income; a far lower unemployment rate;
a far lower poverty rate; a minuscule rate of reliance on public
assistance; a minuscule arrest rate; a substantially lower rate
of mental and emotional disorders; and a higher rate of participation
in elections. McKenzie also reports that the majority of orphans
state that they prefer the way they grew up to the way they would
have grown up in foster care or in their own families. The author
contrasts the success of the orphans with the lowered expectations
of child care professionals for those growing up in orphanages.

<b>Cornell Professor
Sues Over Harassment Conviction</b><br>
The Center for Individual Rights
has filed a lawsuit against Cornell University on behalf of Professor
James B. Maas.  The lawsuit demands $1.5 million in damages for
Cornell's actions in finding Maas guilty of alleged &quot;sexual
harassment.&quot;<p>
Jim Maas, a professor of psychology, is one of
Cornell's most prominent faculty members.  He has a record of
31 years of distinguished service to the Cornell community.<P>
The
lawsuit, filed today in Tompkins County Supreme Court, demands
redress for a yearlong, ruinous witch hunt against Maas.  In a
proceeding over sexual harassment charges filed by former students
in May 1994, Maas was convicted as a &quot;sexual harasser&quot;
on stale and unproven charges; was subjected to an adjudicatory
&quot;process&quot; that was administered by fanatical faculty
members devoid of even the most basic elements of procedural fairness;
was forced to watch helplessly as unsubstantiated rumors and halftruths
were peddled to the local, national, and international press,
besmirching his reputation and severely damaging his ability to
function as a teacher and a scholar; and was ignored by Cornell's
feckless administrators when he protested the egregious violations
of Cornell's established procedures and of the confidentiality
rules that were supposed to govern the proceedings in his case.<P>

<b>Oral
Arguments Made in Hopwood v. State of Texas</b><br>
On Tuesday, August
8, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments
in the case of Hopwood v. State of Texas.  The case was brought
by Cheryl Hopwood and three other unsuccessful applicants for
admission to the University of Texas Law School.  The plaintiffs,
who are white, claim that the law school discriminated against
them by maintaining a racebased admissions system that was intentionally
biased in favor of black and Mexican American applicants.<P>
The case
is an appeal from a decision handed down by US District Court
Judge Sam Sparks in August 1994.  The judge found that the Law
School had indeed operated a racially discriminatory admission
system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause, noting that the school had maintained separate admissions
committees to evaluate applications from members of different
racial groups.  The judge also observed that blacks and MexicanAmericans
were presumptively admitted with test scores and college grade
point averages lower than those set for the presumptive rejection
of whites.<P>
Nevertheless, Judge Sparks refused to order the plaintiffs'
admission to the law school because they failed to prove that
they would have been admitted except for the unconstitutional
program.  Moreover, the judge refused to award damages of more
than one dollar, finding that the law school had acted in &quot;good
faith&quot; when it violated the plaintiffs' rights.  And because
the judge found the law school's admission program no longer to
be in violation of the equal protection clausebecause it had discarded
the segregated admission tracks and separate admissions committees
by the time the case went to trialhe refused to order any change
in the school's admissions procedures.<P>
The law school, however,
has never disavowed the use of race as a factor in its admissions
process; indeed, it continues to treat an applicant's status as
black or MexicanAmerican as a &quot;plus.&quot;  Such preference
is given automatically, without regard to the applicant's socioeconomic
background, and to both Texas residents and nonresidents.<P>
During
the oral argument, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to order
the law school to offer them admission.  In addition, the plaintiffs
asked the appellate court to remand the case so that they may
seek an award of nontrivial monetary damages.  Most significantly,
however, the appeal asks that the law school be prevented from
using race as it currently does as a criterion in student admissions.
 In this respect, the case presents the Court of Appeals with
an opportunity to clarify the meaning of University of California
Regents v. Bakke, a 1978 Supreme Court ruling having to do with
the constitutionality of racebased admissions procedures at a
statesupported medical college.<P>

<b>Institute
Comes to the Defense of School Choice</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association
(MTEA), joined by People for the American Way and Americans for
the Separation of Church and State, filed lawsuits in early July
in state court in Madison challenging the constitutionality of
the recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.<P>
The Institute's
petition to intervene as defendants on behalf of the grassroots
group Parents for School Choice and eight lowincome families who
will participate in the program, was granted Friday, August 4.
 Landmark Legal Foundation will represent another group of lowincome
families from its previous lawsuit.  On August 17, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court granted the Governor's petition for original action
jurisdiction and will promptly consider the plaintiffs' motion
for preliminary injunction.<P>
The ACLU lawsuit challenges the program
under the religion clauses of the United States and Wisconsin
constitutions.  The MTEA lawsuit adds claims under the &quot;private
or local&quot; bill provision of the Wisconsin Constitution and
the &quot;Public purpose&quot; doctrine.  The suits have been
consolidated and the plaintiffs are seeking injunction before
the school year starts.<P>

<b>Freedom Hits the Streets of Denver</b><br>
The Institute's

on August 1st with the grand opening of Freedom Cabs.  Run by
Leroy Jones, Ani Ebong, and Girma Molalegne, Freedom Cabs is the
first new cab company to open its doors in Denver since 1947.<P>
 The entrepreneurs first challenged Denver's taxicab monopoly
in January 1993 when they joined with the Institute to file a
lawsuit against the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which
regulates taxis in the state.  Later, due to the lawsuit's high
visibility, the Colorado legislature passed a law opening the
Denver taxi market.<br>This lawsuit is part of a comprehensive effort
by the Institute for Justice to restore judicial protection for
&quot;economic liberty&quot;the basic civil right of every American
to pursue a business or profession free from arbitrary or excessive
government regulation.<p>

<b>Institute Files Amicus Opposing Civil Forfeiture<br></b>
The
Institute filed an amicus in Bennis v. State of Michigan, fighting
the government's ability to forfeit the property of wholly innocent
owners.  The state forfeited Ms. Bennis' interest in her automobile
because her husband used the car for prostitution.  Ms. Bennis
committed no wrong and had no knowledge of the illegal use of
her property.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan provides no
recourse for innocent owners.<P>
The Institute's brief critiques civil
forfeiture from a property rights perspective and argues that
forfeiture of property held by truly innocent owners is unduly
oppressive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  Furthermore, the law should not place affirmative
obligations on individuals to police the actions of third parties.
 Rather, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate
that an owner negligently entrusted property to another in order
to expose that individual to civil forfeiture.  The Institute
will also fight the forfeiture of Ms. Bennis' rights in the automobile
on the ground of taking of private property without just compensation.<p>

<b>Virginia Supreme Court Upholds Redskins' Right
to Work</b><br>
The Supreme Court of Virginia refused a petition for appeal
by National Football League Player Association (NFLPA) union officials
to overturn a lower court's ruling barring the NFLPA from seizing
forced dues from sixteen current and former Washington Redskins
players, National Right to Work Foundation attorneys announced
today.<p>
The ruling upheld a lower court decision by Loudoun County
Circuit Judge Thomas D. Horne.  Horne last year ruled that it
is a violation of Virginia's Right to Work law for NFLPA union
officials to force Redskin players to pay union dues as a condition
of employment.<p>
Horne's ruling permanently barred player union officials
from requiring former Redskins tight end Terry Orr and other players
to pay union dues.  Orr and fifteen former and current Redskins
players were represented in their legal action by attorneys from
the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.<p>
  &quot;This
is another enforcement action to guarantee employee rights under
Virginia's Right to Work law, &quot; said Foundation VicePresident
Timothy McConville.  He added, &quot;Every step of the way in
this case, we've prevailed and protected employees' right not
to pay compulsory union dues just to keep their jobs.&quot;<P>

In
December of 1993, NFLPA union officials nearly forced the Redskins
to forfeit their final regular season game by threatening to have
the players who exercised their Right to Work suspended.<p>
The union
claimed that the Redskins were employed in Washington, DC, where
they play their home games, and therefore not covered by Virginia
law.<p>
But the lower court declared that because the Redskins spend
the overwhelming majority of their work time at Redskins Park
in Loudoun County, Virginia, they are Virginia employees, protected
by the state's Right to Work law.<p>
In contrast, players typically
spend only 60 hours before, during, and after home games working
in the District of Columbia.<p>

<h3>The Rutherford Institute</h3><p>
<b>Supreme
Court Allows Student Initiated Graduation Prayer</b><br>
On June 26 the
Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in Harris v. Joint School District.  The court's decision
effectively upholds the right to studentinitiated prayer at public
high school graduations.  The Rutherford Institute represented
students in the case.<P>
The case began in 1991, when the ACLU filed
suit against the public high school in Grangeville, Idaho, for
allowing studentinitiated prayer at their graduation ceremony.
 The high school gave complete control over the ceremony to seniors
who voted to include a benediction and invocation.  Initially,
a federal district court ruled in favor of the school, but the
court of appeals reversed the decision, holding that graduation
prayer violated the first amendmentregardless of whether or not
the prayers were studentinitiated.  The Ninth Circuit's decision
was in direct conflict with an earlier decision from the Fifth
Circuit upholding student-initiated graduation prayer.<p>
&quot;The
Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case on the merits means that
the uncertainty over the legality of student-initiated prayer will
continue,&quot; said Rutherford staff attorney Mark Beutler. 
&quot;I am pleased nonetheless that the Court vacated the Ninth
Circuit's decision.  Now students in western states can once again
decide to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford
Sues California Superintendent Delaine Easton</b><br>
California State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Easton as well as a half dozen
other school superintendents have been named defendants in a lawsuit
against the state of California regarding administration of the
California Learning Assessment Systems (CLAS) test.  Despite Governor
Pete Wilson's veto on funding for the controversial CLAS tests,
schools continue to administer test materials without parental
consent or notice.<p>The complaint was amended on Monday, June 19,
to argue that the state violated not only parental rights guarded
by the Constitution, but also federal civil rights laws.  A court
date has been set for October 23, 1995.<p>The original suit, filed
April 21, 1994, sought a temporary restraining order to stop six
San Bernardino County School districts from giving the CLAS test.
 The test requires children to answer personal questions about
their family values, practices, and beliefs as well as questions
pertaining to their relationship with their parents.  Children's
answers may then be referred to Child Protective Services without
ever notifying parents how the test results are being used.  Not
only parents, but also state senators, school board members, and
teachers were denied the opportunity to examine the test before
it was administered.  The defendants in the lawsuit continue to
assert that they have done nothing wrong, insisting that parents
have no right to shield their children from questionable materials
found in public schools.<p>
&quot;This battle will not end until the
State Department of Education is forced to recognize the rights
of parents to guide the education of their children,&quot; said
Frank J. Mistretta, Jr., an attorney handling the case, adding,
&quot;Now is definitely not the time to drop the ball on defending
parents' rights.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford Institute Defends School Against
ACLU Suit</b><br>
On June 30, The Rutherford Institute filed a posttrial
brief on behalf of Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent
Lynn Westfall in response to a lawsuit brought against the school
by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The ACLU sued the
school administration for allowing a citizen group to place a
box of free Bibles for students on school property.<p>
The posttrial
brief filed by The Rutherford Institute requests the court to
rule in favor of the school.  The brief argues that the school
acted neutrally by permitting religious materials to be made available
on the same terms and under the same conditions as nonreligious
materials.<P>
The case began on December 6, 1994, when the school
board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses
to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on
February 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis.
 As a result, on February 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several
parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the
school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students
while the case was pending.<p>
&quot;We are hopeful that in light
of the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger and Pinette, the
court will not require the school to treat private religious speech
occurring during the school day differently than nonreligious
speech,&quot; said Dean Whitford, The Rutherford Institute attorney
handling the case, along with Attorney Michael D. Lorensen.<P>

for protecting the civil liberties of employers during inspections
and investigations.  The petition urged OSHA to provide a &quot;statement
of employers' rights and responsibilities&quot; prior to every
inspection.  Currently, OSHA does not require its inspectors to
inform employers of any of their rights.  WLF's proposed statement
explains employers' rights, including the right to refuse an inspection
that is not authorized by a warrant or its equivalent, to consult
one's legal counsel, and to accompany the inspector throughout
the inspection.  The petition is in response to the results of
WLF's research into OSHA inspection procedures, which disclosed
that OSHA lacks adequate regulations or internal rules for protecting
civil liberties.<p>

<title> Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</i></b>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programs—Medicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up to—Medicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxes—and hence the cost of employing Americans—by an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the program—that is, to put it on a permanently sound footing—an immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I>by Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</i>
<hr>
<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced détente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpreters—is unique in the study of the Cold War.

<i><h3>National Security and Foreign Policy</h3></i>
<p>
<b>Clinton's ABM Treaty Muddle,</b> by Kim R. Holmes and Baker Spring<br>
<i>Committee Brief No. 16</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p> 
Heritage vice president Kim Holmes and policy analyst Baker Spring focus on the inconsistencies in the Clinton administration's approach to the ABM Treaty. This brief, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 7, suggests five steps to overcome the confusion in the administration's policies: 1) Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces overseas, and their vital interests, will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world; 2) Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one; 3) Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation policy; 4) Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty; and 5) Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM Treaty. Holmes and Spring maintain that these steps will resolve the contradictions in the President's approach to the ABM Treaty. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>The Mystery of Japanese Growth,</b> by Ramesh Ponnuru<br>
<i>Rochester Paper No. 4,</i> Centre for Policy Studies and American Enterprise Institute
<p>
Ramesh Ponnuru, a student at Princeton University, examines the cause of Japan's economic strength and why, according to the author, America and Europe falsely believe this strength threatens their own economies. Ponnuru writes, "Neither a concern about trade imbalances nor fear of Japan's potential to surpass the economic might of other nations justify the adoption of self-destructive policies by those nations. America and Europe should refrain from raising their drawbridges against Japanese commerce, setting targets for trade in specific sectors, or indeed for overall trade balances, or forcing Japan to cut its savings rate." The author argues that many critics of Japan falsely credit Japan's success with the interventionist policies of its government. Ponnuru unequivocally believes that, on balance, interventions in the Japanese marketplace have hindered rather than helped Japan's economy. 47 pp. CONTACT: Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU, 071-828-1176.

<b>Soviet in Public, Azeri in Private: Gender, Islam, and Nationalism in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,</b> by Nayereh Tohidi<br>
<i>Working Papers No. I-95-9,</i> Hoover Institution
<p>
Nayareh Tohidi, research fellow and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, focuses on the intersection of gender, state socialism, nationality, and religion in Soviet and post-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The interplay between the Soviet state policy towards the "national question" and the "woman question" is demonstrated in the Muslim Azerbaijani context. It shows that, although Muslim Azeri women have accomplished an impressive level of emancipation, their overall status remains flawed with contradictions and duality. Similar to women of several other countries in the Muslim world confronting colonial domination or semi-colonial intrusion, Azeri women's liberation has been held hostage to their assigned responsibility as the primary repositories of tradition, ethnic, and national identity. In conclusion, gender dynamics of recent changes and a new search for national identity in the ethnically contested and war-stricken context of newly independent Azerbaijan is briefly explored. 30 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA 94305-6010, 415/723-3373.

<b>Keeping America Great: Toward a New Foreign Policy Doctrine,</b> by Malcolm Wallop<br>
<i>Heritage Lecture Series No. 526,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Former Senator from Wyoming and distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation Malcolm Wallop describes, in his remarks to Heritage's Annual Board Meeting in San Diego, how America, since the Bush presidency, has allowed her role as world leader to slip away. Wallop describes the effects of the "utter vacuum of [foreign] policy." The administration's focus on the economy led to further cuts in the military and lack of policy definition, and Wallop states, "No great nation can remain great, free, and prosperous without strength, purpose, and courage. Today America has the latter, some of the former, and none of the middle." To reconcile this situation, Wallop names six essential components of a new doctrine: "First, the safety of the homeland is the paramount obligation. Second, America has an interest in a world at peace, if only for economic reasons. Third, we are a trading nation needing markets as well as access to supplies. Fourth, we are a communicating nation, and that means access to space. Fifth, we are a nation of travelers and scholars. Sixth, we are a nation of conscience and freedom—not to impose it, but surely to support it." 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Do Sanctions Work? Economic Sanctions as a Tool of US Foreign Policy</b>
<i>Conference Summary,</i> American Enterprise Institute
<p>
This summary provides the comments of two separate panels, the first entitles "Sanctions—Important or Ineffective Tool of Foreign Policy." Shaun Donnely, deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions, and commodities for the US Department of State, described sanctions as the answer to situations where diplomatic initiatives are insufficient, but military action is not justified. Julius Katz, president of Hills & Company, points out that sanctions, in their historical context, have rarely worked. Zalmay Khalilzad, director of the Program for Strategy, Defense and Force Structure for RAND Project AIR FORCE, clearly regards sanctions (including the embargo of military technology) as an important instrument foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Richard Perle, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute uses the reasons to support sanctions which had been presented by Shaun Donnely and argues that they are exactly the reasons to oppose sanctions. Perle suggests that the US resorts to sanctions rather than a military effort is when it is not prepared to "bear the costs of real and effective action." The second panel, "The Efficacy of Sanctions—The Iraq, Iran, and Cuba Cases" examines the results of sanctions in these three countries. Micheal Eisenstadt, military fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; James Kinnear, former president and CEO of Texaco Inc.; and Otto Reich, director of the Brock Group offer their differing views. 8 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/862-5800.

<b>Fair Lending Enforcement: How the Government Micromanages Banking,</b> by David J. McPherson<br>
Washington Legal Foundation
<p>
David McPherson, a banking and real estate attorney, argues that the recent fair lending enforcement campaign by the Department of Justice sets a disturbing precedent of the executive branch legislating by consent decree. This monograph discusses the legal basis for the Department of Justice enforcement actions and describes how, by prosecuting lending institutions for alleged discriminatory lending practices and forcing these institutions into consent decrees, the Justice Department has gone far beyond what is required by the federal fair lending laws and has confused sound lending practices with racial discrimination. McPherson advocates the cessation of attempts by the Justice Department to micromanage lending institutions and the encouragement in careful and consistent regulation and voluntary fair lending compliance by the lending community. 41 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<b>The Menace of Regulation,</b> by Michal Tosovsky<br>
Klub Mediator
<p>
Michal Tosovsky, president of the Czech Government Office for Standards, Metrology and Testing, defines the problems of regulation, focusing on Czech legislation since 1989, developments in the European Union, and experience gained from over-regulation in the United States. Tosovsky cites examples of excessive Czech legislation in the last five years: the Trading Act, Construction Act, Act on Authorized Architects and Engineers, Consumer Protection Act, Act on Czech Business Inspection Bureau, and the Act on State Testing. This paper examines these pieces of legislation and demonstrates the precedent they set for future increased regulation. The author concludes by recommending improvement of private legal mechanisms, implementation of EU regulations, coordination of deregulation measures and increased private deregulation initiatives. 23 pp. CONTACT: Klub Mediator, Box 115, 110 01 Praha 1, CZECH REPUBLIC, 42 2/539 568.

<b>The Myths and Realities of Trade Deficits,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1039</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Heritage policy analyst Bryan Johnson argues that the driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Johnson states that the administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits including: trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial; trade deficits cost jobs; Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies; since the US is unable to sell some goods and services in Japan, their markets must be closed; and trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs. Johnson challenges each of these assumptions and others, proving that trade retaliation, in most cases, has failed to open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

The cover story of this month's <i>Carolina Journal</i> by editor John Hood focuses on regulatory issues. The cover story, "Splitting Hairs", questions why North Carolina licenses so many occupations, ranging from barbers to veterinary technicians, without a sound public policy reason for doing so. Hood writes, "By lifting these onerous restrictions on enterprise, policy makers in North Carolina could help both producers and consumers by increasing competition, lowering prices, and fostering more economic opportunity for disadvantaged North Carolinians seeking a way out of poverty."

<b>Reinventing the Regulatory System: No Downsizing in Administration Plan,</b> by Melinda Warren and Barry Jones<br>
Occasional Paper No. 155, Center for the Study of American Business
<p>
Researchers Melinda Warren and Barry Jones question the administration's call for $16.6 billion in spending for regulatory programs in fiscal year 1996. Warren and Jones point out that this represents a 3.3 percent real increase, even after adjusting for inflation. This report also predicts that staffing figures will reach a new peak in 1996—132,000 regulators. Warren and Jones conclude that the Clinton budget for 1996 appears to ignore the public's desire for less regulation and the administration's talk of reinventing government and streamlining the regulatory system has yet to be translated into action. 36 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Trade Policy Ahead: Three Tracks and One Question,</b> by Ernest H. Preeg<br>
Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>
Ernest Preeg, the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS, asserts that the structure of world trade has changed fundamentally in three ways since the early 1980s: 1) international trade in goods and services has become increasingly related to the international flow of capital, technology, and labor—the factors of production; 2)national economies and corporate strategies are increasingly dependent on international markets due largely to information-based technological change; 3)the polarization of the global industrialization process into three regions (Western Europe, North America, and East Asia) has intensified, one-half of world trade now takes place within these three regions. Preeg demonstrates that the changed structure has been reinforced by another change in the international trading system—from a multilateral yet, according to the author, narrowly drawn GATT to a system of multilateral commitments, regional free trade agreements, and selective bilateral accords.<i> Trade Policy Ahead </i>poses the question of how to manage the three tracks in a consistent, mutually reinforcing way toward broadly established goals. Preeg writes, "The time is finally ripe to include international investment policy within the framework of the multilateral trading system . . . and a central objective should be to launch negotiations for expansion of the WTO to a WTIO—a World Trade and Investment Organization." 75 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, 202/887-0200.

<h3><i>Taxation and Budget</i></h3>
<p>
<b>The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<p>
Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business Survival Foundation, evaluates the current tax system and the leading proposals for reform—the flat tax, national retail sales tax, consumed-income tax, and the value-added tax (VAT). Each tax plan is analyzed according to eight criteria: ability to promote economic growth, rate of capital taxation, inflation factor, clarity of the tax system, simplicity, limits to bureaucracy and intrusiveness, minimized incentives for tax avoidance, and limitations to government spending. Keating offers a simple scoring system, assigning one point for each criteria fulfilled, a half point for each partially met, and zero points for those not met at all. From highest to lowest, the plans scored as follows: flat tax, national retail sales tax, VAT, consumed income tax, and the current income tax. The author concludes by recommending reducing the size of the federal government substantially and moving to a low, flat income tax of 10 percent, with no taxation of capital gains, dividends, interest from savings, or business income. Keating ultimately suggests repealing the 16th Amendment and replacing the income tax with a nation retail sales tax of less than 10 percent. 38 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th Street, NW, Suite 2000, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238, fax 202/822-8118.

<b>A Citizen's Guide to the State Budget Mess: A Menu of 217 Proposals to Reduce State Government Spending,</b> by Tom McClintock<br>
<i>Briefings</i>, The Claremont Institute
<p>
Former California Assemblyman Tom McClintock presents 217 specific reductions that could be made in the 1995-1996 California budget. Total savings from these proposals, which include contracting out services, abolishing obsolete agencies and programs, controlling the growth of the bureaucracy, and operation reforms, amount to more that $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items. This work breaks the budget down into ten areas, from state and consumer services to health and welfare to youth and adult corrections. The author identifies many of the smaller, less costly programs that often get "lost" in the process of compiling large budgets. The savings amount to 13 percent of all funds proposed to be spent in the Governor's budget, or 18 percent of General and Special Funds. These proposals would also eliminate $725 million in fees to California citizens. 51 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 2012 H St., Suite 101, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916/446-7924.

<b>What To Do About Medicare,</b> Stuart M. Butler, Robert E. Moffitt, and John C. Liu<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1038</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Stuart Butler, vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies, Bob Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies, and John Liu, policy analyst, demonstrate that for the Medicare system to achieve long-term actuarial balance without reform, the trust fund would require an immediate payroll tax increase of 3.52 percent, which would raise taxes by $711 billion over the next five years. This increase would only fund the hospital program, not the fund for physicians' services. This paper suggests, "Instead of trying to tighten current controls on deregulation, the proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits." Butler, Moffit, and Liu recommend offering the a plan modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The major difference between this and the current system is that the government would make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, rather that reimbursing Washington-approved service according to a fee schedule. This paper concludes that if Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in health service or working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes. Reform would provide a new Medicare system based on consumer choice, with security for both today and tomorrow's retirees. 22 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: Answering the Critics</b>, by Michael Tanner<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 228</i>, Cato Institute
<p>
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at Cato, seeks to answer the concerns of the critics of consumer-based health care. Tanner addresses four questions often raised by those who oppose MSAs: claims that health care has become so complex that consumers are unable to make cost-conscious decisions about their treatment; claims that consumers will forgo necessary or preventative care to save money in their medical savings accounts; claims that MSAs would attract the healthy, while the sick remain in conventional insurance programs; and claims that MSAs are regressive, providing benefits primarily to the wealthy. This paper provides the information that supporters of MSAs require to rebut the arguments of those opposing reform. The author admits that MSAs are not perfect, but maintains that they represent a significant step toward solving the cost and access problems of our health care system. 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>The Private-Sector Health Care Revolution: How It's Controlling Costs Across Florida and America,</b> by Melanie S. Tammen<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 16</i>, James Madison Institute
<p>
James Madison Institute research associate Melanie Tammen reveals that, despite the failure of Medicare and Medicaid, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and President Clinton continue to promote plans which will force more and more people into government-intermediated health care programs. This paper maintains that Chiles' Florida Health Security Plan would dramatically expand the scope of the state's 11 new regional purchasing alliances by having them sell government subsidized health plans to low and middle-income residents. Tammen recommends reforms that facilitate universal coverage and affordability in marketplace, rather than plans to provide universal coverage along with large, expensive, taxpayer-financed programs. Tammen encourages Florida legislators to oppose Florida's new health care bureaucracy, the Community Health Purchasing Alliances, and pursue measures to further development of private sector reform. 16 pp. CONTACT: The James Madison Institute for Public Policy Studies, P.O.

Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill, both of Glasgow Caledonian University, focus on how health care moneys are to be managed and acknowledge the conflict between the managerial and clinical goals of the National Health Service in Scotland. This paper surveys opinions and beliefs of health managers and doctors in the West of Scotland. Bruce and Hill demonstrate that future reforms will require the input of both managers and doctors, in order to define a common agenda. This work begins the process of discovering the views of doctors, managers, and consultants towards research, management, medical direction, clinical direction, and training and preparation of doctors for management.

<b>Government in Health Care: Lessons from the UK</b>, by W. Duncan Reekie<br>
The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies
<p>
Duncan Reekie, the Bradlow Professor of Business Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, criticizes, as one who grew up under Britain's National Health Service (NHS), the Clinton administration's approach to health care. The proponents of NHS used the same arguments used by the Clintons, and the author investigates these arguments, revealing their flaws from 1948 and now. Reekie recognizes that the Clintons' plan is substantially different from the NHS and that most of the alternate plans in Congress are subject to market-based objections as well. The author discusses why he believes a Clinton health care program, like the NHS, would lead to a politicized health care system dominated by special interests, "fostering not trust but distrust between patient and physician." Reekie demonstrates that once a government-dominated health care system is in place, it is nearly impossible to abolish. This paper warns the American electorate of the perils of national health care and urges Americans to learn from the mistakes of the UK. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies, School of Business and Economics, California State University, Hayward, CA 94542, 510/885-3275, or fax 510/885-4442.

<b>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</b> by Cynthia Ramsay and Michael Walker

The current<i> Critical Issues Bulletin </i>attempts to document the extent to which lines are being used as a means of adapting to the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and potentially unlimited demand for free health care in the Canadian health system. Ramsay and Walker compiled data based on the waiting time in hospitals across Canada. The results suggest, based on the increased waiting times and the increased concern of the government to continue to supply the norm of health care services, that waiting lists have become an alternative to rising prices by restraining health care expenses in a system where prices have been systematically eliminated and neither physicians nor patients have any economic incentive to consider the costs of their decisions. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Fraser Institute, 626 Bute St., Vancouver, BC, CANADA V6E 3MI, 604/688-0221.

<b>Welfare Reform: Allow Welfare to Wither So Charities Can Bloom,</b> by Stuart Anderson<br>
<i>Issue Brief</i>, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
Stuart Anderson, policy director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, suggests that public policy analysts should pose two questions: in what areas are charitable organizations superior to the government in providing sevices to those less fortunate? and how can American society put more resources into the hands of charitable organizations to provide those services? This paper recommends that these decisions be made at a local level, and therefore the federal welfare system must give states flexibility to design their own approaches without interference from Washington. This study presents three significant findings: 1) the non-profit group Community for Creative Non-Violence spent $365,000 in 1992 to house 1400 homeless individuals on a nightly basis, while the DC government spent $26.4 million to house 2280 homeless people nightly in government shelters; 2) over a period of years, the city government paid the Pitts Hotel the $12.48 per person, per day for food, which amounted to 78 times the cost of three meals provided by the charity-run DC Central Kitchen (with donations and food purchased from local food banks, the DC Kitchen can serve meals at a cost of 16 cents per person.); and 3) advocates for the poor are restricted by regulations that  limit flexibility and creativity. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

Milton Friedman addresses the immediate need to reconstruct the education system at both the elementary and secondary levels to offset the growing wage differential crisis in the United States. He recommends privatizing a large segment of the school system, allowing for the creation of a for-profit education industry. This plan would offer effective competition to public schools by creating a free-market for choice in education. The system he proposes enables parents to select the schools their children attend by means of a universal voucher system that would be sufficient to cover the costs of a high-quality education. 7 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p>
Allyson M. Tucker, policy council director at the National Policy Forum, and William F. Lauber aid to Representative Chris Cox (R-CA); both former Heritage Foundation analysts, report strong evidence that concludes that the school choice movement is gaining ground at the state level. Their argument originates from the strong results pro-school choice candidates had at the polls in the 1994 elections, indicating that 1995 could be the year that school choice legislation will make significant gains. Lisa Graham was elected for state superintendent of schools in Arizona, with 59 percent of the vote, on a platform centered on school choice. At the gubernatorial level, candidates such as George W. Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, and John Rowland of Connecticut won as advocates of school choice. Proponents of choice can also expect action from Congress in 1995. Debate is going on in both chambers on "how the federal government can help states implement choice." Discussion is expected to focus on using funds from Chapter One for vouchers. Chapter One is the largest federal aid program for poor elementary and secondary students. Other articles address the tax status of the NEA and deregulating schools. 3 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palantine, IL 60067-6516, 708/202-3060, or fax 708/202-9799.

Marshall advocates the theory that parents, as opposed to government bureaucrats, are more able to select the schools their children attend based upon: the values they embrace, the teachers they employ, and the curriculum they uphold. The author also provides an in-depth section in his paper devoted to rebutting the attacks school choice opponents most commonly use to halt the movement. He debunks fifteen myths surrounding the school choice debate, including: 1) school choice is unconstitutional at state and local levels; 2) choice carries a heavy price tag; 3) school choice will wipe out the gains made in desegregation; and 4) choice will relegate poor children to the worst schools. 52 pp. CONTACT: Floridians for Educational Choice, P.O.

While debate continues on the educational benefits of returning control of education to state and local governments, Berthoud's paper makes the case for the potential cost savings of such decentralization. Terminating the department would eliminate the cost of maintaining a separate bureaucracy and the interest group pressures to increase spending. Alexis de Tocqueville Institution also reported the following findings: 1) eliminating the U.S. Department of Education would save taxpayers $15.7 billion dollars over a five-year period; 2) since education became the 12th cabinet department in 1979, the department's spending has risen three times as fast as the non-defense discretionary budget; and 3) taxpayers would have saved 5 billion dollars since 1979, if federal education spending had grown at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending. 17pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

The author argues that textbooks view the traditional Judeo-Christian conceptions with indifference. Moreover, history requirements have been replaced by classes such as personal awareness and self-esteem that promulgate these new moral credos.

Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at CSAB, acknowledges that Superfund, due to its perverse and conflicting incentives, encourages litigation and delay among conflicting parties rather than the clean up of Superfund sites. As Congress attempts to repair the damage of Superfund legislation, Mahoney suggests Ten Points of Resolution: retroactive liability should be retained as in the current law; insurance issues should be left to settlement by the parties involved; joint and several liability would be replaced by proportionate liability; the highest priority is the completion of Superfund's Emergency Removal program; no new additions should be made to the Superfund NPL list during the life of the Emergency Removal program; Superfund sites should be divided into two categories, those where containment is satisfactory and those whose future use is yet undetermined or unlikely to be industrial; a substantial amount of Superfund moneys would be allocated to proposals to develop cost-effective, neighbor-friendly permanent remediation; communities should be empowered and funded for full participation in the Superfund Trust; minor participants at sites should be relieved from all future liability upon payment of a nominal share; and minority and/or poor communities would receive preferential priority. Mahoney suggests that these Ten Points of Resolution represent an outline for Superfund reform and provide a basis for tradeoffs among the various parties' interests. 9 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the Regulatory Smog,</b> by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
<i><b>Policy Analysis No. 233</i></b>, Cato Institute
<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argue that the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided because it fails to account for current population trends and is based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This paper describes how this is particularly important in the Ozone Transport Region, the 12 states from Virginia to Maryland. The regulatory programs being proposed resemble the low-emission vehicle standards in California. The authors write, "The sort of control for control's sake' pollution control strategies pursued by the EPA and the Ozone Transportation Commission are largely inappropriate because they are neither cost-effective nor equitable means of achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be necessary." This paper recommends alleviating unneeded and costly regulatory mandates under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>Restoring Integrity to Government: Ending Taxpayer-Subsidized Lobbying Activities,</b> by Marshall Wittman and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1040,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Marshall Wittman, Heritage senior fellow in Congressional Affairs, and Charles P. Griffin, Heritage deputy House liaison, reveal that each year American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations which may use the money to advance their political agendas. They find that Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy. Wittman and Griffin write, "Taxpayer funding of advocacy groups is wrong—fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the people. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures." This paper cites many of the recipients of federal money: the AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, Families USA, The Child Welfare League of America, The National Trust for Historic Preservation, The American Nurses Association, and The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. 12 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Why Congress Should Not Undermine the Presidential Power of Appointment,</b> by Patrick Korten<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1044,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Patrick Korten, executive assistant director for Policy and Communication at the US Office of Personnel Management during the Reagan Administration, addresses the Congress' intention to reduce executive branch staff from 2,800 to 2,000. While Korten endorses the legislative branch reducing its own staff, he sees two unintended consequences with one branch reducing the staff of another: 1) since no overall reductions are made in the size of the executive branch bureaucracy, no money will be saved by eliminating 800 political appointees—their slots will be filled by career bureaucrats; and 2) since those slots would be filled with career bureaucrats, Congress would solidify the grip of Washington's "permanent government" on the operation of the federal establishment. 6 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Defenders Unclog Brace's Path to High Court</b><br>
Defenders of Property Rights has come to the aid of Pennsylvania farmer Bob Brace, who is being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He has been accused of violating federal wetlands statutes. Defenders has filed an amicus brief in support of Mr. Brace's petition to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The government claims Brace violated Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act when he upgraded his farm's drainage system in 1977. This improvement, which allowed him to farm thirty acres of land that was previously useful for little more than pasture, was cited as an unpermitted discharge of fill. The EPA ordered him to remove the drainage system to allow the land to return to its alleged "natural state" as a wetland. Failure to do so could subject him to fines as high as $25,000 a day.
Mr. Brace contends his changes to the property are permitted by the Clean Water Act. Section 404(f) states that discharge permits are not required for "normal farming activity," specifically stating "the maintenance of drainage ditches...is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under this section."<br>
Brace can expect word from the high court as to whether whey will hear his case sometime this fall.

The Institute filed an<i> amicus</i> brief in the pending U.S. Supreme Court case, <i>44 Liquormart v. State of Rhode Island.</i> This commercial speech case concerns a challenge to Rhode Island's prohibition on advertising the price of alcoholic beverages. The Institute's brief critiques the prohibition from the perspective of the ultimate beneficiary of commercial information: the consumer. Drawing on the works of Hayek, Friedman, and Stigler, the brief also documents the essential role of price information and advertising in a market economy. The brief concludes by arguing that commercial speech should be granted full constitutional protection.

<b>New Jersey Reform Confronts Another Hurdle After Big Victory</b><br>
The Legal Services Corporation of New Jersey has filed an appeal in response to a federal district court ruling, on March 4, in favor of the state's family cap welfare reform experiment. The Institute will continue to defend New Jersey's plan in the third circuit.<br>
The lawsuit in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the ground that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and constitutional rights. The Institute filed an<i> amicus</i> brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an activist role in defending the program.

<b>Landmark Files Academic Freedom Case Against University of Kansas</b><br>
Former University of Kansas Law School professor Emil A. Tonkovich is suing the University for pursuing a politically correct agenda designed to discredit the professor, a political and philosophical conservative. Landmark Legal Foundation is representing Professor Tonkovich, who was fired for allegedly sexually harassing a student.<br>
The controversy began I May of 1991, when a female student initially accused Tonkovich of making "a pass" at her following a school party three years ago. He has vehemently denied the charge. Several months later, this accusation mushroomed into an allegation of sex and sexual harassment. The allegation was uncorroborated and was contradicted by other female students.
"The widespread use of smear tactics to drive politically incorrect professors off campuses poses a dangerous threat to academic freedom in this country," said Landmark President Jerald L. Hill. "This lawsuit will help send the message that conservative professors will not be silenced."<br>

<b>New England Legal Foundation</b><br>
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Strikes Down Scheme that Raised Utility Costs
In a case in which the New England Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down an ordinance enacted by the city of Somerville which required utilities to pay a single contractor chosen by the city to do all excavation and paving work on city streets. The chosen contractor had used its government-created monopoly to charge utilities twice the rate it charged for such work in neighboring towns.<br>
The "City Contract Representative" was chosen by the city but paid by any utility that had to do street work. Bid specifications were so narrowly drawn that only one contractor qualified for the job. Utilities which refused to use the Representative were denied needed permits. The Representative had no incentive to work quickly nor, because its pay is based on the amount of asphalt used, efficiently. Because the city instructed the Representative to put the street into better condition than it was before being opened, it was able to make utilities and, ultimately, their customers pay for routine street work.<br>
An <i>amicus  </i>brief filed by NELF argued that the Somerville ordinance was not only unwise but that it exceeded the city's legal authority to maintain public streets and conflicted with state's supervisory power over utility regulation. In effect, NELF argued, Somerville had imposed an unauthorized and illegal tax on all utility customers. The Supreme Judicial Court has now agreed.

<b>NELF to File Brief in Connecticut Trespasser Tort Case</b><br>
In Hartford, Connecticut, a thief decided to steal from what appeared to be an abandoned electric switchbox, despite bold-faced warning signs posted in English and Spanish. When the thief was shocked and seriously injured, he sued the utility, claiming that it should have taken more care to protect potential thieves from possible injuries. A Superior Court judge in Connecticut threw out the case; the thief is appealing.<br>
NELF will file an<i> amicus </i>brief supporting the lower court. In this case, as in other recent Rhode Island and Vermont cases, NELF will argue that the traditional common law rule, that landowners are not obliged to spend money making their property safe for trespassers, is both good and sound public policy. Furthermore, NELF will argue that a state PUC rule, which requires utilities to take reasonable precautions to ensure that consumers and others are not endangered by company equipment, did not require anything more than the clear and visible warnings which the company did post.<br>

<b>Fighting Against Government Extortion</b><br>
<i>Ehrlich v. City of Culver City.</i> In June, PLF filed a friend of the court brief in the California Supreme Court in one of the most important "regulatory takings" cases to come before the state justices in 17 years. Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich's attempt to invalidate "mitigating" fees imposed on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing development.<br>
For several years, Mr. Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a town-house condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the building project on the condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts.<br>
PLF contends that the fee is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality test laid down last June by the U.S. Supreme Court in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard.</i> In<i> Dolan,</i> The Supreme Court invalidated a condition by the City of Tigard, Oregon, that a landowner give 10% of her property for public use in exchange for a permit to expand her plumbing supply store. Such conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exaction must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community.<br>
PLF helped Mr. Ehrlich win an order from the U.S. Supreme Court that 1) vacated a Court of Appeal ruling upholding the city's fees, and 2) sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions to reconsider in light of the <i>Dolan</i> decision. The Court of Appeal affirmed that development fees must meet the high level of scrutiny required by <i>Dolan.</i> Unfortunately, it misapplied the<i> Dolan </i>test to the facts of this case and held that the fee was related to the impacts caused by a change in land use designation needed for the construction of the condominiums.<br>
PLF also will assist Mr. Ehrlich's attorney in preparing for oral argument before the state Supreme Court.
<p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down Congressional Ballot Access Restrictions</b><br>
<i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton.</i> In a major setback for term limit proponents, the U.S. Supreme Court held on May 22, that voter-enacted ballot access restrictions on members of Congress are unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Justices held that the qualifications for congressional services set forth in the Constitution are "fixed" in that they may not be supplemented by Congress or the states. PLF, on behalf of Citizens for Term Limits filed friend of the court briefs in the case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case and arguing in support of Arkansas' ballot access measure, Amendment 73.<br>
Amendment 73, an amendment to Arkansas' constitution, prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for Congress form appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. That person could run as a write-in candidate, however. PLF attorneys argued, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution permits states to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of elections. They asserted that measures like Amendment 73 do not bar anyone from running for office, but only restrict ballot access in certain circumstances.<br>
The High Court ruled that the Constitution is the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress and that states may not add qualifications. Even though Amendment 73 allows congressional candidates to run as "write-in" candidates and serve if elected, the Court nevertheless considered this to be an indirect attempt at evading the Qualifications Clause's requirements.
The ruling has absolutely nothing to do with term limits on state officeholders. But according to recent news stories some term limit opponents are claiming the decision may open the door to a renewed challenge to term limits imposed on state legislators and constitutional officers. PLF successfully represented the proponents of California's Proposition 140 (state term limits) before the California and United Sates Supreme Courts. Any attempt to relitigate and overturn that settled victory will be met by a forceful defense by PLF attorneys.

<b>Important Rent Control Victory in New York Upheld</b><br>
<i>Manocherian v. Lenox Hill Hospital</i>. Late May, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review and let stand a key property rights decision by New York's highest court. Last October, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the state's rent control law relating to the subleasing of rent-stabilized apartments as applied to nonprofit hospitals. PLF filed a friend of the court brief in support of the property owner.<br>
Lenox Hill Hospital leases rent-stabilized apartments in New York and subleases them to its nurses as an employee benefit. Ten years ago, Lenox Hill Secured passage of a law that required apartment owners who lease apartments to the hospital to offer lease renewals directly to Lenox Hill rather than to the individual nurses who occupy the apartments. Because Lenox Hill has a perpetual corporate existence, this law has the effect of denying the owners any expectation of being able to reoccupy their property, as they could if their primary tenant was a natural person. <br>
New York's highest court declared the law to be unconstitutional for "not substantially advancing a closely and legitimately connected State interest."<br>
In its majority opinion, the Court of Appeals returned again and again to <i>Nollan's </i>requirement that property regulations be closely related to the advancement of a legitimate governmental interest. <i>Nollan </i>and other recent Supreme Court cases are seen to lay down "a constitutional minimum floor of protection which this Court lacks authority to diminish under the Supremacy Clause."<br>

<b>ACLU Sues School for Making Bibles Available to Students</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent Lynn Westfall because they agreed to allow a citizen group to place a box of free Bibles for students on school property. The Rutherford Institute represented the school board and the superintendent in the case tried before U.S. District Court Judge Irene M. Keeley.<br>
The case began on Dec. 6, 1994 when the school board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on Feb. 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis. As a result, on Feb. 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students while the case was pending.<br>
The Rutherford Institute asked the court to recognize that a public school's decision to permit outside groups to make free written materials available to students does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because the outside group chooses the Bible as the material to make available.

<b>Red Cross Retracts Attack on Religious Freedom Law</b><br>
The Red Cross has amended its motion to dismiss a religious discrimination case against it to exclude its prior argument that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is unconstitutional.

Because Hall was denied instructor certification in February 1993, The Rutherford Institute filed a complaint in February 1995 against the Red Cross in the Central District Court of California. In response, the Red Cross moved to dismiss the case, stating that RFRA is unconstitutional.

<b>Valedictorian to Deliver Religious Speech at Graduation</b><br>
DeSoto, Texas, May 22, 1995--Late yesterday, the DeSoto Independent School District agreed to allow valedictorian Shannon Leigh Welch to deliver an unedited graduation speech containing references to God and to religion. Gregory P. Gorman, a participating attorney with The Rutherford Institute, represented Welch. <br>
On May 18, 1995, Welch submitted her speech to the school's English Department for grammatical editing. As a result, school officials informed Welch that school policy required her to remove religious references and the words "God" and "Jesus Christ" from her speech. School officials also advised Welch to rewrite her speech.<br>
The Rutherford Institute, on May 21, 1995, hand delivered opinion letters to the school board, superintendent and principal, informing them that they were violating Welch's constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights by forcing her to remove religious references from her speech. In response, the school district reversed its position.

<b>WLF Assists Texas in Death Penalty Case</b><br>
At the request of the Texas Attorney General's Office, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas supporting the state's effort to carry out the death sentence imposed on a murderer who argued, in a <i>habeas corpus</i> petition, that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to execute him after his 12 years on death row. WLF's brief in the case, <i>Lackey v. Scott,</i> pointed out that his argument has no basis in the text of history of the Eight Amendment and that the inmate himself is responsible for creating the delay by availing himself of state and federal review procedures.
<p>
<b>Federal Court Asked to Dismiss Suit on "Three-Fifths" Rule for Tax Votes</b><br>
WLF filed a brief on behalf of itself and 22 Members of Congress urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss <i>Skaggs v. Carle, </i>a suit filed by Democratic Members of Congress to invalidate new House Rules that would make it more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. House Rule XXI (c)requires a three-fifths vote to raise taxes, and House Rule XXI (d) prohibits consideration of retroactive tax increases. WLF argued that the case is not justifiable and that each House of Congress has the power to set the rules of its own proceedings. WLF further pointed out that by the plaintiffs' reasoning, numerous long-standing congressional rules and practices would also be unconstitutional, including the Senate's cloture rule.

<b>WLF Supports Landowner in Fight Against Confiscatory Regulation</b><br> 
In <i>Ehrlich v. Culver, </i>WLF urged the Supreme Court of California to reverse a lower court decision that allowed a city to require a developer to pay for the construction of public tennis courts as a condition for letting the developer erect townhomes on his property. The city argues that because the developer was closing his private tennis club, the city needed money from him to replace his tennis courts. WLF argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard </i>allows a municipality to consider only the future effects of a development in assessing development exactions, not the property's prior use.<br>

Whitburn.</i> Under benefits for the first six months of their Wisconsin residence as if they were in their former state. WLF's brief opposes the suit brought by Legal Action of Wisconsin, which claims that the program violates the recipients' constitutional right to travel and that federal statutory and regulatory requirements governing research experiments on human subjects require Wisconsin to obtain the consent of all welfare recipients who are affected by the program.

<b>Constitutionality of "Official English" Defended in Ninth Circuit</b><br>
In <i>Yniguez v. State of Arizona, WLF </i>filed a brief on behalf of itself and the Center for Equal Opportunity in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of Arizona's "Official English" 1988 ballot measure, which amended the Arizona Constitution to require that the state and local governments of Arizona must act in English (with exceptions to protect public health or safety, to protect the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual education). Following passage of the measure, Arizona was sued by a state employee who claimed she has a First Amendment right to continue to practice conversing with Spanish-speaking malpractice claimants in Spanish and to continue filling out release-of claim forms in Spanish--a language that her supervisor did not understand, leaving him unable to review the forms. WLF's brief was filed before the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc, which will review the panel decision that accepted the employee's position and struck down the amendment in its entirety.<br>

<p><b>Retreat or Reform? Russia's Struggle for Democracy,</b> by Robert Halfon<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 62,</I> Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<p>Robert Halfon, director of research at Market Access International, a leading public affairs consultancy in the UK, points out that the re-emergence of hardline communism as a significant political force is a matter of great concern. He suggests that the real danger lies in the way in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic party justify Russian "sabre-rattling" in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, for the purpose of intimidating the West into accepting policies which may prove detrimental to its interests. Halfon cites the military-industrial complex and the former KGB leaders as other areas where communists still present an obstacle to liberalization. Therefore, the author concludes, western democracies have a crucial role to play in identifying and promoting Russian democratic groups and leaders and encouraging their political programs. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, ENGLAND, W1P 3FP, 0171/637-2152, or fax 0171/637-2155.

<p><b>Spending Wisely, Not Just More: What Does a 21st Century Defense Require?,</b> by Philip Gold<br>
<i>Inquiry April 1995,</i> The Discovery Institute
<p>Philip Gold, a Discovery Institute Senior Fellow and director of their Aerospace 2010 project, analyzes the spending habits of the military establishment since the end of the Cold War. This paper questions the ability of the military to deal effectively with the New World disorder, in light of recent cutbacks. Gold also explores why increased spending will be necessary in certain technological areas. The author argues that, in the long run, the proper course is not to spend more but to spend more wisely.

<p><b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act: Helping to Create a Free and Prosperous Cuba,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 208,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson examines the possible effects of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which is currently before the Senate. He encourages the Senate to take this opportunity to strengthen the bill which passed the House by including several measures: 1) strengthen the provision prohibiting international financial institutions from providing loans and guarantees to Castro's Cuba; 2) create a provision designating as a hostile act any move by Castro to unleash a mass exodus of illegal emigrants; 3) restore Cuba's share of US sugar import quotas to near its 1958 level once Castro is gone and a democratic transition government is in place; 4) eliminate language authorizing the President to provide government-subsidized financing and other programs to a post-Castro Cuba; 5) direct the President to seek a free trade area agreement with a post-Castro Cuba; and 6) require that the President begin processing the 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo for controlled entry into the US. Johnson proposes that these measures will tighten the existing embargo and help end Castro's 40 year nightmare in Cuba. 10 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>NATO and US Interests, </b>by W. Bruce Weinrod<br>
<i>Commonsense, Vol. 2 No. 1,</i> National Policy Forum
<p>W. Bruce Weinrod, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy in the Bush administration, outlines and addresses the serious questions being raised about the relevance and future of NATO. As the United States and its European allies enter a new era in international politics, NATO must decide how its role and membership reflect this new era. Weinrod writes, "The best way for NATO to help assure a Europe 'whole and free' is to bring the democratic nations of Europe closer to NATO, with the objective of making them members." In order to clarify these decisions for NATO, the US must first clarify many of the foggy points of its own foreign policy, and the current administration must be willing to exert its leadership over this process. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Policy Forum, 229<P8M><$E1/2><P255D> Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-2900.

<p><b>Do We Need the IMF and the World Bank?,</b> by Sir Alan Walters<br>
<i>Current Controversies No. 10,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Before embarking on any new initiatives for either the IMF or the World Bank, Walters suggests, these two powerful institutions are overdue for a performance re-examination. Walters, having formerly served as an economic advisor to the Prime Minister, points out that attempts to downsize the Fund and the Bank always end up making them larger. The author also acknowledges that both institutions, besides outgrowing their original purposes, have become increasingly political¾ particularly in the case of Russia, where normal conditions have been relaxed. Walters concludes, "ideally the Bank and the Fund should be abolished. If central banks want a central bankers' bank they (not governments) should control it."

<p><b>About-Turn in Hungarian Foreign Policy,1990-1994, </b>by Iván Bába<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 2,</i> Windsor Klub
<p>Once known as the Happiest Barracks in the Camp, Hungary did more than any other ex-Warsaw Pact state after 1989 to undo the legacy of the international order created by the Cold War. Guided by the statesmanlike vision of Prime Minister József Antall, Hungarian foreign policy between 1990 and 1994 consistently pursued the aims of Euro-Atlantic integration and regional co-operation. Despite the break-up of no less than three neighboring countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union), Hungary remained an important source of stability and pro-Western resolve. In this study, the deputy state secretary at the foreign ministry for these years assesses the successes and failures of his country's policies¾ and considers the impact that last year's electoral victory by the Socialist Party will have on Hungary's acceding to such institutions as NATO and the EU. 29 pp. CONTACT: Johnathan Sunley, Windsor Klub, Falk Miksa utca 12.I.1a, Budapest 1055, HUNGARY, 361/112-3701

<p><h3><i>Commerce, Infrastructure and Regulation</h3></i>

<p><b>Red Tape In America: Stories From The Front Line,</b> by Craig E. Richardson and Geoff C. Ziebart, The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Heritage Foundation's report on American bureaucracy reveals the horror stories that result from a regulatory system that has become not merely ineffective but harmful. This study begins by reviewing the general impact of government regulation and then examines specific federal agencies and statutes. Among these are the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, the Internal Revenue Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Americans with Disability Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The cases documented in this report provide irrefutable proof of the degree to which government regulation has harmed both individuals and businesses, stifling creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. 110 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Fixing the Roads: A Blueprint for Michigan Transportation Infrastructure Policy,</B> by John C. Taylor<br>
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy 
<p>This comprehensive analysis of Michigan's transportation argues that policy makers must fundamentally reinvent the planning, funding, construction, and maintenance procedures for the state's roads. The federal government returns to Michigan about half the revenues the state sends to Washington from the federal fuel tax. The author projects a savings of over $170 million in the state's department of transportation budget if the state adopted various reforms, including more privatization, tort reform, and relaxation of unrealistic environmental regulations. This study will prove useful to transportation analysts in most other states, as well. 40 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<p><b>The Minimum Wage: No Way to Help the Poor,</b> by Deepak Lal<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 95,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Deepak Lal, a professor of International Development Studies at UCLA, examines the controversy among economists about the effects of a minimum wage. Despite the many recent studies which apparently support the views of politicians in Britain and the US, minimum wages would have widespread effects on labor markets: they would, for example, reduce human capital formations because they would compress the wage structure and undermine incentives to acquire skills. Thus, support for a minimum wage is "at odds with the desire to promote skill accumulation by unskilled workers¾ particularly the young and females. The author suggests that those who fear a situation where workers do not properly market their skills should still be wary of the minimum wage since "there is not obvious technocratic solution which would be better than that discovered by the market." 38 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London, England  SW1P 3LB, 071/799-3745.

<p><b>A Higher Standard of Living in Right-to Work States,</b> by James T. Bennett<br>
National Institute for Labor Relations Research
<p>James Bennett's study reveals that residents of Right-to-Work states have higher real incomes on average than the residents of states where workers are forced to pay union dues. In his report Bennett shows that after adjusting for state and local taxes and inflation, the average family in a Right-to-Work state has $2,852 more in purchasing power than a family in a forced-unionism state. The author writes, "In states without Right-to-Work laws high taxes and the high cost of living erode the purchasing power of income so much that families in states with Right-to-Work laws are, on average, better off." This study compares 1993 state and local taxes, as well as the cost of living, in those metropolitan areas in Right-to-Work states to those in forced-unionism states. 12 pp. CONTACT: National Institute for Labor Relations Research, 8001 Braddock Rd., Suite 510, Springfield, VA 22160, 703/321-9606, fax 703/321-7342.

<p><b>The Urgent Need to Finish Farm Trade Reform,</b> by Thomas J. Duesterberg<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 177,</i> Hudson Institute 
<p>Senior Fellow and Director of the Competitiveness Center Thomas Duesterberg demonstrates that the developing world is experiencing a tremendous growth in demand for bulk foodstuffs and processed foods, as the economies of these countries continue to prosper. Duesterberg forecasts that the US agricultural industry is one of the few in the world that can meet this growing demand in an environmentally friendly way. Despite considerable obstacles in much of the developing world¾ including outright bans on many Asian countries, severe restraints, and high tariffs¾ US agricultural exports achieved record sales in 1994. This paper concludes that the US, in order to take advantage of the coming increase in worldwide food demand, must unshackle US producers, and US trade negotiators must take aggressive steps to remove barriers to worldwide trade in bulk and processed agricultural products. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Redesigning CERCLA Liability: An Analysis of the Issues,</b> by Kathleen Segerson<br>
Policy Study No. 187, Reason Foundation
<p>This policy study, prepared by University of Connecticut economics professor Kathleen Segerson, examines reform options for Superfund liability. Segerson explores strict liability, joint and several liability, and retroactive liability as they function in current Superfund law and suggests that the present system does not allocate risks and costs effectively or fairly. She concludes that in cases of retroactive application, strict liability should be eliminated and a negligence-based rule should be adopted for both care and mitigation; and in cases of prospective application, strict liability should be retained, and joint and several liability should be eliminated, except when the parties have a contractual relationship. 20 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>A Report Card on the Pressler Telecommunications Plan (S. 652),</b> by Adam D. Thierer<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 209,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Adam Thierer, Walker Fellow in Economic Policy examines why the leading telecommunications deregulation bill in the Senate misses the opportunity to benefit consumers by opening the industry to real competition. This paper explains that the Senate must make several major changes to the current bill, since it currently does not address several issues: some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect; foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of US industry and could be enforced retroactively after repeal; no serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the agency; no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to encourage increased wireless competition; and the current bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that discourage industry competition. 17 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><h3><i>Taxation and Budget</h3></i>

<b><p>Jobs, Growth, Freedom and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax,</b> by Daniel J. Mitchell<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1035,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Armey flat tax proposal has been wildly popular with American taxpayers, not only due to its simplicity but also because of its fairness and potential for producing economic growth. But many taxpayers are not aware of other positive effects of the flat tax: 1) the flat tax would boost national wealth by $1 trillion, since investments would be guided by profitability rather than tax status. 2) a flat tax would treat people equally, no longer penalizing taxpayers based on success or income. 3) Armey's plan would end micromanagement and political favoritism, ridding the tax code of all deduction, loopholes, credits, and special preferences. 4) the flat tax would increase civil liberties by increasing the rights of a taxpayer under IRS investigation. 5) the flat tax would increase tax collections from the wealthy, since the proposal includes incentives to earn and report taxable income. Mitchell concludes that the most important benefit from the flat tax proposal is the reduction of the power of the federal government in taxpayers' lives and businesses. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Who Really Gains from the Capital Gains Tax?,</b> by Alan Reynolds<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 175,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Director of Economic Research Alan Reynolds demonstrates why the capital gains tax is an extremely inefficient method of raising revenue. Reynolds claims that  the capital gains tax is easy to avoid, and reporting and monitoring costs are high. The paper reveals that an even worse effect is that the tax decreases the market value of investments and real estate and hinders the economy's allocation of capital assets to their most effective uses. The paper contends that reducing the captial gains tax to to no more than 15 percent, and indexing the basis, would make many people better off (particularly workers) without making anyone worse off. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Why You Can't Trust the IRS,</b> by Daniel J. Pilla<br>
Policy Analysis No. 222, Cato Institute
<p>Daniel Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, forecasts that some 40 million Americans will have had an adversarial confrontation with the IRS by the end of this year. In a rising number of cases, the taxpayer is right, and the IRS is wrong. This study finds that despite a doubling of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering and enforcing the nation's tax law. This report cites several reasons the IRS can no longer be trusted, including: 1) the IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5 million Americans the wrong answers to even the most basic inquiries about tax laws; 2) this year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion in fines and penalties¾ about half of these notices will be wrong; 3) about 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties¾ in 1993 taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion; and 4) a General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence; the IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation. Pilla reasons that since the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability that it imposes on the citizenry, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to police American businesses and taxpayers. 32 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>The Coming Taxpayer Bailout of Social Security,</b> by Gary and Aldona Robbins<br>
<i>IPI Policy Report No. 130,</i> The Institute for Policy Innovation
<p>This study argues that the disappearance of the Social Security Trust fund is due to two factors. First, the US economy has performed more poorly than expected. The last recession, combined with expectations of slower future growth, has caused almost one-quarter of the payroll tax base to evaporate. Second, the Social Security program is making promises it cannot keep, committing to replacing about 42 percent of the average worker's salary in retirement, as contrasted with the one-third of salary replacement promised during Social Security's first three decades. Meanwhile, Medicare benefits are also growing at an even more alarming rate. The authors point out that the revenues necessary to support this rapid growth in Social Security and Medicare will claim almost 15 percent of the US economy within the next 35 years, giving the federal government even greater control over the productive resources of Americans than it already has. The report states that the only way to secure the retirement of the baby boomers is to boost US economic growth and slow the rate of benefit growth. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

<p><b>The Pension Funds Bail-Out: The Biggest Boondoggle Ever,</B> by Steven Plaut<br>
<i>Policy View No. 12,</i> The Shalem Center
<p>Plaut, a professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of Haifa, analyses the Israeli government's proposed bail-out of the Histadrut Labor Federation's collapsed pension funds and how to solve the problem. Plaut asserts that passage of the deal would be an unprecedented blow to the Israeli economy: the price tag is estimated at $33 billion, about 40 percent of Israel's annual GDP. This is roughly 15 times the size (proportionally) of the American saving and loan bailout of the 1980s. This study shows that the worst part of the bail-out is the plan's inability to address the causes of the crisis. The bail-out leaves the management of the pension funds in the hands of the very people who oversaw the creation of the present actuarial deficits. It does nothing to change the monopolistic, uncompetitive structure of the pension industry in Israel, nor does it address the lack of independent supervision of the pension industry. Plaut recommends that free entry and competition should be allowed among pension plans; issuing subsidized government bonds to the pension funds must end at once; actuarial solvency must be made mandatory, and an independent supervisory body must be established to shut down plans not in compliance. 17 pp. CONTACT: The Shalem Center National Policy Institute, 5 Eliash St., Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 02/254-185, or fax 02/256-720. 

<p><b>Excise Tax and Economic Growth in Indiana,</b> by John E. Berthoud<br>
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, May 1995 
<p>This paper examines the ramifications of excise taxes for Indiana. John Berthoud, Adjunct Scholar at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, outlines the role of excise taxes in the state budget and questions the economic consequences on Indiana. Berthoud discusses why, despite the myth that excise taxes are "painless," they cause states such as Indiana substantial and widespread economic harm. Berthoud concludes, "While it is crucial to keep taxes on productive activity such as work and investment low, because of the dangers of cross-border activity, it is also critical to keep excise taxes low." 26 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, Virginia 22201, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<p><b>The Case for  "Strings-Attached" Welfare Reform,</b> by Robert Rector<br>
<i>The Heritage Lectures No. 524,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>In his address to the Eighteenth Annual Resource Bank  Meeting in Philadelphia, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector discusses the proper relationship between the welfare state and federalism. Rector warns that while many want to move the welfare bureaucracy out of the hands of Washington, the welfare bureaucracy in the states is even larger and more entrenched. This lecture describes the costs and benefits of several different types of welfare reform currently under consideration and analyzes them based on their ability to reduce the welfare system. Rector concludes that "Conservatives at the federal level must unite with conservatives at the state level and surround the liberal bureaucracy and attack it from two directions at once, pushing conservative policies both at the federal level and at the state level." 5 pp.  CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Integrated Systems in Frontier Health Care Delivery: The Unique Needs of Wyoming,</b> 
edited by Sheryl R. Fox and Alexander T. Hunt<br>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>This report provides an overview of frontier health care delivery issues from varying perspectives and suggests possible technological and structural solutions to reform health care delivery systems in rural and frontier states. Specifically, the report examines the potential for telemedicine to improve rural health care systems and assesses both the economic implications of telemedicine for health care providers as well as obstacles to its implementation. Contributors raise several key points: First, national health care reform, by its very nature, will be anti-rural, transferring rural wealth to urban areas through whatever taxes are used to extend coverage to the uninsured. Second, in reforming health care, states like Wyoming will most likely need to develop networks based on providers to maximize access to health services. Third, telemedicine, the transmission of image and data via communications technology used by health care providers for treatment, diagnosis, and education of patients irrespective of distance, offers a way to bridge the health care gap in frontier states. This report is the summary of the CSIS Health Care Forum Series. 39 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20006, 202/887-0200.

Veith describes the work of Idaho Minister Douglas Wilson who has founded a network of private schools: The Association of Classical and Christian Schools.

<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts: A Building Block for Sound Health Care,</b> by Stephen Barchet<br>
The Evergreen Freedom Foundation
<p>Stephen Barchet, chairman of the Washington Medical Savings Account Project, presents his findings from a study to evaluate whether Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are a viable health care alternative. The study was completed through on-site investigations of companies using MSAs, and their research revealed the following facts: 1) reduced health care expenditures to both the sponsor/employer and employees; 2) wiser use of health services by consumers; 3) greater use of preventative services; 4) increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; and 5) strong employee participation and satisfaction. Barchet also finds that the sick and poor are better served than in many "managed-care" programs, since they have the same access to health care as everyone else. This study confirms that people controlling their own health care dollars with MSAs do not need huge central bureaucracies to make intimate health care decisions for them. MSAs allow patient choice, high quality medical service, and lower spending¾ all of the benefits government plans promise without the costly, inefficient invasion of a centrally run bureaucracy. 54 pp. CONTACT: The Evergreen Freedom Foundation, P.O.

<p><b>SSI: The Black Hole of the Welfare State,</b> by Christopher M. Wright<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 224,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Christopher Wright examines why the current reforms of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program fall far short of the dramatic overhaul that the open-ended entitlement program needs. The author states that the ultimate goal should be to privatize disability insurance programs. In the meantime, any serious attempts to reform the system, according to Wright, should include the following: 1) ending automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 2) eliminating retroactive lump sum payments; 3) abolishing all SSI assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics; 4) establishing an enrollment cap for SSI. This study concludes that unless the program's costs are brought under control, by the year 2000 SSI will be larger than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized housing, the earned income tax credit, and all other forms of public assistance except Medicaid. Major reform, and ultimately privatization, are needed to rein in this costly and corrupt entitlement program. 35 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

This report call for a departure in the way America administers its social welfare programs, stating that what most poor people want are opportunities and responsibilities, not just rights and entitlements. As a result of their findings, the task force has found three principles fundamental to turning the tide of poverty: first, funding and authority for designing and providing services to the poor should be devolved not just from the federal government to the state level, but to the community-based organizations that demonstrate success in dealing with the problems of poverty. Second, individuals and communities must be empowered to create their own solutions through policies that emphasize personal and financial asset development. Third, the present maintenance-focused welfare system must be replaced by policies that promote strong families and emphasize personal responsibility and the development of self-sufficiency. 25 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1367 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1103.

<p><b>Government Contracts Reform: A Critical Analysis of the Administration's Proposal, </b>
by Jed L. Babbin and Thomas Earl Patton<br>
<i>Critical Legal Issues: Working Paper Series No. 63,</i> Washington Legal Foundation
<p>This working paper argues that the Clinton Administration's bid protest reform proposal is flawed in its reliance on faulty statistical analysis and its failure to recognize the importance of bid protests in the government procurement process. The authors demonstrate how the flaws in the data underlying the administration's recommendations include overstatement of the number of contract awards actually protested and exaggeration of the amount of time protested contracts are delayed. This paper claims that the Administration's opposition to these recommendations overlooks the General Services board of Contract Appeals process, which allows judges dealing with a complex information technology protest to be experienced in technical issues, providing a suspension mechanism to compel and agency to stop performance of the contract during the protest period. The authors suggest some solutions to bid protest problems, including the imposition of liability for frivolous protests, disallowing protest costs for protests that are not granted in their overhead pools, and requiring alternative dispute resolution before proceeding with protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals or the General Accounting Office. 23 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<p><b>The Case for Fundamental Tort Reform,</b> by Michael J. Horowitz<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 176,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Horowitz maintains that the lawyers' monopoly of access to the courts allows them to impose a 33.33 to 40 percent toll charge on all damage recoveries, even in cases in which defendants are willing to pay on a rapid, no-dispute basis. Contingency fees, the near-uniform means of compensating tort claim attorneys, can provide risk-free windfall of profits to lawyers while harming defendants, plaintiffs, and the economy as a whole. Horowitz demonstrates that true reform of the US tort system should include early offer reforms, which seek to ensure the settlement of large numbers of cases before expensive trials and pretrial proceedings, and contingency fee reform, which protects clients from having to pay their attorneys windfall fees far out of proportion to the work performed and the risks assumed in taking a case. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>A Citizens Guide to Lawsuit Abuse,</b> by James Gattuso and Joe Rubin<br>
<i>Citizens for a Sound Economy,</i> April 1995. 
<p>This guide to lawsuit abuse chronicles the effects of lawsuit abuse in everyday life, revealing products that are not available to consumers and higher prices directly due to companies' fears of lawsuits. This report points out that despite the enormous costs of lawsuits, most of the costs are not even delivered to victims, but rather more the half the costs goes to lawyers. The authors suggest several broad reforms: ensure that the law targets wrondoers, not those with the most money; end the lottery mentality of lawsuits; and deter frivolous lawsuits. 8 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005,  202/783-3870.

<p><b>Punitive Damages: Once Is Enough,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 150,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at the Center for the Study of American Business, states that, under certain limited conditions, granting punitive damages can have merit. However, the author warns, the current practice of allowing punitive damages to be awarded over and over again to different plaintiffs against the same defendant for essentially the same issues is illogical. Mahoney presents the results of an informal survey conducted among a large group of American firms: a representative group of 43 large corporations reported that in the past five years a total of $4.4 billion was involved in settlements driven by punitive damages. Mahoney suggests the most practical answer available is legislation at the federal level, like the Hatch bill, that would forbid the repeated award of punitive damages for the same issue. In addition, in order to protect potential claimants against a single punitive award foreclosing a later, larger amount, judges would be empowered to permit punitive damages a second time if the first award was held to be an "insufficient deterrent." 14 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, One Brooking Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5682.

<p><b>The 1995 Crime Bills: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?, </b>
by Jarett B. Decker<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 229,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Attorney Jarett B. Decker asserts that everyday crime that disrupts American life is largely a local problem, best handled by state and local law enforcement agencies. Despite this, Congress has become increasingly involved in fighting crime on a federal level, in order to be perceived as being active on the issue of crime. Decker states that the 1995 GOP crime bills introduced in the House and Senate promise more of the same, but with unprecedented provisions what would threaten freedom and undermine the fair administration of justice: the Senate bill includes a provision that would exempt federal prosecutors from the rules of legal ethics; both the Senate and House crime bills would enable federal agents to invade homes, raid businesses, and conduct humiliating body searches without legal justification, while reaping the benefits of evidence collected through such illegal searches; and the Senate bill would enable federal agents to detain citizens, hold them incommunicado, interrogate them for day, weeks or months, and use any of their statements in any subsequent prosecution. 41 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>Slashing Congressional Spending, Part I: Congressional Pay, Pensions, Perks, and Staff,</b> by Dan Greenberg<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1034,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Heritage Congressional Analyst Dan Greenberg states that, despite the initial cutbacks imposed on the Congress by the new Republican leadership, further steps are necessary to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. This paper cites several problems with these initial reforms: 1) automatic pay raises are still scheduled each year; 2) Congressional pensions far exceed most private sector plans and benefits exceed those of most other federal employees; 3) taxpayer-funded mailings, travel, and other perks are abused to promote incumbents' reelection bids; and 4) Congress remains the most heavily staffed legislature in the world. Greenberg addresses each of these continuing problems and warns the new Congress not to become complacent. 15 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

This booklet gives its readers four ways to fight religious censorship: 1) fully understanding one's religious beliefs; 2) supporting freedom of expression for all; 3) asserting one's rights and those of others; 4) teaching values to children.

<p><h2><i>Legal Action</h2></i>

<b><p>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE
<p>New Jersey Family Cap Found Constitutional</b><br>
On May 4, 1995, a federal judge ruled in favor of New Jersey's family cap welfare reform experiment.  The lawsuit filed in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the grounds that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and consitutional rights. The judge stated in his decision that the cap "does not violate any statutory or constitutional mandate," thus upholding the validity of the federal waiver and the program. 
The Institute for Justice filed an amicus brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an active role in defending the program. 17 states are currently pursuing similar programs to reform their welfare systems.

<p><b>Institute Challenges Barriers to Interracial Adoption</b ><br>
On April 13, 1995, the Institute for Justice launched a nationwide challenge to "race matching" by state agencies to establish a rule of law that racial discrimination in adoptions is unconstitutional. Its first two test cases are in Texas and Tennessee. In Austin, Texas, the Institute filed a class action lawsuit against the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, the agency charged with protecting abandoned and neglected children. In Memphis, Tennessee, the Institute joins as co-counsel in an ongoing federal class action, Reisman v. Tennessee Dept. of Human Services. In Reisman, the plaintiff class of minority children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Human Services challenges the use of racial classifications in the adoptive placement process. Joining the Institute as co-counsel in Texas will be Harvard Law Professors Elizabeth Bartholet, Randall Kennedy, and Laurence Tribe.

<p><b>Repealing the Davis-Bacon Act: Round I</b><br>
In an order released on May 8, federal judge William B. Bryant denied the government's motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act, filed by the Institute for Justice on behalf of minority contractors and public housing tenant groups on the ground that the law is racially discriminatory. The law, which requires "prevailing wages" on nearly all federal contracts, was passed in 1931 and aimed at restricting minority entrepreneurs and workers from competing with mainly white construction unions. The US Department of Labor, which is defending the law, argued that the law was not enacted for discriminatory purposes and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. In a one page order, the court refused to do so, allowing the case to proceed.

A conservative student magazine at the University of Virginia won its appeal of a decision to defund the publication because it was a "political organization." With the assistance of Landmark Legal Foundation, students who publish <i>The Virginia Advocate</i> fought the student council decision citing their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws.</i> The Virginia Advocate</i> is the only conservative student publication at the University of Virginia.
The students' appeal was heard on May 3, 1995 by the University's Student Activites Committee, whose chairman is dean of students Robert Canevari.<i> The Virginia Advocate</i>'s editor, Ellen J. Riegel, argued the magazine's appeal. Landmark's attorney, Pete Hutchison, provided a legal memorandum to the committee outlining the constitutional infirmity of the decision.
Landmark told the committee that the student council's decision "violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws to the students who publish<i> The Virginia Advocate </i>through viewpoint discrimination." The Foundation also pointed out student council funding of such groups as Straight and Gay for Equality, which promotes candidates and legislation advancing a liberal agenda, and a wide range of other organizations promoting a liberal agenda.

<b><p>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.

<p>Foundation Sues Clinton to Enjoin Strike Order</b><br>
National Right to Work attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt enforcement of a Clinton executive order prohibiting federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strke. The order enacted the policies of the so-called "Anti-Striker Replacement" legislation which Congress has twice rejected.
"The President trampled on the rights of workers by unilaterally enacting policies to punish workers who choose to work during a strike. He's sweeping the Constitution under the rug so he can please his Big Labor friends," said National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Timothy McConville.
Attorneys from the Foundation filed the suit in US District Court in Washington, DC, on behalf of Representatives John Doolittle (CA), David Funderburk (NC), Ernest Istook (OK), and Harris Fawell (IL). The complaint charges that by issuing the executive order, President Clinton has usurped the constitutional authority soley vested in the Congress to make laws and regulate commerce.
"Most observers agree the result will be more strikes, McConville said. "Union officials would call any strike they want and win every strike they call as easily as pushing a button. With more strike powers, the union officials will have more power to force workers to pay union dues, busting holes in state Right to Work laws."

<b><p>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>NELF Coalition Wins Complete Victory in RI Tidal Land Litigation</b><br>
Four years ago the Rhode Island Supreme Court released an opinion which implied that land ever below the median high tide mark ("tidal land") might be subject to a "public trust." That decision raised the threat that the state might be allowed to charge fees or impose public access requirements for use of such land. Because the commercial heart of Providence is tidal land, the implications of the court's decision on the state's economy were troubling. Title insurance and mortgage for this land became difficult to purchase.
NELF responded to this challenge over the next four years by organizing a coalition of the state's major landowners. The coalition decided that the best way to resolve the uncertainty brought about by the court decision was to initiate a second, test case which would give the court a chance to clarify and, hopefully, minimize the scope of the public trust. NELF helped prepare the test plaintiff's brief and filed its own amicus brief on behalf of a number of major Providence landowners.
The first major development in the case came last year when the state conceded that the most important part of the Providence tidal land, the "cove," was free from trust. Last month the Rhode Island Supreme Court decided the remaining issue, the status of the remaining "harbor line" tidal lands. This final decision is a complete victory landowners. The court held that all land which a landowner has filled out to a legislatively established harbor line becomes completely free from any trust. Downtown Providence's landowners have now been confirmed in the full ownership rights they thought they had possessed all along.
<p><b>Connecticut Court Joins Chorus Striking Down Ban on Phone Companies' Entry into Cable TV</b><br>
In a case in which NELF filved an amicus brief on behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) and the New England Council, the US District Court in Hartford, Connecticut has joined the growing number of federal courts which have struck down the ban on local telephone companies' entering the cable television industry. NELF, CBIA, and the Council argued that the ban violated the first amendment rights of not only the local telephone company, Southern New Telecommunications, but it also unconstitutionally limited the television choices that should be coming available to consumers. As the entertainment and communication industries grown ever closer, NELF intends to work to ensure that local telephone companies can become major sources of innovation and competition in the telecommunications industry.
<p><b>NELF to Enter Massachusetts Employment Sex Harassment Case</b><br>
NELF will file an amicus brief in the Massachusetts Appeals Court supporting the dismissal of an employee's sex harassment case. The case was dismissed because of the plaintiff's failure to have used the comprehensive procedures of the Massachusetts employment discrimination act, Mass. G.L. c. 151B. A Superior Court judge held that this failure precludes her suing her employer on any "corollary claim" arising out of the same facts. In this case that meant that the employee's claims of statutory sexual harassment, violation of equal rights, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were all barred. the court's reasoning followed closely two Massachusetts Supreme Judiciial Court cases in which NELF was involved last year.

<p>Supreme Court Lets WLF Civil Rights Victory Stand</b><br>
On May 22, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the pathbreaking Fourth Circuit decision in favor of WLF's client, a Hispanic student, in his suit against the University of Maryland's black-only scholarship program.  The Court had been urged by the Clinton Administration and more than 60 interest groups and universities to reverse WLF's victory, which calls into question the legality of race-based scholarship programs at public universities across the country.  The suit was part of WLF's effort to oppose government programs that classify citizens by race.

<p><b>WLF Appeals in Challenge to Texas IOLTA Program</b><br>
WLF has asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas's Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, which requires attorneys to turn over interest generated by their clients' trust accounts to fund legal services organizations.  In 1992, more than $150 million was raised by IOLTA programs nationwide, nearly $10 million in Texas alone.  WLF argued that the program violates the First Amendment by forcing Texans to associate with political causes with which they disagree and that it violates the Fifth Amendment by taking their property without just compensation.  WLF's suit, now on appeal, was rejected by a federal district judge in January.

<p><b>WLF Supports Virginia Against EPA</b><br>
WLF has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit supporting Virginia's lawsuit against the EPA over the agency's requirement that Virginia change its rules for standing in its state courts.  The EPA has ordered Virginia to allow third parties the right to obtain judicial review of emissions permit approvals, whether or not the parties would have standing to sue under state law.  The EPA's position, if upheld, would enable groups such as the Sierra Club to impede the expansion or modernization of plants even where the state has given its approval.  WLF argued that Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to require this radical expansion of the availability of third-party standing in state courts.

<b><p>WLF Brief Opposes Racial Gerrymandering</b><br>
WLF, representing Congressman Gary Franks, urged the Supreme Court in Miller v. Johnson to strike down Georgia's redistricting plan on the grounds that it improperly drew lines so as to segregate black and white voters into separate congressional districts.  Under pressure from the Justice Department, the Georgia legislature created a district in 1992 with a strange layout, having uninhabited "land bridges" as little as a mile wide to connect black sections of urban areas.  WLF argued that such racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional and also pointed out that black candidates such as Rep. Franks have won elections in majority-white districts.

<b><p>WLF Urges Court to Recognize Constitutional Limits On Punitive Damages</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Court should strike down an Alabama court's $2 million punitive damages award against BMW.  The suit was brought by a physician who learned that BMW had refinished the car to repair slight paint defects incurred during shipment to the United States. WLF argued that the award, which was 500 times the amount of the economic damage suffered by the car buyer, was clearly excessive and violated due process.<br>

<b>The Return of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights<br>
Hadley Arkes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994)
</b>
<P>
   Conventional histories of the Supreme Court
describe George Sutherland, who was seated at the Court from 1922
to 1938, as a mainstay of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
 a sinister reactionary whose blunt, ideological dissents were
blindly devoted to business interests but failed to engage or
accept the emerging reality of the New Deal constitutional revolution.
Hadley Arkes's remarkable intellectual history, "The Return
of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights,"
reveals a far more subtle and textured portrait of Sutherland:
a sophisticated political thinker who was able to intellectually
outflank his philosophical adversaries and was willing to follow
the logic of his principles even when they drove him outside of
the respectable opinion of his day. Arkes's book is a compelling
portrait of a life animated by ideas, ideas that inspired Sutherland,
at the age of twenty, to copy paragraphs of natural rights theory
into his commonplace book (one of its pages is reproduced as Arkes's
frontispiece) and, at a more advanced age, to import its abstractions
into the often dry details of the law.     But the law, and the
controversies that it raises, are anything but dry when Arkes
describes them. He discusses a hidden Sutherland, one who led
the fight in the Senate for women's suffrage by making Lincolnesque
arguments about natural rights. On the Court, Sutherland reading
the categorical language of the First Amendment argued that the
Constitution categorically barred Congress from placing any limits
on the freedom of the press. In short, for a reactionary, he was
surprisingly progressive even, in some respects, radical.    
<P>
 Arkes sketches a compelling profile of Sutherland and the philosophical
tradition that he represents, demonstrating how the opinions of
the preRoosevelt Court that are generally held to embody a reactionary,
probusiness agenda turn out to benefit employees and the general
public as much or more than they benefit employers. The Old Court
struck down Arizona's law requiring that 80% of a business's workers
be nativeborn; without Court action, Mike Raich  an Austrian immigrant
 would have been out of a job. Sutherland's opinion, in a case
in which a minimum wage for women (but not for men) was struck
down, permitted women to hold onto their jobs, rather than being
displaced by men legally empowered to work for less money. But
the key to understanding Sutherland's jurisprudence is precisely
that he avoided making judgments of constitutionality on utilitarian
grounds, insisting that a coherent theory of natural rights would
lead to a compelling constitutional vision. Sutherland steadfastly
refused to take judicial notice of the happy coincidence that
his constitutional theories would also benefit the public.   
<P> Arkes, through his examination of Sutherland, makes plain what
the reserved language of Sutherland's judicial opinions are sometimes
only able to hint at: that the intellectual foundations of the
modern welfare state rest only on thin air. The knowledge of the
details of complex commercial enterprises that its regulations
presume are rarely to be found in those who would draft them.
The justice of the benefits and burdens that price regulation
attaches arbitrarily to various activities is difficult to justify
or discern. Arkes's description of Brandeisian jurisprudence,
an almost perfect foil to Sutherland's work, is penetrating, even
withering, especially when Arkes sketches how painfully oblivious
Brandeis is to contrary arguments.
  <P>
   Arkes also demonstrates
how Sutherland's fidelity to the bounded nature of the concepts
and texts judges must work with determines his decisions in the
cases before him. Sutherland's strict attention to the history
and meaning of such terms of constitutional art as "commerce,"
"delegation," and "general welfare" and, more
generally, to the necessary implications of the structure of the
Constitution guards against an interpretive slippage that leads
to unlimited government discretion. His method is a refreshing
change from much constitutional law today, which uses crucially
unmoored concepts like "dignity" to get the Court where
its judges want it to go. A problem with this approach  one which
Sutherland's more formal approach solves  is that, without careful
attention to the meaning and limits of words in the law, they
function much like Rorschach inkblots, revealing more about the
way their witnesses think and what they want to do than anything
else.
<P>
      Arkes's book makes a persuasive case that we need more
of Justice Sutherland's radicalism in the world today  a radicalism
that Arkes sets against both the common law's remnants of sympathy
for regulation as well as its continuation in the modern New Deal
state. It is a radicalism that should find many sympathizers.
Those who are deemed unfit to provide for themselves and for their
families because of the terrifying dangers of unregulated taxicabs,
haircuts, and shoeshine stands  as well as other victims of the
regulatory state would likely be sympathetic to Sutherland's views
that people have natural rights to occupational freedom.  
<P>
   It
is difficult in a brief review to give more than a glimpse of
this powerful book, but its fascinating mixture of political theory
and constitutional law provides an intellectual drama that is
rarely seen in books about the Court. Those who seek a model to
get today's Court back on track and in philosophical trim will
benefit from Arkes's readable study.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>1. Why does FRC exist and what do they stand 
for?</h2></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council's primary reason for existence is
to reaffirm and promote nationally and particularly in Washington,
DC, the traditional family unit and the Judeo-Christian principles
upon which it is built.  To accomplish this task we will:

<p><ul>

<li>Promote and defend the family in the media.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional
values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family
in our civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote biblical
principles in our culture.

</ul><p>

<h3>FRC stands for:</h3>

<p><ol>

<b>The American Family</b>

<p>

<li>To ease growing economic pressures on families, federal and
state tax policy should allow parents raising children to keep
more of the money they earn.

<li>Fathers play an irreplaceable role in the upbringing of their
children.   They should take these responsibilities seriously.

<li>The natural, married-couple family is the best environment
to bear and raise children.  Public policy should protect the
two-parent family.

<li>America's child protection policies should be reformed to
be more sensitive to the rights of the parents.

<li>The best child care program is one a child receives in his
or her own home, from his or her own parents.  Congress and employers
should therefore adopt policies which make it easier for parents
to care for their own children.

<li>Adults should make every effort toward reconciliation before
considering divorce.  Congress and the state should encourage
this by limiting or repealing current &quot;no fault&quot; divorce
policies.

<p>

<b>The Preservation and Sanctity of Human Life</b>

<p>

<li>Human life is sacred and should be protected -- from conception
until natural death.

<li>Adoption should be strongly advocated, particularly as an
alternative to abortion.

<li>Taking organs from aborted children for experimental purposes
is morally repugnant.  The medial community should find alternatives
to this practice.

<p>

<b>Making our Schools Great Again</b>

<p>

<li>Parents should be free to direct their children's education;
government should respect the right of parents to choose safe and effective
schools for their children.

<li>A child's performance in school should be judged by academic
achievement, not whether the child becomes &quot;politically correct.&quot;

<li>Voluntary student-initiated prayer should be allowed in public
schools.

<li>Schools should teach abstinence before marriage and fidelity
within marriage, keeping in mind that parents bear the primary
responsibility for their children's sex education.

<p>

<b>Pro-Family Health Care Reform</b>

<p>

<li>America's health care system should be flexible enough to
meet each individual family's needs and should also respect the
right of each family to make its own health care choices.

<li>The best method for controlling the spread of AIDS is for
people to change their behavior, avoiding activities which would
put them at risk of acquiring the HIV virus.

<p>

<b>The Family and Society</b>

<p>

<li>Homosexual activity is immoral, unhealthy, and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  Homosexuals should not
be granted special rights based on their sexual preference.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; should not be equated with civil rights.

<li>Homosexuals should be treated with compassion, not bigotry.
We should provide support and healing for homosexuals who want
to change their way of life.

<li>It is destructive for military morale, readiness, and effectiveness
to permit homosexuals into the armed forces.

<p>

<b>Family</b>

<p>

<li>Tax dollars should not be used to fund obscene or indecent
art.

<li>It is essential that concerned citizens take part in the
political process, not just be passive observers.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>2. What does FRC think about AIDS funding?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that funding and AIDS prevention should be redirected
in ways commensurate with the threat to the entire population.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> AIDS is a serious threat that has already
claimed a quarter million lives.  However, it enjoys a much higher
share of available prevention, research and treatment dollars
than other equally devastating diseases, and this must change.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In Fiscal Year 1996, the Department
of Health and Human Services will spend $5.35 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest per-victim expenditure for any of the nation's
10 most lethal diseases.

<p>

AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and last year accounted for about 42,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, heart
disease claimed 730,000 lives, and cancer killed 520,000.  Yet
this year, HHS will spend more on research for each AIDS death
($33,333) than for each death from heart disease ($1,201) or cancer
($4,615).

<p>

The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving serious attention.
HIV is a contagious and uniformly fatal disease, and its victims
deserve compassion and help.  Funding should continue for treatment,
prevention and care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into
line with expenditures for other life-threatening diseases, and
the money must be redirected toward more effective approaches.

<p>

For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Far more Americans die each year from cancer or
heart disease than AIDS.  Government should allocate resources
in proportion to the need.  To defeat the AIDS epidemic, government
must focus a larger share of AIDS funding on prevention.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>3. What does FRC think about adoption?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC encourages and promotes the adoption of children by two-parent
families as a superior alternative to abortion, out-of-wedlock
parenting, and foster care.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Passage of a $5,000 adoption tax credit
for couples who choose to adopt a child.  (2) Removal of policy
barriers which discourage interracial adoptions.  (3) Amendment
of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act so that Indian tribes would
no longer be able to retroactively overturn an adoption which
was approved by the child's biological parents.  (4) Encouragement
of crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and family planning
clinics to provide adoption counseling for their unmarried pregnant
clients. (5) Shortening the time frame for biological parents
to make custodial claims so that children do not languish for
years in foster care, but are eligible for adoption sooner.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Adoption typically provides children
with a permanent, stable, and loving home.  It helps to break
the cycles of illegitimacy, single parenthood, abortion, and welfare
dependency.  And for foster care children, adoption also acts
as a preventative measure against being involved in crime, being
incarcerated, or becoming welfare-dependent.

<p>

Public opinion polls show that the American people consistently
support the choice of adoption.  For example, the Family Research
Council's &quot;1995 Family Issues Survey&quot; found that, when
presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies
(adoption, marriage to the birthfather, single parenthood, or
abortion), more respondents chose adoption as the best option
than any of the others.  In reality, however, 46 percent of all
nonmarital pregnancies in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent
ended in miscarriage, and 44 percent were carried to term, of
which only 2 percent were placed for adoption.  So while the number
of potentially adoptable children is theoretically large due to
the high number of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies,
there remains a relatively small number of adoptable children.
Consequently, an estimated one to two million prospective parents
are still waiting to adopt a child.

<p>

Currently, there are 500,000 children in foster care, only a portion
of whom are legally adoptable at any one time.  Of these foster
children, 50,000 who are &quot;free&quot; to be adopted remain
in foster care for months or years.  Furthermore, every year,
15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from the foster care system
by turning 18 with no permanent family.  That these children languish
in foster care year after year is primarily attributable to two
reasons:  (1) The overriding emphasis on race-matching the child
with his/her adoptive parents has often led to major delays or
denials of adoptions, even when transracial adoptive homes are
available; and (2) The foster care system places an undue, and
often misguided, emphasis on returning children to their biological
parents, even when there are clear indications that the biological
parents have forfeited their custodial claims by abusing or neglecting
their children.  Thus, these children languish in foster care
even when adoptive homes are available.  If they are finally released
for adoption, many of them are much harder to place because they
are older and have generally acquired more behavioral problems.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Adoption benefits everyone.  It benefits the young,
unmarried birthmother and her life chances to finish school and
escape the welfare-dependency cycle.  It meets the child's needs
for stability and has a positive effect on the child's physical,
emotional, and psychological health.  It benefits the adoptive
parents who desire to have a family.  It benefits American society
because the children are reared in solid, two-parent homes without
cost to the American taxpayer.  It also provides a superior alternative
to out-of-wedlock parenting and abortion.  By promoting and enabling
adoptions to occur more easily, more children will have the opportunity
to be raised in loving, two-parent homes rather than to suffer
the vagaries that come with being wards of the state through
foster care or welfare-dependency.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>4. What does FRC think about child care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that federal child care policies must respect a range
of private choices without undermining intact families or placing
an undue tax burden on middle-class parents.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Resistance to calls for the creation of
a new federal child care entitlement; protection of the voucher
provisions in the existing child care and child development block
grant (with the proviso that vouchers may be used at sectarian
institutions); passage of tax credits that do not discriminate
against either non-commercial care or one-career families.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Federally-funded child care programs
are a staple of the liberal agenda to replace the nuclear family
with the total state.  It is no coincidence that the opening shot
in the political battle over the family was the passage in 1971
of Senator Walter Mondale's Comprehensive Child Development bill.
An archetype of liberal social engineering, the Mondale bill
sought to place as many children as possible under the care of
federally-funded child advocates and day care centers.  In his
veto message, President Nixon wrote that &quot;good public policy
requires that we enhance rather than diminish both parental authority
and parental involvement with children -- particularly in those
decisive early years when social attitudes and a conscience are
formed, and religious and moral principles are first inculcated.&quot;

<p>

While acknowledging that not all mothers can choose to stay at
home with children, contemporary child care policy must preserve
as many choices as possible -- including at-home care, church-based
care, and other informal arrangements.  Any expansion of federal
oversight, by definition, will limit options and pose regulatory
entanglements.  New federal funding will inflate the tax burden
on two-parent families and force many parents to spend more time
at the job site -- less time with the children.

<p>

Welfare reform that imposes stiff work requirements on mothers
of preschool children threatens to distort child care policy by
creating new sympathy for greater federal intrusion.  To reduce
the need for day care services -- and to assimilate welfare recipients
into the labor force more successfully -- welfare reform must
focus first on the mothers with older children in school.  Research
studies on various &quot;workfare&quot; experiments show a low
success rate for sustained employment by unmarried mothers with
preschool children, who face much greater role strain and task
overload than mothers with school-aged children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> While decentralization ensures flexibility and
greater responsiveness to individual needs, vouchers ensure that
parents themselves retain maximum say in determining what is best
for their children.  Advocates of greater federal involvement
operate instead on the assumption that bureaucrats and licensed
&quot;experts&quot; know best.  Policymakers must acknowledge
that no paid worker can be an adequate substitute for a loving
parent -- and work to eliminate both the tax burden and the culture
of poverty that restrict families' economic freedom to care for
their own children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>5. What does FRC think about China having &quot;most 
favored nation&quot; trade status?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the United States should take a strong stand
against China's human rights violations and revoke their &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Revoke &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status for China.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> China's atrocious record on human
rights is indisputable.  Its blatant disregard for the sanctity
of human life has led to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers
at Tiananmen Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers,
women being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide,
and the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of
Christians.

<p>

For the last 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Some have argued
that, by opening up our economic doors to China, the United States
will wield greater influence in reversing China's horrific human
rights record.  However, in the last 15 years, not even one of
these human rights abuses has been halted or abated.  Indeed,
China's human rights abuses have only worsened over that time,
and the Chinese government has grown more stubborn in its control-by-force
and intimidation tactics.

<p>

In addition to the myriad human rights abuses which alone should
disqualify China from receiving MFN status, in the last year alone
China has also threatened war with Taiwan, risking a military
confrontation with the United States; sold missiles and nuclear
technology to rogue nations (some of whom fund terrorists); and
balked at talks with the U.S. and South Korea.  Furthermore, because
the United States is currently running a $33.8 billion trade deficit
with China, there is reason to believe that revoking China's MFN
status may help to make an impact on China's leaders.

<p>

The Clinton administration has recently signaled that it will
extend MFN to China again this year.  Since the president will
not stand up to China, it will be up to Congress to pass legislation 
with a two-thirds majority in both Houses to overturn the president's 
decision by the end of August.  The oppressive nature of this Chinese 
government regime is well-known.  If the United States has not succeeded
in using the &quot;carrot&quot; of economic markets to encourage
China to meet a humane standard, then the &quot;stick&quot; should
be the revoking of China's trade privileges.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Revoking China's MFN trade status is a modest,
but significant step that the United States must take in order
to demonstrate tangibly that it will not tolerate the large-scale
human rights abuses taking place in China.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>6. What does FRC think about crime prevention?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports and encourages efforts to combat crime at all levels
to ensure that law-abiding Americans feel safe in our streets.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Sentencing and prison reform. (2) Reforms
in criminal procedure. (3) More aggressive enforcement.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>

<p>

(1) <I>Sentencing and prison reform</I>:

<p>

Serious repeat violent felons must be put away permanently.  Recidivism
figures show clearly that many criminals, once released, return
to a life of crime.

<p>

Government must protect the public by keeping violent criminals
behind bars for their entire sentences and eliminating bail for
suspects.

<p>

Adolescents who commit &quot;adult&quot; crimes should be tried
as adults and subjected to adult penalties.

<p>

Criminals must be punished, not pampered.  Recidivism is high
among violent offenders partly because the price they pay for
crime is too low.

<p>

Other means of punishment, such as restitution, might be used
for less-serious offenses.  This could help relieve an overburdened
prison system.

<p>

No one advocates cruelty or harsh, meaningless labor such as the
old &quot;making little rocks out of big ones.&quot;  But prisons
should be places of punishment, not weight-lifting and entertainment
centers.

<p>

(2) <I>Reforms in criminal procedure</I>.

<p>

The death penalty, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976, must
be used where it is justified if it is to deter crime.

<p>

Habeas corpus loopholes that permit criminals to exploit the courts
must be closed.  The impact of the Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995 must be carefully monitored to ensure that the loopholes
have been closed.

<p>

The exclusionary rule should be changed.  The exclusionary rule
was created by the courts to implement the Fourth Amendment (all
persons have the right to be secure from unreasonable searches
and seizures) thus protecting the public from police abuses. 
But the rule has been used to unfairly favor criminals.  It must
be modified to deny freedom to the guilty, give incentives for
police professionalism and protect civil liberties.

<p>

Jury reform is long overdue.  Jury members ought to be able to
ask questions that trial attorneys and prosecutors may miss. 
They should also be informed of the defendant's past criminal
history, especially during sentencing considerations where either
mitigating circumstances or a track record of incorrigible behavior
is significant.

<p>

(3) <I>More aggressive enforcement</I>.

<p>

Increase the prison population to reduce crime.  Statistics show
that most crime is committed by a core of chronic criminals. 
Keeping these criminals in jail for longer periods will make society
safer.

<p>

More local police -- to guard our schools, neighborhoods and commerce
-- are necessary to free our citizens to go about their daily
lives without fear.

<p>

Government must protect law-abiding citizens from recidivist sex
felons.  An example of this is the recently-passed &quot;Megan's
Law.&quot;*   It requires state governments to disclose information
and notify communities about convicted sex offenders who are released
from prison.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Crime costs America half-a-trillion dollars every
year.  It leaves thousands of killed and injured people in its
wake.  In order to prevent the next decade's much-anticipated
youth crime explosion, major anti-crime reform is desperately
needed.

<p>

* &quot;Megan's Law&quot; amends the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>7. What does FRC think about defunding public arts and 
humanities that support cultural decay?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that most of America's troubles stem more from moral
decline than from economic problems.  Part of FRC's goal is to
spark a cultural renewal that will be evident in music, arts,
literature, film, television, and other parts of our culture.
FRC believes there should be an end to taxpayer funding of public
arts and humanities and broadcast programs that attack the family,
religion and traditional values, and/or promote an ideological
agenda.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Defunding the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The National Endowment for the
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities began in 1965
with budgets of $2.5 million.  The two agencies' budgets reached
more than $175 million each per year in the 1990s.  NEA was cut
to just under $100 million in fiscal 1996,  to be phased out after
1997.  NEH was cut to $110 million in fiscal 1996, with a planned
phaseout after 1998.

<p>

Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  A federal grant instantly conveys
the stamp of approval of the federal government and the American
people.

<p>

Federal arts funding, an unconstitutional expansion of government 
power, has skewed the art market toward questionable projects.
NEA continues to fund such venues as the Franklin Furnace Archive
theater in New York, where artists engage in scatological, sexually-explicit,
anti-religious and anti-family &quot;performance&quot; works.
NEA Chairwoman Jane Alexander told the pro-gay <I>Advocate</I> magazine
that she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently
to gay themes all across the country.  And I mean gently, because
if you start with a very overt thing, people get scared.&quot;
Alexander also defended a performance at an NEA-funded art center
in which an HIV-positive man sliced another man's back with a
knife, mopped up blood and sent it over the audience on clotheslines.

<p>

At the NEH,  money has been wasted on politically correct projects
such as the promotion of &quot;cultural diversity&quot; and the
&quot;National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity.&quot;
When one activist used the latter forum to state that, &quot;There
is nothing about me that is American.  I don't want to be an American,&quot;
NEH Director Sheldon Hackney exulted, &quot;What an American thing
to say -- squarely in the great tradition of American dissent.&quot;

<p>

In 1967, Congress created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
Radio.  CPB's budget grew to nearly $285 million by fiscal 1996.
In fiscal 1997, CPB is to receive $260 million, with a request
for $296.4 million for 1998.  No phaseout has been enacted.

<p>

America has more than 11,700 radio stations, 3,100 television
licensees, 109 cable networks and another 6,963 translators and
boosters, plus the Internet. There is no reason to tax hardworking
American families to subsidize PBS or NPR shows.  Although PBS
and NPR have some worthy fare, there is a drumbeat of anti-family
and anti-religious programming.  Political bias is rampant.

<p>

CPB subsidies are not needed.  <I>Sesame Street</I> can make it
on its own, while bad programs would and should fail in an open
market.  Some congressmen have talked about creating a $1 billion
trust fund for PBS without any congressional oversight.  More
money and <I>less</I> oversight?  It's time to defund the NEA,
NEH and CPB.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The saving of hundreds of millions of dollars
annually and an end to tax-subsidized attacks on family, religion,
sexual morality and free enterprise.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>8. What is FRC's stand on divorce reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes there needs to be revisions in public policy that
would increase the commitment of society to the institution of
marriage, the protection of children and justice for innocent
parties.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Reform of the current no-fault divorce
laws in every state by establishing fault for grounds and dissolution
where there is no mutual consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current situation began in
1969 when California passed the first &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce
law.  Intended to remove animosity during divorce, reduce perjury
and collusion, establish standards for alimony and property awards
and give relief to marital conflict, no-fault laws passed in 45
states in the next five years.  By 1985, all 50 states had passed
laws establishing no-fault divorce.

<p>

What have been the results of such a significant shift in the
way that we view the marriage contract?  We have shifted from
a culture of marriage to a culture of divorce.  Divorce rates
have surged 34 percent from 1970 to 1990.  It is estimated that
one half of all new marriages will end in divorce.  The United
States is the divorce leader of the industrialized world.  What
are we communicating when it is easier to divorce your wife of
25 years that it is to let go that employee you hired two weeks
ago?

<p>

More specifically, no-fault divorce has had a detrimental affect
on the innocent parties involved, especially the children.  No-fault
divorce reduces the protection and negotiating rights of the spouse
who wants to maintain the marriage.  Divorced women experience
a 30 percent drop in income the first year after a divorce.  Three
out of four teen suicides are committed by children from broken
homes.  Children of divorce are also 70 percent more likely to
have been expelled or suspended from school, and are twice as
likely to drop out of school.  Of juveniles and young adults serving
time in long-term correctional facilities, 70 percent came from
broken homes.

<p>

No-fault divorce has not only added to societal problems, but
it has not remotely addressed the problems it originally set out
to solve.  Animosity during divorce has simply shifted to animosity
during the settlement.  Fights over custody and support are more
prevalent today and just as humiliating as those over grounds.
In the overwhelming majority of cases before the adoption of
no-fault grounds, there was no litigation at all, let alone hostile
litigation.  Perjury and collusion have also just shifted from
the grounds arena to the collateral arenas of custody and visitation.

<p>

Dr. Allen Parkman has summed it up this way:  &quot;Seldom in
U.S. history have laws been enacted with higher hopes and poorer
results than the no-fault divorce statutes.&quot;  Not surprisingly,
in a recent FRC survey, by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent,
Americans said that they favor divorce reform to strengthen the
rights of spouses who want to save their marriage.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Divorce reform will strengthen our families and
society by increasing the incentive for spouses to invest in their
marriage.  It will offer justice for those who are unwilling parties
of divorce, especially for any children involved.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>9. What national drug abuse policies does FRC 
support?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that:

<p><ol>

<li>The President must give the drug war a high priority.
<li>Congress must hold federal drug spending at current levels
until there is strict accountability, and then consider increasing
budget authority.
<li>The drug czar must be made subordinate to the attorney general
to coordinate all drug interdiction.
<li>Local communities must be allowed to tailor treatment and
prevention programs to local needs.

</ol><p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> America has successfully cut drug
abuse in half since 1979, but now it is rising again and emboldened
drug legalization proponents are calling for a surrender in the
drug war.  The drug war needs leadership, a unified national interdiction
effort, and a local prevention and treatment focus.

<p>

The absence of committed Presidential leadership has contributed
to the problem. President Clinton has been virtually silent about
drug abuse.  He has mentioned drugs in less than three percent
of the public speeches made during the first three years of his
administration.

<p>

The lack of Presidential attention to this issue tracks with a
growing view that illegal drugs are less dangerous and more acceptable.
This shift can be attributed to fewer news stories about the
risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions,
and glamorization of drugs by pop culture.  In fact, last year,
the major television networks ran only 40 drug stories compared
to nearly 400 per year during the Reagan administration.

<p>

Drug abuse costs the nation perhaps half-a-trillion dollars annually.
The federal government will spend $13 billion fighting the drug
war this year, but much of this money will be spent without close
accountability.  This must change.

<p>

The federal drug effort is complicated by too many programs. 
There are 140 federal programs each with its own bureaucracy and
tangled set of procedures.  This scattershot approach isn't working.
The federal part of the war must focus on interdiction and turn
the rest over to local communities.

<p>

The drug czar should be subordinate to the attorney general just
as the surgeon general falls under the Secretary of Health and
Human Services.  That would eliminate redundancies and improve
the use of taxpayer dollars.  The drug czar should coordinate
the U.S. drug interdiction effort and speak out against abuse.

<p>

Other than the President providing the vision for a drug-free
America, drug treatment and prevention are issues the federal
government is poorly equipped to handle.  Consolidate federal
drug bureaucracies, streamline procedures and send authority and
resources to the local level.  Local communities working with
citizen-run groups can do a far better job than the federal government
at tailoring programs to meet local needs.

<p>

Include faith-based programs in the local solution and take steps
to ensure that government does not interfere in their religious
mission.  They have a proven record of long-term drug abuse recovery
and prevention effectiveness.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Drug abuse ruins lives, acts as a drag on our
economy, damages every American's quality of life via drug-related
crime, and robs America of its intellectual edge in a competitive
world.  This is a national crisis and deserves top priority.

<center><h2>10. How does FRC believe we can improve the public education
system in America?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that America must restore decision-making authority
over school policy and finance to parents, locally elected school
boards and taxpayers, relieving them of the layers of bureaucracy
that hinder education renewal.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The federal role in education, now amounting
to several hundred programs, should be terminated and the billions
of dollars spent annually returned to taxpayers.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Education has been traditionally
-- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.
But since the U.S. Education Department was created in 1979,
it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand
its range and influence.  Today, more than 760 education programs
exist in 39 federal agencies, totalling $120 billion in annual
expenditures.

<p>

A new height of federal intrusion into local education was reached
with the passage of Goals 2000 in 1994.  Goals 2000 prescribes
to states how they will run their educational systems and meddles
in their curricular issues by creating national standards and
assessments.  But Goals 2000 also pushes a liberal social agenda,
covering everything from prenatal health care systems to mandatory
community service to comprehensive health education.

<p>

Goals 2000 must be repealed as the first step toward restoring
local schools in America.  Republicans in the 104th Congress demonstrated
their commitment to eliminating wasteful, inappropriate federal
programs and to improving education by seeking to end Goals 2000.
The House voted to eliminate funding for the program in FY '96,
and the House Budget Committee resolved to do so again for FY '97.

<p>

As control has been seized by the centralized education bureaucracy,
local apathy has increased, just as Alexis de Tocqueville predicted
over 150 years ago.  Liberals seek to dictate parental and community
involvement in education through federal law, ignoring the fact
that their own cumbersome programs choke off any meaningful participation.

<p>

Only when the federal role in education is ended will we see a
revitalization of the community involvement that characterized
schools before the advent of the education bureaucracy.   The
proposal to free schools from federal control received a hearty
response in the 104th Congress, where some 120 members of the
House sponsored the Back-to-Basics bill, the first concerted effort
to shut down the U.S. Education Department bureaucracy in the
last decade.

<p>

As part of their freedom to participate fully in their children's
education, parents should be permitted to choose a safe and effective
public, private, religious or home school.  When parents freely
choose the kind of education they seek for their children, employers
will get the qualified employees they want, and policymakers will
see the healthy schools they envision coming to life as a result
of competition.

<p>

Blaise Pascal told us that seeking to obtain by one means what
can only be achieved by another is tyranny.  We have witnessed
in the past three decades an ever-expanding attempt to solve educational
problems from Washington, D.C.  The resulting nationalization
of education has only exacerbated the problems of local schools.
Parents, teachers and schools must be freed from the burdens
of the federal education bureaucracy.  Only then will America
experience the educational renewal that will keep this nation
a leader in the 21st century world.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The elimination of the federal role in education
will allow state and local education to flourish without regulatory
bondage, reestablish the authority of parents and taxpayers over
education, and bring about the education renewal parents desire
and their children need for future success.  Tax relief will allow
families to increase their buying power for current educational
services and to save for future educational needs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>11. What solutions does FRC see for affordable health 
care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that families should have access to affordable, portable
health care and insurance for families.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of tax-free medical savings accounts
(MSAs) as an important cost-saving and freedom-of-choice component
of any health care reform measure.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> A radical overhaul of our nation's
health care system, which is one of the finest in the world, is
not necessary.  Rather, there are certain aspects, such as affordability
and portability, that are amenable to reform without inviting
wholesale federal interference in health care.  Tax-free medical
savings accounts (MSAs) for working families and individuals,
as passed in the House-Senate Balanced Budget Act and the House
health care reform package, constitute one such reform.  MSAs
are similar to IRAs in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit
may be set aside for certain medical expenses.  MSAs are controlled
by individuals and families, not by governments or insurance companies.
MSAs usually supplement high-deductible (catastrophic) health
insurance coverage, helping to cover lower-level medical expenses
before the insurance deductible is reached, co-payments, and other
qualified expenses.  Because families and individuals are directly
responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard
against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping
to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, families reap
the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of
practicing good health habits, for any monies not spent by the
end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income,
or kept in the account for future health care needs.  Since most
individuals spend less than $2,000 per year on medical expenses,
funds in the account would be portable and available in-between
jobs, at the next job, or when bigger unexpected medical costs
come up in the future.

<p>

Companies that offer MSAs have found that they are most popular
among lower-income families.  Under conventional insurance plans,
low-income employees typically have to meet their $250 or $500
deductible with after-tax dollars before they can access their
insurance.  A single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year
may find it difficult to meet the deductible when rent, transportation,
taxes, grocery bills and other needs for her children are pressing.
An MSA allows these low-income earners first dollar coverage,
permitting them to get medical care when they or their children
need it.  This feature alone could significantly reduce 
the level of emergency room utilization for non-emergency care.
Low-income wage earners would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage
for medical care up to the amount in their MSA.

<p>

MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because
MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those
not expressly covered within the insurance policy, a family has
more flexibility to choose health services and providers and has
more portability of coverage.

<p>

More and more private sector employers are offering MSAs to their
employees, with great response, even though our federal tax code
discriminates against this practice.  Fifteen states have passed
laws granting favorable tax treatment to MSAs.   In March 1996,
the House of Representatives passed an MSA provision that would
allow comparable tax treatment to other forms of employment-based
insurance, as part of their health care reform package, H.R. 3103.
A similar Senate bill, S. 1028, did not contain an MSA provision
so this issue must be worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> MSAs empower families to make their own health
care decisions by choosing their own doctors and spending their
own money for such care.   MSAs are a bipartisan solution and
a practical free-market alternative to address the problems of
escalating health care costs and lack of portability between jobs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>12. What is FRC's response to the homosexual 
agenda?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that homosexuality is unhealthy, immoral and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  <I>Compassion</I> --
not bigotry -- impels us to support healing for homosexuals who
want to change their orientation.

<p>

FRC opposes any attempts to equate homosexuality with civil rights
or to compare it to benign characteristics such as skin color
or place of origin.

<p>

The Family Research Council opposes sex education programs that
treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally desirable,
that teach that any sexual behavior between consenting people
is a human right, and that idealize homosexuality and the homosexual
lifestyle.  FRC also opposes attempts to make the adoption of
children by homosexuals an accepted practice.

<p>

Much of the data used to support claims by homosexual activists
is flawed:  the debate has been clouded by faulty research and
surveys taken out of context.  FRC supports efforts to promote
public policy -- based on scholarly research -- that undergirds
traditional values and families, rather than attempts to provide
special treatment for homosexuals.  The Family Research Council
applauds the efforts of men and women who provide counseling and
support for people who wish to leave the homosexual lifestyle
and find fulfillment in a healthy lifestyle.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>13. What is FRC's position on the military's homosexual 
ban?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the military should enforce the law  [10 U.S.C.
&#167; 654] that denies military service to homosexuals.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Rewrite the Pentagon's inconsistent method of 
implementing regulations which ignore the law's intent to deny service to 
homosexuals. Additionally, reinstate the question asking if a candidate 
is a homosexual, which the law permits to be asked of all recruits.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In 1993, Congress held hearings to determine
whether to keep the military's 200-year-old homosexual ban.  Experts
testified that homosexuals threaten unit cohesion and morale --
key combat components.  Their defining behavior is illegal in
the military, and as a category homosexuals create an unacceptable
health risk to themselves and others.  Science has found that
homosexuals experience higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases,
including the AIDS virus, and higher rates of drug abuse than
heterosexuals.

<p>

On November 30, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the military's
long-standing ban on homosexual military service.  The law [ 10
U.S.C. &#167; 654] Congress passed is very clear: no homosexuals
in the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the Clinton administration from
creating regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only
serve, but serve openly in the military.  This end run around
Congress has not gone unnoticed.

<p>

This spring, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
in <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> identified the regulatory loopholes.
In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both the law passed
by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations on homosexuals
in the military.  Six of that court's judges declared that the
administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly what the White House was up to in regard to 
&quot;implementing&quot; the law on homosexuals in the military.

<p>

Besides revising the regulations to be consistent with the law,
the services must also return to asking recruits about their sexual
orientation and past homosexual conduct. Asking the questions
kept honest homosexuals out and sent a clear message that to serve,
others must keep their homosexuality a secret.  In 1993, the Clinton
administration ordered this practice stopped.  The new law, however,
permits the Secretary of Defense to reinstate the questions. 
Asking new recruits and those reenlisting is a prudent step to
warn would-be service members that homosexuals are not eligible
for service in the military.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The law and the regulations are inconsistent.
This undercuts the constitutional authority of Congress to set
the rules and regulations for the military and puts the courts
in the position of having to force the executive branch to do
its constitutional duty to &quot;faithfully execute the laws&quot;
of the land.  Rewriting the regulations will result in the restoration
of a consistent policy that will survive constitutional challenge,
avert the manifold medical and morale-related problems occasioned
by the Clinton administration's social experimentation, and put
to rest an issue that has disrupted the clear and workable policy
that served the nation well for generations.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>14. What does FRC think can be done to restore the sanctity
of human life?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that society must acknowledge and restore the sanctity
of human life for those born and unborn.  Society must protect
innocent unborn children and mothers facing a crisis pregnancy
from government funding and promotion of abortion in the U.S.
and abroad, and protect the elderly from physician-assisted suicide
and euthanasia.  We can accomplish these goals through various
protective measures through all branches of government:  executive,
legislative, and judicial.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of specific pro-life legislation,
such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and other measures
that protect unborn children from abortion, reduce the overall
number of abortions, and restrict taxpayer funding and sponsorship
of abortion.  Encouraging the President to appoint, and the Senate
to confirm, pro-family judges who believe that unborn children
have an inalienable right to life and deserve full legal protection.
Adopt a human life amendment to the Constitution.  Encourage
policies to restrict physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Thomas Jefferson said:  &quot;The
protection of human life and happiness, and not their destruction,
is the first and only legitimate object of good government.&quot;
However, the unborn child is not considered a &quot;person&quot;
according to seven members of the Supreme Court in the <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> decision (1973).  Since the legalization of abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy in 1973, there have been
more than 33 million abortions.  One-third of these were performed
on teenage girls.  Out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted
diseases [particularly chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomarvirus
(HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], and abortion rates
have all dramatically increased since that time.  Abortion is
never a healthy solution to a problem pregnancy.  To that end,
government and, principally, communities and churches, must encourage
and promote public policies and programs that reduce the demand
for, and total numbers of, abortions; promote adoption; promote
parental involvement; and offer practical assistance to teens
and women in a crisis situation.  Our tax dollars should never
fund or actively encourage abortions using taxpayer dollars or
fund organizations with pro-abortion policy goals or objectives.

<p>

Opinion polls consistently show that the majority of Americans
oppose most abortions.  A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN
and <I>USA Today</I> found that 65 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot;
or &quot;legal under certain circumstances.&quot;  A January 1995
CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found that 60 percent believe that
abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter
limits.&quot;

<p>

Specifically, the president should sign the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, a bill that would limit a particularly horrible late-term
abortion method that is basically infanticide.  Congress should
adopt, and send to the states for ratification, a human life amendment
that applies the protection of the 14th Amendment to unborn children
and assures recognition of their fundamental, individual right
to life.  In addition, various government agencies, such as the
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of
Health, Department of Education, State Department, and Agency
for International Development must not indirectly or directly
fund or encourage abortions, fund domestic or international organizations
that promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning,
fund &quot;comprehensive&quot; school-based health clinics, fund
or encourage abortion-related research on drugs like RU-486, or
promote or fund physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Promoting the sanctity of human life is vital
to maintaining a great nation and strong civil society.  We see
in alarming crime rates and shocking killings the inevitable result
of abortion cheapening human life.  Society and political parties
must recognize the value and inherent worth of each individual
person from the moment of conception to natural death.  Unborn
children, the infirm, the handicapped and the elderly must all
be protected.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>15. How does FRC view immigration reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the immigration laws should reflect this country's
heritage as a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot; while also placing
emphasis on fairness and orderly procedure, recognizing that regulation
is necessary to protect our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Support measures which halt illegal
immigration, e.g., increasing border patrols, halting welfare
payments to illegal aliens, permanently denying readmission to
aliens who are caught illegally residing in the U.S., etc.  (2)
Support pro-family measures regarding legal immigration, e.g.,
reuniting nuclear families first before other family and work
categories, enforcing policies which hold U.S. citizens and residents
financially responsible for the family member(s) they &quot;sponsor&quot;
for entry into the U.S., deporting and permanently excluding aliens
who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and providing
asylum to victims of religious persecution and/or coercive population
control policies.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Immigration reform is badly needed
in order to correct the unwise policies of the past (i.e., providing
amnesty to all illegal aliens) and to provide a framework to meet
present and future challenges, especially those which address
the ever-growing problem of illegal aliens crossing into the U.S.

<p>

The problem of illegal immigration must be addressed on the principles
of ensuring adherence to the law and administering justice.  The
United States must not reward illegal aliens whose first act in
this country is to break the law.  Thus, we support efforts to
halt illegal immigration by increasing border patrols, enforcing
the expedited deportation of illegal aliens, increasing criminal
penalties for those who create or distribute fraudulent identification
documents, and permanently denying readmission to aliens who are
found to illegally reside in the U.S., among others.

<p>

In terms of legal immigration, the United States should preserve
its policy of welcoming legal immigrants, acknowledging the fact
that we are a &quot;nation of immigrants.&quot;  However, in recent
years, public opinion has been antagonistic towards immigrants
-- both legal and illegal -- due to the influx of illegal immigrants
and the notion that legal immigrants are not &quot;paying their
own way&quot; once they enter the U.S.  Thus, we support policies
which help legal immigrants &quot;play by the rules,&quot; such
as deporting and permanently excluding aliens who are convicted
of felonies, and enforcing &quot;sponsorship&quot; policies which
hold U.S. family members financially responsible for those immigrants
they sponsor to enter the U.S.

<p>

Finally, the United States must preserve its commitment to refugees,
particularly those who are victims of religious persecution or
coercive population control policies.  We support current U.S.
policy which does not impose a numerical limit on refugees because
America needs the flexibility to respond appropriately to future
humanitarian crises and because refugees currently comprise only
about 8 percent of total immigration to the U.S. every year. 
Most important of all, the United States must maintain its tradition
of moral leadership, reminding other nations that adherence to
universally-recognized human rights matters.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The American people already want immigration reform.
Implementing wise immigration reform policies -- halting illegal
immigration and regulating legal immigration -- will be vital
in order to restore Americans' confidence in the immigration system
as well as in changing the current negative public perception
about immigrants as a whole.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>16. What is FRC's position on the Legal Services 
Corporation?</h2></center>

<p>

To protect American families and businesses from frivolous, damaging
litigation and to end the annual waste of millions in taxpayer
dollars, FRC believes that the Legal Services Corporation should
be defunded.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The complete defunding of the Legal Services
Corporation.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The Legal Services Corporation
was founded in 1965 with the purpose of expanding welfare benefits
to the poor through test cases and impact litigation.  That and
much more occurred as the program was commandeered by left-wing
lawyers with anti-family agendas.

<p>

The family is the foundation of society, yet in case after case
LSC has attempted to make the individual, instead of the family,
the basic unit of welfare policy.  This goal undermines the family
by replacing parents (especially fathers) with welfare programs
and discouraging self-reliance in favor of federally-funded dependency.

<p>

Examples of legal services' hostility to the family are legion.
They include:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1994, the National Center for Youth Law, a major LSC grantee,
played a key role in overturning California's parental consent
law on abortion.

<p>

<li>In 1993, Karla and Leland Swenson were forced to sell their
home to fight the Idaho Legal Aid Society's effort to seek custody
of their adopted son for the sister of the boy's biological father.
Neither of the boy's biological parents was seeking custody.

<p>

<li>In 1995, Lehigh Valley Legal Services of Pennsylvania tried
to give a teenage rapist custody of a child he fathered by his
rape of a 13-year-old even though a psychologist concluded he
would endanger the child.

<p>

<li>Also in 1995, Legal Services of Greater Miami joined forces
with the ACLU and homosexual activists to fight for a homosexual
couple's bid to adopt a child.

</ul><p>

Congress has already called for LSC's phasing out by 1998, starting
with a 30 percent funding cut for fiscal 1996 from $400 million
to $283.5 million.  In addition, several restrictions have been
placed on LSC, prohibiting its grantees from filing class-action
lawsuits except with the approval of the Corporation.

<p>

Legal services lawyers will no longer be allowed to represent
prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being
evicted for drug-related crimes.

<p>

Unfortunately, restrictions can be circumvented.  Several grantees
have already set up new groups to receive LSC grants while using
non-federal or private grants to carry out continued assaults
on the family.  The inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus
spending bill was a victory for LSC.  It allows grantees to comment
on legislation as well as become involved in legislative rulemaking
-- a major loophole for legal services lawyers to engage in lobbying
activities.  As these incidents show, nothing short of the outright
abolition of LSC will solve the problem.

<p>

The private bar can and must assume responsibility for meeting
the needs of poor Americans for legal services not covered by
public defender programs across the United States.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding the Legal Services Corporation will
provide protection to the American family, slow the expansion
of the welfare state, and cut federal spending by billions of
dollars over the long-term.  It will help get politically-motivated
&quot;public interest&quot; lawyers off Americans' backs and shift
power and money back to local governments -- and the American
people.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>17. What is FRC's opinion on the redefinition of 
marriage?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC opposes the radical redefinition of marriage and the erosion
of societal protections for marriage.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Passage of the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA), continued enactment of state laws that define marriage
as the union of one man and one woman, and resistance to the institution
of  &quot;domestic partnership&quot; benefits and privileges to
same-sex or unmarried couples.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>  Because of its crucial role, marriage
has a special status within the culture and the law.  Its essence
-- the joining of one man and one woman in a uniquely exclusive
legal, sexual, economic and spiritual bond with the procreation
of children as a desirable and common result -- had not been seriously
challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

Now, homosexual activists are on the verge of radically redefining
marriage and family through judicial fiat.  If they succeed, all
distinctions based on sex will fall, and the worst aspects of
the rejected Equal Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals
will gain the &quot;right&quot; to adopt children; schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexual sex is the equivalent of marital
love between husband and wife; employers will be forced to subsidize
homosexual relationships; churches will be pushed outside the
civil law; and government power will be directed against anyone
who believes that homosexuality is wrong.  Likewise, any government
institution of  &quot;domestic partnerships&quot; will harm the
moral order by raising homosexuality and fornication to protected
status, thereby undercutting societal support for marriage.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  
Despite widespread opposition within Hawaii (recent polls show
that 74 percent of Hawaiians reject same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;)
homosexual activists hope to impose their agenda through compliant
courts.  Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit
Clause calls for states to honor each other's licenses, homosexuals
are planning to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to
the mainland to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  More than 30
states now have efforts underway to protect marriage, and nine
-- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma,
South Dakota and Utah -- have enacted laws protecting marriage.

<p>

At the national level, DOMA would protect the military, Social
Security and all federal agencies from radical redefinition of
wedlock, as well as protect states from having their marriage
laws invalidated by an adverse court ruling or enactment in another
state.

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several key cases involving
the homosexual agenda are being decided.  The Supreme Court recently
struck down a voter-approved Colorado state constitutional amendment 
to bar any city or county from enacting special rights
based on sexual orientation.  Several cases challenging the military's
ban on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.  In Georgia,
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian fired from
her job at the state attorney general's office after she announced
that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  In New York, the
state's high court opened adoption proceedings to homosexual couples
and unmarried heterosexual couples, thus devaluing marriage and
jeopardizing children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> If marriage is radically redefined, or domestic
partnerships instituted, the entire moral code will unravel. 
Polls show that the American people overwhelmingly expect public
officials to defend marriage unequivocally.  This effort can advance
the cause of judicial reform, halt the judicial assault on traditional
morality and stall the homosexual activist agenda, which has gone
far beyond mere &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>18. What does FRC do to support military families?
</h2></center>

<p>

FRC created the Military Readiness Project (MRP) to oppose the
induction of homosexuals into the military because their known
presence destroys morale and personal privacy and introduces sexual
tension into the barracks.  FRC opposes attempts to subvert the
law barring anyone with homosexual &quot;propensities&quot; from
military service.  The MRP has been actively engaged in providing
&quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in key federal court cases
dealing with this issue.

<p>

The Family Research Council believes in the unique gifts and capabilities
of women, and opposes the pitfalls of a military that is gender
blind.  Some combat exemptions have already been eliminated, but
if the erosion continues, women may be placed in direct combat
roles &quot;on the same terms as men,&quot; a position supported
by barely a quarter of the American people.  The country -- and
its women -- are not well-served by placing women in combat positions.
FRC has worked hard to maintain a combat exemption in today's
military.

<p>

FRC has also tackled the issue of pornographic materials sold
in taxpayer-supported military stores.  The Family Research Council
sees this practice as one that undermines military discipline
and is at odds with the fundamentals of leadership and service.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>19. How does FRC view the rights and responsibilities 
of parents?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children without unwarranted interference
from the government should be protected.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The past century has witnessed
a subtle shift in the role of child rearing from a private matter
to a matter of increasingly public concern.  At the turn of the
century, courts began to examine and uphold state compulsory education
laws; today, government bureaucrats display an arrogant &quot;we
know best&quot; attitude that manifests itself in such ways as
compulsory-attendance, value-free sex education classes for elementary
school children.

<p>

While the Constitution does not explicitly address the parent-child
relationship, the Supreme Court has historically regarded the
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children as a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In the 1920s, the Supreme Court affirmed its high regard for
the integrity of the parent-child relationship in two landmark
cases:  <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I> and <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</I>.
In <I>Meyer</I>, the Court stated that the liberty guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment denotes &quot;the right of the individual
to marry, establish a home and bring up children.&quot;  The Court
declared in <I>Pierce</I> that the child is not a mere creature
of the state, and that &quot;those who nurture him and direct
his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize
and prepare him for additional obligations.&quot;

<p>

A new law is needed because although the Supreme Court's intent
to protect parental rights is unquestionable, lower courts have
not always followed the Supreme Court's strong mandate for the
parent-child relationship.  For example, parents from Falmouth,
Massachusetts recently lost a case in which they challenged their
school board's installation of condom machines in high school
bathrooms and school-nurse distribution of condoms to junior high
schoolers. Many public schools conduct psychological testing of
children under the guise of standardized &quot;tests&quot; and
&quot;surveys&quot; without parental consent.  Court challenges
to these policies have been met with mixed results.  Parents in Georgia
are fighting a legal battle against school administrators who
drove their daughters to a health clinic for gynecological tests
and birth control prescriptions without notification or consent.

<p>

The legal recognition of parental rights is also a children's
rights issue, because a child's first and most important right
is to have a parent who is in charge of raising him or her with
love and direction.  To say that parents have the primary role
in raising children is to say that parents are irreplaceable.
Stable, intact families rearing children with both love and direction
have never been in shorter supply or more desperately needed.
Parents need the legal standing to defend their fundamental right
to direct the upbringing and education of their children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children
would ensure that, when parents and government fight for the right
to make important decisions about child rearing, parents' preeminent
and unambiguous rights will prevail.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>20. What is FRC's opinion of pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC strongly opposes pornography, especially child pornography.
Pornography has a corrupting influence on individuals, turns
natural desires into unnatural cravings, and reduces human beings
to anonymous tools for the stimulation and gratification of those
cravings.

<p>

Contrary to a widespread perception, pornography no longer consists,
if it ever did, primarily of soft air-brushed photos of smiling
young women in various states of undress, or of movies depicting
cheerful, consensual coupling.  Exploiting the phenomenon of customer
desensitization, today's pornographers have turned to themes such
as bondage, mutilation, torture, bestiality, and others.

<p>

Does pornography contribute to rape, battery, and child molestation?
Supporters of pornography say it does not, but the evidence suggests
otherwise:  studies have shown that exposure to pornography
leads to a generalized predisposition toward violent and sexual
acts.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>21. What does FRC think should be done to combat 
pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) National standards for the determination
of obscenity should be developed.  (2) The law should require
compensation for the victims of pornography.  (3) Obscenity should
be treated as contraband.  (4) Strict liability should be the
legal standard for child-porn possession and distribution.  (5)
Computer networks should be family-friendly.  (6) Cable porn should
not be available on anything other than an opt-in basis.  (7)
All child porn should be made illegal:  pseudo, morphed, sketched,
or written.  (8) Indecency laws should be updated to include cable
and satellite transmission.  (9) Ordinary citizens should have
legal standing to seek injunctions against pornographers.  (10)
Pornography should be banned from U.S. government property, such
as on military bases both in America and abroad.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The policy steps listed above can
be taken to strengthen the hand of law enforcement against obscenity.
In 1970, the U.S. Postal Service identified 25 mail-order companies
across the country which sent unsolicited, sexually-explicit material
to homes across the country.  By March 1988, the number had grown
to 100 such companies.  Sex movies now make up more than 27 percent
of national video rental revenue.  Rentals and sales of adult
videos soared to $2.5 billion in 1994, and one analyst predicted
a 15 percent increase in that figure when 1995 figures become
available.

<p>

Pornography is also rampant on the worldwide computer system called
the Internet.  In June 1995, a team at Carnegie-Mellon University
released the results of a quantitative analysis of more than 900,000
items on the Internet.  The results:

<p><ul>

<li>83.5 percent of pictorial images available on Usenet newsgroups
devoted to images are pornographic;

<p>

<li>More than 48 percent of all &quot;downloads&quot; from 
&quot;adult&quot; commercial outlets are child porn;

<p>

<li>The two most-frequently-accessed picture categories on the 
&quot;adult&quot; market are child porn and bestiality.

</ul><p>

Dr. Dolf Zillman of Indiana
University, who has conducted research on attitudinal changes
caused by &quot;soft-core&quot; pornography, wrote, &quot;Whatever
the specific contents of standard pornography, there can be no
doubt that effects are created, and consistently so.  There can
be no doubt that pornography, as a form of particularly male entertainment,
promotes the victimization of women in particular.&quot;

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The enforcement of laws against obscenity and
the development of more legislation to protect our communities
from pornography in all its forms will result in a more family-friendly
world in which to raise children.  When parents and their children
enter the world of television, movies, radio, cyberspace, video
stores, and magazine shelves, the landscape will no longer resemble
fields of land mines.  Women will be protected, as will the institution
of marriage itself.  The deterioration of neighborhoods which
pornography brings will be reversed.  Incidents of date rape and
sexual harassment will be significantly reduced.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>22. What can be done to promote premarital sexual abstinence
and responsible sex education?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> National and local acknowledgment of parents
as the primary sex educators of their children.  National and
local publicity for and support of grass-roots initiatives which
promote abstinence and secondary virginity, especially those which
are faith-based in their approach.  Local school boards that cooperate
with parents to determine which, if any, sex education curriculum
should be implemented.  Most importantly, parents that give special
attention to personally teaching their own children about sexual
abstinence.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In recent years, encouraging premarital
abstinence has not been a national priority.  Rather, parents
have often had to single-handedly defend their values to their
children against the onslaught of media, school sex education
programs and school-based clinics, federal family planning initiatives,
and the rhetoric of national leaders which irresponsibly condone
out-of-wedlock sexual activity and attempt to separate premarital
sexual behavior from its inevitable and devastating consequences.

<p>

While there are many federal initiatives which promote &quot;family
planning&quot; and other types of sex education which undermine
the pre-marital sexual abstinence message (i.e., Title X of the
Public Health Service Act, the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage
Pregnancy, etc.), only Title XX of the Public Health Service Act
has devoted any monies and resources to promoting sexual abstinence.
Title XX funding has hovered around $6 million for several years
now, but only about one-third of these monies are dedicated to
abstinence education programs (as opposed to the nearly $200 million
appropriated for Title X alone).  More recently, $75 million was
appropriated for abstinence education in the welfare bill, but
President Clinton vetoed the measure.

<p>

While the Family Research Council supports measures that would
promote pre-marital sexual abstinence, FRC is firmly committed
to the principle that those who are best equipped to guide our
nation's children towards sexual abstinence and other moral and 
character values are their parents first and their community second. 
We believe that the proper role of the government and the media is 
to acknowledge the primary role of parents and to support their 
efforts.

<p>

Promoting premarital sexual abstinence makes good sense in a day
and age when out-of-wedlock pregnancies, illegitimacy, abortion,
and sexually-transmitted diseases are rampant, especially among
the young.  Not only does premarital abstinence help young people
to successfully avoid these physical and societal scourges, it
also increases the likelihood that they will experience an enduring
marriage, sexual satisfaction, and emotional and psychological
health.

<p>

For those young people who do not have the benefit of an intact,
two-parent home,  community programs which promote abstinence
are vitally important.  For example, the Washington, D.C.-based
<I>Best Friends</I> program has successfully helped more than
400 girls aged 10-18 to preserve their virginity and rise above
the teen motherhood and welfare dependency to which so many of
their peers have fallen victim.  In addition to <I>Best Friends</I>,
church-based initiatives such as <I>True Love Waits</I> and school-based
programs such as <I>Teen-Aid</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>Teen Choice</I> have all been effective in helping young people
make a commitment towards premarital sexual abstinence.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Enabling parents, churches, and communities to
promote and encourage pre-marital sexual abstinence will strengthen
the American family, especially in the long-term as today's abstinent
young people grow up to form healthy marriages and families. 
Promoting abstinence will also help reduce the incidence and prevalence
of sexually-transmitted diseases, out-of-wedlock pregnancies,
illegitimacy, and welfare-dependency.  Furthermore, the focus
on parents and grass-roots community activism away from government
directives will cost taxpayers less money and will result in better
outcomes for our nation's youth, families, and local communities.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>23. What is FRC's position on spousal benefits?</h2></center>

<p>

In an effort to help alleviate the financial burden on families
in which one spouse stays at home, and to recognize the important
contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production
of employed spouses (an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce
settlements), FRC fully supports spousal benefits.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Legislation allowing expansion of IRA benefits
to non-employed spouses.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Complementing the attractive idea
of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free up family finances
(e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education,
and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility
of IRAs to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the
eligibility of IRAs in general would primarily benefit upper-middle-
and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the
eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily
to middle-income families with children -- those most in need
of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim
almost twice the benefits of single-earner couples, penalizing
those families who choose to stay at home with their children
and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker
makes to the income production of the employed spouse.

<p>

The acknowledgment of the non-employed spouse as a contributor
to the income production of the employed spouse is one already
made in divorce settlements, and is an important principle for
Congress to reinforce.  For families with children, current IRA
benefits financially reinforce families where both parents work
outside the home, while penalizing those families who choose to
have one spouse stay at home to care for the children.

<p>

Legislation broadening IRA eligibility was passed in both the
House and Senate, but vetoed by President Clinton in the proposed
budget for 1996.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing
field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief
to American families.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The passage of legislation increasing pro-family
spousal benefits is key to underscoring the importance of the
family and to providing tangible aid to middle-class American
families.  Broadening IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would
give hard-working middle-class families help, by providing savings
and income options for families where one parent stays home to
raise children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>24. Does FRC support Title X of the Public Health Service
Act?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that defunding Title X is the first step in removing
the federal government's imprimatur on out-of-wedlock sex and
to halt its role in distributing contraception to minors without
parental consent.  Defunding Title X is justifiable and necessary
because the program has failed to achieve the goals of reducing
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion.  Indeed, since the inception
of Title X, both the out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion rates
have increased dramatically.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Zero out funding of Title X of the Public
Health Service Act.  If complete defunding is unsuccessful, support
efforts which cut funding of the program and/or insert &quot;strings&quot;
such as requiring parental notification or consent for any contraception
given to minors, or requiring outcome evaluations of clinics which
receive Title X funds to show their impact on pregnancy, STD,
and abortion rates among clinic &quot;clients.&quot;

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Title X of the Public Health Service
Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning
projects throughout the country.  It has been funded by Congress
every year through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bills which Congress
considers and passes every summer as part of the federal budget.
The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning
clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution
of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental
consent.  Title X received more than $193 million last year and should
be defunded altogether.

<p>

The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title
X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock
births, pregnancies, and abortions have all risen dramatically,
particularly in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
Consider the teenage population alone.  Since 1970, the teenage
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and birth rates have doubled, the teenage
abortion rate has more than doubled, and many sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically.  While not
all of this can be directly tied to Title X funding, it is certain
that the federal government's sanction for such programs has led
to an undermining of moral standards by accepting premarital sex
among teenagers as a cultural norm.

<p>

Secondly, Title X should not continue to receive federal funding
because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired
in 1985.

<p>

Third, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as
Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide
family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.
There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical
family planning program when state governments have the capability
to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative
block grant.

<p>

Finally, Title X's contraceptive approach leaves many vulnerable
girls open to abuse.  New studies show that most teenage mothers
are not &quot;sexually active&quot; ingenues, but rather victims
of sexual exploitation by much older men.  Title X's contraceptive
approach does not protect these young girls, it only &quot;equips&quot;
them for continued abuse.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding Title X will help to uphold the first
principle of the Hippocratic Oath to &quot;do no harm.&quot; 
It will place limits on the wrongheaded attempts of the government
to redefine family life and the social parameters regarding out-of-wedlock
sex.  It will also help to lessen the large monetary advantage
that so-called family planning programs have over abstinence programs,
which have demonstrated superior ability to promote healthy attitudes
and behaviors in the young.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>25. What is FRC's position on the United Nations' Convention
on the Rights of the Child?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child
poses threats to the institution of the family.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> No U.S. ratification of the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The United Nations was created
in 1945 in the shadow of the Second World War as an attempt by
the victorious democracies to establish an international body
to safeguard the peace and promote human rights.  The U.N. has
attempted to give voice to the common aspirations of the world's
people.  In the past two decades, however, the U.N. has expanded
its agenda in ways that pose direct threats to the traditional
family.

<p>

Among the most threatening is the U.N. Convention of the Rights
of the Child, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly
in 1989.  One prominent theme from the Convention is the notion
that children ought to be protected from the power of their parents.
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
For example, Article 12 grants children &quot;the right to express
views freely in all matters.&quot;  Would Article 12 permit parents
to restrict their children from getting tattoos, or talking back
to authority figures?  Article 15 guarantees children the &quot;freedom
of association.&quot;  One can envision a law that prevents parents
from restricting a child's choice of friends.  Conceivably, Article
14's freedom of religion could prevent a parent from taking a
child to church when he would rather not go.  Under Article 13,
a child has the right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information.&quot;
There are no exceptions to this right, not even for parents who
would like to keep pornography from their children.

<p>

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, signed the
treaty in 1995, and it will become law in this country if the
Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds vote.  The required vote in
the Senate does not seem likely now, because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
In fact, Sen. Helms has introduced a Senate Resolution which
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators have co-sponsored this resolution.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> As an international treaty, the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child would be co-equal with federal statutes,
and possibly the United States Constitution.  If the United States
were to ratify the treaty as it stands, it would become not only
an international obligation, but also a domestic obligation potentially
regulating the most intimate details of American family life.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>26. Does FRC support the adoption of a $500 per child tax
credit for every American family with children?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports the adoption of a $500 per child tax credit for every
American family with children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> FRC has been calling on Congress
to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average
family of four contributes nearly 25 cents on every dollar in
income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government -- this
is compared to two cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of
this, the per child tax credit was designed to help offset the
extraordinary erosion in per child income tax benefits over the
last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief
should be a top priority in the ensuing debate in Congress and
in the presidential debates.  The $500 per child tax credit was
vetoed by President Clinton as part of the balanced budget package.
FRC believes that per child tax relief should be the centerpiece
of any tax reform package.

<p>

Many critics and lukewarm supporters have expressed concern about
offsetting the revenues lost to such tax cuts.  In recent years,
the Heritage Foundation and others have developed ways to offset
generous pro-family tax relief with significant cuts in federal
spending programs.  These proposals have considerable merit --
as do proposals which would seek to offset the &quot;cost&quot;
of pro-family tax relief over the long haul by raising the retirement
age for various federal entitlement programs.

<p>

Streamlining government and permitting families to keep more of
their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing
purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy
and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax
relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the
budget and make government more efficient.  Of course, pro-family
tax relief also sends to families the message that their dedication
to their children is invaluable to America, as they are the next
generation of American citizens.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Tax relief for families with children will strengthen
the American home and its finances, place real limits on the growth
of government and its wrongheaded attempts to redirect family
life, and underscore that the best &quot;investment&quot; in children
is made by mothers and fathers who, indeed, &quot;know best.&quot;

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>27. Does FRC support welfare reform?  Why?</h2></center>

<p>

To control the damage caused by federal welfare programs that
promote family breakdown and crowd out more compassionate alternatives
at the grass-roots (including private, faith-based programs),
FRC supports compassionate welfare reform.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> End the entitlement status of all cash
benefits that reward irresponsible conduct, particularly benefits
that are contingent on the birth of a child outside marriage;
end the federal tax code's marriage penalty on low- and middle-income
taxpayers; end the federal role in welfare -- both funding and
programmatic responsibility -- to maximize states' flexibility
to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral
requirements; revise the tax code to encourage charitable giving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current welfare system encourages
family disintegration and discourages personal responsibility
by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits regardless of personal
conduct.  The bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer
those benefits, in turn, tend to crowd out the voluntary organizations
that provide the real help -- the help that changes lives.

<p>

The culture of welfare dependency has reduced a potentially proud
and independent people to passive clients.  The current system
sends the message not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges
of life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less capable
group of citizens than those who can and do live by the rules.
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do
it for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
Current policy empowers the bureaucracy at the same time it destroys
individuals, and children are inheriting not only material poverty
but their parents' poverty of the spirit.

<p>

It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reform will
cause suffering.  Policymakers must come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  No one can expect to roll
back the tide until more children are growing up with an attentive
father in the home.  The overriding purpose of welfare reform
<I>must</I> be to reverse government policies that suppress the
natural human instinct to form families.

<p>

Policymakers can disapprove of personal decisions that jeopardize
children and yet still provide help.  Measures like the tax credit
for charitable contributions deserve support because the most
compassionate help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support -- on the premise that needy individuals are not clients
but fellow human beings.  Welfare policy should in no way jeopardize
the autonomy of the faith-based programs that have a proven track
record of rescuing lives when all other programs have failed.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Compassionate welfare reform will ensure that
more children have the opportunity to reap the benefits of stable,
two-parent families.  It will expand the freedom of individuals
to make rational, responsible decisions by eliminating the perverse
economic incentives of the current welfare system.  It will also
redirect dollars to those organizations that provide not only
material help but also love, concern, and an opportunity for personal
renewal.

<center><h2>28. Does FRC support exemptions for women in 
combat?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC fully supports the armed forces exemption of women from combat
and near-combat assignments.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Re-impose combat exemptions for women and
reverse decisions to dramatically increase the number of women
serving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, Congress rescinded female
combat exemption laws and then the Clinton administration opened
a quarter million previously closed combat and near-combat positions
to women.  These decisions were not prompted by military necessity,
and they hinder military readiness.

<p>

According to the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces, there are undeniable differences
in speed, strength and endurance between men and women.  Women
will always be in greater danger on the battlefield.  Women do
not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;  That's
why the most physically demanding combat assignments should go
to men.  Additionally, a downsizing military does not need women
when an ample pool of fully-qualified men is available.

<p>

Assigning women to combat also makes women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 1948 Selective Service Act requires all 18-year-old
male citizens to register for a possible draft.  In the 1981 case
of <I>Rostker v. Goldberg</I>, the Supreme Court ruled that women
were excluded from selective service registration primarily because
the law exists to develop a pool of potential combat troops; women
at that time were not eligible for combat.  That argument is losing
credibility as more combat exemptions are being abandoned.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Removing exemptions for women weakens the military
and makes all women vulnerable to a future draft.

<p>

The military exists to perform the most physically demanding task
known to man: combat.  Removing exemptions so that more women
can serve in combat and near-combat is not a prudent readiness
decision.  It weakens America's combat power.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>29. What is FRC's position on informed consent for women's
reproductive health decisions?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that women have the right to be fully informed about
both immediate and future risks to their physical and emotional
health, especially with regards to induced abortion.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Require that all health care professionals,
especially counselors and practitioners working in family planning
clinics and public health departments, effectively communicate
to their patients or &quot;clients&quot; the risks involved in
abortion, e.g., the increased risk of breast cancer for women
who have abortions.  (2) Require that all abortion clinics (as
well as other medical facilities offering abortions) perform an
ultrasound exam on abortion-minded women in order to (a) confirm
pregnancy and (b) to educate the woman about what the abortion
procedure entails. (3) Require post-abortion counseling centers
or other physicians to be integrated within protocol in order
to achieve true informed consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> It is routine public health practice
that patients be informed of all their risks before undergoing
a medical procedure or receiving medication of any kind.  However,
while technology has rapidly advanced and more data have been
acquired in the field of women's reproductive health, the abortion
industry and family planning clinics have not been regulated to
the same degree as hospitals and other health care facilities.
As a result, it is dubious that women are truly receiving all
the information they need to make fully informed decisions about
their reproductive health.

<p>

For example, women are currently not advised of the possibility
that induced abortion increases their risk of breast cancer, especially
if they have borne no other children to full term.  And yet, there
are more than 20 epidemiologic studies spanning the last two decades
which show a link between abortion (induced or spontaneous) and
breast cancer.  Indeed, the prestigious <I>Journal of the National
Cancer Institute</I> published a 1994 study which found that women
who have had an abortion before age 18 are 150 percent more likely
to develop breast cancer.  Women who have had an abortion after
age 30 increase their risk of breast cancer by 110 percent, and,
regardless of age, abortion increases the risk of breast cancer
by 50 percent.  With approximately 1.5 million abortions taking
place in the United States every year, 40 percent of which are
repeat abortions, and with one in every nine American women developing
breast cancer in their lifetimes, it is remarkable and highly
unethical that women are not informed of such risks.

<p>

In addition, there is ample evidence to suggest that many women
undergoing abortion suffer from post-abortion grief or trauma.
Indeed, support groups such as Project Rachel and organizations
such as American Victims of Abortion exist because of the emotional
scars post-abortive women bear.  Yet women are not being informed
of their risk of experiencing post-abortion grief nor are referrals
to any of the aforementioned organizations being given as part
of the typical abortion clinic's protocol.

<p>

Furthermore, achieving true informed consent becomes even more
important as several abortion clinics are currently using new
experimental abortifacients, such as the off-label usage of the
anti-cancer drug methotrexate in combination with the prostaglandin
cytotec.  Neither of these drugs is approved for the use of abortion,
yet several abortionists are regularly offering these drugs to
their patients, even though there is little research available
to prove their safety or efficacy.

<p>

Beyond providing appropriate counseling regarding abortion's physical
and emotional risks, abortion clinics should also be required
to give each abortion-minded woman an ultrasound exam in order
to confirm pregnancy and better explain the abortion procedure
to the woman.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Achieving true informed consent will (1) require
abortion clinic counselors to devote more time to each counseling
session, (2) require abortion clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment
and employ staff who are knowledgeable in operating the ultrasound,
(3) require that the most up-to-date research on the safety and
efficacy of abortion techniques, the physical and emotional risks
involved with abortion, and information about post-abortion grief
organizations are available for all clients.  Abortion clinics
will also need to come under the jurisdiction of a medical regulatory
agency in order to make certain that they are adhering to the
standards of true informed consent outlined above.  While these
regulations will require providers of abortion to alter their
practices, the standards are absolutely necessary to achieve the
overriding goal of protecting women's health and giving women
all the information they need to make an informed choice.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

<H3>The Looming Crisis</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is your financial future at risk? Do you worry that your stnadard
of living is threatened? Does it concern you that for the first time in
America's history young adults today do not believe they will exceed the
achievements of their parents' generation?<BR>
<BR>
If you answered yes you are not alone. Millions of us -- Baby Boomers and
Gen Xers -- have lost faith in America's twin promises of retirment security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Saving Social Security</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think we can shore up the failing Social Security
system by pouring billions more tax dollars into a system basically unchanged
since President Roosevelt introduced in in 1935. Others say it should be
scrapped altogether, that we should break the promises ratified by every
US President since Roosevelt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Mission</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Economic Security 2000 is committed to reviving the Roosevelet
committment to retirment security and restoring economic opportunity to
millioins of Americans, many workings tow and three jobs without getting
ahead.<BR>
<BR>
We have time to transform Social Security, but we must act quickly -- before
the year 2000. America's third cnetury can be an era of security, ownership,
growth, savings, investment, and unprecedented prosperity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Economic Security 2000 presents a blueprint for restoring the American
Dream. This is your call to action. Together let's begin a national debate.<BR>
<BR>
We cannot continue a pay-as-you-go Social Security System that will require
staggering tax increases and huge cuts in benefits.<BR>
<BR>
We cannton abandon Social Security and Roosevelt promise of a safety net
for retirees, non-wage earners, and the disabled.<BR>
<BR>
Let's take the sensible approach and capitalize the system and save Social

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.
<BR>
<BR>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.

If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

<P><CENTER>F<B>or more than a century, science attempted to explain all
human behaviour as the subrational product of unbending chemical, genetic,
or environmental forces. The spiritual side of human nature was ignored,
if not denied outright. <BR>
<BR>
This rigid scientific materialism infected all other areas of human knowledge,
laying the foundations for much of modern psychology, sociology, economics,
and political science. Yet today new developments in biology, physics, and
artificial intelligence are raising serious doubts about scientific materialism
and re-opening the case for the supernatural. <BR>
<BR>
What do these exciting developments mean for the social sciences that were
built upon the foundation of materialism? This project brings together leading
scholars from the natural sciences and those from the humanities and social
sciences in order to explore what the demise of materialism means for reviving

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>New technologies will continue to be powerful agents of growth
and progress in the next century, opening up traditional fields to a surge
of entrepreneurial activity that can help revive our culture and economy.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta
Katz</A>, <A HREF="brownleebio.html">Lisa Brownlee</A>, and Adjunct Fellow
<A HREF="perelman.html">Lewis Perelman</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Properly enabled, new technology is a still unimagined boon. In books such
as <I><A HREF="books.html">MICROCOSM</A>, <A HREF="schlsout.html">SCHOOL'S
OUT</A>, <A HREF="life-tv.html">LIFE AFTER TELEVISION</A></I>, and, soon,
<I>TELECOSM</I>, Gilder and other Discovery Fellows are defining the issues,
as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Rising distrust of government threatens to demoralize our system of representative
democracy. Headeded by Discovery Institute president <A HREF="chapman.html">Bruce
Chapman,</A> the program identifies the origins of this threat in the decline
of civics instruction, diminished rewards for virtue in public life, the
unintended consequences of the political reform movement, and the over-reaching
ambition of government itself.<BR>
<BR>
The program aims to restaste the purposes of robust and effective representative
democracy, advocating a &quot;reform of the reforms,&quot; strengthened
political parties, and revived commitment to public service. Discovery Fellows
involved in the program include <A HREF="gold.html">Dr. Philip Gold</A>,
<A HREF="jwestbio.html">Dr. John G. West</A>, and Egils Milbergs.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>How to protect the natural environment without sacrificing the human

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers’ funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the group’s philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nation’s fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.    
<p>
<center>
<img alt="NCSC Annual Revenue Graph" src="1040img.gif">
</center>
<p>
The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIO’s toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnson’s in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With America’s welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The group’s president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
union’s own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nation’s 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="prob"><h4>NOT A NEW PROBLEM</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organization’s resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS AREN’T WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administration’s attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congress’s intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employee’s] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers’ funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups’ employees will sometimes proselytize the 
program’s beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.

<b>Total&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $1.8 billion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.
<BR>

<P>
<b>1. AmeriCorps&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $427 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<P>
<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<P>
<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b1.html">February 7</a>
<dd>This show brought you a look at the 104th Congress and what 1996 could 
entail for them. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b2.html">February 14</a>
<dd>This show celebrated Valentine's Day with a new slant on what many consider to 
be true romance: abstinence. Saving sex for marriage seems to be an increasing 
trend, and this show introduced some people who explained this 
not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b3.html">February 21</a>
<dd>This show discussed one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b4.html">February 28</a>
<dd>This week's episode discussed how the media influences 
society today. From television to movies to music to the Internet, 
we are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see, hear, 
and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make. Does the media take 
such a responsibility seriously?

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c1.html">March 6</a>
<dd>This show brought you a unique discussion about the 
diverse strategies to combat our Nation's war against drugs, and the 
experts who joined in the discussion range from a former lieutenant colonel 
in the U.S. Army, a psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical and 
policy areas of drug addiction, and a former state drug czar.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c2.html">March 13</a>
<dd>This show took a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing 
and life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. 
If adoption is viewed as the best alternative to unwed 
pregnancy by the majority of Americans, why is it so hard for 
couples to adopt children in our own country?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c4.html">March 27</a>
<dd>This week's show brought you clips from the 
Washington Briefing which was hosted by FRC on March 18

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d1.html">April 3</a>
<dd>This show brought you more highlights from the briefing 
with more speakers and insightful discussions on our current government, 
the government to come, and how America's schools are affected.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d2.html">April 10</a>
<dd>This week's show discussed a matter which could destroy marriage
and family as we know it by redefining marriage to include gay
unions.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d3.html">April 17</a>
<dd>This show presented some insider information from those 
who attended the recent 1996 National Education Summit. Will 
the solutions that came out of it help your children?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d4.html">April 24</a>
<dd>This show discussed an issue not often seen in secular news 
coverage: religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world. It showed how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?

insights into motherhood.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96e3.html">May 15</a>
<dd>This episode discussed a chilling issue

come with a contract of death.

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96e4.html">May 22</a>
<dd>In this week's show, we heard from an American hero, 
Captain Scott O'Grady, the courageous pilot who was rescued

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f1.html">June 5</a>
<dd>This episode took you to the Stand for 
Children rally, whose name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children. But the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f3.html">June 19</a>
<dd>Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the revered 
position it once held in our national culture. This episode 
dealt with the harsh reality that thousands upon thousands 
of America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f4.html">June 26</a>
<dd>Parental rights have slowly diminished in our schools and 
our culture. This episode helped us to understand why parents 
are fighting for their inherent rights to lovingly guide their 
own children.

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g1.html">July 3</a>
<dd>In this episode, we alerted parents to a new affront
against America's children as a recent court case was discussed 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g2.html">July 10</a>
<dd>This episode shared some key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g3.html">July 17</a>
<dd>This show presented more experts who brought
their well-researched insights into the defense of marriage, 
and there was personal testimony from a former 
homosexual man who now helps homosexuals who wish to leave 
that lifestyle.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g4.html">July 24</a>
<dd>This episode presented a completely different 
marriage tragedy, its possible collapse, as seen by author 
Maggie Gallagher, who wrote the recent best seller, 
<i>Abolition of Marriage</i>. Has our country discarded this 
founding union?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g5.html">July 31</a>
<dd>This show discussed RU-486, the abortion pill, and how 
this abortion method could lead to severe physical, emotional, 
psychological and legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.

<center><h2>October 1996 <i>Straight Talk</i> Transcripts</h2></center>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j1.html">October 2</a>
<dd>This episode discussed some of the historic and controversial 
issues from the 104th Congress that caught the attention of those 
both on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j3.html">October 16</a>
<dd>This show focused on a topic which
once was taboo but now is a regular part of many television
sitcoms. It's a hot point of controversy, and the topic is 
homosexuality. Former homosexuals told about their life experiences.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j4.html">October 23</a>
<dd>This show brought you a perspective 
on election issues from the unique viewpoint of women.
Since the suffrage movement, women have fought to make their 
mark in political discussions that shape our nation.  Is the 
women's movement what it was in the sixties as women battle 
for equal rights?  Do single mothers have a voice in our 
nation?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j5.html">October 30</a>
<dd>Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children. 
In this episode, FRC stood with the American Family
Association and recognized Pornography Awareness Week.

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<b>Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging 
Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments
<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(3) the smaller conventional forces likely resulting from the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration will be too small to fulfill the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(4) the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met by fielding conventional forces capable of fighting and winning one major regional conflict, roughly the size of the Persian Gulf War, and one minor regional conflict, roughly the size of the 1989 invasion of Panama, simultaneously, as opposed to the two major regional conflicts called for by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
(5) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States requires the United States to contribute military forces to peacekeeping missions only when doing so will serve to protect the vital interests of the United States;
<p>
(6) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met with conventional military forces roughly of the size proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, which include the equivalent of 15 total divisions in the Army (10 active divisions), twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 aircraft carrier battle groups (active) in the Navy; and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps, provided these forces are both combat ready and fully modernized;
<p>
(7) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be achieved with a total military manpower endstrength similar to that proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, some 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
(8)  Congress should provide the funds required for the forces recommended by this resolution, even though they will likely be substantially more than what the Clinton Administration has budgeted for defense over the next six years. </blockquote></blockquote>

ADOPTION PLANS?</h2>

<p>

A glaring discrepancy exists between what Americans believe and
how they behave regarding adoption as a positive response to crisis
pregnancies. Consider the following data:

<p>

<li>Many Americans believe that adoption is the best response
to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. A 1995 Family Research Council
survey of 1,000 Americans found that, when presented with four
options to resolve out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies, 29 percent
of respondents thought it best to &quot;have the child and put
it up for adoption;&quot; 24 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to marry the child's father and have the child;&quot; 11
percent thought it best for the mother &quot;to have the child
and raise it by herself;&quot; and only 8 percent thought it best
for her to have an abortion.[1]

<p>

However, in reality, 46 percent of all the nonmarital pregnancies
in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent ended in miscarriage,
and 44 percent were carried to term, of which only 2 percent were
placed for adoption.[2] (It is not known whether the mother eventually
married the child's father or chose to raise the child by herself
in the remaining 98 percent of &quot;live birth&quot; cases.)

<p>

<li>Many young, unmarried pregnant women also hold favorable attitudes
toward those who choose adoption. A survey of such women staying
in maternity homes found that the majority, regardless of whether
they were choosing adoption or single parenthood, hold positive
attitudes toward mothers who place their children for adoption.
The respondents believe that a woman who places her baby for adoption
loves the baby, wants the best for the baby, is being a good parent
in a special way, is being responsible, and is neither selfish
nor abandoning the baby.[3] Nevertheless, many of these same unmarried
pregnant women had never considered adoption as an option for
their children.

<p>

Why do so few unmarried women choose adoption in reality when
both they and the general American public hold favorable attitudes
toward adoption? Also, what accounts for the decline of adoptions 
over time? Before 1973, about one in five non-marital births to white 
women was placed for adoption. By the late 1970s, this proportion had 
shrunk to less than one in 10, and by the late 1980s, to one in 30.[4]

<p>

The answer may lie less in the fact that public opinion towards
adoption has changed than in the fact that other options have
overshadowed adoption, making adoption less visible as an alternative.

<p>

The impact of three major social trends during the last two to
three decades may provide some clues to this phenomenon:

<p>

(1) <b>Increasing Social Acceptance of Single Parenthood</b> --
The sheer prevalence of single-parent families has increased the
social acceptability of single motherhood. For example, in 1970,
13 percent of all families with children were single-parent families.
By 1994, more than 30 percent of all families with children were
headed by a single parent.[5]

<p>

The trend towards single parenthood began with the liberalizing
of divorce laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the subsequent
divorce epidemic. Indeed, the number of divorces per year tripled
between 1960 and 1990.[6] But when divorce began to level off in
the 1980s, the growth in illegitimacy continued the trend. In
1970, 11 percent of all births were to unmarried women; in 1980,
18 percent of all births were nonmarital; and by 1991, an astounding
30 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock.[7] Yet, even more significant
than the rise in nonmarital births is the even faster growth in
the <I>visibility</I> of illegitimacy. Adoption helps to mask
the visibility of illegitimacy because the child born out-of-wedlock
is immediately placed in a two-parent home. However, the proportion
of unmarried women choosing adoption dramatically declined during
the same time period that illegitimacy rates rose.

<p>

It is this high visibility of single-parent families that has
made single parenting normative in today's society. Thus, there
is more precedent for young unmarried women to choose single parenthood
and comparatively less incentive for them to place their children
in adoptive homes.

<p>

(2) <b>The Legalization of Abortion</b> -- The introduction of
abortion has greatly diminished the likelihood of choosing adoption
because it has altered the thought processes by which both the
pregnant woman and her counselors approach an unintended pregnancy.

<p>

Before abortion was legalized, women facing a crisis pregnancy
had only to decide among three or four options: adoption, marrying
the father, raising the child herself and/or having her parent
raise the child. Among these options, adoption fared relatively
well as one in five white women chose adoption.

<p>

However, after abortion was legalized, a two-tiered thought process
replaced the previously one-tiered process. The preeminent question
was no longer &quot;Who shall raise this child?&quot; but rather,
&quot;Shall I have this child?&quot; And with that change in question
also came a change in focus from being child-centered to woman-centered.
Thus, it is not surprising that fewer women are choosing adoption
because adoption typically requires a child-centered focus.

<p>

Since the legalization of abortion, pregnancy counselors must
also spend much more time and effort addressing the first question
of &quot;Shall this pregnancy be carried to term or aborted?&quot;
And while this must be the first question addressed, too often
counselors give short shrift to the second question of &quot;Who
shall raise this child?&quot; One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors failed to include adoption as an option
in their counseling. Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. Some
even failed to present adoption as an option because they thought
the girls would not want to hear about it.[8]

<p>

(3) <b>Increasing Availability and Use of Welfare Benefits</b>
-- To the degree financial considerations play a role in whether
a woman chooses to marry, place for adoption, or raise the child
herself, the increasing availability and use of welfare benefits
add weight to the single-parenting option. Beginning in the late
1960s, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid
benefits for pregnant, single mothers became well-established
and well-used. Both AFDC and Medicaid have grown tremendously
over the last two decades as more and more unwed mothers have
chosen single parenthood. Knowing that they have this &quot;safety
net&quot; on which to fall back, many unmarried women choose to
raise their infants rather than make adoption plans.

<p>

In conclusion, despite the fact that most Americans favorably
view adoption, several major social trends have altered the course
of the discussion and made the adoption option less visible. However,
there is a growing counter-movement to change the terms of discourse
once again and combat the social trends that lead not only to
fewer adoptions, but also to greater numbers of out-of-wedlock
births, abortions, and welfare recipients. During the mid-1980s,
a &quot;new wave&quot; of adoption and maternity services agencies
began opening up in the United States. These include more private
adoption agencies, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, maternity
homes, and private charitable organizations. The degree to which
these institutions grow more visible and flourish is the degree
to which adoption can grow, narrowing the gap between public opinion
and reality.

<title>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</title>

<p>

<h2>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES<br>
RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Two military homosexual cases are now competing for a Supreme
Court hearing. Both cases have already been heard at the appellate
court level, and decisions are expected by the summer.

<p>

These cases are complicated by major differences between the congressional
law concerning homosexuality in the armed forces (Defense Authorization
Act of 1994, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654) and the regulations issued
by the Clinton administration to implement this law (DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30).[1]

<p>

These differences include:

<p><ul>

<li>As passed by Congress, the law forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals and drop the principled and unambiguous statement
that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
propensity to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation. In addition, the Clinton
regulations hinder military criminal investigators from investigating
private consensual sexual misconduct (sodomy and adultery).

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons.
But contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. Information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without permission
from high-level political appointees.

</ul><p>

<center><h3><i>ABEL ET AL. V. U.S.A.</i></h3></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the first federal challenge to the military's homosexual policy.[2]
The case involves six avowed homosexuals who allege that the military's
policy violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights.

<p>

This case was filed in 1994 shortly after the congressional law
took effect. The plaintiffs skirted the military's normal administrative
process and went straight to federal court seeking a preliminary
injunction (PI) barring the military from discharging them until
their constitutional challenge was resolved. The government sought
relief from the PI via the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d Circuit,
and was granted that motion, forcing the lower court to hurry
up the hearing.

<p>

In March, 1995, <I>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</I> was heard by Judge
Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York. Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union
represented the homosexual service members. They called six 
&quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's claim of a 
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals. Curiously, Clinton Justice 
Department lawyers did not counter any of these witnesses with expert 
testimony from defenders of the ban.

<p>

In addition, the Justice Department failed to:[3]

<p><ul>

<li>Present well-documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.

<p>

<li>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.

<p>

<li>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence
that homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military.

</ul><p>

The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them based on their
homosexuality. The government argued that this is not a First
Amendment issue because the law and the policy are directed solely
at the prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to
rebut the presumption of misconduct. However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct. In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.

<p>

The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively. Judge Nickerson
found for the plaintiffs.[4] He labeled the discrimination unjustified
and noted key differences between the congressional law and the
Clinton policy:

<p><ul>

<li>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and
orientation at the point of admission, the Clinton administration
has rejected such questions. The judge labeled this as unusual.
On one hand the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not
making homosexuality part of a pre-induction litmus test) and
then insists that the homosexual remain secretive about his 
&quot;status.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the policy permits
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct. This creates a
status/conduct dichotomy. The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian&quot; because the government failed to show
a connection between a declaration of homosexuality and misconduct.
The judge understandably concluded &quot;that the admission of
homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would
commit acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order, and 
discipline....&quot;

</ul><p>

Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine the constitutionality
of the policy [read law] adopted by Congress, not its morality.&quot;
He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to think it demeaning
and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy [read law] on
pretense rather than on truth.&quot;

<p>

Nickerson's decision was appealed by the government to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. The hearing
was set for December 19 but was postponed due to unusual circumstances.

<p>

The night before the hearing, a letter was faxed to one of the
judges from the Justice Department. It reminded Judge Guido Calabresi
that back in March 1993 he had signed a letter to Congress maintaining
that legislation banning homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional.
At the time he co-signed the letter with 118 other lawyers, Judge
Calabresi was the dean of the Yale Law School. He was appointed
by President Clinton to the federal bench in 1994.

<p>

Calabresi's letter says, &quot;The ban on military service by
lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans violates the most basic premise
of equal protection law: that all similarly situated persons should
be treated alike.&quot;[5]

<p>

The judge recused himself from the case the morning of the scheduled
hearing. The case was rescheduled with a new panel and heard on
January 16, 1996.

<p>

At that hearing, Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., a Bush appointee,
demonstrated an understanding of the law's intent. &quot;If you
say you're a homosexual,&quot; Walker said, &quot;in order to
rebut the presumption, you can't be a homosexual. A person is
either joking, mistaken, lying or expressing vague desires, as
opposed to propensity.&quot;[6]

<p>

Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler urged the court to &quot;rely
on the policy,&quot; which rationally allows a superior to address
an issue. He noted that the policy works and explained that seven
avowed homosexuals have already rebutted the presumption of conduct
and have been allowed to continue serving. Finally, he recommended
overturning the lower court's decision because the homosexual
members failed to exhaust administrative challenges before taking
their case to court.[7]

<p>

Matthew A. Coles, of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued
that the military has no right to ban either homosexual acts or
their speech. He also challenged the reasoning behind the idea
that homosexuals should have to rebut the presumption that they
will engage in homosexual acts.[8]

<p>

Judge Pierre Leval asked Coles to respond to a parallel situation.
Leval posed the question, what would the military do if someone
declared himself a white supremacist? Coles said the military
would do nothing. But the judge argued that at least the military
would investigate to determine whether the individual intended
to act on his beliefs.[9]

<p>

<center><h3><i>THOMASSON V. PERRY</i></h3></center>

<p>

FRC had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the Fourth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>.[10] Lt. Paul G. Thomasson is an avowed
homosexual who petitioned the court to declare the military's
ban unconstitutional. FRC defended the law while the Justice Department
hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty policy.

<p>

This case has followed an unusual track. It began on March 2,
1994, the day Thomasson wrote a letter to his boss at the Bureau
of Naval Personnel in Arlington, Virginia. The letter contained
the declaration, &quot;I am gay.&quot; A Navy administrative board
discharged him June 15,1994 for homosexuality. Thomasson never
admitted to homosexual conduct and failed to rebut the presumption
of misconduct.[11]

<p>

He subsequently filed a motion for relief with the U.S. Federal
Court for the Eastern District of New York asking the court to
declare the military's policy unconstitutional. U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the policy was constitutional
upholding Thomasson's honorable discharge. Thomasson's appeal
of that decision was then heard by a three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Alexandria, Virginia.[12]

<p>

On September 12, 1995, at the appeals court hearing, one of the
judges said the Clinton administration has a &quot;problem&quot;
in defending its &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on homosexuals.
It does not match the intent of Congress.[13]

<p>

Judge J. Michael Luttig told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler,
who argued that the Clinton policy is constitutional, &quot;I
think you've got a problem in the government's case.&quot; He
accused the administration of using the policy to make an &quot;end
run&quot; around the Congress.[14]

<p>

All three judges roundly criticized the policy scheme, in particular
the attempted distinction between &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;propensity.&quot;[15]

<p>

Allan Moore, Lt. Thomasson's attorney, told the court that the
policy and law violate the constitution's guarantees of free speech
and equal protection. Moore labeled the policy &quot;an Orwellian
concept.&quot; He rejects the notion that the statement, &quot;I
am gay,&quot; presumes misconduct. He argued that the statement
is nothing more than an admission of identity or status.[16]

<p>

Judge Luttig posed a hypothetical case to Mr. Kneedler. What if
I claim to be a communist? Can I rebut the government's presumption
that I will engage in communist activities? The judge then skipped
to the homosexual case. &quot;Okay to think, 'I'm gay,' but can't
say so. But if I say it, I must persuade the decision-maker that
I won't do gay things.&quot; The relationship between &quot;status&quot;
and &quot;propensity&quot; consumed most of the oral argument.[17]

<p>

After the hearing, the three judges signed an order saying they
wanted the full court to rehear the case. At this point, FRC filed
a motion to make oral arguments and, in an unusual move, the court
granted that motion.[18]

<p>

On December 5, the 13 judges of the U.S. Appeals Court for the
Fourth Circuit reheard the case in Richmond, Va. Once again, Judge
Luttig took a conservative stance. He said, &quot;It seems to
me...the Navy is concerned with conduct and not speech.&quot;
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer joined in, &quot;I'm just wondering why
this is a speech case at all.&quot;[19]

<p>

Judge Harvie Wilkinson III said, &quot;Don't we have here a case
where statements are used for evidentiary value, and the First
Amendment never prohibits statements for whatever evidentiary
value they may have?&quot;[20]

<p>

Professor William Woodruff, the Army's former chief of litigation
and now a law professor at Campbell University in North Carolina,
argued for FRC. He explained that the Clinton regulations are
inconsistent with the law. He also pointed out that the old policy
was codified in the new law and declared that the intent of the
law was a classwide bar, that is, homosexuals cannot legally serve.
He called for a faithful execution of the law.

<p>

A decision favorable to conservatives is expected by late spring.
That decision will be in competition with <i>Abel</i> for an appeal to
the Supreme Court this summer.

<p>

<center><h3>RELATED ISSUES</h3></center>

<p>

Other homosexual cases are winding their way through the federal
court system. However, either <I>Thomasson</I> or <I>Abel</I>
will most likely be heard by the high court. That decision will
become a landmark for future homosexual litigation such as the
rising tide of homosexual marriage and adoption cases.

<p>

Meanwhile, in August, 1995, Defense Department general counsel
Judith Miller wrote a memo to the military services which spells
out what to do with those service members who say they are homosexual
and what they must do to remain on active duty.[21] This memo followed
the publicized case of Navy Lieutenant Commander Maria Z. Dunning,
who successfully rebutted the presumption by promising not to
engage in homosexual misconduct.[22]

<p>

The memo gave confused commanders better guidance on proceeding
through the homosexual policy thicket. In spite of the latest
clarification, the number of homosexual discharges are up. From
October 1994 to September 1995, the military services discharged
722 members for homosexuality, a 21 percent increase from the
1994 figure of 597 discharges.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

No matter which case or combination of cases reaches the Supreme
Court, FRC will file a friend-of-the-court brief and a motion
to make oral argument before the justices. Given past history,
it's reasonable to expect the Clinton Justice Department to under-argue
the case that goes to the high court and, hopefully, FRC's clear
voice defending the law will be heard.

<p>

Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and
murder dropped 12 percent. This was the largest drop in the murder
rate in years and six times larger than the drop the year prior.[1]

<p>

Some experts attribute the decline to a combination of the aging
of baby boomers, police anti-drug gang efforts and the stabilization
of drug-related turf battles. Alfred Blumstein, a professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, observes, &quot;In large
cities, the [drug] markets are most mature. Drug markets started
later in smaller cities, later still in rural areas.&quot;[2] Drug-related
violence may now be shifting to suburbia.

<p>

Thus, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics
&quot;will give us a false sense of security.&quot;[3] He's not alone.

<p>

Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, &quot;We...have absolutely
no idea why we are experiencing such a precipitous drop [in the
murder rate].&quot;[4] There were 26 percent fewer murders in the
first half of 1995 than the same period the prior year. New York
City's crime rate registered its steepest drop in 23 years.[5]

<p>

Amidst the good news, FBI Director Louis Freeh notes that violent
crime involving young people, both as perpetrators and victims,
is on the rise. &quot;The number of juveniles arrested for weapons
offenses has more than doubled over the past decade,&quot; Freeh
said.[6]

<p>

On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder.[7] A profile of Justice Department
murder arrest rates by age provides a sobering story. In 1965,
23-year-olds were arrested more often for murder than any other
age group, and their rate was 33 per 100,000 23-year-olds. In
1992, 18-year-olds were arrested more often for murder and their
rate was 97 per 100,000 18-year-olds. That's a 467 percent increase
in murder arrests for 18-year-olds.[8] The trend is toward younger
offenders and higher arrest rates.

<p>

In addition, many experts believe that within the next decade
America will experience an unprecedented surge in youth crime.[9]
According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children
killing will only worsen because demographics show the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.[10]

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UPSURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG MURDERERS?</h3></center>

<p>

Social scientists cannot show cause-and-effect relationships for
murder. But they can demonstrate that certain conditions highly
correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.

<p>

<li><b>Parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.</b>

<p>

As out-of-wedlock birth has risen, so has the crime rate. Forty-three
percent of all inmates grew up in a single-parent household. Nearly
a third had parents who abused either alcohol or drugs, and more
than a third had at least one family member who was ever incarcerated.[11]

<p>

Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, &quot;A one-percentage-point
increase in births to single mothers appears to increase the violent
crime rate about 1.7 percent.&quot;[12] And a 1990 study by June O'Neill,
a professor with Baruch College of the City University of New
York, shows that men from single-parent families are twice as
likely to commit crimes compared to men from two-parent families.[13]

<p>

Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago,
notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization within a community. &quot;There are higher crime
rates in places where communities are not characterized by strong
families,&quot; Sampson said. &quot;The research has been fairly
consistent showing a small-to-moderate positive relationship between
individual delinquency and family breakdown.&quot;[14]

<p>

Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs. About 31 million children
under age 15 live with 19 million mothers employed outside the
home. Mothers who work full-time outside the home are four times
more likely to have unsupervised (latchkey) children than moms
who work part-time.[15] This is important, according to a Justice
Department study. It concluded that parental supervision, attachment
to family, and consistency of discipline were the most important
barriers to delinquency and drug abuse.[16]

<p>

Likewise, a study in <I>Child Development</I> found that the fundamental
causes of delinquency are consistent across time and rooted in
generic family processes such as supervision, attachment, and
discipline. This study also found that teenagers whose mothers
who are employed outside the home are more likely to become delinquent
than teenagers whose mothers who are not employed outside the
home. Most adolescents in the low-supervision category (83 percent)
were delinquent compared to 10 percent of those in the high-supervision
category.[17]

<p>

Another study in the <I>Journal of Social Work</I> entitled, &quot;Parenting
in Poverty,&quot; found that for children growing up in very disadvantaged
and violent neighborhoods, the one factor that seems to protect
the child from growing up to be violent is having a parent who
supervises the child very strictly.[18]

<p>

The National Institute of Justice found that being neglected as
a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile, as an
adult, and for violent crime.[19] This was especially true for juvenile
girls. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
20 percent of male and female runaways marked parental neglect
as a primary factor for their leaving home.[20]

<p>

Metropolitan Life's 1993 national survey found that teachers (71
percent) and law enforcement officials (90 percent) agree that
the lack of parental supervision at home is a major contributing
factor to violence in schools.[21]

<p>

<li><b>Drug use is highly correlated with delinquent behavior,
and use among adolescents is on the rise.</b>

<p>

A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that the rate of marijuana use among eighth-graders rose from
6 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994. A similar trend is evident
among 10th- and 12th-graders. Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack,
heroin, and LSD is also rising.[22]

<p>

Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former
NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>,
&quot;There is...an undeniable relationship between crime and
drugs. Drug addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders
and spur them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
He argues that in spite of the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts
cannot conclude that drugs cause crime. In fact, drugs &quot;do
not ingest themselves.... Drugs reach their human hosts only after
being invited.&quot;[23]

<p>

A Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.[24] The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency. By
age 16, half of the youth surveyed were using alcohol regularly
and one-quarter were using marijuana.[25]

<p>

The study also found that delinquency starts early. Ten percent
of the 7-year-old boys surveyed reported having committed at least
one street offense. By age 9, the figure was 20 percent and by
17 years of age, 40 percent of the boys had committed at least
one crime.[26]

<p>

<li><b>Most Americans blame the pop culture for increases in youth
violence.</b>

<p>

According to the Family Research Council's 1995 nationwide poll
(conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Maryland-based pollster),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime at least a little.

<p>

Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees. He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;[27]

<p>

Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed McAffee's view, saying, &quot;Those
who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep
into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves
and ignoring reality.&quot;[28] He called for a boycott of Columbia's
film <I>Money Train</I> following a copycat incident where two
men sprayed flammable liquid through the slot of a Brooklyn subway
token booth, holding a match in the window and seriously burning
the agent inside. The man died several days later.

<p>

But many of Hollywood's elite deny the relationship. Only 30 percent
of media's elite told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> that
violence in the media contributes to the level of violence in
America.[29] For example, Richard Jewell, a professor in the School
of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California,
says that Dole's attack is unfair. &quot;The biggest difficulty
with politicians like Dole is that they oversimplify things to
such an extent that we lose sight of the real issues: drugs, families
coming apart, all sort of things that go far beyond media presentation,
Jewell said.&quot;[30]

<p>

But Joel Federman, research director for Mediascope, a Studio
City, Calif.-based public policy group isn't so defensive. He
acknowledges that television violence plays a small but significant
role in promoting more aggressive behavior.[31]

<p>

Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child psychologist, says
that the average child watches 100,000 acts of television violence
and witnesses 8,000 television murders before the end of elementary
school.[32] This much violence has an effect.[33]

<p>

According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, the
S.I. Newhouse Professor of Public Communication at Syracuse University,
says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can
be linked to television.[34]

<p>

Psychologist Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research has tracked the television viewing habits
of 650 New York children from 1960 to the present. Those who watched
the most violent programming grew up to be the most aggressive
and crime prone-adults.[35]

<p>

In 1995, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy reviewed numerous
television violence studies. The studies consistently found that
children who view media depictions of aggression became more violent
in their own behavior.[36]

<p>

The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness. Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot;[37]

<p>

Murder, which is defined by the FBI as &quot;the willful killing
of one human being by another,&quot; is an aspect of many television
films.[38] Consider these 1995 TV movie titles:

<p>

<I>Death in Small Doses</I> (ABC), <I>Deadline for Murder: From
the Files of Edna Buchanan</I> (CBS), <I>Fatal Vows</I> (CBS),
<I>A Killer Among Friends</I> (CBS), <I>Love Kills: Sweet Justice</I>
(NBC), <I>A Menu for Murder</I> (NBC), <I>The Moment of Truth:
Murder or Memory?</I> (NBC), <I>Marked for Death</I> (CBS), <I>Death
Becomes Her</I> (NBC), <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> (CBS),
and <I>Falling for You</I> (CBS).

<p>

While television impacts juvenile violence and murder, no one
knows precisely how much. But there are those willing to speculate.
For example, epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I>
that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders per
year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.[39]

<p>

The music industry shares some of the responsibility. Dr. Joseph
Stuessey, professor of music history at the University of Texas,
told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music affects behavior.
This simple fact has been known intuitively for centuries....In
the 20th century, especially in the last four decades, tons of
research has been done on the interrelationship of music and human
behavior....It affects our moods, our attitudes, our emotions,
and our behavior. It affects us psychologically and 
physiologically.&quot;[40]

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[41]

<p>

Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[42]

<p>

Pop culture's music is laden with violence. It has themes about
murder, maiming, raping, abusing, and destroying. Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence. Some examples of violence-promoting lyrics:

<p><ul>

<li>The Dead Kennedys sing &quot;I Kill Children.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;I kill children, I love to see them die. I kill
children to make their mothers cry.&quot;

<p>

<li>Rigor Mortis sings &quot;Bodily Dismemberment.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;My fetish is a crime....With five easy slices you're
in six lovely pieces. Bodily dismemberment as passion increases.&quot;

<p>

<li>Blood Feast has a song &quot;Kill for Pleasure&quot; and Motley
Crue has a song &quot;Bastard&quot; about killing someone with
a knife.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>COMING CRIME WAVE</h3></center>

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking stories of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens aged 15 to 19 will increase
by 23 percent and a larger proportion of these teens will be coming
from homes without fathers. Given the correlation between father
absence and crime, some experts estimate that violent crime like
murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year -- that's up
60 percent from the current toll.[43]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles and co-editor of the book <I>Crime</I>,
said, &quot;So we should expect, unless something changes dramatically,
that the [now lower] crime rate will go back up.&quot;[44]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Americans perceive that crime is getting worse. This may seem
out of line with recent crime statistics, but the changing face
of crime has made citizens feel less safe. Young thugs are now
the threat, and the danger is likely to increase. Defusing the
coming youth time bomb should be a major priority for all levels
of government.

<title>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO WAKE UP AMERICA</title>

<h2>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO<br>
WAKE UP AMERICA</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

A courageous soldier has become a pawn in a complex national debate
involving the constitutional separation of powers, foreign policy,
and military law. In the end, America must exercise great caution
when deciding these weighty issues.

<p>

Specialist Michael G. New, a former homeschooler and son of Christian
missionaries, refused to wear a blue beret and a United Nations
(U.N.) patch on his U.S. Army uniform because, he believes, it
violates Army uniform regulations and his enlistment oath which
was to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United
States,&quot; not the U.N.

<p>

Specialist New's unit, based in Germany, was alerted last summer
for a peacekeeping mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM). His commander ordered a pre-deployment inspection
which included the requirement for all soldiers to appear in formation
wearing their U.S. uniform augmented with a U.N. shoulder patch
and a blue beret. New contends this was an illegal order.

<p>

In August, New told his sergeant that he would disobey an order
to wear the U.N. accouterments on his uniform. After consulting
with his military legal counsel, a chaplain, he flew home from
Germany to discuss his alternatives with his father, his civilian
attorney and congressional representatives. As a result of these
discussions, he decided to disobey the order.

<p>

Specialist New knows that soldiers are expected to obey lawful
orders, and an order to report to duty in a prescribed uniform
is generally a lawful order. However, the government and New disagree
about the Army's authority to prescribe a uniform that includes
the U.N. accouterments.

<p>

In October, after failing to appear in the prescribed uniform,
New was charged with failure to obey an order and offered non-judicial
punishment. Because of his deep conviction on this issue, New
refused non-judicial punishment and asked for a court-martial,
even though this subjected him to potentially much severer punishment
if convicted.

<p>

Specialist New has chosen to fall on his sword to propel onto
the national scene the debate over America's involvement in U.N.-sponsored
peacekeeping missions. This debate ought to be waged by politicians
rather than depending on the martyrdom of an individual soldier.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.S. MISSION IN MACEDONIA</h3></center>

<p>

Some question the legality of the Macedonian mission. Their concern
centers around the interpretation of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. Senate consented to ratify on July 28, 1945 and which was
signed by President Harry Truman on October 31, 1945.

<p>

U.S. Army forces have participated in the ongoing United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in FYROM as &quot;Task
Force Able Sentry&quot; since July 1993. President Clinton argues
that the Macedonian mission is authorized by Section 2, Clause
1, Article II of the U.S. Constitution which establishes the President
of the United States as the Commander in Chief of the Army and
Navy. In fact, he vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, in
part, because of his belief that Congress was trying to infringe
upon his authority as Commander in Chief to &quot;assign U.S.
Armed Forces under United Nations operational or tactical 
control.&quot;[1]

<p>

The President has both the constitutional and statutory authority
to employ the armed forces in order to &quot;further U.S. national
interests.&quot; By statute -- Section 7 of the United Nations
Participation Act (22 US Code 287d-1) -- the President may detail
U.S. military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations under
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter to serve as observers, guards,
or in any other noncombatant capacity. Further, under Section
628 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, upon appropriate presidential
determination, U.S. personnel may be assigned or detailed to international
organizations to serve with the international staff of such organizations
or to provide technical, scientific, or professional services
to them.

<p>

The Clinton administration argues that the UNPREDEP was established
as a peacekeeping operation under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement
of Disputes) of the U.N. Charter, which would mean that the presence
of U.S. troops serving in FYROM is authorized by law. Specialist
New and numerous members of Congress disagree with the administration's
analysis. They contend that this is a Chapter VII (Action with
Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression) mission and is illegal because it was not approved
by Congress.

<p>

On October 6, 1995, 44 members of Congress signed a letter citing
New's case to President Clinton, seeking answers to questions
about America's involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations. They
asked whether U.S. intervention is in the &quot;national interest,&quot;
if constitutional procedures were respected in the decision to
deploy American troops, and if Americans will be under the command
of foreign officers.[2]

<p>

This politically charged debate illustrates a classic separation
of powers dispute and must be resolved before more Americans are
assigned to U.N. missions.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.N. IS BECOMING MILITARIZED</h3></center>

<p>

The U.N. has experienced a renaissance with the precipitous fall
of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early 1980s
to worldwide peacemaker in 1995. This transition has been marked
both by a change in operational philosophy and the expansion of
a blue-helmeted legion of peace-enforcers.

<p>

There is little doubt that the U.N. would not exist today if it
were not for U.S. membership and support. The American taxpayer
has paid a disproportionate part of the U.N. budget. The recent
surge in U.N. military operations should concern American policymakers.

<p>

The U.N. operational philosophy and military role have radically
changed. In the U.N.'s first five years, it launched only two
peacekeeping missions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
U.N. has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000 blue-helmeted
soldiers. Last year these operations cost $3.6 billion. Of this,
the U.S. was directly assessed $1.2 billion by the U.N., and the
Clinton administration spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military
participation in U.N. missions. Today, thousands of American soldiers
wear U.N. blue helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon
to the former Yugoslav republics.

<p>

The U.N. has dramatically expanded its use of military forces
in peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350 with a modern
situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked electronically
to all U.N. hot spots. It has a standby system to tap troops and
equipment from 185 member nations, and it has established a storage
base in Italy to stockpile equipment such as armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.[3]

<p>

The United States Senate has the constitutional authority and
obligation to determine whether continued American membership
in the U.N. serves a useful purpose. A significant question is
whether the militarization of the U.N. is in this country's best
interests.

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LIKES THE U.N.</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, the Clinton administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive 25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
U.N. Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in U.N. operations.&quot;

<p>

Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry
has said that President Clinton supports America's continued U.N.
involvement[4] and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the U.N. system.&quot;[5]

<p>

The Clinton administration has supported the U.N.'s radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share this optimism. Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said, &quot;It is high time we rein
in U.N. peacekeeping, which is out of control.&quot; Senator Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) has called the U.N. &quot;the nemesis of millions
of Americans.&quot;[6]

<p>

These are early warning signs that must not be ignored. History
teaches that the acquisition of military power traditionally has
been the first step toward establishing governance over a territory.
Coupling the U.N.'s changing military strength with the new operational
philosophy favoring individual over state sovereignty sends a
warning shot across the bow of free people around the world.

<p>

<center><h3>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT RISK</h3></center>

<p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the U.N. dealing with traditional
interstate aggression rather than the types of internal conflict
that now dominate. But the 50-year-old organization is transitioning
to the &quot;new world order.&quot; That change is echoed by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has issued <I>An
Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly expanded U.N. peacemaking
role. He endorses the principle of &quot;universal sovereignty&quot;:
&quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and the rights of
peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty that resides in
all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate involvement
in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction U.N. efforts in
Somalia, saying, &quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.&quot; Thus, he justified
the world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation. The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<p>

Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
U.N. It was a case of aggression in which the armies of one state
crossed international borders to invade another. Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to reject the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. The subsequent 1991 U.N.-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force in the strictly internal affairs of a member
state. Thus began a potentially dangerous new era for U.N. 
&quot;peacemaking.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Loose constructionists of the U.N. Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding U.N. jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest. Is this what we want to do? Someone
had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;[7]

<p>

But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries. He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
Apparently, then, outside forces do have a right to trump national
sovereignty. Does this, then, mean or imply that true sovereignty
resides with the U.N., individual nationhood be damned?

<p>

The U.N.'s implied &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign
affairs of a country leaves all member countries vulnerable including
the U.S. For example, the next time Korean-Americans bear the
brunt of a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could
ask the U.N. to intervene to protect its citizens' rights. It
couldn't happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally
and militarily. But it could happen in the future, especially
if the U.N. has a standing military governed by a liberal world
elite.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The national debate fostered by Specialist New's case is important.
It comes at a time when American troops are involved in peacekeeping
missions around the world. It has taken the courageous act of
one soldier to highlight an issue that deserves serious debate
and resolution.

<title>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE<br>
MILITARY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

One of Bill Clinton's first acts as president was to try to pry
open the military to service by homosexuals. That effort met with
great opposition and led to a Democratic Congress codifying the
military's long-standing ban on homosexual service. But the Clinton
administration did an end run around that law and wrote implementing
regulations that are inconsistent with the law and that have caused
considerable confusion.

<p>

The second anniversary of the implementation of these regulations
was used to expose that confusion. On February 27, 1996, the Washington-based
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy organization
for homosexuals in the military, claimed to have documented 363
cases in the last year in which military officials violated the
Clinton administration's homosexual regulations by directly asking
members about their sexual orientation or harassing members suspected
of being homosexual. As evidence, it cited rising discharges for
homosexuality.[1]

<p>

The Pentagon discharged 722 homosexual service members in fiscal
1995, compared with 597 in 1994. The Pentagon attributes the 17
percent increase to a different reporting method by the Air Force.
There were 949 discharges for homosexuality in 1991, 708 in 1992
and 682 in 1993.[2]

<p>

Prior to 1994 the Air Force, when it found homosexual activity
during basic training, discharged that person for &quot;fraudulent
enlistment&quot; rather than for homosexuality. This procedure
changed in 1994, and that's why there is an increase in the number
of homosexual discharges in 1995. Discounting 163 Air Force discharges
that fit this category, the Pentagon's 1995 figure would be 559,
the lowest in many years.[3]

<p>

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has accused military
officials of overstepping their bounds to conduct &quot;witch
hunts&quot; to find evidence to discharge service members for
homosexuality. It cited the case of an Army woman who charged
that several drunken male soldiers had attempted to rape her.
She reported the incident, but her commander dismissed it. She
alleges the men then started rumors that she was a
lesbian and that this led to an investigation. The Army says it
dropped the case against the woman and is investigating whether
the commander went too far.[4]

<p>

Military investigators and commanders are also accused of pursuing
wide-ranging inquiries aimed at identifying homosexual members.
But the Pentagon dismisses the allegations of abuse. It claims
to have &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; them to ensure fair
application of the policy.

<p>

The confusion about homosexual service is prompted by the stark
differences between Clinton's regulations and the law which is
a codified version of the military's long-standing ban. The Clinton
administration's regulations are contrary to the law passed by
Congress and signed by the President on November 30, 1993. Consider
the major differences:

<p><ul>

<li>The Clinton regulations [DOD Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30]
drop the principled statement that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible
with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law [10 U.S.C. &#167; 654] forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals.

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a &quot;propensity&quot;
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
&quot;propensity&quot; to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.

<p>

<li>The Clinton regulations prevent military criminal investigators
from investigating adult private consensual sexual misconduct
(sodomy and adultery). The law relies on commander discretion
to initiate investigations.

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons,
but, contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. And information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without high-level
political permission.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>STATUS OF FEDERAL COURT CASES</h3></center>

<p>

Confusion on the issue of homosexuals in the military is amplified
by the many pending federal court cases. There are five military
homosexual cases now pending at the federal appellate court level
and three cases at the district court level.[5] Most of these cases
involve servicemembers complaining that their constitutional rights
have been violated by Clinton's regulations and sidestep a frontal
attack on the law which clearly denies service by homosexuals.

<p><ul>

<li><I>Abel v. Perry</I> was heard on January 16, 1996 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This case
involves six servicemembers who won at the district court level,
claiming that the Pentagon violated their First and Fifth Amendment
rights. This case contests Clinton's regulations and avoids the
plain meaning of the law. A decision is expected this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> was heard on December 5, 1995 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It
involves a Naval officer who complains that his discharge for
homosexuality violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The
government won at the trial court level. A decision is expected
this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Selland v. Department of Defense</I> was decided at the
district court level for the government on October 31, 1995. The
case was brought by a Naval officer dismissed for declaring himself
a homosexual. The plaintiff has indicated he will appeal, but
that appeal will be delayed until a decision is announced in the
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> case.

<p>

<li><I>Phillips v. Perry </I>will be heard on March 4, 1996 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This
case involves a sailor who claims his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy was swayed by his admission
of misconduct. He also claims there are sexual acts that are guaranteed
protection within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
He lost his complaint at the trial court level. A decision is
expected this summer.

<p>

<li><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I> will be heard this spring in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This Air
Force officer was discharged for homosexuality and lost at the
trial court level.

<p>

<li>Three cases are pending at the federal district court level.
They are: <I>Thorne v. Department of Defense</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; brought by a Naval
officer); <I>Holmes v. California National Guard</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California; brought by a National
Guardsman); and <I>Watson v. Perry</I> (U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Washington; brought by a Naval officer).

</ul><p>

The Family Research Council has participated as an amicus (friend
of the court) in the five appellate cases. It was granted the
unusual opportunity to make oral argument in <I>Thomasson v. Perry,</I>
where FRC defended the law and the Clinton Justice Department
defended the faulty regulations. It will closely monitor the progress
of the three district court cases.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

A Justice Department attorney announced during the <I>Abel v.
Perry</I> hearing that seven avowed homosexuals have rebutted
the presumption that they will engage in illicit conduct. They
now serve uncontested. This is a flagrant violation of the law
but has been allowed because of the faulty Clinton regulations.
Unless these regulations are changed, more avowed homosexuals
will serve, despite clear congressional intent to the contrary.

<p>

The intent of the law has always been to deny service to homosexuals.
It is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress under Article
1, Section 8 to write the rules and regulations for the military.
After exhaustive hearings in 1993, the Congress by a large majority
codified the military's long-standing ban on homosexual service.
The law denies service to all homosexuals, both those in and those
out of the closet.

<p>

It is hoped that Congress or a future administration will right
the Clinton administration's faulty regulations. The regulations
must be rewritten to echo the intent of the law. Meanwhile, it
is expected that either the <I>Abel</I> or <I>Thomasson</I> case
will be appealed to the Supreme Court this summer. FRC will file
a motion to argue as an amicus in that case to defend the law
which is based on the will of the American people and the findings
of the 1993 Congressional hearings on the issue of homosexuals
in the military.

ABOUT THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE</h2>

<p>

<b>Q: In restricting marriage to one man and one woman, aren't
you imposing your beliefs on others?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life. Those who are trying to
radically redefine it for their own purposes are the ones who
are trying to impose their values on the rest of the population.
Ordinary people did not pick this fight. They are not the aggressors.
They are merely defending the basic morality that has sustained
the culture for everyone against a radical attack.

<p>

<b>Q: Oh, come on. Whom does it really hurt if a same-sex couple
want to get married?</b>

<p>

A: When homosexual couples seek state approval and all the benefits
that the state reserves for married couples, they impose the law
on everyone. According non-marital relationships the same status
as marriage would mean that millions of people would be disenfranchised
by their own governments. The state would be telling them that
their beliefs are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights
laws into a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Business men and women would be required to provide &quot;family&quot;
health benefits to homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Children would be taught in schools that homosexual sex is
the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would facilitiate the adoption
of children by homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Sex-based distinctions in the law would be removed (as was
proposed in the rejected Equal Rights Amendment).

</ul><p>

Law is not a suggestion, but, as George Washington observed, it
is force. Official state sanction of same-sex relationships as
&quot;marriage&quot; would bring the full apparatus of the state
against those who believe that marriage is between one man and
one woman. Traditional morality would, in effect, be outlawed.

<p>

<b>Q: But if two people -- any two people -- love each other,
why not let them marry?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage is not just a matter of feelings. It is the specifically
defined legal, social, economic and spiritual union of a man and
a woman. The two sexes must be present for it to be marriage.
If that definition is radically altered based on the &quot;feelings&quot;
of those in other relationships, then the sky is the limit. There
is no logical reason for not letting several people marry, or
for gutting other requirements, such as minimum age, blood relative
status or even the limitation of the relationship to human beings.

<p>

<b>Q: Don't morals change? Haven't we heard all these tired phrases
used in defense of not letting women vote or even in defense of
slavery?</b>

<p>

A: Various social movements have succeeded because they were in
accord with natural law and the basic precepts of the moral code.
Homosexuality has never been considered morally good, and it is
a quantum leap from ending slavery to saying that homosexuality
must now be considered good, healthy and worthy of state-protected
benefits. Homosexuals enjoy all the rights every other citizen
already has -- they can vote, own property, etc.-- but they cannot
claim special treatment beyond those rights. Anytime they achieve
that, they threaten the civil rights of those who disagree with
them.

<p>

<b>Q: For years, in some Southern states, blacks and whites were
prevented from marrying by anti-miscegenation laws. Eventually,
the courts overturned these laws. Aren't same-sex couples being
similarly discriminated against? Isn't it only a matter of time
before these repressive laws are also overturned?</b>

<p>

A: As Colin Powell has observed, skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different. The first is a benign, inborn characteristic
that has no bearing on conduct or character; the second is behaviorally-based
and has everything to do with character, morality and society's
basic rules of conduct. If the civil rights laws begin deviating
into behavior and away from race, ethnic origin, place of birth
or other immutable characteristics, there is no stopping point.
New laws would have to be coined almost daily to accommodate the
flood of claims based on behavior (smokers, compulsive gamblers,
pornography fanatics, sex addicts and pedophiles could all claim
new &quot;rights&quot; to protection against discrimination).
One non-immutable characteristic that does get protection is religion,
because that is enshrined in the Constitution. But there is no
constitutional right to engage in sodomy (see <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>)[1]
and demand that the state elevate it into protected status.

<p>

<b>Q: But studies show that homosexuals are born that way. How
then can you blame them for their condition?</b>

<p>

A: Nobody is &quot;blaming&quot; anyone for having homosexual
desires. The &quot;genetic&quot; studies that have been publicized
have been conducted by self-styled homosexual activists or have
been misrepresented in the media. The studies themselves typically
have tiny sample sizes, biased selection, and other major methodological
flaws, and are not replicated by reputable scientists.[2] By contrast,
70 years of therapeutic counseling and case studies show a remarkable
consistency concerning the origins of the homosexual impulse as
an uncompleted gender identity seeking after its own sex to replace
what was not fully developed.[3] Do homosexuals choose to be gay?
Mostly, no, but they can choose their behavior, and they can change
their orientation,[4] as researchers Masters and Johnson showed in
their landmark studies[5] and as numerous examples of successful
personal transformation testify.[6]

<p>

<b>Q: Isn't the traditional view of marriage religious in nature?
And if so, doesn't the restriction of marriage to one man and
one woman violate the religious beliefs of those who disagree?</b>

<p>

A: Although marriage does indeed arise from religious traditions,
most notably the Bible, it is an independently quantifiable good
for society. Hence, the state has an interest in preserving and
protecting the special status of marriage, regardless of religious
beliefs. A society can get along just fine without any homosexuality,
but no society can get along without marriage. That is why the
state encourages marriage. In 1885, the Supreme Court felt so
strongly that marriage was to be protected that it declared it
as a requirement for admission of new states to the Union. Any
prospective state, the court said, had to have law resting &quot;on
the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing
from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot;[7]

<p>

<b>Q: What about childless couples? Since you say that marriage
must be protected partly because of its importance in forming
families, does this mean that heterosexual couples who do not
have children shouldn't get marriage licenses?</b>

<p>

A: Of course not. Although most people marry with the intention
of someday starting families, the married couples who do not have
children still have the potential for becoming mothers and fathers,
either biologically or through adoption. Marriage is a societal
good even without children, as husbands and wives serve as role
models for children in their neighborhoods. Procreation is an
important aspect of society's high regard for marriage, but it
is not the only reason marriage is protected. Children do not
benefit when homosexuality is presented as a neutral or positive
lifestyle choice.

<p>

<b>Q: But with the threat of AIDS and other diseases among promiscuous,
homosexual men, wouldn't it be a societal good to encourage homosexual
monogamy?</b>

<p>

A: In cities where homosexual monogamy is already being encouraged,
AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases are skyrocketing.[8]
It is not &quot;homophobia&quot; that is causing this, but the
behavior itself, which is destructive emotionally, physically
and morally to individuals, families and societies. That is why
it has been discouraged in all successful cultures. Socrates and
Plato wrote that homosexuality was harmful to individuals and
society and should be discouraged. Even in &quot;steady&quot;
homosexual relationships, dangerous sex occurs, since the defining
homosexual sex act is patently unhealthy by any standard. State
sanction of homosexuality in any form is an invitation to the
young to experiment with something that may prove deadly. Any
public health benefits available by discouraging promiscuous homosexual
activity can be achieved without redefining traditional marriage,
which is per se a profoundly important public health measure.

<p>

Besides, homosexual literature acknowledges that homosexual 
&quot;monogamy&quot; is largely fictional. Most homosexual relationships 
are fleeting. Those that endure more than a few years do so because of an 
agreement to have outside partners. As <I>New Republic</I> editor Andrew
Sullivan, a homosexual, writes in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I>,
&quot;the openness of the contract&quot; of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
reflects &quot;greater understanding of the need for extramarital
outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.&quot;
In other words, the homosexual concept of &quot;monogamy&quot;
is non-monogamous. Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile
frankly admits that the goal of homosexual activists is to &quot;fight
for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted,
redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the
right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes
but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic 
institution....&quot;[9]

<p>

<b>Q: Don't most people want homosexuals to be treated fairly?</b>

<p>

A: Yes. Most people have no ill will toward homosexuals, but this
does not mean that a tiny segment of the population (less than
2 percent) should be allowed to radically redefine society's moral
code. Even in liberal Hawaii, recent polls show that more than
70 percent of residents oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot;
and national polls show that about two-thirds of respondents oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; This is not about tolerance, but
about a tiny group seeking to use the law to impose its version
of morality on everyone else.

<p>

<b>Q: Still, don't homosexuals suffer discrimination when they
can't marry?</b>

<p>

A: No. Homosexuals have precisely the same right to marry as anyone
else. Marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes. That
is the whole point. To enter marriage, you must meet its qualifications.
Any attempt to get around the rules that everyone else plays by
is an attempt to have special rights, not equal rights. Eliminating
an entire sex from the picture and then calling it &quot;marriage&quot;
is not a mere expansion of an institution, but rather the destruction
of a principle.

<p>

<b>Q: What about domestic partnerships? If you won't go along
with same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; why not at least allow committed
same-sex couples to get some benefits?</b>

<p>

A: The state should never be in the business of encouraging unhealthy
behavior by granting special benefits for it. A homosexual life
does not offer the richness of the complementary relationship
that men and women find in marriage and family life. People should
not be written off as if they can do no better than be mired in
an unhealthy, unnatural behavior. The more that homosexuality
is encouraged, the more damage will be wreaked among individuals,
families and society. This is not compassion but its opposite:
a ruthless social Darwinism that devalues people as impulse-driven
incorrigibles. Each human soul is of inestimable worth, and homosexuals
are no different from anyone else. They deserve the truth, not
an officially sanctioned lie.

<li><I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> 478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986).  In rejecting
the claim, the Court said, &quot;Nor are we inclined to take a
more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental
rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause.  The Court is most
vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with
judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots
in the language or design of the Constitution....There should
be, therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive reach
of those Clauses, particularly if it requires redefining the category
of rights deemed to be fundamental.&quot;

<title>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A COMEBACK</title>

<h2>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A<br>
COMEBACK</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A 1960s-era designer drug is making a dramatic comeback and may
do to the 1990s what cocaine did to the 1980s. The use of methamphetamine,
known on the street as speed, ice, crank, crystal meth or the
&quot;poor man's coke,&quot; is rising dramatically.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is a synthetic central-nervous system stimulant of the amphetamine
family. It was discovered by a Japanese chemist in 1919, and was
used extensively by all sides during World War II to fight fatigue
and enhance performance.

<p>

In small doses, meth has been used by combat pilots to keep alert,
and by astronauts to be ready for critical decisions at the end
of long missions. A <I>USA Today</I> story last fall claimed President
John F. Kennedy used small quantities, and that German dictator
Adolph Hitler was known to be a meth abuser.[1]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW DOES METH AFFECT THE USER?</h3></center>

<p>

Larry Lewman, Oregon State Examiner, said, &quot;It's not as lethal
[as crack], but it's cheaper. And it causes a toxic psychosis
and (users) can be absolutely irrational for days.&quot;[2]

<p>

Meth can have a bizarre effect on some. While high on meth, Eric
Smith thought his 14-year-old son was demon-possessed. He murdered
his son, cut off the boy's head, and tossed it out of the window
of his van.[3]

<p>

Such irrational and often violent behavior is common among meth
abusers. According to Dr. Alex Stalcup, former medical director
of the Haight-Asbury free clinic, &quot;I have [meth] patients
come in with as much as 19 to 20 days of no sleep. They are very
dangerous, paranoid, talking weapons. Some hold themselves in
a house, take hostages and begin shooting out the windows.&quot;[4]

<p>

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA school of medicine,
said of meth users, &quot;They're wired to be alert, on guard
and primed for action.&quot;[5]

<p>

The downside of meth's euphoria is an amphetamine psychosis. It
can last for months. The person becomes agitated, on edge and
paranoid. A meth crash can be deadly for children, spouses and
friends of the user.

<p>

The signs of meth abuse are: weight loss, irritability, excitability,
paranoia, wandering attention, sleeplessness for days and then
sleeping for 24 to 36 hours straight.[6]

<p>

<center><h3>WHERE DOES METH COME FROM?</h3></center>

<p>

In the late 1980s, traffickers and clandestine laboratory operators
discovered that ma huang, an extract from the ephedra plant, the
world's oldest known cultivated plant, could be used to produce
methamphetamine. This discovery prompted the U.S. government to
impose controls on ephedrine.

<p>

The ephedra plant is grown in China, India, the Czech Republic
and, at one time, was sown as a ground cover in the western U.S.
by the Bureau of Plant Industry. Frontier Americans called ephedrine
&quot;Mormon tea&quot; because it was drunk by Mormons in lieu
of regular coffee and tea, which are off-limits. It was also called
&quot;whorehouse tea&quot; because settlers believed it cured
venereal disease.[7]

<p>

Although ephedrine is not sold in large quantities for fear it
will be used to produce meth, it is legally available as a treatment
for asthma. Pseudoephedrine is readily available as a nasal decongestant.
Ephedrine tablets are also sold as an herbal supplement under
such names as &quot;Trim Easy,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and 
&quot;Bliss&quot; at rock concerts or hip clothing boutiques and 
&quot;Ephedra&quot; in health food stores.[8] It can be found in some new 
herbal sodas. Bodybuilders also use it for short-term energy boosts.

<p>

In 1988, Congress passed the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act, which imposed controls on bulk ephedrine powder. Thereafter,
meth producers sought international sources and began to switch
to pseudoephedrine as their source chemical.

<p>

Meth can be &quot;cooked&quot; by amateurs with a few simple chemicals
in makeshift labs. Some of these labs can produce up to 100 pounds
at a time. In February 1995, Mexican authorities seized a lab
that could produce 2,640 pounds of meth a month.[9]

<p>

Even a makeshift lab can take $4,000 in raw ingredients and produce
eight pounds of meth worth more than $50,000 on the street.[10] Besides
the danger of arrest for producing illegal substances, lab mistakes
can be catastrophic.

<p>

On Christmas Day, 1995, a mobile home near Aguanga, California
burst into flames. Three children died and an out-of-control meth
kitchen was blamed.[11]

<p>

Authorities busted 419 clandestine labs in California in 1994,
and the deadly environmental residue from these labs cost that
state more than $1 million in clean-up.[12] Although the number of
meth lab seizures rose to 683 in 1989, they dramatically declined
with new laws restricting ephedrine's availability.[13] Today, the
number of labs is rising once again as alternative ephedrine sources
have been found.

<p>

<center><h3>WHO USES METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is tailor-made for the fast-paced 1990s. It helps suppress
the appetite, gives self-confidence, provides an extended feeling
of euphoria, and provides &quot;Energizer&quot; levels of get-up-and-go.

<p>

Kathy Paddock, a services coordinator for Terros, an Arizona-based
drug and mental health rehabilitation center, said, &quot;We're
seeing young people in their teens, young adults, everyone. It's
the drug of the '90s. People are needing to go fast -- alter their
moods. The meths are replacing crack.&quot;[14]

<p>

One study found that 75 percent of meth users were employed white
men between the ages 25 and 35.[15] Robert Booth, a psychiatry professor
at Colorado University's medical school, says meth attracts middle-class
housewives with too much to do.[16] <I>The U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
describes meth users as white, 18-to-34-year-old working class
people, &quot;some of them gay and many of them women.&quot;[17]

<p>

Ed Mayer, head of the narcotics enforcement team in Jackson County,
Oregon, says meth is &quot;cheaper [than cocaine] and it gives
people a longer high.&quot;[18] That's why it is growing in popularity,
especially among adolescent girls who want to lose weight and
boys who use it as a sexual stimulant.[19]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NEW METH EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

Just how bad is the meth &quot;epidemic&quot; and what are the
consequences? Consider:

<p><ul>

<li>The Department of Justice reports that meth abuse has risen
between 500 and 800 percent among young adults over the past five
years.[20]

<p>

<li>The nation's medical examiners report a 144 percent rise in
meth-related deaths from 1992 to 1994.[21] There were 1,816 meth-related
deaths reported from 1991 to 1994.[22] Eighty percent of these were
reported in just <i>four</i> big western cities.[23]

<p>

<li>Meth-related hospital emergency room admissions have risen
366 percent over the last 10 years in California.[24] In some local
areas they have risen 1,742 percent.[25] The problem is so bad that
in one California hospital meth babies now outnumber crack babies
by as much as seven to one.[26]

<p>

<li>In Phoenix, meth-related crimes have jumped 400 percent in
the last three years.[27] Officials believe meth is largely responsible
for a 40 percent jump in Phoenix's 1994 homicide rate. Phoenix's
law enforcement authorities also report spending 60 percent of
their time working on cases involving meth.[28]

<p>

<li>In Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, police say that
meth was involved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.[29] San Diego
County reports that meth detections among arrestees rose from
23 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1994.[30]

<p>

<li>Authorities in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area report
nearly 3,000 admissions to treatment programs for meth. This is
up from only 600 in 1988.[31]

<p>

<li>Meth is making inroads elsewhere. Of 100 women recently booked
into the Minneapolis jail, 75 had meth traces in their urine.[32]
In Tacoma, Washington, police report that meth-related homicides
are on the rise.[33]

</ul><p>

Recognizing the critical nature of the coming tidal wave of meth
abuse, on March 12, 1996, Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced
legislation aimed at curbing the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has bipartisan
support, tightens federal regulation and reporting requirements
for the chemicals used to produce meth, and increases criminal
penalties for possession of the relevant chemicals or equipment
with the intent to manufacture the drug.

<p>

Public officials are nearly unanimous in condemning meth and warning
Americans about its likely impact. Attorney General Janet Reno
warned, &quot;There should be no question...in anybody's mind
that methamphetamine poses a real and serious threat to the citizens
of our nation.&quot;[34]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration head Thomas A. Constantine told
a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee: &quot;I am concerned that
this coming epidemic could not happen at a worse time. Our nation
has not yet fully recovered from our cocaine experience, and powerful
traffickers in Mexico are seeking to make their mark on history
in much the same way the Cali Mafia did.&quot;[35]

<p>

Dr. Andrew Mecca with the California Alcohol and Drug Programs
participated in a meth study which found &quot;that we have got
a dramatic rise or epidemic level of occurrence.&quot;[36]

<p>

John Coonce, the meth task force chief for the DEA, said, &quot;We're
seeing more [meth] labs in middle American. It's an epidemic that's
getting worse.&quot;[37]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TRAFFICKERS FIND METH BETTER THAN CRACK</h3></center>

<p>

Today, meth is available in large quantities. Last year about
170 tons of ephedrine was converted into 136 tons of meth, which
was sold on U.S. streets for about $3.2 billion. That's enough
meth to supply 12.4 million abusers with three 10-milligram doses
a day for 365 days a year.[38]

<p>

Meth production and distribution have become a big business. In
the 1970s, meth was largely the province of motorcycle gangs.
But in the 1980s making meth from ephedrine became an easy and
lucrative alternative to processing and selling cocaine. It became
attractive because domestic traffickers could cut out middlemen
like the Colombian cartels.

<p>

There are three categories of meth traffickers. Those who traffic
in the raw materials -- primarily ephedrine or pseudoephedrine
-- to producers, those who peddle the finished product, and those
who do both.

<p>

The raw material traffickers either operate domestically or internationally.
The domestic operators divert legal ephedrine to meth lab operators.
For example, Clifton Pharmaceuticals in western Pennsylvania imported
large quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine powder last
year. From the powder they made pills, which were then sold through
three mail order firms located in Florida and Kentucky. The DEA
routinely seized these products in clandestine meth labs in California.[39]

<p>

Ephedrine tablets were sold through mail order distributors in
100 and 1,000-count bottles through magazines like <I>Cosmopolitan,
High Times</I> and <I>Hustler</I>.[40] They were advertised as 
bronchodilators, energy boosters or diet aids. This practice has now been 
slowed by the 1990 Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act, because the
DEA can now deny registration to companies whose actions are deemed
to pose an imminent threat to public health and safety. Unfortunately,
the Food and Drug Administration has yet to reclassify pseudoephedrine
as a controlled substance.

<p>

Mexican drug organizations are the primary traffickers in raw
ephedrine. They ship large quantities of ephedrine from India,
China and the Czech Republic into Mexico and then either make
meth at local labs or smuggle it into the U.S. For example, in
1994, 3.4 tons of ephedrine traveling from Zurich to Mexico City
was seized by the customs service at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.[41]

<p>

Mexican finished-product traffickers have so saturated the Western
meth market as to depress its street value. In 1991, a pound of
meth cost $6,000, but today the price has been cut in half.[42] That
makes meth a real psychedelic bargain when compared to crack cocaine.
For example, $20 can buy a quarter gram of meth or one-tenth of
a gram of crack or one-sixteenth of a gram of heroin.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW TO HEAD OFF THE COMING EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

This country needs a three-part, balanced strategy to stop the
meth epidemic. This strategy must include strong enforcement,
prevention, and effective meth-abuse treatment with accountability.
Enforcement begins with the right laws. Congress already has laws
that tightly control the sale of ephedrine powder, but should
consider more restrictions on the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine
tablets. Feinstein's proposal closes a loophole in the Controlled
Substances Act by removing an exemption for pseudoephedrine. It
also adds needed restrictions on other chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine. Meth producers can now make cash purchases of
large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas
-- chemicals used to make meth. There are no uniform reporting
requirements or quantity limitations for these chemicals.[44]

<p>

The pending bill would restrict access to these chemicals and
impose a civil &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; law for
companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make
meth. It will also increase the maximum criminal penalty for those
who possess equipment used to manufacture meth.

<p>

The second part of an effective meth-abuse prevention strategy
is to reduce demand through more effective education about the
drug's ruinous effects, which include hallucinations, addiction,
depression, paranoia and violent rages. This effort should be
spearheaded by private, non-profit groups involved in drug education
at both the national and grass-roots levels.

<p>

Finally, the strategy must include effective treatment. Treatment
funds must be controlled at the point of delivery where local
officials best understand the problem. These programs must last
long enough to give the addicts a fighting chance to recover,
and addicts must be held strictly accountable for their progress.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The methamphetamine epidemic is poised to become much worse than
the crack epidemic. Meth is cheaper, can be domestically produced
and gives the abuser a higher high that lasts much longer than
crack cocaine. Meth's downside is that it can make the abuser
incredibly violent, thus further fueling the nation's crime epidemic.
Now is the time for parents, school teachers, citizen groups,
law enforcement, government officials, church leaders and others
to act in concert to ward off this scourge before it accelerates
into overdrive, leaving millions of devastated citizens in its
wake.

<title>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</title>

<h2>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS<br>
TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert Knight and Ken Ervin</i></center>

<p>

Under the guise of &quot;condemning hate speech,&quot; a homosexual
activist group, Parents, Friends &amp; Families of Lesbians And
Gays (PFLAG) has launched a TV and newspaper advertising campaign
designed to smear and silence opponents of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

Back when it was formed in 1981, the Washington, D.C.-based PFLAG
was a small, obscure group of parental activists. In recent years,
it has become a major player to promote homosexuality as normal
and healthy. PFLAG's mission statement focuses on three areas:

<p><ul>

<li>Support - chapter groups meet in various cities to offer support
and plan strategies;

<p>

<li>Advocacy - testifying and lobbying on both state and federal
levels in favor of homosexual-friendly legislation;

<p>

<li>Education - through the publishing of various &quot;fact&quot;
sheets, audio workshops, conferences and seminars.

</ul><p>

PFLAG's goal in educating society is to &quot;dispel myths, report
on scientific research, [and] explain religious teachings.&quot;[1]
However, the group has disseminated much inaccurate and misleading
information concerning homosexuality. For example, in its brochure
<I>Why Is My Child Gay?</I>, the reader is told that &quot;about
10 percent of the population is gay.&quot; This inflated figure
is based on the discredited works of Alfred Kinsey, author of
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>. The brochure also leads
the reader to believe that scientists have found evidence that
homosexuality is a biological predisposition, but no credible
evidence exists for this assertion.[2]

<p>

PFLAG has amassed considerable financial backing to launch its
latest campaign against opponents of the homosexual agenda. The
$1 million effort follows one of the many blueprints for propaganda
warfare set forth in the book <I>After the Ball: How America Will
Conquer Its Fear of Gays in the 90's</I>.[3]

<p>

PFLAG has chosen a tactic called &quot;Bracketing,&quot; which
is best described by <I>After the Ball</I> authors Marshall Kirk
and Hunter Madsen:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The best way to make homohatred look bad is to vilify those
who victimize gays. The public should be shown images of ranting 
homohaters whose associated traits and attitudes appall and anger 
Middle America. . . .In TV and print, images of victimizers
can be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
call 'bracket technique.' For example, for several seconds an unctuous
beady-eyed Southern preacher is shown pounding the pulpit in rage against
'those perverted, abominable creatures.' While his tirade continues over 
the soundtrack, the picture switches to heart-rending photos of badly 
beaten persons, or of gays who look decent, harmless, and likable; and 
then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher. The contrast 
speaks for itself. The viewer will ordinarily recoil from these images 
of victimizers, thinking automatically: 'I don't like those maniacs,
don't want to be like them, and would be ashamed if others thought I was 
like them. Surely I'm more compassionate and sophisticated, because I 
don't share their irrational hatred of gays.' Every time a viewer runs 
through this comparative self-appraisal, he reinforces a self-definition 
that consciously rejects homohatred and validates sympathy for gay 
victims. Exactly what we want.&quot;</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And apparently that is exactly what PFLAG wants, because they've
followed Kirk and Madsen's game plan almost to the letter.

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;One of the two 30-second [TV] spots dramatizes gay-bashing,
where a young man is chased by a group and then beaten; the other depicts 
a young woman holding a gun as she considers suicide. Visuals then cut 
to TV comments from the Rev. [Pat] Robertson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

The PFLAG campaign, Project Open Mind, is expected to run for
the next two to five years. It is currently being marketed in
Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma. New stations
are being sought in five Midwest and Pacific Northwest markets.
The PFLAG effort coincides with a major effort to press the homosexual
agenda on several fronts:

<p><ul>

<li>Homosexuals in the military - the effort to force the inclusion
of open homosexuals in all branches of the U.S. military;

<p>

<li>Homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; - the campaign to accord marital
status to same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Homosexual adoption - the drive to sanction custody and adoption
of children by same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Civil rights for homosexuals - the wide-ranging campaign to
bully the U.S. legal system into granting special rights and privileges
to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuals qualify for 
&quot;minority&quot; status.

</ul><p>

Coming under increasingly shrill attack from PFLAG and other homosexual
activist groups are orthodox Christianity and &quot;organized
religion.&quot; On this battleground, however, the homosexual
community seems fragmented over the best way to attack. One segment
of activists believes the best course of action is blatant, 
&quot;in-your-face&quot; defiance. This consists of staged, eye-catching 
media events like gay pride parades. During the June 25, 1995 New York 
City parade, activists, some in nun's habits and others in various 
stages of undress, once again marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral 
carrying signs with such slogans as &quot;Hatred is not sacred.&quot;

<p>

The belief of another faction is that this kind of activism has
damaged the homosexual cause politically and intellectually. During
the visit of Pope John Paul II to New York City, six men unfurled
a banner from a sixth-floor window in Saks Fifth Avenue facing
St. Patrick's Cathedral. The banner, which read &quot;Condoms
Save Lives,&quot; was removed and the men were arrested. Citing
this botched effort, lesbian writer Camille Paglia calls for homosexual
activists to turn from attacks on the church and concentrate more
on intellectual discourse. Yet the author, near the end of her
argument for a more intellectual approach, still can't resist
the urge to take pot-shots at religion:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Mottos I would have liked to see fly on violet satin over
St. Patrick's: Penis Power; Long Live Gay Love; Paradise Now; Sympathy 
for the Devil; Flesh and Fantasy; There Is No God; Eat of My Body; Sex 
Is Sacred; Art, Pleasure, Sex; Dionysus Lives; Bring Back Babylon; 
Pagans Unite; Disobey Authority; Free Your Mind.&quot;</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

Another group has chosen to carry out its attacks by infiltrating
church hierarchy. Episcopal Bishop John Spong appeared as keynote
speaker at a November 10, 1995 symposium hosted by PFLAG and held
at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. (currently
attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton and, until early 1995, by
Bob and Elizabeth Dole). According to an eyewitness account by
Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, Bishop
Spong's address ridiculed the Christmas story, praised homosexual
&quot;marriage,&quot; declared the Ten Commandments &quot;immoral,&quot;
and referred to the Apostle Paul as a &quot;self-hating, gay man.&quot;

<p>

Increasingly, opponents of the homosexual cause are being labeled
as &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;haters&quot; by mainstream journalists.
For example, the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Richard Cohen recently
queried, &quot;Where is the Republican who will look certain conservative
Christians in the eye and call them the bigots they are? Where
are the Christian clergymen, like those of the civil rights era,
who will condemn ignorance and bigotry, and exalt tolerance and
understanding? Who in the GOP field will assert that homophobia
is not a family value?&quot;[7]

<p>

Even while homosexuals continue their media assault, few major
political figures dare to evince any criticism of the gay agenda.
Part of this is due to a wholesale media blitz. As syndicated
columnist Cal Thomas has remarked, &quot;Evidence of this compromise
is everywhere, from the open recruitment of 'gay journalists'
to a convention of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
meeting in Washington last month. A copy of the program shows
that not only were representatives of major press organizations
in attendance as participants, they also contributed substantially
to the cost of the event.&quot;[8] These companies included ABC,
NBC, CBS, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I> and the
Associated Press, which recruited homosexuals and openly sided
with the partisan homosexual agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activists have cultivated a relationship with the press
to such a degree that its ability to report fairly and objectively
on the issues has been seriously impaired. At one PFLAG meeting
in Maryland on Nov. 21, 1993, according to an eyewitness account
by Peter LaBarbera, homosexual researcher Dean Hamer told the
audience that he was pleased with media coverage. Hamer, a geneticist
with the National Cancer Institute who is under investigation
for fraud in connection with the first of two gay gene studies
he authored, said, &quot;If you tell the press what to write about
a scientific study, they'll write it.&quot;[9] He added that he told
reporters that his study's findings show that sexual orientation
is like being &quot;left-handed,&quot; and that they obliged him:
&quot;That's what I told them to say, and they said it.&quot;[10]

<p>

Liberal politicians are increasingly looking to groups like PFLAG
for support in their efforts to restructure and realign both government
and society. &quot;PFLAG is writing the final chapter in the
nation's 200-year-old struggle for civil rights. I don't know
if you realize how important you are,&quot; says Rep. Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.).[11]

<p>

PFLAG's campaign is by no means an arbitrary attack. It's just
one small piece of a much larger battle plan. The goal is to silence
all opponents of the homosexual agenda, and harness government
and corporate power to enforce it.

A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR<br>

<p>

Lawsuits brought by prisoners cost Americans millions of dollars
and make a mockery of the justice system. One murderer sued more
than 300 times, claiming he caught a cold from eating off of paper
plates and wasn't given enough fruit juice. A serial killer on
California's death row who sexually assaulted, tortured and mutilated
five teenage girls, sued prison officials for &quot;cruel and
unusual punishment&quot; because they served him soggy sandwiches.
A Missouri rapist, robber and kidnapper sued to have prisoners
treated to salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays.[1]

<p>

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
is promoting an inmate lawsuit reform bill. In his words, &quot;It's
high time to stop this outrage against taxpayers. It must not
continue any longer.&quot;[2]

<p>

Lawmakers also want to halt inmate litigation which delays executions
and overturns state court decisions via federal habeas corpus
petitions. Reforming the federal habeas corpus review process
will help repair the sagging credibility of our criminal justice
system.

<p>

Our system is supposed to serve victims and criminals by ensuring
that offenders receive appropriate and swift punishments which
act as deterrence to future crime. Unfortunately, habeas corpus
petitions, which may be well intended, delay justice and therefore
damage law enforcement's credibility. This must change.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS HABEAS CORPUS?</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus petitions allege that the prisoner's federal constitutional
rights were violated. State and federal prisoners can challenge
the validity of their convictions and the appropriateness of their
sentences by filing these petitions in a federal court. If a federal
judge agrees, he can issue writs ordering the prisoner's freedom,
reducing his sentence or having his case remanded for retrial
or resentencing.

<p>

Habeas corpus is Latin for &quot;you have the body.&quot; It requires
the prison warden to produce a prisoner to determine whether or
not the inmate is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should
be released from custody. A state prisoner who has exhausted normal
state appeals may continue to litigate his conviction or sentence
by applying for habeas corpus in a federal district court.

<p>

A growing number of Americans view such appeals as judicial obstruction.
After all, in spite of overwhelming evidence, many are filed by
death row criminals who litigate solely to delay their execution.
For example:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1974, Mitchell Blazak was convicted and sentenced to death
on two counts of murder. Between 1977 and 1988 he filed five unsuccessful
petitions with Arizona courts. In 1988, he successfully persuaded
a federal district court to vacate his 1974 trial because it failed
to consider his mental competence at the time. Crucial evidence
was lost by the federal court during the habeas corpus evidentiary
hearing, and as a result the state could not retry him and settled
for a negotiated plea agreement. Because Blazak had his presentence
credit of more than 19 years, he was returned to prison for less
than six months and released.[3]

<p>

<li>In 1977, Clarence Allen was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison. From prison he arranged for the murder of three people
who testified against him for which he was then convicted and
sentenced to death. Six years later, the California Supreme Court
affirmed the death sentence. Over the next two years, his federal
habeas corpus petitions were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review his case. But on September 2, 1988 a sympathetic
federal district judge issued a stay of execution which remains
in effect today -- 22 years after his first murder.[4]

<p>

<li>William Bonin was convicted and sentenced to death for the
1979 murders of 14 boys he lured inside his van, sexually assaulted
and then strangled. After nearly two decades of delays, Bonin
and 31 other Orange County, California death-row inmates have
exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution.[5]

<p>

<li>In 1982, Robert Buell kidnapped, brutally raped and strangled
an 11-year-old Ohio girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. Over a period of 12 years, he filed eight separate judicial
actions involving 36 judges. He recently filed papers in federal
court seeking yet another hearing.[6]

</ul><p>

Although 77 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for murderers,
they don't want the system to act in undue haste and execute innocent
people who may have been wrongly convicted.[7] Thus, the courts and
legislative bodies have carefully crafted a system of checks and
balances which includes federal habeas corpus petitions. The system
has saved some innocent people from execution and from the effects
of judicial errors.

<p>

Lloyd Schlup was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for
helping to kill a fellow inmate in the Missouri State Penitentiary.
Schlup's jury didn't hear from the 20 prisoners who witnessed
the murder and who later testified that Schlup wasn't the killer.
Neither did they see a surveillance videotape that showed Schlup
elsewhere at the time of the murder. Finally, at the insistence
of Schlup's fifth court-appointed lawyer, the evidence was heard.
The federal judge, after seeing the evidence, said, &quot;No reasonable
juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;[8]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas corpus reform such as the &quot;Emergency
Committee to Save Habeas Corpus&quot; often cite the case of Roger
Coleman. In 1981, Coleman was convicted and sentenced to death
for murdering and raping his sister-in-law although no one could
place him at the scene of the crime, and four independent witnesses
corroborated his near-perfect alibi. He was allegedly denied an
opportunity to present new evidence 10 years after sentencing
because his lawyer missed a filing date by three days. Coleman
was executed.[9]

<p>

The pro-reform Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF) provides
the rest of the story. Coleman's case went to the Supreme Court
twice on federal habeas corpus petitions. He claimed that new
evidence proved his innocence but in fact, according to a federal
judge, the forensic evidence done at Coleman's request &quot;significantly
bolster[ed] the jury's finding of guilt.&quot;[10]

<p>

Another case used to defend habeas corpus review involves Cornelius
Singleton, a black man, who was executed in Alabama in November,
1992, for murdering a nun in a cemetery by smothering her with
rocks. His court-appointed lawyer refused to meet with his client,
failed to object when the prosecutor struck all blacks from the
jury pool, and neglected to tell the jury that Singleton was mentally
retarded. The court-appointed attorney was disbarred. The attorney's
mistakes were wrong, but do not negate the facts in the case which
compelled a jury to find Singleton guilty of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>HISTORY OF HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus originated in Great Britain, where it was a 16th
century constitutional remedy against the tyranny of the crown.
It is found in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
safety may require it.&quot; Only once has the writ been suspended.
In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did so
by proclamation.

<p>

Traditionally habeas corpus was a pre-trial remedy which guarded
against federal oppression. The right to habeas corpus under the
constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 limited federal government
power but didn't apply to those detained by the states.[12] The Act
gave federal courts authority to issue the writ only for federal
prisoners. In 1833, Congress made an exception for state prisoners
in cases where states were interfering with federal officers enforcing
the Fugitive Slave Act.[13]

<p>

In 1867, Congress created an enlarged statutory habeas corpus.
The intent was to help former slaves held in involuntary servitude
in violation of the 13th Amendment. This change permitted any
prisoner convicted in a state court to have the constitutionality
of his conviction or his sentence reviewed by federal courts.[14]

<p>

This change was not frequently used. For example, in 1941, state
prisoners filed 127 petitions in federal courts.[15] But after the
creation of a &quot;quasi-appellate federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
by judicial decisions of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; the number
of petitions increased dramatically.[16] In 1994, state prisoners
filed 11,918 such petitions.[17]

<p>

The 1953 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v. Allen</I> transformed
federal habeas corpus into a general appellate jurisdiction of
the lower federal courts over criminal judgments.[18] The Court eliminated
conventional limitations on the scope of habeas review by expanding
the federal rights of state defendants.

<p>

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has since
imposed some limitations on writs of habeas corpus. It has narrowed
the range of claims that can be raised by prisoners who have pled
guilty. It has also restricted claims that were not properly raised
before state courts and barred rehearing of 4th Amendment claims
where state proceedings provide a &quot;full and fair opportunity&quot;
to litigate such claims.[19]

<p>

In a 1989 decision, the high court said that federal courts can't
consider habeas claims based on &quot;new rules of law&quot; that
were not in effect at the time of conviction.[20] A 1991 decision
further limits death row prisoners to one federal habeas petition
unless there is good reason why any constitutional claim was not
raised in the first instance.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>PROFILE OF THOSE WHO USE HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Most of the 13,359 federal and state inmates who filed federal
habeas corpus petitions in 1994 had been convicted of serious,
violent offenses. A 1987 U.S. Attorney General study found that
40 percent were filed five years after conviction, and delays
of more than 50 years were found.[22]

<p>

Anti-reform advocates like Yale Law School scholar Libby Lewis
cite myths to defend habeas corpus review. Lewis wrote in <I>The
Baltimore Sun</I>, &quot;Federal courts have found reversible
constitutional error in 40 percent of the death-penalty cases
reviewed under habeas corpus since 1976 -- after state courts
found no such error.&quot;[23]

<p>

A comprehensive analysis of federal habeas corpus reviews in capital
cases by the pro-reform CJLF labels Lewis's 40 percent statistic
&quot;out of date.&quot; The Foundation says the overall number
is around 15 percent, and for guilty verdicts the rate is only
5 percent.[24]

<p>

The Justice Department's 1995 review of federal habeas corpus
cases provides an interesting profile. It found that four of five
habeas petitioners had been convicted after trial and had their
cases reviewed by state appellate courts. Nearly half pursued
collateral remedies in state courts, and a third had filed at
least one previous federal petition.[25]

<p>

The Justice Department found that one-quarter of petitioners allege
ineffective assistance of counsel. Others cite trial court errors,
prosecutorial misconduct and violations of the 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th and 14th Amendments.[26] Roughly one-third of the petitions address
a single issue and more than 10 percent cite four or more issues.[27]

<p>

Federal courts dispose of most habeas cases quickly. Almost all
cases (98 percent) are either dismissed or denied on the merits,
while 1 percent are granted on the merits, leaving only 1 percent
to be returned to state courts for follow-up action.[28] Almost two-thirds
are dismissed due to either plaintiff's failure to exhaust state
remedies or procedural errors. Three of every four cases are settled
in about a year, but one out of every 10 cases lasts longer than
two years.[29]

<p>

Of course, the more issues involved, the longer the case. Multiple-issue
petitions average about 925 days to resolve while single-issue
cases are resolved in 224 days. The type of issue also dictates
the length of the period for resolution. For example, petitions
which allege prosecutorial misconduct take on the average 608
days, and trial court error issues take 559 days.[30]

<p>

On December 31, 1994, the Justice Department found there were
2,890 prisoners under sentence of death. During the period from
1977 to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons entered state and federal
prisons under sentences of death, and 1,790 of them have been
removed as a result of resentencing, retrial, commutation or death
while awaiting execution.[31]

<p>

In 1989, CJLF studied 100 capital habeas corpus cases from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It found that
40 percent of the court's final judgments resulted in relief.
Anti-reform advocates use this as evidence that habeas reviews
identify systemic deficiencies in state courts. But on closer
examination of each case, the states reached a reasonable decision.
The cases that gained federal relief came because the law had
changed, the claim was never properly presented to the state courts,
or because the courts simply disagreed with state jurists.[32]

<p>

A 1994 study by the National Center for State Courts came to a
similar conclusion. It found that the success rate for capital
habeas petitioners was &quot;vastly overstated.&quot; It found
that federal courts gave relief in 15 percent of capital cases
examined.[33]

<p>

<center><h3>WHY NOT CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in 1992 that there
is no case in which &quot;a state court's incorrect legal determination
has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. . .
. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have
an independent obligation to say what the law is.&quot;[34]

<p>

Habeas provides a mechanism to protect a criminal's constitutional
rights from abusive state courts. In 1982, a police officer in
Houston, Texas was gunned down during a routine traffic stop.
Police killed one of the assailants and charged the other with
the officer's murder. A jury convicted the man and sentenced him
to death. Texas denied him a rehearing. The man, an illegal alien,
filed a habeas petition. The federal judge found that prosecutors
had threatened witnesses, failed to disclose evidence that showed
the man's innocence and used false evidence at trial. The man's
life was saved.[35]

<p>

Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and an authority on
the death penalty, defends habeas, saying, &quot;It's absolutely
critical if we're going to have a death penalty system that we
provide adequate safeguards lest we make an irreversible, catastrophic
mistake. And we know that mistakes are constantly made.&quot;[36]

<p>

Leigh Dingerson, with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, also defends habeas corpus petitions. The &quot;real&quot;
implication of the habeas reform effort, according to Dingerson,
is that &quot;we'll see cases with significant constitutional
error slide through the courts without review. . . . Most death
row inmates were very poorly represented by trial counsel. . .
. So the more we limit the appeals process, the more we risk executing
defendants simply because they had a lousy lawyer.&quot;[37]

<p>

&quot;Without a review process conducted by a federal judge sitting
for life,&quot; said Michael Knoll, head of the Death Penalty
Information Center, &quot;you are going to see a lot more errors
go through -- errors that will lead to executions.&quot;[38]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas reform explain that state judges, who
may be elected [this is true in seven of the 50 states], and who
sometimes are former prosecutors, are subject to local political
pressures which could influence their trial decisions. This is
why federal courts are run by judges who are appointed for life
and are immune to many of the same pressures.

<p>

Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur England supports
federal review of state decisions. &quot;We've had instances in
Florida where innocent people came very close to being executed,&quot;
but they were saved by federal review.[39]

<p>

Former president of the American Bar Association, John Curtin,
Jr., supports habeas review of state decisions. &quot;Miscarriages
of justice cannot be tolerated in a civilized society.&quot;[40] Habeas
review acts as a responsible check on the system.

<p>

<center><h3>WHY CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Jerri Davis, whose son was viciously murdered in 1979 by a killer
who has delayed his execution for 17 years, argues, &quot;As long
as he's sitting up there, there's resentment. He has his life.
He has his card games, his exercise, his TV. We're feeding him.
We're clothing him. It's not fair.&quot;[41]

<p>

Death-row inmates like the killer of Davis's son have manipulated
the courts. They have nothing to lose, and the taxpayer picks
up the tab. Even Justice O'Connor cautions federal courts to be
&quot;fair to the states, in not disrupting the states' enforcement
of their criminal laws.&quot;[42]

<p>

&quot;There are some crimes that are so brutal that society expects
and demands the death penalty,&quot; says Michael Capizzi, an
Orange County, California district attorney. &quot;If you take
a quick snapshot of the devastation to human beings you understand
why an overwhelming majority of the people in the state favor
the death penalty.&quot;[43]

<p>

An ABA report shows that even the simplest cases, where relief
is denied at every stage, will still go to the high court at least
three times and to federal district and appellate courts twice.
That's after all state-level options are exhausted.[44]

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the death
penalty appeals process. &quot;The state has, as noted, a strong
interest in executing its duly acquired judgment.&quot; Referring
to a convicted murderer who has delayed his execution via the
appeals process for 15 years, he says his &quot;interest . . .is
entirely indeterminate, and for all we know non-existent. He seeks
additional time not in order to elaborate on a known claim, but
in order to develop a claim.&quot; Judge Scalia fears that the
current process allows executions to be &quot;stayed 
indefinitely.&quot;[45]

<p>

Paul Kamenar, director of the Washington Legal Foundation, says
that reforming habeas corpus and the 1976 revival of the death
penalty will improve criminal justice. But he warns, &quot;The
deterrent effect of any punishment depends on how swiftly the
punishment is applied.&quot;[46] Given the long delays for appeals
between sentencing and execution, many citizens have grown disillusioned
with the justice system.

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Crime
Subcommittee, wants to limit habeas corpus appeals. &quot;It sends
the message of swiftness and certainty of punishment that has
been missing from our criminal justice system for some time, and
it goes a long way to restoring deterrence to the criminal justice
system.&quot;[47]

<p>

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) supports changing the appeals process
&quot;because of the length of time that people remain on death
row at taxpayer expense. The people in this country are sick and
tired of paying for cable TV and . . . for food and lawyers for
those who have killed innocent people.&quot;[48]

<p>

John Collins, with the Springfield, Va., Citizens for Law and
Order, expresses a widely held belief that &quot;with repeated
review, there's never any finality, and there is continued victimization
of families.&quot; He asked, &quot;If you have federal review
after you've had full and fair state court consideration, why
have the state courts at all?&quot;[49]

<p>

Reform advocates contend that death-row inmates intentionally
withhold claims and wait until the last minute to petition federal
courts to gain execution delays. William Kopney, an Orange County
appellate attorney, said, &quot;Don't underestimate the ingenuity
of the people who are struggling 24 hours a day to save someone's
life when they believe the trial wasn't fair, or there's a miscarriage
of justice . . . . It's common for 11th-hour requests to strike
some responsive chord.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>LEGISLATION TO REFORM HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Many Americans want Congress to do something to reverse what they
perceive to be the abuse of the justice system by inmates. Americans
are also cynical about a liberal judiciary that appears to place
criminals' rights before victims' rights.

<p>

That's the impetus for legislative action to curb habeas corpus
abuse. In 1983, then-Attorney General William French Smith suggested
enactment of legislation abolishing federal habeas corpus as a
post-conviction remedy for state inmates.[51] Although Attorney General
Edwin Meese III agreed, Congress failed to act.[52] More recent attorneys
general echo agreement.

<p>

Following the April, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton
called for &quot;swift justice&quot; and gave his support to an
anti-terrorism bill. In both the Senate and House versions, that
bill includes habeas corpus reform.

<p>

The Senate version (S. 735, &quot;Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995&quot;) requires that a prisoner show that his conviction
or sentence violated &quot;clearly established federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the U.S.&quot;[53]

<p>

The House version (H.R. 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty
and Public Safety Act&quot;) incorporates habeas corpus reform
that establishes a six-month statute of limitations during which
a prisoner must file paperwork to receive an appeal hearing in
capital offense cases. Non-capital defendants have one year in
which to file appeal paperwork. Once the appeal has been filed,
the federal court must hear the case within four months. If the
petitioner loses at the district court, he may appeal only if:
(1) newly discovered evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly
that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant
guilty in his original trial, and (2) a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, is issued which was
previously unavailable.

<p>

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget criticize the
proposed changes. In their view, the proposed reform will &quot;subject
[the law] to potentially meritorious constitutional challenge.&quot;[54]
OMB says the proposal presumes to instruct federal courts on the
decisions those courts should reach on the meaning of the Constitution.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The battle over habeas corpus reform will become a constitutional
confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. Congress
can make law, but the high court has sway over issues of constitutionality.

<p>

The issue of protracted appeals by convicted criminals touches
deep emotions, especially among victims and their families. It
costs taxpayers millions of dollars to support inmate litigation
and sustain the judicial system. While appeals are in process
the friends and family of the victims suffer because they believe
justice has not been served. After almost every execution, the
victim's family says something to the effect of, &quot;At least
I can rest. Justice has been served.&quot;

<p>

It's time for habeas corpus reform that balances constitutional
rights and ensures justice. Any change must equally address three
tenets: swift punishment means better deterrence; limitless and
meritless appeals deny justice and displace taxpayer funds from
other programs; and hasty punishment may result in injustice to
those wrongly convicted.

<p>

Americans want to protect civil liberties, but they also want
to avoid freeing violent criminals on technicalities while ensuring
that police officers do not abuse their authority. Striking
this delicate balance is the subject of a national debate that
centers on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures[.]&quot;  To protect this right,
the modern judiciary created the exclusionary rule, which says
that prosecutors may not use evidence gathered illegally by the
police.  The rule is intended to keep law enforcement honest.

<p>

Policemen must obtain a warrant prior to searching and seizing.
Otherwise, evidence obtained at a crime scene may be ruled inadmissible
in court.  Judges routinely exclude such &quot;illegally&quot;
obtained evidence and allow criminals to go free. For example:

<p><ul>

<li>Charles Rathbun was arrested for the November 1995 murder
of model Linda Sobek.  He allegedly took Sobek into the California
hills, where he murdered her and buried her body.  During questioning,
Rathbun confessed to the crime and led officials to Sobek's grave.
A California court, however, ruled Rathbun's confession inadmissible
because police had not read him his rights prior to questioning.[1]
He may go free.

<p>

<li>Gary Gauger confessed to the gruesome murder of his parents
in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal,
an Illinois court ruled that his confession was inadmissible because
it, too, was illegally obtained.[2] He may go free.

<p>

<li>In 1984, Alfio Ferro was arrested for a fur robbery and murder.
While in custody, Ferro refused to speak with police.  One of
the detectives laid some furs in front of Ferro's cell.  Ferro,
thinking the police had information about the crime, made statements
which were later used against him.  A New York appeals court overturned
his murder conviction, contending that the placing of furs in
front of Ferro's cell amounted to coercion.  Ferro was freed.[3]

</ul><p>

Pending legislation which will alter the exclusionary rule might
have kept these murderers behind bars.

<p>

<center><h3>GROWING NATIONAL INTOLERANCE FOR LEGAL ABUSES</h3></center>

<p>

According to Steven Wagner of Luntz Research, a Republican polling
firm, there is a widespread feeling that the criminal justice
system has broken down and that the breakdown is &quot;the most
visible symbol of the declining moral character of American 
society.&quot;[4] Consider evidence of a wayward justice system.

<p>

In January 1996, at 5 a.m., a New York police officer patrolling
a high-crime area saw four young men loading duffel bags into
the trunk of an out-of-state car.  The men fled when they saw
the officer.  The officer found $4 million worth of cocaine and
heroin in the bags.[5]

<p>

Initially, federal District Court Judge Harold Baer found the
officer's explanation &quot;incredible&quot; and threw out the
trafficker's videotaped confession, saying the arrested driver
could have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.[6]
He denied that the police had &quot;probable cause&quot; for
searching the car.  The judge also said the men fled because of
the police department's reputation for being brutal.  Only after
a buildup of political pressure (including from President Clinton,
who had appointed the judge) did Baer reverse the finding.[7]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on President Clinton to admit
he had made mistakes in appointing judges &quot;who find technicalities
to release drug dealers and dangerous criminals.&quot;[8] Others
accused Baer of favoring the rights of criminals over public safety.

<p>

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see why some Americans are
suspicious of law enforcement.  Tales of police corruption, rogue
cops and evidence &quot;planting&quot; fill the media.  Testimony
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial by former Los Angeles detective
Mark Fuhrman eroded confidence in all policemen.  Fuhrman gave
the country a startling example of police brutality and racism.
Fuhrman bragged on tape about police abuses:  &quot;We basically
tortured them. . . .We broke'em.  Their faces were just mush.&quot;[9]

<p>

The widely-publicized Rodney King beating and the recent videotape
of two white deputies clubbing Mexicans near Los Angeles have
revived fears of rogue cops.  The &quot;Good Ol' Boys Roundup&quot;
in eastern Tennessee, where law enforcement agents took part in
racist acts, also add to the public's negative perception of law
enforcement.

<p>

Although these scenes do not represent the hundreds of thousands
of law enforcement officers who do their job well and faithfully
every day, they have undermined public confidence in the justice
and law enforcement systems and have chilled the exclusionary
rule debate.  Americans are confused about calls to reform the
rule.  Should lawmakers leave the rule alone or give police more
authority? Both options have liabilities.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN HISTORY</h3></center>

<p>

The exclusionary rule was created by the courts to implement the
Fourth Amendment.  It dates back to colonial times when British
troops broke down doors of homes seeking criminal evidence.  The
framers of America's Bill of Rights had one specific incident
in mind.

<p>

The 1763 case of <I>Wilkes v. Wood</I> clearly illustrates the
need for the Fourth Amendment. British troops, acting without
a warrant, broke into Wilkes' home and seized his private diaries.
Wilkes won his damage action against the colonial government.
His case steeled the Constitution's framers with a desire to
preclude future abuses.

<p>

Although the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees
to all persons the right to be secure from &quot;unreasonable&quot;
searches and seizures, it does not specify a remedy for violations
of this protection.  This is where the Supreme Court has sought
clarity.

<p>

In the 1820s, an attorney argued before the high court that the
Constitution provided for the exclusion of evidence.  Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Story denied that the Bill of Rights included
the concept of excluding evidence.  Story wrote, &quot;The right
of using evidence does not depend, nor, as far as I have any recollection,
has ever been supposed to depend, upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness
of the mode by which it is obtained.&quot;[10]

<p>

In 1886, however, the high court took the first steps toward creating
the modern exclusionary rule.  In <I>Boyd v. United States</I>,
the Supreme Court decided that using a man's diary or personal
papers as evidence against him in a criminal case would force
him &quot;to be a witness against himself.&quot;[11] Under these
circumstances, the court opined, the use of such evidence could
be denied.

<p>

In 1914, the exclusionary rule was officially created by the <I>Weeks
v. United States</I> decision. The high court determined that
evidence seized illegally had to be excluded.   The court reasoned
that the temptation to make unlawful searches and seizures could
not be checked by the threat of a civil lawsuit alone, and that
forcing law enforcement officials to get proper warrants would
force them to act with restraint. The court also reasoned that
denying police the fruits of unrestrained searches was an appropriate
defense of civil liberties.

<p>

As in the 1949 <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> case, the high court resisted
forcing the rule on state courts. But in 1961, Chief Justice
Earl Warren led the Supreme Court in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> to expand
the rule's application to all jurisdictions.  In 1984, it was
modified with <I>Leon v. United States</I>. In this case police
conducted a search pursuant to a search warrant that later was
found to have been defective.  The Supreme Court said that because
the officers believed they were acting properly, denying the evidence
would not deter future misconduct.  This has become known as the
&quot;good-faith&quot; exception.

<p>

The &quot;good-faith&quot; exception has also been applied in
situations where police gathered evidence without a search warrant
but in the reasonable belief that their actions were proper.

<p>

Now that the exclusionary rule has been tried for 80 years, it
has earned both supporters and detractors.  Professor William
Gangi of St. John's University told the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&quot;I see Americans growing increasingly cynical about our criminal
justice system, making derogatory references to 'technicalities'
or to criminals having more rights than their victims. And we
have to ask ourselves, 'Why?'&quot;[12]

<p>

<center><h3>HANDS-OFF THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

Defenders of the exclusionary rule claim it keeps lawmen honest.

<p>

Alan Dershowtiz, Harvard law professor and civil liberties advocate,
cautions that expanding the defendant's rights using the exclusionary
rule is the best way to protect the public from police abuses.[13]

<p>

James Fyfe, a former New York policeman and specialist on police
behavior, warns that &quot;...like some soldiers in a no-win war,
they [policemen] commit atrocities.&quot;[14]

<p>

This warning is not without substance.  The 1994 New York City
Mollen Commission investigated police corruption.  It found the
Department plagued with misconduct.  The Commission also found
that the Department's internal affairs &quot;often minimized and
even concealed corruption rather than rooted it out.&quot;  In
March 1994, 50 cops were arrested on charges of drug trafficking,
extortion, brutality and civil rights violations.[15]

<p>

Recently, Philadelphia had a similar police scandal.  Six rogue
cops pleaded guilty to charges that they framed people, lied to
obtain search warrants and stole money.  At least 42 criminal
convictions have been overturned as a result of these disclosures.[16]

<p>

Some key members of Congress support the exclusionary rule as
a check on police corruption.  On March 7, 1995, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;The
exclusionary rule enforces the Fourth Amendment by providing a
powerful disincentive to illegal searches by law enforcement
officials. . . .The rule has given prosecutors' offices and police
departments an institutional stake in thorough, lawful police
work.&quot;[17] Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. Bobby
Rush (D-Ill.) both claim to have been victimized by warrantless
federal searches.[18]

<p>

The American Bar Association also supports the rule.  Michael
McCann, an elected district attorney of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin,
spoke for the ABA at the same Senate Judiciary crime control hearing.
&quot;The rule has worked. . . .It has contributed to substantial
law reform by federal authorities.  It has increased the professionalism
of federal law enforcement officers.  It has vastly enhanced the
integrity of the federal judicial process.&quot;[19]

<p>

Rule supporters point out that complaints of abuse are often unfounded.
They cite four studies that show that the rule is seldom used
to toss out evidence.  A 1979 General Accounting Office report
found that motions to suppress evidence were granted in only 1.3
percent of federal cases.  A 1982 National Institute of Justice
study found that only 0.79 percent of all California felony cases
between 1976-79 rejected evidence because of the rule.  A study
of three midwestern states found the rule was used in less than
half of 1 percent of all cases.  Finally, Professor Wayne LaFave of the
University of Illinois College of Law found, &quot;The most careful
and balanced assessment of all available empirical data show [sic]
that. . .the cumulative loss in felony cases because of prosecutor
screening, police releases and court dismissals attributable to
the acquisition of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is from 0.6 percent to 2.35 percent.&quot;[20]

<p>

Even some peace officers support the rule.  Myron Orfield Jr.,
writing in the <I>University of Chicago Law Review</I>, quotes
the head of the narcotics section of the Organized Crime Division
of the Chicago Police Department:  &quot;In my personal opinion
[the exclusionary rule] is not a detriment to police work.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  It makes the police department more
professional.&quot;[21]

<p>

FBI director Louis Freeh said, &quot;My sense and my experience
have been that over the years, the exclusionary rule has not been
an obstacle to the FBI.&quot;[22]

<p>

John Dawes, a Cobb County, Georgia, homicide detective said, &quot;It's
been my experience that it's better to have a legal search warrant
issued by a judge.  That way, when you're entering, you know that
you're legally entering and legally gathering evidence.&quot;[23]

<p>

Justice Louis Brandeis endorsed placing constraints on law enforcers.
He wrote for the high court in the 1928 case <I>Olmstead v. United
States</I>: &quot;Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by
its example. . . .If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds
contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself;
it invites anarchy.&quot;[24]

<p>

Harvard law professor Carol Steiker echoed Brandeis's views to
the Senate Judiciary Committee at the March 7, 1995 hearing. 
She traced the expansion in the size and strength of our modern
police forces and said, &quot;Today's citizens are much more likely
to face well-trained and well-equipped police than they are to
encounter the anonymous blundering constable [who was once blamed
for making illegal searches]. . . .&quot;  She argues that modern
police are &quot;measured not by fidelity to procedural niceties
but rather by their ability to ferret out as much crime as possible.
In this respect, the Fourth Amendment's warrant clause and the
exclusionary rule are eminently realistic constitutional commands:
each counterbalances the natural incentive to fight crime at
any cost.&quot;[25]

<p>

She cited Justice Brandeis: &quot;To declare that in the administration
of the criminal law the end justifies the means -- to declare
that the government would commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution.&quot;[26]

<p>

Steiker says the exclusionary rule protects the most vulnerable
citizens from police over-reaching.  Specifically, she contends,
racial minorities are discriminated against by law enforcement
because too often race and class act as proxies for criminality
and too often police subject minority communities to the most
intrusive and offensive law enforcement tactics.[27]

<p>

She further argues that the rule encourages prosecutors and law
enforcement to communicate during the early stages of investigations
so as to develop evidence that can be used in court. Finally,
Steiker believes it protects the judicial process by preventing
government from being implicated in legitimizing unlawful conduct.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</h3></center>

<p>

On the other hand, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, disputes the notion that the exclusionary
rule deters police misconduct.  He argues that there is &quot;little
reliable empirical evidence that police misconduct has been deterred
by the rule.&quot;[29]

<p>

Judge Harold Rothwax, former vice chairman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union during the 1960s says, &quot;The pendulum has
now swung to the point that it unfairly favors the defendant 
[criminal].&quot;[30]

<p>

Judge Rothwax warns, &quot;What's happened is we've really departed
from common sense. . . . The system today seems incomprehensible to 
the average citizen.&quot;[31]

<p>

Steven Brill, editor-in-chief of <I>Court TV</I> and <I>The American
Lawyer</I>, agrees. &quot;There's no doubt that lots and lots
of people of good faith -- who aren't anti-civil liberties and
aren't right-wing zealots -- are increasingly frustrated.&quot;[32]

<p>

Professor Gangi told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;I call
it a disgrace.  Not only has the exclusionary rule failed to work
the magic its proponents promised, but it has eroded citizen confidence
in the competency of government.  And, in my opinion, it also
has thoroughly undermined the nobility of the role once played
by defense counsel.&quot;[33]

<p>

Paul Robinson, a professor at Northwestern University School of
Law, writes in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, &quot;The exclusionary
rule...suggests a system less strongly committed to doing justice
than to discouraging overreaching by the police.&quot;  He suggests
that police misconduct can be controlled by making offending officers
liable or by helping victims to get compensation from municipalities.
He says, &quot;If limiting overreaching by the police is such
an important goal, why not attack it head-on rather than 'punishing'
the offending officers by letting the criminal go free -- which
punishes society rather than the officers?&quot;[34]

<p>

<center><h3>PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

The Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666) would expand
the so-called &quot;good-faith&quot; exception to certain federal
searches without a warrant.  Evidence would be admissible as long
as trial judges determine that police had reason to believe that
their actions were proper.  The bill would not overturn prior
Supreme Court decisions specifying when a warrant must be obtained
prior to conducting a search.

<p>

Professor Steiker admits that this bill would not eliminate the
exclusionary rule but proposes it would admit unconstitutionally
seized evidence when law enforcement agents have a belief in the
legitimacy of their conduct.  She argues that this change ignores
the importance of the rule in the maintenance of judicial integrity
and fails to provide equally effective deterrence of unconstitutional
conduct. Further, she believes it will encourage police overreaching.[35]

<p>

Thomas Davies, professor at the University of Tennessee College
of Law, agrees with Steiker.  He believes H.R. 666 would provide
short-term gains, &quot;but the rule plays a vital role in reaffirming
the rule of law.  [The exclusionary rule and Mirander Waiver rules]
tell police officers that citizen's rights matter.  They allow
honest police officers to respect themselves as upstanding citizens
also.&quot;[36]

<p>

Senator Hatch's legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Improvement Act of 1995 (S.3), would eliminate the
rule entirely and establish in its place a civil tort remedy designed
to benefit citizens whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.

<p>

Hatch argues, the &quot;rule is not compelled by the Constitution.
. . .It is time to revisit this judicially-created remedy.&quot;[37]
He wants to strike the delicate balance between protecting the
rights of the accused from police misconduct while ensuring that
relevant evidence comes before the jury -- so as to put the truly
guilty in jail and achieve justice.
Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee  that the Hatch bill &quot;restores coherence
to our constitutional structure.  It takes the Fourth Amendment
out of criminal procedure, where it does not fit, and puts it
back where it belongs: in constitutional law.&quot;[38] He also
said, &quot;Suppose the bill increases convictions of guilty defendants
by 1 percent.  That's a lot of guilty rapists, murderers, and
robbers, and a lot of victims of crime who can sleep easier.&quot;[39]

<p>

The Hatch bill is not without its opponents.  Senator Kennedy
said that enactment of the Hatch bill &quot;would invite drastically
reduced compliance with the Constitution.&quot;[40]

<p>

Professor Steiker believes that removing the rule would fail to
provide the required deterrent effect and that the tort alternative
is misdirected.  Victims of illegal searches would not bring suit
against police misconduct either because lawyers would be reluctant
to take such cases or the likely awards would be insufficiently
enticing.[41]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

There are competing concepts in the exclusionary rule debate 
-- freedom from police misconduct and justice for the guilty.
We must find a balance.

<p>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his Birmingham, Alabama
jail cell, &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor,
it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;[42] Most citizens would
agree with Dr. King.

<p>

Today, there is ample evidence that some lawmen and judges are
over-stepping their bounds.  This must change.  Congress should
modify the law to simultaneously deny freedom to the guilty, give
incentives for police professionalism and protect civil liberties.
It can start by changing the court-created exclusionary rule.

<h2>MARY JANE IS NO FLORENCE<br>
NIGHTINGALE: THE TRUTH<br>
ABOUT MARIJUANA'S<br>
MEDICINAL USES</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

If a bill before the House makes its way into law, the federal
government would have to make the switch from uprooting and destroying
marijuana crops to growing its own fields of plants for large-scale
distribution.

<p>

Once again, pro-drug groups are trying to convince America that
marijuana must be considered a legitimate medicine. Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618 last November, which would
&quot;provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]

<p>

The specified illnesses are to be limited to glaucoma, AIDS wasting
syndrome, nausea resulting from chemotherapy, and spasticity resulting
from multiple sclerosis (MS), paraplegia, and quadriplegia. However,
the bill does leave room for those with other illnesses to apply
for marijuana use through the Food and Drug Administration.[2]

<p>

Basically, the bill is another effort to reclassify marijuana.
Currently, marijuana is under Schedule I, meaning it is unable
to be prescribed, has a high potential for abuse, is not currently
accepted for medicinal use, and has a lack of safety. Rescheduling
marijuana would place it under Schedule II, which includes drugs
currently accepted for medical use that have a high potential
for abuse, but are still able to be prescribed.[3] Cocaine is an
example of a Schedule II drug.

<p>

The bill calls for an Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs to be established under the Department of Health
and Human Services. That office would be responsible for making
sure there is an adequate supply of the drug for &quot;legitimate
medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United
States.&quot; This supply would come from bidders or, if there
weren't enough domestic growers, from direct importation.

<p>

The office would provide the seeds to those whose bids to grow
marijuana are accepted. Those seeds, in turn, would be obtained
as follows: &quot;[L]egitimate commercial producers of marijuana
or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
the Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement Administration,
or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Secretary with
an adequate supply of seeds capable of germination.&quot;

<p>

The marijuana would be distributed to doctors who have said they
intend to use the drug only on consenting patients with one of
the aforementioned illnesses. The doctors would be approved by
sending in applications which the office would approve or deny
within 30 days. According to the bill, if the office does not
respond within that time, doctors could consider themselves approved.

<p>

The use of marijuana as medicine has stirred considerable controversy.
Marijuana advocates insist it carries valuable medical benefits
and claim it is actually more harmful to prohibit the sick from
smoking it. Most of the medical community sees it differently,
however. Few doubt that marijuana (cannabis) does have a certain
degree of medical effect. The problem is the marked disadvantages
crude marijuana carries with it. Smoked marijuana has too many
negative side-effects to warrant its use as a drug.

<p>

Of course, the utility of marijuana as a true medicine too often
takes a back seat to other interests. The pro-marijuana movement,
led by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), certainly has a
well-known ulterior motive for pushing marijuana as a medicine.
Dr. Janet Lapey, a pathologist who is now president of Concerned
Citizens for Drug Prevention, said members of NORML have frequently
cited the medicinal marijuana issue as a red herring to gain a
toehold in legalizing all marijuana use.[4] (In fact, the pro-drug
<I>High Times</I> magazine characterized drug proposals like 
marijuana-as-medicine as being mere first steps that were &quot;far 
short of the DPF's ultimate goals, which include decriminalization of 
all illegal drugs.&quot;[5])

<p>

Marijuana simply is not the equal of other therapeutic drugs already
on the market. In fact, the American Medical Association, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
the American Cancer Society, and the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society all deny that marijuana should be construed as medicine.[6]
After the DEA reviewed a petition for the possible rescheduling
of marijuana, Robert Bonner, the Administrator of Drug Enforcement
at the time, wrote, &quot;Relying on the same scientific standards
used to judge all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected
marijuana for medical use.&quot;[7]

<p>

The active medical and psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is
delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A synthetic THC called
dronabinol has been marketed as the drug Marinol since 1985.[8] Thus,
what medical good there is in marijuana has already been separated
from the problematic vegetable tissue of the cannabis plant. However,
even this purified and tested drug is not well received because
of its serious side-effects. Dr. Eric A.Voth is an assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Kansas and chairman of the International
Drug Strategy Institute. He has treated drug addicts for 10 years,
and recently testified at a congressional hearing on the legalization
of marijuana. Voth asserts, &quot;The negative side-effect profile
for marijuana, even dronabinol (Marinol), far exceeds most of
the other effective agents available.&quot;[9] Voth backs this assertion
by citing a study which ranked non-inhalant THC as only sixth
in preference among oncologists for the treatment of severe nausea,
and only ninth for mild nausea.[10]

<p>

Crude marijuana has even less to recommend it. First, no approved
drug is smoked. In the same way that tobacco is known to induce
lung cancer, smoking marijuana increases chances of cancer, too.
Billy Martin, a professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University's
medical college, said, &quot;There is good scientific evidence
showing adverse effects of smoking marijuana. Certainly it has
much higher tar content than cigarettes.&quot;[11] One study found
that marijuana smoking resulted in up to four times the respiratory
burden of an equivalent amount of tobacco smoking.[12] A September,
1993, National Institute on Drug Abuse update reported, &quot;Daily
use of one to three marijuana joints appears to produce approximately
the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking five
times as many cigarettes.&quot;[13]

<p>

When marijuana supporters advocate smoking the drug for the rest
of a patient's life (for conditions like MS or glaucoma), it seems
strange to promote a &quot;treatment&quot; that could very well
promote disease and hasten death. Moreover, at a time when tobacco
products are roundly criticized, legalizing a similar product
for supposedly medicinal purposes would be hypocritical.

<p>

Besides the adverse effects of smoking, marijuana use is related
to amotivation syndrome in chronic users, characterized by a loss
of energy, general apathy, and impairment of concentration. Sedation
and lethargy are very common. Acute negative psychological effects
could include flashbacks, panic attacks, and disorientation.[14]

<p>

Additionally, for each of the diseases listed in Frank's bill,
scientific studies and the vast majority of doctors cast doubts
on marijuana's usefulness compared to currently approved drugs.

<p>

Simply put, glaucoma is gradual blindness caused when fluid pressure
inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is too high. Crude marijuana,
like alcohol ingestion, can reduce that pressure. But to arrest
glaucoma's progress, marijuana would have to be ingested chronically
-- every day of a patient's life -- in order to be effective.
On the topic of glaucoma, a 1994 Drug Enforcement Administration
manual cited Dr. Keith Green. Green has served on the boards of
eight ophthalmological journals, and performed extensive research
on the relationship between marijuana and glaucoma. According
to the manual, Dr. Green &quot;suggests that in order to decrease
intraocular pressure, one would have to smoke the equivalent of
six joints a day.&quot;[15]

<p>

In studies analyzing the effect of marijuana on glaucoma, heavy
doses were needed to reach the point at which intraocular pressure
was reduced. In some studies, the effect of the necessary dosage
of marijuana caused patients to become quite drowsy. Researchers
reported, &quot;Our subjects were sometimes too sleepy to permit
measurement of intraocular pressures. . . three hours after 
intoxication.&quot;[16]

<p>

A 1994 Drug Watch publication entitled, &quot;Glaucoma: Is Marijuana
a Safe and Effective Treatment?&quot; reported that &quot;the
country's leading ophthalmologists are 'chagrined' and 'disturbed'
to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana as a treatment
for glaucoma.&quot;[17]

<p>

Vomiting because of chemotherapy treatment is a serious concern
of cancer patients and their doctors. While smoked marijuana has
some ability to control vomiting, doctors still say it is not
as effective as other, safer drugs. In an overview of antiemetic
(anti-vomiting) drugs in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>,
the authors addressed cannabis derivatives that were used as antiemetics.
Dronabinol usage entailed serious side-effects, including &quot;dysphoria,
hallucinations, sedation, vertigo, dry mouth, and disorientation,
and are therefore seldom used as first-line antiemetic therapy.&quot;
The authors do find hope in cannabinoids, though: &quot;Synthetic
cannabinoids with no psychotropic activity have antiemetic 
activity.&quot;[18] Thus, cannabinoids could lead to anti-vomiting drugs 
in the future that don't have the mindbending effects that marijuana and 
its active ingredients have. This does not mean, of course, that crude
marijuana is that hope. Scientific studies have shown that marijuana
is not preferable to Marinol, which is itself not preferable to
other anti-vomiting drugs.[19]

<p>

Neither should marijuana be used as a treatment for spasticity
resulting from neurological disorders. The DEA manual, written
by Tom Pool, claimed, &quot;Experts on MS absolutely reject this
proposition.&quot;[20] Pool quotes Dr. Donald Silberberg, the Chair
of the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine: &quot;The use of (marijuana), especially for
long-term treatment. . . would be worse than the original disease
itself.&quot;[21]

<p>

Of course, some MS sufferers adamantly claim marijuana helps control
their spasticity. These subjective anecdotes, unfortunately, have
not been borne out in clinical studies. One recent study indicated
that even while MS patients thought they were being helped by
smoking marijuana, their actual balance and coordination were
made worse.[22]

<p>

Using marijuana for treating AIDS patients brings more concerns.

<p>

Pool wrote, &quot;First, studies conducted at the Virginia Medical
College suggest that the THC in marijuana damages the immune system,
making the patient more susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza
while at the same time increasing the severity of any illnesses
that the patient has. Clearly, the last thing that a patient with
AIDS needs is to have his or her immune system weakened. Second,
the marijuana smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients.&quot;[23]

<p>

Advocates of medicinal marijuana continually make claims that
might lead the unsuspecting to believe that marijuana is actually
a miracle drug. For example, one pamphlet published by the Colorado
Hemp Initiative Project stated, &quot;Cannabis is two to three
times as effective as are currently legal medicines for reducing
Intra-Ocular Pressure, without toxic side-effects or damage to
liver and kidneys associated with presently approved drugs.&quot;[24]
Yet, in an evaluation of glaucoma treatment published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, marijuana isn't even mentioned
-- odd, if it is indeed two to three times as effective as any
other drug.[25]

<p>

Voth summarized the issue by noting, &quot;The pro-drug lobby
would have the public and policy makers incorrectly believe that
crude marijuana is the only treatment alternative for masses of
cancer sufferers who are going untreated for the nausea associated
with chemotherapy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other 
ailments.&quot;[26]

<p>

Pro-marijuana arguments heavily rely on anecdotal evidence instead
of controlled studies. Many people make the claim that marijuana
use has helped control aspects of various diseases. However, anecdotes
are notoriously inaccurate or statistically misleading.

<p>

Robert Peterson, the director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control
Policy from 1991-1995, wrote, &quot;One must look closely at anecdotal
evidence. In some of the most celebrated cases, the individual
smoked pot before he or she ever got ill. Marijuana is addictive
and addicts tend to feel better when they receive their drug.
. . . There is no doubt that using a euphoric drug such as marijuana,
alcohol, cocaine or heroin will make a sick person feel better.
That does not make a drug a medicine.&quot;[27]

<p>

The DEA petition echoes Peterson. &quot;Sick people are not objective
scientific observers, especially when it comes to their own health.
We all have heard of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency
to respond to drugs as they believe is expected of them. . . Stories
of marijuana's benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.&quot;[28]

<p>

Legislators considering legalizing marijuana as a type of folk
medicine should also consider the secondary effects of that action.
Past experience has shown that it is not uncommon for drugs distributed
by doctors that are otherwise illegal to spread from the patient
to his or her acquaintances and friends. Also, public attitudes
toward marijuana as a recreational drug probably would begin to
change if medicinal uses were approved. Already, youth are beginning
to see marijuana as a benign or even beneficial drug due to some
highly successful propaganda by groups like NORML. If, as the
evidence suggests, marijuana will not add anything to the American
medicine cabinet, any increased collateral use and resulting damage
would have to be added to the cost of rescheduling crude marijuana.

<p>

Certainly, pro-marijuana groups have performed admirably in disseminating
their views. Now, the voices of the objective medical establishment
need to match their enthusiasm, and inform the public of the truth
about medicinal uses of marijuana and the motivations behind the
arguments.

<p>

A 1995 government-commissioned study claims that giving clean
needles to addicts will slow the spread of the AIDS virus without
encouraging drug abuse. While there is reason to question this
claim, even if the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users
(IDU) were slowed, this action would create some potentially undesirable
effects.

<p>

The fight to establish federally-funded needle exchange programs
(NEP) is being urged as a wedge issue to gain drug legalization.
Linking drug addiction with the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic
under the pro-drug umbrella called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
is good political strategy, but it's a bad idea that is gathering
momentum, and it must be countered.

<p>

Supporters of federally-funded NEPs are rallying around this issue.
Leading NEP researcher Peter Lurie, a professor with the Institute
for Health Policy Studies, University of California San Francisco,
says the 1995 study is &quot;a vindication for all of the needle
exchange workers around the country, as well as the scientists
who have been coming to these conclusions for years....[The government]
can no longer hide from the weight of scientific evidence....&quot;[1]

<p>

In response to the American needle study, the respected British
medical journal <I>Lancet</I> said, &quot;It is time for the U.S.
to catch up with so much of the world....Needle exchanges do not
increase drug use in programme [sic] participants. They do not
encourage or increase the number of drug users. They do not increase
the number of needles lying about; they do not destroy cities,
or towns or neighborhoods.&quot;[2]

<p>

Dr. Lincoln Moses, chairman of the 15-member panel that led the
government's NEP study, said, &quot;We must consider the reality
that people do use drugs and that HIV is transmitted in growing
numbers by injection drug use.&quot;[3]

<p>

Not everyone agrees with those who favor needle exchange. Donna
Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), has
doubts. Shalala told <I>CNN</I> that &quot;different experts disagree&quot;
as to the efficacy of needle exchange.[4] Philip Lee, Shalala's assistant and 
a former needle exchange researcher, called NEPs &quot;an extraordinarily
complex public policy strategy&quot;[5] and expressed concern that
NEPs &quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;[6]

<p>

Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said, &quot;It [needle exchange]
drags down the standards of all society.... It is an act born
of desperation.&quot;[7] Reverend Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, agrees. &quot;I am not in favor of cooperating
with evil,&quot; said Butts. &quot;If we give out needles now...the
next step will be to legalize crack and heroin.&quot;[8] This may
be the ultimate goal of proponents of these programs.

<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL BACKGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

In 1992, Congress ordered HHS to request a study of NEPs by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent, Congressionally-chartered,
non-government research agency. If the Academy found that NEPs
were shown to be effective in reducing HIV infection while not
encouraging drug use, then the Surgeon General could lift the
ban on federal financing for such programs, Congress said.

<p>

The Academy concluded its study in 1995 and reported that well-implemented
NEPs can be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
increase the use of illegal drugs. NAS recommended that &quot;[t]he
Surgeon General make the determination called for in Public Law
102-394, section 514, 1993, necessary to rescind the present prohibition
against applying any federal funds to support needle exchange
programs.&quot;[9]

<p>

While addicts can legally buy needles in all but nine states without
a medical prescription, 45 states have laws making it a crime
to carry a needle and syringe.[10] Police in these states argue that
the criminalization of drug paraphernalia helps successful drug
arrests and prosecutions.

<p>

In 1992, Connecticut modified its syringe law to permit the possession
and purchase of up to 10 needles without a prescription. But a
state-sponsored survey found that IDU needle sharing did not change
with the new law.[11]

<p>

Community NEPs do not slow illegal needle sales. Numerous studies
have found that even where NEPs operate and syringes are available
without prescription, IDUs remain dependent upon black market
sources for needles.[12]

<p>

<center><h3>THE BATTLEGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

Needle Exchange Programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among IDUs to reduce the risk of transmitting
the AIDS virus. Residual blood retained in a shared syringe can
be passed along to the next person using the syringe. This high-risk
behavior infects perhaps 20,000 Americans with the AIDS virus
every year.[13]

<p>

Providing addicts with clean needles may slow the spread of the
AIDS virus, but questions remain. Will it lead to more responsible
behavior? Will it lead addicts to seek drug treatment? Will this
practice encourage more drug abuse?

<p>

Researchers discovered that the bite of the infected female anopheles
mosquito transmitted malaria. To slow malaria's spread, researchers
theorized, the mosquito had to be destroyed. It worked. Dr. Lurie
argues that replacing tainted drug needles with clean ones would
be analogous to removing the malaria vector.[14]

<p>

Nationwide, almost one-third of all AIDS cases are associated
with IDUs. This includes almost 60 percent of children under age
13 who contracted the virus from mothers who were abusers or who
were sex partners of IDUs.[15] Today, shared needles are blamed for
more HIV infections than in the past.

<p>

In 1981, only 12 percent of AIDS victims contracted the virus
from needles but in 1993 that number had risen to 29 percent.[16]
During the same period the proportion of new cases of HIV transmission
due to sex between men declined from 74 percent to 47 percent.[17]

<p>

Most of the IDUs are found in the 96 largest metropolitan areas.
These areas also include 85 percent of all reported AIDS cases,
and nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of all IDUs are located in
just six cities: Boston, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C.[18]

<p>

The total number of IDUs is hard to predict. The U.S. Public Health
Service reports that the population exceeds one million.[19] The 1994
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 2,580,000 Americans
have used needles to inject illicit drugs in their lives and 257,000
have done so in the past year.[20] A 1994 CDC report estimates that
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas alone the IDU population
exceeds 1.5 million.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>WHO ARE THE ADDICTS?</h3></center>

<p>

Terri is a 29-year-old Hispanic mother of two and an IDU. She
said, &quot;In the beginning, it was fun. I felt like Superman....It
was like I had an 'S' on my chest and I had my mask on, and I
could conquer the world. The drugs took away the bad feelings.&quot;[22]

<p>

Terri, like many addicts, started injecting just to get high.
Soon she found that the drugs were causing more pain than relief.
To support her $200-a-day habit, Terri sold heroin, got caught,
and lost custody of her children.[23] There are more than 200,000
addicts like Terri in New York City alone.[24]

<p>

According to another addict, &quot;Shooting drugs is not a rational
act....I know what it's like to be scared of getting AIDS, but
I needed to get high so bad that I didn't think about the risk.&quot;[25]

<p>

Dr. Steven Koester, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver, explains why addicts share needles
in spite of the AIDS scare. &quot;The laws against having syringes
made it too risky to carry them on the way to get heroin. It created
an artificial scarcity. They were sharing because they had to
-- not because of some ritual for bonding.&quot; After buying
their dope, said Koester, addicts &quot;go to the closest place
where they can have privacy and get a syringe.&quot; This is typically
a &quot;shooting gallery&quot; where, for a small fee, they can
get privacy and a needle to use.[26]

<p>

It's difficult for an addict to stop injecting drugs because heroin
depletes key body chemicals. With these gone, the body experiences
intense drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant.
That's why a heroin addict may need four to six injections each
day, 120 to 180 times per month or 1,500 times per year. Frequent
injections with shared needles lead to increased chances of contracting
blood-borne diseases like HIV.[27]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW NEPS WORK</h3></center>

<p>

The typical NEP client is male, has been injecting between seven
and 20 years and is between 33 and 41 years old.[28] Racial/ethnic
distributions vary considerably depending upon location. One-third
to one-half of NEP clients have never been in drug treatment.[29]

<p>

The Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center [New York City] provides
numerous services. Addicts can get &quot;shooter's supplies&quot;
like alcohol pads, cotton balls, cookers, condoms, bottles of
bleach and clean water. The exchange hands out about 1,000 needles
an hour[30] or between 15,000 and 20,000 each week.[31]

<p>

The exchange also helps addicts get into treatment programs, solves
housing problems, gives lessons on safer ways of shooting drugs,
and keeps tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. Warnings
about bad heroin are identified by their street names on a chalkboard
hung inside the center.[32]

<p>

Mark Gerse, the center's director, said, &quot;We've become an
information clearinghouse. If we didn't get the word out, it would
take a series of deaths to get people's attention.&quot;[33]

<p>

Terri uses the Lower East Side needle exchange which operates
out of a storefront in a residential area populated by working
poor. She explains, &quot;This place gives me hope and it makes
me feel loved....This place keeps you from hurting yourself until
you're able to make a choice to straighten yourself out.&quot;[34]

<p>

Another addict who has been mainlining for more than a decade,
said, &quot;It's good to know that there's someone actually looking
after us because the truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves
with bad dope.&quot;[35]

<p>

There are approximately 75 NEPs in 55 U.S. cities.[36] They operate
either from fixed sites (stationary van, storefront, street, and
health facility) or mobile sites (walk route, deliveries and roving
vans) operating a median 10 hours per week. They are staffed with
a combination of paid employees and volunteers who may provide
a variety of services in addition to exchanging needles, such
as HIV testing/counseling, tuberculosis screening, screening for
sexually transmitted diseases, primary medical care and substance
abuse treatment.[37]

<p>

<center><h3>THE SWISS NEEDLE EXPERIMENT</h3></center>

<p>

In 1986, to counter the drug problem, the Swiss began experimenting
with NEPs. The first step was to make syringes available in every
pharmacy. Switzerland also legalized syringe sales via public
vending machines. For three francs or about $2.43, anyone can
buy two syringes, extra needles, alcohol, swabs, gauze, and a
condom packaged in a cigarette-sized pack labeled &quot;Flash.&quot;[38]

<p>

In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened for free needle distribution.
Up to 300 syringes were given away each day. The original aim
had been to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for Zurich's own addicts.
But before long, the city was flooded with foreign addicts. The
number of needles exchanged grew to 12,000 per day before the
park was closed in 1992.[39]

<p>

After police closed Platzpitz, thousands of addicts relocated
a half-mile away to an abandoned railway station called &quot;Letten&quot;
where the Swiss experiment evolved into a grotesque spectacle.
Needle exchanges grew to 15,000 per day.[40]

<p>

Letten became a war zone between rival drug-dealing gangs. When
police tried to investigate crimes, they faced gunfire and their
cars were attacked and overturned by addicts. Local police arrested
a drug dealer after the fourth murder within just one month. Fellow
drug dealers stormed the police station demanding the man's release
or else they would blow-up the station.[41] He was released. In February,
1995, Swiss authorities closed Letten and moved the addicts to
government-sponsored centers and &quot;shooting galleries.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist, and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program. She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of pro-drug forces.

<p>

Opposition to NEPs and government-sponsored heroin experiments
has not been tolerated. Doctors who protested the initial NEP
were quashed by the media and pro-NEP physicians. Even a public
school teacher who warned her elementary students about the risks
of illicit drugs lost her job because of pressure from pro-drug
groups. One of her students had died from a heroin overdose.[42]

<p>

Switzerland has the highest heroin addiction rate (30,000 addicts)
and second highest HIV infection rate in Europe. It experiences
between 350 and 400 illicit drug overdose deaths each year.[43] To
address the growing problem without experiencing more &quot;Lettens,&quot;
the Swiss federal government started giving drugs to some addicts.
Switzerland has an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin,
morphine and methadone are given to addicts. The project, which
is scheduled to end in December, 1996, includes 700 addicts. Nearly
half of these addicts are HIV-positive. They are given free drugs
up to nine times a day. At night they are given heroin cigarettes
to be used at home. The cost is covered by health insurance or
the government.[44]

<p>

Dr. Andre Seidenberg, who runs a Swiss government-sponsored heroin
maintenance clinic for 100 addicts, believes that &quot;[h]eroin
consumption should be medicalized.&quot; He would &quot;like to
see heroin distribution trials in the U.S.&quot;[45]

<p>

The experiment's aim is to improve addict health, decrease criminal
activity, cut addicts off from drug dealers and stop abuse. Unfortunately,
the number of addicts is rising, and the experiment has not cut
illegal drug abuse and crime. It is also reported that police
officials in Bern and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug
consumers and dealers.[46]

<p>

On July 1, 1995, Swiss prison authorities began experimenting
with heroin-addicted inmates. Junkie prisoners with at least a
nine-month sentence who were age 20 and older were given heroin.
The rationale for this experiment was not announced.[47]

<p>

It appears that Switzerland is moving towards drug legalization.
The problems associated with NEPs and drug maintenance programs
have contributed to a shift in attitude toward drugs. On November
9, 1995, 94 Swiss executives called for the government to embrace
a &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy that includes an expansion
of the legal heroin distribution program. Six of the executives
were representatives of American companies in Switzerland: Andersen
Consulting AG, American Express, Polaroid, Atag Ernst &amp; Young
AG, Agfa Gevaert AG and Revisuisse Price Waterhouse AG.[48]

<p>

Roland C. Rasi, general manager of the Swiss Bank Corporation,
spoke for the executives when he announced the 11-part &quot;harm
reduction&quot; strategy. The strategy would shift funds from
enforcement to treatment such as medicalized heroin distribution.
It would also demand that Swiss companies employ drug addicts
in order to better integrate them into society. He described one
Swiss company that proudly hires auto mechanics who are addicted
to heroin.

<p>

In 1996, the Swiss people will decide whether to legalize now-illicit
drugs. The vote is expected to be close. Dr. Haller said she hopes
America does not follow Switzerland's drug example.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY ABOUT NEPS?</h3></center>

<p>

The Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which is supported
by pro-drug billionaire George Soros, has hosted several Capitol
Hill seminars to brief Congressional staff about NEPs. Arnold
Trebach, DPF's president and an American University professor,
said at one of the seminars that the &quot;[d]ominant morality
is that drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[49] Trebach
said the federal government's needle exchange policy is &quot;obscene.&quot;
He says the research supports NEPs.

<p>

In September, 1995, the National Academy of Sciences announced
the results of its government-requested study of NEPs in its work,
&quot;Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles
and Bleach&quot;.[50] The panel called for the Surgeon General to
rescind the present prohibition against applying any federal funds
to support NEPs.

<p>

Dr. Moses, the study chairman, said that data from a program in
New Haven showed that the rate of HIV infection in needles turned
into the exchange had decreased by one-third.[51]

<p>

Edward Kaplan, a professor with Yale University's School of Management,
evaluated the New Haven NEP. Kaplan, a statistician, says he is
not an NEP advocate, but that he believes NEPs are effective.[52]

<p>

Moses also cited a study in Tacoma, Washington, which found a
dramatic drop in blood-borne diseases after an NEP started. That
study examined hepatitis B infection rates among NEP participants
and found these people were eight times less likely than non-participants
to contract the blood-borne infection. This study is supposedly
analogous for HIV infections.[53]

<p>

Dr. Don Des Jarlais, research director of the Chemical Dependency
Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, endorses
NAS's recommendation. &quot;Anyone who's looking at it from the
perspective of preventing HIV transmission,&quot; said Des Jarlais,
&quot;comes to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more syringe
exchange.&quot;[54]

<p>

Dr. Peter Lurie led a CDC-funded study entitled, &quot;The Public
Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States
and Abroad,&quot; 1993. The study evaluated 23 of the programs
in 15 cities across four countries. His study was extensively
reported by the NAS. Lurie concluded that NEPs &quot;do not appear
to increase drug use and do prevent HIV infections in injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children.&quot;[55] His
700-page report calls for more federal funds for NEPs, repeal
of laws precluding purchase of syringes without a prescription,
and repeal of paraphernalia laws.

<p>

Lurie's analysis evaluated eight needle exchange studies that
measured drug use levels. Only one study showed an increase in
drug use. Three showed a decrease, and four found no change. Lurie
found 10 of 14 other studies that showed a reduction in HIV infection
among NEP participants.[56]

<p>

Lurie's report acknowledges numerous problems:

<p><ul>

<li>None of the studies reviewed were &quot;randomized; self-reported
behavior (subject to response bias) was often used as an outcome;
follow-up was often poor; and risk behavior was often only roughly
measured.&quot;[57]

<p>

<li>Lurie admits that he can't determine whether NEPs change the
community level of drug use, and he found no evidence that NEPs
increase use of drug treatment.[58]

<p>

<li>With regard to New Haven-type studies that test only syringes,
Lurie says, &quot;The validity of testing of syringes is limited.&quot;[59]

<p>

<li>On the key issue whether NEPs effect HIV infection rates,
Lurie states, &quot;Studies of the effect of NEPs on HIV infection
rates...probably cannot provide clear evidence that NEPs decrease
HIV infection rates. However, NEPs do not appear to be associated
with increased rates of HIV infection.&quot;[60]

</ul><p>

Even a 1993 General Accounting Office report concludes, &quot;Research
suggests [that syringe exchange programs have] promise as an AIDS
prevention strategy.&quot;[61] GAO's &quot;promise&quot; and Lurie's
&quot;cannot provide&quot; are not comforting conclusions.

<p>

On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier interviewed Ton Quadt,
the Dutch Drug Rehabilitation Coordinator. Quadt said, &quot;If
you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people don't have
to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is lessened.&quot;
Since the program began 10 years ago, the AIDS infection rate
of those in the program has dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent.[62]

<p>

Enthusiasm for NAS's recommendation to lift the ban on NEP funding
is not universally shared. Assistant Secretary of HHS Philip Lee
said, &quot;I have not been convinced on the evidence that has
been presented so far.&quot;[63] His skepticism is well founded.

<p>

On October 16, 1989, then Secretary of HHS Louis Sullivan hosted
a conference with 12 scientific and legal experts to discuss NEPs.[64]
The consultants recommended designing a new multi-center experiment
lasting three to five years. Unfortunately, that recommendation
was never undertaken.

<p>

Lead consultant Dr. Edward Brandt, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary
for Health and then the Executive Dean of the College of Medicine
of the University of Oklahoma, said, &quot;It will be extraordinarily
difficult to provide a scientifically rigorous answer [with regard
to NEPs slowing HIV infection without increasing drug abuse].&quot;[65]

<p>

Considering the NEPs at that time, Brandt concluded, &quot;It
is not possible to perform a meaningful evaluation of existing
programs because none were designed and initiated with a stringent
evaluation approach as a primary objective. Also, comparison among
programs through a multi-center evaluation is not possible because
of major differences in program objectives, design, and operation.&quot;[66]

<p>

Brandt's reservations are evidenced in key studies cited in the
NAS report. For example, the New Haven study is based on a mathematical
model using six independent variables to predict the rate of infection.
The unreliability of any of these variables invalidates the result.

<p>

The New Haven study includes key assumptions. For example, it
assumes that any needle returned by a participant other than the
one to whom it had been issued had been shared and that any needle
returned by a participant to whom it had been issued had been
unshared.[67] Both assumptions are suspect.

<p>

More than half (60 percent) of the New Haven participants dropped
out. Those who remained in the program were most likely motivated
to protect themselves from infection and the drop-outs likely
continued in their high-risk lifestyles.[68]

<p>

The Yale study fails to consider the seroconversion rates in addicts
and also relies on self-reporting by addicts, a group not known
for reliability.

<p>

Additionally, most NEPs provide a host of services which account
for some of the reported &quot;success.&quot; Outreach programs
without needle exchange have been shown to have some effect.

<p>

Dr. Janet Lapey, a medical doctor, studies NEPs for Drug Watch
International, a worldwide anti-drug organization.[69] She critiqued
NAS's report, saying:

<p><ul>

<li>It downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts. Some
resort to prostitution to fund their addiction. After all, non-needle
using crack addicts have high incidence of HIV.

<p>

<li>It cites a NEP study that had no increase in heroin use by
young users. This is not surprising given that NEPs and drug treatment
programs are usually populated by older drug users.

<p>

<li>It fails to interview neighborhood residents near NEPs to
see whether they approve of the effect of these programs.

<p>

<li>It trivializes the drug problem and provides no solutions
other than NEPs.

<p>

<li>It does not cite studies that measured HIV seroconversion
rates, the only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

<li>It does not measure whether drug use rises in NEP service
areas.

<p>

<li>It gives credibility to pro-needle studies and claims that
anti-needle studies are lacking. She says this biased use of statistics
is analogous to the tobacco companies using statisticians to support
their claim that smoking does not cause cancer.

</ul><p>

James L. Curtis, director of the Department of Psychiatry, Harlem
Hospital Center, wrote to New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
to recommend against NEPs. Curtis said, &quot;On the unproved
assumption that these programs prevent the spread of AIDS, addicts
are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with
illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding
the needle exchange program. Indeed the addict is partially financed
in continuing this self-damaging behavior.&quot;[70]

<p>

Finally, Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix House
Foundation, a drug treatment organization, said, &quot;I don't
think we have any data yet that is compelling that needle exchange
is making a difference.&quot;[71]

<p>

<center><h3>POLICY DILEMMA</h3></center>

<p>

California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have
authorized state-funded NEPs. He explained, the &quot;[r]eal question...is
whether the hoped-for reduction in needle-transmitted HIV infection
justifies sending a mixed message that will threaten to undermine
the credibility of all society's other anti-drug efforts -- especially
those preventive education efforts aimed at dissuading young audiences
from choosing to engage in drug use.&quot;[72]

<p>

The NAS agrees with Wilson's reservations. The report says, &quot;The
long-term effects of these programs on the level of illicit drug
use in communities are not yet known.&quot;[73] It acknowledges that
&quot;the act of giving a needle to an IDU has a powerful symbolism
that has sparked fears about the potential negative effects of
NEPs.&quot;[74]

<p>

Wilson recognizes the hyperbolic nature of a pro-needle policy.
&quot;If we are going to demand that young people exercise personal
responsibility,&quot; Wilson explained, and &quot;if we say that
they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, [then]
what are they to think, when in the next breath we give formal
sanction to a project which facilitates drug use?&quot;[75]

<p>

Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) opposes NEPs. He has said,
&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse, not to find
a cleaner, safer way to do it. Sure, IV drug abusers put themselves
at risk of AIDS through sharing needles and, certainly, we want
to slow its spread, but there are better ways than giving addicts
needles to do their drugs.&quot;[76]

<p>

Former national drug czar William Bennett agrees. NEPs are rejected
because they &quot;may also confound a community's anti-drug efforts
by implicitly condoning the intravenous use of illegal drugs.&quot;[77]

<p>

Lee Brown, who resigned as President Clinton's drug czar last
December, said the Office of National Drug Control Policy &quot;can
find no compelling reason for the administration to depart from
existing federal policy regarding needle exchange...[It] is neither
an adequate substitute for drug treatment nor a preferred means
of entry into drug treatment.&quot;[78]

<p>

Dr. Moses, chairman of the NAS panel, claims that NEPs &quot;often
result in more referrals to drug abuse treatment.&quot;[79] Evidence
to support this statement is minimal.

<p>

Most addicts in treatment are there because of a run-in with the
criminal justice system, not because of a run-in with an NEP.
According to Dr. Lapey, only 16 percent of NEP participants voluntarily
enter treatment.[80]

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the NAS panel, Dr. Herbert
D. Kleber and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, claim that the news media
have exaggerated NAS's findings and that NEPs &quot;are not the
panacea their supporters hope for....We personally believe that
the spread of HIV is better combated by the expansion and improvement
of drug abuse treatment rather than NEPs, and any government funds
should instead be used for that purpose.&quot;[81]

<p>

A myth associated with NEPs is that there is a long wait for treatment.
But according to Rosenthal, treatment candidates are not turned
away without help. There is a four-week waiting period for in-patient
treatment, but all candidates for admission are placed into a
&quot;day care&quot; program until such time as beds become available.
The &quot;day care&quot; unit lasts eight hours a day, and patients
can receive AIDS education and counseling.[82]

<p>

Rosenthal says that the greatest HIV threat among heterosexuals
is from sexual contact, not dirty needles. Clean needles will
not modify sexual behavior in the IDU. He explains that in the
New Haven study, fewer than a third of the participants employed
safe-sex practices most of the time.[83]

<p>

Dr. David Williams of the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research says that NEPs raise important ethical and moral
problems. &quot;People can be morally compelled,&quot; said Williams,
&quot;to support a lesser harm [drug abuse] in order to overcome
a greater harm [AIDS].&quot;[84]

<p>

In response to this philosophy, Rep. Rangel said, &quot;Supporters
of free needles may have their hearts in the right place, but
they have overlooked some very important considerations. These
people should enlist in efforts to expand comprehensive treatment
and rehabilitation services. Better to stop needle use altogether.&quot;[85]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO NEPS ENJOY?</h3></center>

<p>

The DPF and the NAS report say that the public favors NEPs. They
site a 1994 survey of 1,001 Americans by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C., which showed that 55 percent
favor implementing NEPs to reduce the spread of diseases such
as AIDS.[86]

<p>

The NAS report also profiles 23 other surveys with mixed results.
A 1988 <I>CBS News/New York Times</I> national poll found that
only 40 percent of Americans favor giving injection drug users
sterilized needles to slow down the spread of AIDS. A 1989 Media
General/<I>Associated Press</I> national poll found that half
of all Americans favor giving needles to addicts given the promise
that it will slow down the spread of AIDS.[87]

<p>

To measure America's commitment to NEPs, pollsters should set
a better context for the needle question. Perhaps the pollster
should ask, &quot;Would you support giving clean needles to drug
addicts to slow the spread of HIV, if you knew that this policy
shift might increase illicit drug use among America's youth?&quot;
Most likely, a majority of Americans would answer &quot;no.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES?</h3></center>

<p>

There is ample evidence that NEPs contribute to serious social
consequences for affected communities. For example, Regina Policastro,
an editor for a small Boston newspaper, wrote about her experience
with an NEP client. On November 11, 1991, &quot;a woman, having
received a state-provided free needle, engaged in prostitution,
and overdosed right in front of Policastro's child in her yard.&quot;[88]
Police did nothing because the woman had an authorized needle
identification card.

<p>

The plentiful supply of free needles has created a rogue practice.
The <I>Boston Herald</I> reports that Boston police were on the
lookout for a junkie who obtains allegedly AIDS-tainted needles
from a local NEP and then sells them for use as weapons. An unidentified
Boston officer overheard schoolkids say, &quot;It's better than
a gun because a gun you can do time for.&quot;[89] Similar scares
are common among New York City commuters.

<p>

Reverend Steve Peterson, pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church
in Madison, Wisconsin, expressed grave concern that Madison's
NEP -- which is only 250 feet from the school -- will put his
parish elementary school children at risk. He explained, &quot;Our
concern is that the needle exchange violates the spirit of the
drug-free zone.&quot;[90]

<p>

Milt McPike, a Madison high school principal, said, &quot;I have
a lot of concerns about stuff like that [NEPs] near schools.&quot;[91]
His job is to protect children, and their welfare must be balanced
with the need to control HIV among drug addicts.

<p>

Nancy Sosman knows all too well the problems NEPs bring to a community.
Sosman is a member of the Coalition for a Better Community, a
New York City citizens group opposed to NEPs. Since the Lower
East Side NEP began, she says, &quot;We've seen an increase in
dirty syringes on our streets, in our school yards and in our
parks....There has been a dramatic increase in the public display
of injecting drugs.... Brazen addicts shoplift, loot and steal
to buy drugs.&quot;[92] Sosman says that there are no controls on
the number of syringes given to an addict at the NEP and in fact,
she has seen NEP participants sell their syringes to buy drugs.
Even &quot;exchange workers have been photographed selling needles
away from the NEP.&quot;[93]

<p>

New Haven Police Chief Nicholas Pastore supports NEPs. Pastore
told ABC's Catherine Crier, &quot;The thing that I feel good about
is that that heroin addict is not preying on society, is not killing
somebody, not banging somebody on the head, not breaking into
your or my home. They're getting help....&quot;[94]

<p>

That's not Nancy Sosman's observation. She says that the NEP participants
fan out into her neighborhood &quot;to buy drugs, use drugs, sell
drugs and steal to get money for drugs. Our local police will
never be able to stop the trafficking of illegal drugs.&quot;[95]

<p>

Curtis contends that NEPs are bad medicine. &quot;The police make
no attempt to arrest addicts even though it still is illegal to
possess and inject illegal drugs. The drug dealers flock to these
neighborhoods in order to sell drugs which are openly used even
in broad daylight. These neighborhoods experience dramatic deterioration
with a corrupting influence on many candy stores, newspaper stands
and grocery stores. The sidewalks are littered with used and bloody
needles, syringes and empty vials of crack cocaine. Furthermore
some addicts make a business of selling these needles to purchase
other drugs such as cocaine which they prefer.[96]

<p>

Curtis continues, &quot;Addicts commonly support their habit by
selling drugs to other addicts, by recruiting new addicts, and
by prostitution or by exchanging sex for drugs, all of which behavior
contributes to spread of the AIDS virus.&quot;[97]

<p>

NEPs &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order,&quot; the Harlem
doctor says. &quot;They are poor medicine and poor public health
practice. In fact, these programs constitute a reckless experiment
with human beings, totally unregulated by research guidelines
ordinarily applied to protect human subjects from potentially
dangerous research.&quot;[98]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

On April 2, 1995, Saudi Arabia beheaded three drug smugglers.
A little earlier, Singapore did the same.[99] There are no NEPs in
Riyadh and few addicts on Singapore's streets. Neither country
has an AIDS epidemic.

<p>

If America seeks to reduce drug use, it must stop coddling addicts.
Drug abusers need treatment, not encouragement to keep injecting
deadly drugs. Although AIDS will kill some, most will die from
drug overdoses or other high-risk behaviors.

<p>

Congressman Rangel tells public officials not to fool themselves
about NEPs. &quot;Can police honestly enforce laws against people
who use 'government-issue' needles when the government is the
very source of the tool to commit the offense?&quot;[100]

<p>

The growing needle exchange debate is really about drug legalization.
Pro-drug forces have nurtured a cadre of scientists and others
to give their fight the appearance of legitimacy. But they have
yet to satisfy the strict, scientific requirements set forth in
the law.

<p>

Before the federal government boards this <I>Titanic</I>, it should
sponsor research like that suggested by former Secretary of HHS
Sullivan or even embrace some of Dr. Lurie's recommendations for
methodologically-sound NEP studies. Then, if the evidence satisfies
the requirements of Congress, the lifting of the funding ban could
be reconsidered.

<p>

In the meantime, missteps with the NEP policy could lead the nation
down a tragic path. NEPs provide no guarantee to solve the AIDS
epidemic nor stop the drug scourge.

<title>THE IMPACT OF ROMER v. EVANS</title>

<p>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF <i>ROMER v. EVANS</i></h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

On May 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
Colorado's Amendment 2 to the state constitution, which had prohibited
the state and local jurisdictions from adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to minority protection statutes.  The amendment, approved by a
majority of voters in 1992,  was drafted after several Colorado
cities -- Denver, Boulder, Aspen and Aurora -- had enacted statutes
adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the list of protected
civil rights, thus affording homosexuals a vehicle to use civil
rights law in discrimination claims.

<p>

Amendment 2's sponsors viewed this &quot;special&quot; protection
to homosexuals as a threat to those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong and not a valid category for heightened protection heretofore
reserved for genuinely-disadvantaged minorities.

<p>

In a 6-3 ruling,[1] the court disagreed, saying that Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution because the state could not prove a &quot;rational
basis,&quot; that is, a &quot;legitimate legislative end&quot;
for denying homosexuals &quot;the possibility of protection across
the board.&quot;  Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier
ruling of the trial court and the Colorado Supreme Court in striking
down Amendment 2.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS RULING?</h3></center>

<p>

It sweeps aside the right of the people to amend their own state
Constitution, at least with regard to homosexuality.  The court,
in effect, said that it, and it alone, will determine which groups
can be considered &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they lose a statewide
ballot issue.  By this reasoning, any state that has outlawed
polygamy has &quot;disadvantaged&quot; polygamists by making it
unlawful for them to enact legalization of polygamy at the local
level.  In his forceful dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia addressed
this particular absurdity:  &quot;Has the court concluded that
the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern
of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality
is not?&quot;

<p>

Homosexual activists now have a guarantee that their opponents
will be prevented ever from rescinding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
laws at the state level.  Homosexual activists can work to get
&quot;gay rights&quot; laws on the books, but no group of voters
is allowed ever to rescind them at the state level.

<p>

The court's decision has not technically created a brand new class
of specially-protected citizens:  homosexuals.  But no other group
has that kind of heightened protection except for those that have
been designated as &quot;suspect&quot; classes in need of special
protections.  No court -- including the current Supreme Court
-- has ever designated homosexuals as a &quot;suspect class.&quot;

<p>

The cultural impact may be greater than the legal implications.
<I>The New York Times'</I> lead headline on May 21 proclaimed,
&quot;Gay Rights Laws Can't Be Banned, High Court Rules.&quot;
Although technically the ruling only applies to state laws that
bar passage of new gay rights laws, <I>Romer v. Evans</I> was
hailed as a repudiation of any efforts to delay consolidation
of the homosexual agenda.  Within hours of the decision, the Supreme
Court's ruling was cited by an attorney in a lesbian parenting
dispute in Florida, who proclaimed that the high court had outlawed
the use of sexual orientation as a factor in child custody cases.
The court did no such thing, but we can expect more of the same
sweeping interpretations to be used to sway a reeling culture
that has been force-fed homosexual propaganda for the past decade.
As Suzanne Goldberg of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
exulted after the decision, &quot;Because the court so clearly
rejected anti-gay sentiment, it plants the seeds for future decisions
rejecting anti-gay decisions in many other areas.&quot;[2]

<p>

<h4>Wasn't this a victory for tolerance of gay and lesbian people?</h4>

<p>

No. Homosexuals have achieved enormous tolerance and are now
seeking state-mandated acceptance of their behavior.  The <I>Romer
</I> decision was a defeat of the Colorado people's desire to create
a level playing field with regard to civil rights.  A majority
of Coloradans passed Amendment 2 so that people who disagree with
the homosexual activist movement would not be subjected to discrimination
in &quot;gay rights&quot; jurisdictions such as Aspen, Denver,
Boulder and Aurora.  As Justice Scalia put it in his dissent,
&quot;The only denial of equal treatment [the Court] contends
homosexuals have suffered is this:  They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution.&quot;  He also
said, &quot;The Court has no business imposing upon all Americans
the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members
of this institution are selected, pronouncing that animosity toward
homosexuality...is evil.&quot;  Note that Justice Scalia did not
say animosity toward homosexuals.  In singling out the behavioral
characteristic in question, Scalia correctly reflected the Christian
view of loving the sinner but hating the sin. The state should
never give preferential treatment on the basis of  behavior that
has been discouraged in all major cultures for thousands of years
and by all major religions.

<p>

<h4>The court cited some previous case law in its decision.  Isn't
this a well-founded ruling?</h4>

<p>

The court, indeed, cited some cases in which legal protections
have been extended to particular groups that are not officially
&quot;suspect&quot; classes but are &quot;identifiable&quot; groups.
But, overall, the opinion was so legally impoverished that it
had to be fashioned, as Scalia remarked,  &quot;so long on emotive
utterance and so short on relevant legal citation.&quot;  The
court's opinion fails to address <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>, the
1986 case in which the court ruled that there is no constitutional
protection for homosexuality.  So if it is legal to criminalize
the act of sodomy, then why can't a state decline to extend special
protections for a class of people whose only defining characteristic
is that they practice sodomy?

<p>

<h4>Doesn't Amendment 2 take away the civil rights of homosexuals?</h4>

<p>

No. It just prohibits the addition of special rights that others
do not have.  As Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;The Colorado Amendment
does not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favored for
many reasons -- for example, because they are senior citizens
or members of racial minorities.  But it prohibits them favored
status <I>because of their homosexual conduct</I>....(italics
in original)&quot;

<p>

In other words, homosexuals were in no danger of losing any civil
rights despite press accounts that incorrectly say that Amendment
2 &quot;strips homosexuals of their civil rights.&quot;  They
just could not gain new rights based solely on their predilection
to practice homosexuality.

<p>

<h4>The court ruled that no rational basis could be found to justify
Amendment Two.  What's wrong with that?</h4>

<p>

Ignoring numerous examples of how &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
protections can be wielded against ordinary citizens, the court
essentially concluded that the Colorado people's sole reason for
enacting Amendment 2 was an &quot;animus&quot; toward homosexuals.
This means the court is calling more than 800,000 Coloradans
&quot;hate-filled bigots&quot; and declaring that they had no
rational basis whatever for approving the amendment.  It also
means that God-fearing people in all major religions who believe
homosexuality is wrong are now deemed to be outside the realm
of decency.  This is a sweeping condemnation of the deeply-held
beliefs of billions of people around the world.

<p>

<h4>The court said that gay rights are not &quot;special rights.&quot;
Why do you say they are?</h4>

<p>

Homosexuals have the same rights all citizens have.  They have
the same redress that all citizens have if they face discrimination.
They want an extra level of preferential treatment that would
allow them to cite their homosexuality anytime they do not get
what they want -- a job, a promotion, whatever.  People who commit
adultery do not have such a right.  People who abuse drugs do
not have such a right.  In fact, nobody else has the right to
insist that their behavior is irrelevant to an employer.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; laws are a massive club with which to beat everyone
else into acceding to homosexuals' increasingly strident demands
for mandated acceptance.  As social critic David Frum writes,
&quot;Antidiscrimination law may invoke the language of rights
and freedoms, but its true function is to shrink the ambit of
freedom in order to promote equality.  The landlady who does not
want to rent an apartment to a tenant whose habits and friends
frighten her; the hardware store owner who wants to hire someone
he regards as trustworthy -- new antidiscrimination rules shrink
even further the liberty of these people to use their property
as they see fit or to hire whom they like.&quot;[3]

<p>

<h4>Can you give some examples of this?</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>In Ontario, Canada, the mayor of Hamilton was personally fined
$5,000 for running afoul of that city's human rights ordinance
that includes sexual orientation.  His crime?  He declined to
issue a special proclamation that the city would celebrate a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;[4] The mayor in no way threatened the rights of
homosexuals, but was personally punished for failing to use his
city office to celebrate homosexuality.

<p>

<li>The Boy Scouts of America have been under severe legal attack
by homosexual activists in states that have &quot;gay rights&quot;
laws.[5] Their crime? They updheld their 80-year-old moral tradition
that bans openly homosexual men from becoming leaders over young
boys.

<p>

<li>In San Fernando, California, Superior Court Judge John Farrell
was told by other judges in 1995 that he should quit his activities
as a parent volunteer for the Boy Scouts or resign from the bench.
His crime?  The Scouts &quot;discriminate&quot; on the basis
of sexual orientation, which is a protected category under California's
&quot;gay rights&quot; law. A proposed judicial rule would also
ban participation by judges in any group that discriminates on
the basis of sexual orientation.  So Farrell's volunteer work
with the Boy Scouts is a violation of  &quot;judicial ethics.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In Seattle, Washington, a small-business employer, Bryan Griggs,
was hauled before the city's human rights board.  His crime?
He allegedly violated the rights of a homosexual employee whom
he had laid off.  The employer did not know the employee was gay.
The employer had had to lay off the entire staff during a downturn.
The employee's claim to &quot;discrimination&quot; consisted
of his employer's playing Christian talk radio on which ads for
the business were running (this constituted a &quot;hate&quot;
crime), posting a letter from a Congresswoman regarding the 
gays-in-the-military issue, and having a note on his desk that he wrote 
to himself regarding homosexuals and adoption of children.  After spending
thousands of dollars defending himself, Griggs saw the case finally
dismissed for lack of substance.[7]  But the point was made to other
employers --  mess with any homosexual employee or would-be employee
and you will be legally harassed.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

In striking down Amendment 2, the court ignored a wealth of case
law, twisted the meaning of the Constitution, ignored the reality
of homosexual behavior, and intervened heavily on the side of
homosexual activism against those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong.

<p>

Justice Scalia summed up the case by writing, &quot;Today's opinion
has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends
to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable
provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive
sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment.  Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

In the face of an increasingly strident homosexual rights movement,
the court has declared war on the beliefs of millions of ordinary
Americans.

<p>

This is the real message of &quot;gay rights&quot; -- affirm what
we do or we will use legal means to harass you.  Americans who
want to stay neutral will soon find that this is a stance that
homosexual activists -- and now the Supreme Court -- will not
afford them.

<h2>STORM CLOUDS OR A DRIZZLE?<br>
A LOOK AT A NEW STUDY ON<br>
CHILD CARE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

The National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) recently released the initial
findings of a new child care study &quot;and fired the shot
heard round the world.&quot;  In this long-term study that plans
to track the effects of child care on children's development
through 7 years of age, the results of phase one rendered a body
blow to mothers choosing to provide full-time care for their babies.
Within days, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> headlines read &quot;Child
Care No Risk to Infant-Mother Ties,&quot; and <I>The Guardian</I>
reported, &quot;Child Care Report Backs Working Mums.&quot;
Meanwhile, mothers here and abroad tried to make sense of a study
that implied &quot;other care&quot; was as good as &quot;mother
care,&quot; at least in terms of a baby's attachment relationship
with his or her mother.

<p>

<center><h3>THE MEANING OF ATTACHMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Just what is meant by the term &quot;attachment?&quot;
In his l969 book <I>Attachment,</I> the late British psychiatrist
John Bowlby wrote about the centrality of the baby's attachment
to his mother which he believed was &quot;the foundation stone
of personality.&quot;[1] Bowlby added that a &quot;young child's
hunger for his mother's love and presence is as great as
his hunger for food&quot; and that &quot;her absence inevitably
generates a powerful sense of loss and anger.&quot;[2] Freud would
agree with Bowlby on the importance of the mother or mothering
figure in the child's early life.  Writing in <I>An Outline
of Psychoanalysis</I>, he described the relationship a child has
with his mother as &quot;unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and strongest love
object and as the prototype of all later love relations -- for
both sexes.&quot;[3]

<p>

The formation of attachment -- or
the emotional bond between a mother and her baby -- is a critical
developmental milestone during the first year of life.  In fact,
psychologists Alan Sroufe and Everett Waters call this enduring
bond a &quot;psychological tether which binds infant and caregiver
together.&quot;[4] From his earliest attachments, first to mother,
then to father, a baby develops a sense of his own worthiness,
conscience, and the capacity for intimacy in later significant
relationships.[5] He also learns -- generally by 12 months of age
-- whether or not he can trust his mother to meet his
physical and emotional needs.  If his mother is sensitive, consistent
and responsive in meeting his myriad needs, he is likely to be
securely attached to her.  If she is unpredictable in her ministrations
or rejecting, then the  mother and her baby will tend to develop
an insecure emotional bond or attachment.

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Just what did the NICHD-supported
scientists discover about the effects of child care on a baby's
attachment to his mother?  The study, which has followed 1,300
families at l0 different sites since 1991, found that child care,
<I>in and of itself</I>, does not harm the baby's emotional
bond with his mother.[6] Indeed, the researchers state that the
type of child care, the quality of care, the number of hours per
week in care and even the age the baby enters care do not create
an insecure attachment.  With this ammunition, the media heralded
the current study as a challenge to, or even  repudiation of,
earlier infant day care research, as well as a blanket endorsement
of child care for employed mothers.  Upon examination, however,
the NICHD study does not quite deliver the broadside to on-site
mothering that the media contends.  In fact, it contains some
important caveats to the central finding that child care neither
helps nor hurts the baby's attachment relationship to his
mother.

<p>

For example, the NICHD researchers
found that if a baby was unlucky enough to have an &quot;insensitive
mother,&quot; then the child care variables mattered.  Thus,
the &quot;dual risk&quot; of an insensitive mother <I>plus</I> 
poor quality child care, <I>or</I> inconsistency of care,
<I>or</I> more than l0 hours per week in care increased the likelihood
that a baby would be insecurely attached to his mother. While
the study did not contain a profile of the insensitive mother
(whether she was divorced, employed, stressed, and lonely, or
married, at home, financially strapped, and depressed), it did
find, as one would expect, that a sensitive mother who was well-adjusted
psychologically was more likely to have a securely attached child
than her insensitive counterpart.

<p>

The NICHD study also found significant
gender differences in terms of the effects of child care on attachment
security.  Infant boys who spent <I>more than</I> 30 hours per
week in child care were at risk for insecure attachment while
girls who spent <I>less than</I> 10 hours per week in care were
&quot;somewhat&quot; more likely to be insecurely attached
to their mothers.  Psychologist Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State
University, one of the study's researchers, explained these
particular findings this way:  &quot;Separation might prove
stressful for boys, but girls who are at home with mothers extensively
may become too close and enmeshed.&quot;[7] Belsky's interpretation
prompted <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Suzanne Fields to write,
&quot;In other words, mommies who spend a lot of time with their
infant daughters are dangerous to their daughters' mental
health.&quot;[8]

<p>

Additionally, the NICHD study found
that a mother's belief system affected her baby's
attachment security. Those mothers who believed that maternal
employment actually &quot;benefited&quot; their babies'
development placed their children in child care earlier and for
more hours than did those mothers who held &quot;weaker&quot;
beliefs.  Those mothers who felt child care was harmful to their
children but used it anyway tended to have more securely attached
children than their less anxious counterparts.

<p>

How to explain this apparent conundrum?
While some may wonder about the negative psychological implications
of being riven by guilt and anxiety, Belsky suggests, &quot;It
may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and
able to monitor the quality of care.  Being cavalier about the
effects of work turns out to be risky.&quot;[9]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD FINDINGS AND THE ONGOING INFANT DAY CARE 
DEBATE</h3></center>

<p>

Why were the NICHD findings so provocative?
The findings, as <I>The Guardian</I> so aptly stated,
&quot;go to the heart of an enduringly bitter debate&quot;
about the effects of child care on a baby's emotional security
during that critical first year of life.[10] This debate affects
a huge number of American families and touches on an emotion-laden
issue:  How best to raise America's children.  Not only
do more than half the mothers of infants under one year of age
participate in the work force, but in this particular study more
than half of the infants were in some form of child care for more
than 30 hours per week by the end of their first year.[11] In addition,
the NICHD study flies in the face of accumulated evidence since
the early 1980s, which  found that placing a baby in substitute
care, even good quality care, for 20 or more hours per week during
that critical first year, not only increased the baby's
risk of insecure attachment to mother and/or father, but also
was often the harbinger of behavioral and emotional problems later
on.

<p>

<center><h3>EARLIER INFANT DAY CARE RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

For example, in l988 researchers
Jay Belsky and Michael Rovine evaluated the effects of child care
on 491 infants and found that those who experienced 20 or more
hours per week of nonmaternal care during the first year of life
were more likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their
mothers than those who spent less time in care.  In l989,
psychologist  Alison Clarke-Stewart found similar results in
her analysis of 1,247 infants.[12]

<p>

When researchers looked at the long-term
effects of infant day care, they often discovered that early entry
into day care signaled later behavioral and emotional problems.
Evidence from as early as the mid-1970s indicates that children
who began child care during their first year were more physically
and verbally aggressive with peers and adults, less cooperative,
and less able to handle frustrations than those who started care
thereafter.[13] For instance, a l985 study at the University of North
Carolina found that children who entered child care during their
first year were more likely to &quot;hit, kick and push other
children&quot; as kindergartners and first-graders than those
who began care later on.[14] In light of these and other findings,
it is not surprising that a full scale ideological war is in progress,
or that the current study produced such a rousing and widespread
media response.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT REPORT</h3></center>

<p>

As a psychologist who has followed
the child care debate since the early 1980s, what struck me about
the current study were the findings that never made the newspapers,
namely these statistics:

<p><ul>

<li>About 42 percent of male infants were insecurely attached to 
their mothers when they worked more than 30 hours per week.  (This 
is a hefty number in light of proven male vulnerability to psychological 
and behavioral problems).

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their babies with insensitive 
caregivers, 56 percent of the babies were insecurely attached -- an 
obvious double-whammy for the babies.

<p>

<li>If insensitive mothers placed their babies in child care for more 
than 10 hours per week, between 46-48 percent were insecurely attached 
to their mothers.  (Evidence that simply placing a child in day care 
for more hours does not eradicate the need for time with mother, even 
when she's relatively insensitive.)

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their children in more than one 
child care situation, 44 percent were insecurely attached.  (This 
shows that inconsistent care coupled with an unresponsive mother is 
hazardous to attachment security.)

</ul><p>

These statistics gain significance
when we realize that in cross-cultural attachment research using
the Strange Situation-- the laboratory experiment developed by
psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues and used by researchers
in the NICHD study to determine attachment security -- about 35
percent of the infants are insecurely attached to their mothers.[15]
In most of the analyses in the current study, the rate of attachment
insecurity among the children is between 42 and 56 percent.  This
difference is not insignificant when translated into emotional
insecurity in children's lives.

<p>

<center><h3>MALE VULNERABILITY</h3></center>

<p>

The findings about infant male attachment
insecurity are particularly noteworthy since previous research
has found that males are generally more vulnerable than females
to a host of physiological and psychological ills.  Not only are
males more susceptible than females to speech, learning and behavioral
difficulties, but they are three to five times more likely to
have reading problems.[16] In the arena of emotional disorders, more
males than females suffer from night terrors, hyperactivity, and
autism.  Moreover, adolescent males have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia, delinquency, academic underachievement, and suicide
than females.  According to psychologist Dee Shepherd-Look, &quot;Until
adulthood, it is difficult to find a pathological condition in
which the incidence among females is higher than among males.&quot;[17]

<p>

What happens when mother returns
to the work force?  Researchers Belsky and Rovine found that,
in terms of attachment security, if a mother worked more than
35 hours per week during the baby's first year of life,
50 percent of the sons were more likely to be insecurely attached
to their fathers.[18] A 1987 study by P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and
Margaret Owen found similar results.[19] Also, studies of elementary
school children have discovered that boys are more likely than
girls to suffer when mother works outside the home.[20] In light
of earlier and current research, it is reasonable to suggest that
mothers of sons think long and hard about working full-time during
their babies' vulnerable first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THE INSENSITIVE MOTHER</h3></center>

<p>

As for the insensitive mother and
her baby, the NICHD researchers found that high quality child
care did not entirely compensate for a mother's relative
unresponsiveness.  This was the opposite of what they expected
to find.  In other words, if a baby had an insensitive mother,
the researchers hypothesized that it would be better for that
baby to spend more time away from her in the care of a sensitive
caregiver.  But this did not, in fact, prove true.  Instead, if
the insensitive mother worked part-time rather than full-time,
then her baby was more likely to be securely attached to her (65
percent vs. 56 percent secure, respectively).  This finding supports
the idea that high quality day care does not compensate for mother
care, even when a mother is relatively insensitive.

<p>

It's important to pause at
this point and ask ourselves just how many mothers, some of whom
may be  practicing &quot;defensive careerism,&quot; are able
to be genuinely sensitive and responsive to their babies'
cries and bids for attention, particularly if these mothers are
harried or super-stressed by the multiple demands of their lives?
How is a mother to know for sure that she is creating a secure
emotional bond with her baby as she goes off to work for 10-12
hours per day?  Even this study found that working more than 10
hours per week (that's a mere  two hours per day) puts
the child of the insensitive mother at risk for insecure attachment.
Unless a woman is confident that she is a sensitive mother who
is creating a strong, secure emotional bond with her baby, it
may be wise to err on the side of quantity rather than quality
time during the baby's first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA</h3></center>

<p>

A careful review of the NICHD study,
arouses some very real concerns.  First, 20 of the 25 researchers
are women.  Since all scientific study is, to some extent, contaminated
by bias, there is reason to wonder just how many of these researchers
relied on day care for their own children and may, therefore,
have a personal stake in the report's outcome.  In other words,
is the methodology or even the interpretation of the data, in
this instance, subject to serious bias?  When I posed this question
to psychologist Martha Cox of the University of North Carolina,
one of the study's researchers, she admitted, &quot;Most
of us have used early and extensive child care for our children.&quot;
She said that both of her children had been in child care since
they were two months of age.  But she was quick to add, &quot;If
we tried to get value-free researchers, we wouldn't have
anybody doing research.&quot;

<p>

That this issue is not a red herring
is evident in the article written by Dr. Jay Belsky for <I>Zero
to Three</I> in l986 that set off a firestorm among some
of the researchers involved in the NICHD study.  In this article
entitled &quot;Infant Day Care:  A Cause for Concern,&quot;
Belsky not only reviewed disturbing evidence on the effects of
early and extensive child care but admitted that scientists must
struggle to maintain an open mind when it comes to controversial
and emotion-laden issues. He stated, &quot;I am well aware, too,
that my <I>gender</I> and the more or less <I>traditional nature
of my family structure</I> (italics mine) could bias the reading
of the evidence.&quot;[21]

<p>

So how did the NICHD researchers
attempt to control for bias?  While Cox stated that the data were
coded in a central location (The University of Washington in Seattle)
and not by the individual researchers themselves, Belsky told
me in an interview that those who coded  the data knew this was
a study of child care.  &quot;If they erred, they erred on the
side of finding attachment security,&quot; he said.  Then he
added, &quot;If there's bias it could be the readiness
to embrace the finding that kids aren't affected by child
care -- to give the green light to child care.  If this were a
study of cocaine use and researchers found the same effects, who
would say cocaine use doesn't matter?&quot;

<p>

Additionally, the study examined
a mother's attitudes about the &quot;benefit&quot; of
maternal employment on her baby's development and found
that mothers torn by guilt and anxiety were more likely to have
securely attached babies.  Just what are we to surmise from this?
Does this finding imply that it is okay for mothers to be in
turmoil over their employment decisions as long as their babies
are emotionally secure?  As a therapist who works almost exclusively
with women, I would  suggest that it is hardly a positive for
mothers to have their hearts divided.  Over time, guilt and anxiety
tend to produce depression, and no child profits from having a
depressed mother.

<p>

I am also concerned that the NICHD
researchers examined a mother's attitudes when her baby
was one month old.  Mothers often dramatically change their attitudes
toward separation from their babies over the course of the first
six months after delivery.  In my own doctoral research on adult
attachment and attitudes toward employment conducted at Georgetown
University, I interviewed 89 new mothers two to three days after
they had delivered their firstborn infants and then again four
months later.[22] Not surprisingly, I found that over the course
of four months a number of the women had changed their attitudes
about leaving their babies to return to work.  It was not unusual
for them to say that they had fallen in love with their babies
and could not bear to leave them.

<p>

Finally, since much of the attachment
research using the Strange Situation has looked at a baby's
attachment relationship with his parents when he was 12 months
old, and then again at 18 months to track the stability of the
attachment classification, just why did the NICHD researchers
elect to study the babies at l5 months of age? If this &quot;largest,
longest, and most comprehensive study yet&quot; is to challenge
and even repudiate earlier findings, then why not examine the
mother-baby attachment relationship at the usual 12-month marker?
When asked about this, Dr. Cox said, &quot;We were using other
measures at 15 months and so using the Strange Situation then
was optimal for everything.&quot;  She added, &quot;There's
lots of stability (in attachment patterns) in the 12-18 month
range, though there's always a possibility that things
could change developmentally.&quot;  When asked if this difference
in the research design might have affected the study's
outcome, Belsky replied that the researchers had debated this
issue and reached a &quot;compromise solution.&quot;  Yet one
is left with a feeling of nagging doubt.  In the changing world
of infancy and the forging of emotional bonds, do these three
extra months make a significant difference?

<p>

<center><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3></center>

<p>

Whatever questions the study raises,
in the final analysis, it affirms the importance of mothering.
The study shows that  a mother's sensitivity to her baby
is the most significant predictor of attachment security.  While
it is obviously better for a baby to have a sensitive, well-adjusted
mother, even the presence of an insensitive mother is important
for her baby's attachment security.  Moreover, high quality
care does not eradicate a baby's need for extensive time
with his mother even when  she is relatively unresponsive to his
cues and bids for attention.  In fact, for the insensitive mother
and her child, the NICHD  study affirms the value of part-time
over full-time employment.  Additionally, it  found  that a mother's
attitudes toward employment are crucial in terms of her baby's
attachment security.

<p>

But does this NICHD study categorically
endorse &quot;other care&quot; for babies as the media would
have us believe?  Does it relieve the employed mother's
guilt?  Are we to assume that placing babies in early and extensive
child care carries no significant risk?  As we ponder the findings
of the NICHD study, we need to remember that those researchers
have looked at only one aspect of child development -- attachment.
They have yet to examine children's development in terms
of aggression, social skills, health, capacity for empathy or
intellectual competence.  These qualities will be examined when
the children are 3 and 4 years old.  Since aggression is well
established by age 3 and has been one of the long-term effects
of early and extensive child care, the researchers may find that
the insecurely attached children in this  study are more likely
to be disobedient to adults and bully their peers.  Or they may
not.  Unfortunately, it will be several years before we learn
what these early and provocative findings mean.

<p>

As Belsky said when interviewed,
&quot;It's too early to tell. In my early observations,
lots of child care posed a risk factor. In this study, even more
than 10 hours of care was important. It's the most vulnerable
children who are the most adversely affected.&quot;  In terms
of policy implications, he added, &quot;To presume that the
data carry policy implications at this point is to make decisions
after reading the first chapter of a novel.&quot;  Then changing
his image, Belsky said, &quot;The study shows it's drizzling
now.  It could be a cloud cover or it could be the leading edge
of a storm. We just don't know.&quot;

<p>

As we await later results, we would
do well to look beyond the realm of social science research  to
the cultural landscape where we find other evidence -- disquieting
evidence -- that also merits our consideration.  The indicators
are that children in this country are not faring well.  Increasingly,
we read about acts of rage and violence committed by young children
-- children seemingly without a conscience.  For example, a 6-year-old
boy was recently arrested in Richmond, California, for the attempted
murder of a 6-month-old baby.  (Ironically, his mother works in
a child care agency.)  In Englewood, Colorado, a 10-year-old boy
is being held for fatally beating a 19-month-old girl he was babysitting.
In Lucerne Valley, California, two boys and girls, ages 11 and
12, were arrested for attempting to murder their teacher.[23] Whence
this anger and rage?  How can we begin to understand such violence
in the hearts of some of our nation's children except in
the context of their intimate parental attachments?

<p>

As we continue to make our daily
decisions about how best to rear our very young children and attempt
to understand the results of  scientific study, it may be that
we are doing so, not in a drizzle or even in a storm, but in the
all-too-quiet eye of a hurricane.

<h2>FEDERAL DRUG WAR<br>
IGNORING GREAT ALLY:<br>
FAITH-BASED TREATMENT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Treating addicts is an important part of the nation's drug war.
When abusers are in treatment they aren't committing crimes, and
after treatment some never return to their formerly destructive
ways. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of addicts seek treatment,
usually as part of their punishment, and treatment programs are
limited. More significantly, the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs.

<p>

Faith-based drug treatment programs consistently produce the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country. In spite of high success
rates and zero cost to taxpayers, the government has often stiff-armed
these programs.

<p><ul>

<li>The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) tried
to shut down faith-based Victory Outreach, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts. Outreach founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;[1] Garcia claims a 70 percent success rate
for his privately funded program, while government programs cure
less than 10 percent of their clients and cost hundreds of dollars
per day. He explained, &quot;We believe that sin is the reason
why people take drugs....We believe that the drug addict is a
slave to sin, not to drugs. We believe that drug addiction is
a spiritual problem, and that Jesus Christ is the solution.&quot;[2]
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, &quot;Freddie Garcia has achieved
results that are almost unheard of....All too often the bureaucracy
has tried to put folks like Freddie out of business because they
don't have a Ph.D., or they don't fill out the paperwork right...instead,
they run very inexpensive neighborhood programs that feel more
comfortable to people on the street.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>Teen Challenge of South Texas was almost shut down by TCADA.
Like Garcia's organization, Teen Challenge is a faith-based program
with cure rates of 70 to 85 percent.[4] Teen Challenge has been successfully
treating drug addicts since its founding in 1958. TCADA said that
to get a treatment license Teen Challenge must employ psychiatrists,
masters of social work, certified counselors and other professionals.
It must also embrace a &quot;medical&quot; model for treatment of drug abuse
which presumes that addiction is a disease.[5] But in contrast, Teen
Challenge views addiction as a sin symptomatic of a life out-of-touch
with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Under a &quot;religious&quot;
model, drug addiction is viewed as eminently curable through the
teachings of Christ.

</ul><p>

Robert L. Woodson, Sr., founder and president of the National
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, says faith-based programs
aren't looking for government funds. They &quot;just [want] to
be left to do [their] Christian work...but...officials...insist
you've got to be certified by the state and comply with rules,
like having a 36-inch door rather than a 34-inch door....The government
officials cling to their regulations, and kids who might be rescued
are sleeping in crack houses or under...bridges.&quot;[6]

<p>

Faith-based programs may not work for everyone, but they are part
of a diverse range of programs fighting addiction. That's why
on May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George W. Bush set up a task force
to study how faith-based community service programs can further
help. The 17-member task force's goal &quot;is to identify ways
that Texas can create an environment where faith-based organizations
will flourish and meet the needs of people in crisis with focused
and effective aid,&quot;[7] said Bush. The task force includes Victory
Outreach's Freddie Garcia and J. Herbert Meppelink, the executive
director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the entire nation showing how 
financially-strapped governments can encourage faith-based programs that 
have a long history of meeting critical needs. Unfortunately, the faith 
community and government regulators often disagree over the nature of 
the problem.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT</h3></center>

<p>

There are two major schools of thought about the root causes of
drug addiction. Some argue that it is a disease and should be
treated as such. Others say drug addicts are people whose lives
have gone wrong.

<p>

Many treatment specialists would agree that drug use leading to
addiction is a moral choice and that long-term abuse has physiological
implications. After all, smoking the first marijuana cigarette
or snorting the first line of cocaine is a choice, and there is
medical evidence that increased abuse can lead to addiction which
can have serious, disease-like consequences.

<p>

Hiring a prostitute is analogous to using illicit drugs because
both actions begin with a moral choice and both may cause serious
damage. The sex customer makes a moral decision by hiring a prostitute,
and as a result he may contract a sexually-transmitted disease
(STD) and contribute to crime and to the destruction of his family
and reputation.

<p>

The sex offender can be treated for his disease (the STD), but
unless something is done about his morally-based decision-making
mechanism, he may continue to engage in high-risk and morally
depraved behavior. He needs help to heal both his sexual disease
and his decision-making mechanism.

<p>

Drug addicts also need help with the adverse health consequences
of abuse and with making moral choices. But not everyone agrees
with the dual nature of addiction and its treatment.

<p>

At least one government agency adheres to the disease model. Since
its establishment in 1974, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) has been the lead federal agency for drug abuse research,
looking for causes and effects of drug abuse. It oversees 90 percent
of all funding for drug addiction research nationwide such as
medication research and the new and noninvasive positron emission
tomography (PET) technology which makes it possible to see where
illicit drugs affect the brain. NIDA says that drug addiction
is &quot;a complex disease that can be successfully addressed
by scientific research.&quot;[8]

<p>

There are many non-government treatment specialists who agree.
David E. Smith, a longtime treatment expert and founder of the
Haight Asbury Free Clinics in San Francisco, says that the medical
protocol of his clinics is &quot;the study and treatment of addictive
disease, characterized by the compulsive use of drugs, often with
major physical, psychological and behavioral consequences....Anybody
is liable for addiction, although some are more liable than others.
If your father is an alcoholic, then your son has a four times
higher probability of developing the disease.&quot;[9] This view
suggests that alcohol addiction is genetically predisposed, an
as yet unproven theory.

<p>

Gabriel G. Nahas, professor of anesthesiology at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, writes in <i>A
Manual on Drug Dependence</i> that drug dependence is &quot;[r]eversible
and transient at first...[but] after repetitive drug use&quot;
addiction becomes &quot;irreversible and lead[s] to brain pathology
[disease].&quot;[10]

<p>

One of the classic rationales for labeling addiction a disease
is that it encourages abusers to seek help because there is a
lessened sense of guilt. The fact, however, is that most people
in treatment are there because of a run-in with the law and not
because of a desire to go straight. Unfortunately, the disease
approach allows abusers to ignore or explain away their moral
accountability, and consequently addicts perceive themselves as
victims.

<p>

There is a vast but often unheralded faith-based treatment community
that disagrees with the disease model. They argue that addiction
is a reflection of underlying moral or spiritual problems. Teen
Challenge, the largest faith-based treatment network with 120
centers nationwide, argues that addictions are a &quot;manifestation
of larger problems brought about by sin and self-centered attempts
to find meaning and fulfillment in life....When one does not have
a personal relationship with Christ's person, [he] has profound
emptiness that is often filled with misguided and self-destructive
efforts to achieve happiness.&quot;[11] Faith-based treatment will
be discussed in detail later, but first consider a profile of
American drug treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Many in the medical profession have embraced the disease model,
and this has influenced the available treatment modalities. Psychiatrists
are the primary caregivers for addicts and their manual, the American
Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), defines
substance dependence (addiction) as a disease. The DSM describes
addiction by the following symptoms: (1) compulsion or loss of
control; (2) tolerance, withdrawal reactions and using the drug
to avoid or interrupt withdrawal reactions and (3) impairment and 
preoccupation with the drug to the exclusion of all pleasures and activities.[12]

<p>

Addiction disease is most often treated using one or more of the
following modalities: detoxification, pharmacological treatment,
therapeutic communities, chemical dependency treatment programs,
and outpatient, drug-free treatment like 12-step programs.

<p>

Detoxification is the process of withdrawal of the drug under
supervision. Unfortunately, most detoxified addicts soon return
to the drug if other support treatment is not provided.[13]

<p>

Methadone maintenance is the most popular pharmacological treatment
for heroin addiction. There are at least 110,000 Americans enrolled
in government-sanctioned methadone programs lasting perhaps 12
months or longer. Methadone maintenance substitutes one addiction
(heroin) for another (methadone) requiring doses once a day. It
prevents withdrawal symptoms and stabilizes the addict. Methadone
patients live more productive lives than heroin addicts.[14] A 1991
NIDA-sponsored study of six methadone programs found that 82 percent
of subjects who left treatment relapsed within a year.[15]

<p>

There are a number of alternatives to methadone such as Naltrexone
and Buprenorphine. NIDA recently developed and the Food and Drug
Administration approved a longer-acting variant of methadone,
levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM). It needs to be taken only once
every 72 hours. There are other drug regimes for alcohol addicts
(antabuse) and cocaine addicts (amantadine, bromocriptine and
fluphenthixol decanoate).[16]

<p>

There are more than 500 residential therapeutic community (TC)
programs accommodating up to 15,000 patients annually. These programs
are primarily publicly funded. Seventy-five percent of the patients
have arrest records and are unemployed. TCs provide a strict environment
with group therapy where former addicts are the counselors. Drug
abuse is considered a disease of the emotions, and the patient
needs to be resocialized. Patients remain in residence up to a
year.[17]

<p>

Chemical dependency treatment programs differ from TCs in the
kind of patients, the length of the program and the level of professional
control. The Betty Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation
is an example where management and housekeeping are in the hands
of paid professionals and workers. Patients pay (hundreds of dollars
per day) for the treatment, stay for about a month and receive
care directed by a medical and mental health team. These facilities
care for about 10,000 people annually.[18]

<p>

Finally, outpatient drug treatment is the most common modality.
It includes 12-step programs which are not physician run and rely
on personal faith. Many people who have gone through other programs
will participate in a 12-step group for long-term help. The process
involves admitting powerlessness, seeking help from God, praying
that God will remove shortcomings, making a moral inventory, seeking
forgiveness, making amends, and helping others. Drug abstinence
is the goal, and participants are expected to attend meetings
daily.

<p>

<center><h3>THE DRUG TREATMENT INDUSTRY</h3></center>

<p>

The drug treatment industry can't meet the demand. The 1996 National
Drug Control Strategy claims that there are 11,800 specialty drug
abuse and alcoholism treatment facilities (both public and private)
for 7.1 million Americans who need treatment. But in 1994, only
1.85 million of the most severely addicted actually received treatment.
Most (62 percent) addicted Americans are men and employed (51
percent) with incomes (55 percent) less than twice the poverty level. 
Their lives are marked by criminal behavior, they rely on welfare assistance,
they lack health insurance, and they tend to be young (many under
age 18).[19]

<p>

Much of the recent public sector treatment growth has been within
the judicially-controlled population. In 1993, an estimated 944,208
people under custody of correctional agencies were also clients
in a drug and or alcoholism treatment program.[20] Of that number,
17 percent (160,573) were in non-government-funded treatment programs.
Most of the government (87.2 percent) and private (94 percent)
clients were in outpatient treatment.[21]

<p>

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most common &quot;treatment&quot;
modality. In 1995, there were 50,671 known AA groups and 1,150,447
national members.[22] These numbers do not include other 12-step programs
such as Narcotics Anonymous, Al-A-Teen and at least 629 Christian-based
programs.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TREATMENT COSTS</h3></center>

<p>

Public-sponsored drug treatment is very expensive. The federal
government will spend $5 billion in 1997 treating mostly 
economically-strapped and criminal addicts.[24] A 1992 National Drug and 
Alcohol Treatment Utilization Survey found 945,000 clients involved in 
federally-funded drug abuse treatment. Most (87 percent) were treated as 
outpatients.[25]

<p>

Federal treatment dollars have grown substantially over the past
five years. From 1989 to 1994 federal drug treatment funds increased
119 percent (or $1.3 billion), but the number of persons treated
has declined while the treatment demands have risen.[26]

<p>

Federal funding of treatment programs generally lacks strict accountability.
In 1996, there were 13 federal agencies that allocated treatment
funds to the states using a variety of mechanisms.[27] A percentage
of those funds are siphoned off for administrative costs at each
government level beginning in Washington, D.C.

<p>

Consider the funds California received from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) last year.
[SAMHSA is the source of 30 percent of federal funding for drug
abuse treatment and prevention.[28] ] The state took 5 percent for
administrative costs then negotiated with each of the 58 counties
which are responsible for providing treatment programs. But there
is no accountability mechanism. Perhaps that's why the state government
hired the University of California to study whether publicly-funded
treatment programs work. The report is due next year.[29]

<p>

<center><h3>DOES TREATMENT WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

Determining treatment success can be difficult. The National Drug
Control Strategy lists six treatment success measures: reduced
crime, reduced drug use, reduced domestic violence, reduced behavior
at risk for the AIDS virus, increased days of employment, and
positive change in social values and networks.[30] These indicators
are difficult to measure especially among unreliable addicts.

<p>

A common criticism of drug treatment programs and a good indication
of success is the high rate of addict recidivism. Repeat treatment
is very common and may be attributed to the addict not getting
the appropriate help in the first instance. &quot;There is no
single appropriate treatment for addiction,&quot; says Herbert
D. Kleber, the director of the Division of Substance Abuse, College
of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, &quot;any more
than there is for diabetes, hypertension or depression. These
populations are diverse. Some need medication, some need psychological
help, some need lifestyle change. It is critical to match the
individual with the appropriate treatment.&quot;[31]

<p>

Perhaps Dr. Kleber's warning explains why so many abusers drop
out of treatment. AA has found, for example, that 88 percent of
members drop out within a year, and only 20 to 30 percent remain
abstinent for five or more years.[32]

Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, one of the nation's
two largest residential drug-treatment organizations, says that
30 percent of residents drop out within the first six weeks and
about half make it through the first year.[33] Most therapeutic communities
like Phoenix House see only 10 percent of their patients complete
the program.[34]

<p>

Finishing Phoenix House's comprehensive 18- to 24-month program
is good insurance against relapse. Rosenthal claims that 90 percent
of his graduates are still working and law-abiding five to seven
years later and that 70 percent stay drug-free.[35]

<p>

Rosenthal sees drug abuse as a symptom of a deeper personal disturbance.
He explains, &quot;We have two years to teach industrial-strength
values to those most likely to resist them -- only two years to instill the 
social competence, self-respect, trust in other people, and optimism about 
the future that the addict's community and family did not.&quot;[36]

<p>

Large treatment outcome studies have found mixed &quot;successes.&quot;
The Drug Abuse Research Project Survey (DARPS), a 12-year follow-up
of heroin addicts admitted to methadone, residential, or outpatient
drug-free treatment began in 1969. It found that 83 percent of
the patients had been treated more than once by the end of the
survey and 74 percent had taken methadone at some time. The Treatment
Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) followed 10,000 abuse patients
three and five years after treatment. Most (95 percent) of individuals
in residential treatment reported more than minimal drug use before
treatment and a substantial reduction after treatment. Additionally,
of those who reported illegal activity before treatment, 97 percent
reported no illegal activity during treatment and more than half
(57 percent) reported a decrease in depression after treatment.[37]

<p>

In 1994, there was a California study of 1,900 addicts in treatment.
The study found that it wasn't necessary to complete the treatment
to yield a savings. Each day of treatment yielded a financial
return to society. Specifically, it was estimated that for 150,000
treated addicts which cost $209 million, the state saved $1.5
billion in reduced social costs, primarily crime.[38]

<p>

The effectiveness of drug addiction treatment is inconclusive.
But we do know that the best results come from intensive, long-term
programs that involve multiple modalities that target the addict's
specific problems.[39]

<p>

<center><h3>NO TREATMENT OFTEN BEST</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that there is a high rate of recovery among addicts
even without treatment. Heroin addicts typically break the habit
in 11 years, and half of all alcoholics free themselves without
outside help.[40]

<p>

A study of self-treated alcoholics found that more than half (57
percent) said they simply decided that alcohol was bad for them
and nearly a third (29 percent) said health problems, frightening
experiences, accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.[41]

<p>

A study of heroin addiction among American soldiers who fought
in Vietnam is most revealing. Two to three years after returning
from Vietnam, despite extremely high rates of addiction, they
were no more likely to be addicts than comparable civilians.[42]

<p>

The Vietnam study found that many soldiers were described as heroin
addicts in order to fit the mold of a drug treatment program.
These people had so many other problems, originating before the
addiction, that the label &quot;addict&quot; is little more than
a convenience, and &quot;treatment of drug abuse&quot; is an inadequate
description of their needs.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>A CASE FOR FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

There is room for faith-based programs to compete in the treatment
arena, especially given the poor showing by most publicly-funded
programs. After all, faith-based programs rely on the addict's
relationship with God as a primary treatment modus operandi, and
that appeals to many Americans.

<p>

The typical faith-based drug program is structured like the therapeutic
community approach. Both use former addicts as counselors, seek
to resocialize the addict and usually last for one year. The primary
difference is the faith-based program's philosophy. It claims
that a relationship with Jesus Christ provides meaning and direction
for life which is key to a healthy body, mind and spirit.

<p>

In 1996, a <i>USA Today</i> poll found that 56 percent of Americans
believe that faith helped them recover from an illness.[44] Herbert
Benson, author of <i>The Relaxation Response and Timeless Healing:
The Power and Biology of Belief</i>, supports the faith-healing
connection. &quot;To put it simply,&quot; Benson said, &quot;we're
wired for God...We're the only species that knows it's going to
die and has a belief in something beyond. We have a tremendous
healing capacity if we can tap into what I call the 'faith factor.'&quot;[45]

<p>

Dr. Dale Matthews, an associate professor of medicine at Georgetown
University, reviewed 212 medical studies examining faith and health.
He found three out of every four studies showed health benefits
for patients with &quot;religious commitments.&quot;[46]

<p>

Similar results are found in drug-related studies. In a review
of 20 published studies, 19 (95 percent) showed that religion
plays a positive role in preventing alcoholism. A strong religious
commitment was found to be a consistent characteristic of those
who have not used illicit drugs.[47]

<p>

A study in the <i>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</i>
found that faith-based addiction treatment programs are superior
to non-faith-based programs. The study concluded that patients
who attended faith-based programs were much more likely
(45 percent to 5 percent) to report abstinence from opium-based
drugs like heroin for one year after the program. The study which
was funded by NIDA also found that faith-based graduates were
subsequently three times more likely to be married and far less
likely to be on either parole or probation.[48]

<p>

While the average American is influenced by religion, mental health
care professionals are far less likely to be so inclined. Three
of every four Americans agree with the statement, &quot;My whole
approach to life is based on my religion.&quot; Only 33 percent
of psychologists, 39 percent of psychiatrists, 46 percent of social
workers and 62 percent of marriage and family therapists agree.
Given these statistics, it is easy to understand the secular bias
of these health professionals who have great say over the type
of care given a patient and the type of programs approved by government
health care advisors.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Most drug treatment doesn't work well and where it does work,
one size does not fit all. A diversity of treatment alternatives
to include low cost taxpayer-free and faith-based programs must
be available.

<p>

Pope John Paul II endorses the church's role in drug treatment.
He spoke to the Italian Federation of Therapeutic Communities
labeling drug abuse a symptom of &quot;a culture starved of genuine
values.&quot;[50] He said the church should have tremendous leverage
in addressing drug addiction.[51]

<p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich supports faith-based programs.
&quot;We need to get back to one-on-one missionary work,&quot;
said Gingrich.[52] &quot;We are in the business of changing and saving
people, not maintaining them in their decay. If you don't start
with a faith-based approach, then you haven't started anything...if
you're not improving your life every day, then you're decaying.&quot;[53]

<p>

There are practical reasons for supporting private or community
faith-based alternatives -- such as cost. Taxpayer-funded residential drug
treatment costs far more than many faith-based and taxpayer-free
programs. The 1994 California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment
found that taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment cost $61.47
per person per day and experienced high recidivism.[54] In comparison,
Victory Outreach costs about $25 per person per day and enjoys
very low recidivism.[55]

<p>

The dramatic differences between taxpayer-funded programs and
faith-based programs possibly explains why Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.)
told a Senate hearing on the issue of faith-based programs, &quot;I
believe there are people and groups in America with answers,&quot;
people who are &quot;winning the war on poverty and addiction,
one individual at a time.&quot;[56] He supports their active role.

<p>

Addicts need to be taken off drugs and resocialized. Some are
violent offenders who deserve jail, and others can once again
become productive citizens after help from a diversity of programs
including the Phoenix House, Victory Outreach, The Betty Ford
Clinic and Teen Challenge.

<p>

Government shouldn't try to fight the drug war alone. Rather,
it should focus on supply reduction and push prevention and treatment
efforts down to the community level where programs can be tailored
to local needs.

<p>

The local faith community will play a vital role in prevention
and treatment. After all, the church gives people faith and hope
that there are ultimate meaning and purpose of life. It gives
man answers to great questions of life. It establishes a system
of moral duties which have worked. It also gives direction to
public opinion and provides the basis for social order.

<h2>REPORT ON THE 40TH SESSION<br>
OF THE UNITED NATIONS'<br>
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF<br>
WOMEN</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Ellen Lukas</i></center>

<p>

From March 11-22, the 40th session of the United Nations' Commission
on the Status of Women (CSW) met to discuss and approve worldwide
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s
agenda for women's empowerment, &quot;aimed at removing all obstacles
to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private
life.&quot;

<p>

The CSW, a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), was established in 1946 to prepare recommendations for
the promotion of women's rights and on problems requiring attention
in that field. It meets yearly and has a membership of 45 countries.[1]
The Commission was the preparatory body which produced the Fourth
World Conference for Women in Beijing last year.

<p>

In comparison to the Beijing conference, the March CSW session
was a businesslike and uneventful meeting. Since the real work
of hammering together the platform was finished at Beijing, the
CSW session included no demonstrations, no protests, no brawls.
At least 4,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had gone
to Beijing, but they were not prominent or numerous at this meeting.
Even though the Commission had sent out special invitations asking
all NGOs who had gone to Beijing to come to this meeting, there
were perhaps 200 in the gallery on opening day, and on following
days, never more than a dozen.

<p>

Representatives of the Women Count Network lobbied diligently
for recognition of women's unwaged (i.e., house-) work. Bella
Abzug, co-founder of the Women's Environment and Development Organization
(WEDO), who addressed the Commission on its opening day, argued
for accreditation of a permanent roster of women's NGOs to participate
in CSW meetings, much as the Rio Conference NGOs participate in
meetings of the Commission on Sustainable Development. (This question
will be discussed further at the Economic and Social Council meeting
this month.)

<p>

Generally, government delegates to the CSW session were not the
fiery old-line feminists whose presence sparked the Beijing conference.
This time, for the most part, they were the sober permanent mission
representatives who usually serve on the General Assembly's Second
(Economic) Committee. They saw the issues which the session was
considering primarily through a Second Committee prism and were
more interested in economic questions than in ideological ones.
They also pressed for the use of Second Committee methods at the
session, such as the adoption of &quot;Agreed Conclusions&quot;
rather than resolutions in their final statements.

<p>

The meeting began with two days of general debate in which representatives
of the U.N. system gave their views on various aspects of the
organization's implementation of the document. Each of the 45
delegates on the Commission paid the expected tribute to &quot;gender
mainstreaming&quot; and spoke about his or her nation's programs
on behalf of women.

<p>

U.N. system speakers included the Secretary-General's advisor
on gender issues (Rosario Green, a Mexican woman diplomat); the
new director of the Division for the Advancement of Women which
supplies support services for the CSW; a senior advisor from UNICEF;
and a women's advisor from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). They talked about the impact of the Beijing Platform
for Action on the CSW agenda -- new programs for girls' education
and health, including strategies against early and unplanned pregnancy,
and plans to deal with sexual violence against refugee women.
A human rights specialist from the World Health Organization spoke
on violence as a public health issue, as well as of women's &quot;right
to health.&quot; (He specified &quot;reproductive rights as formulated
by the [Cairo] International Conference on Population and Development,
as a fundamental human right in all circumstances.&quot;)

<p>

When their turn came to speak, the G77 (a bloc of 137 developing
countries, including China) demanded that implementation of the
Beijing document place more emphasis on development. The representative
of the ultra-liberal 15-nation European Union reminded the session
that, &quot;The human rights of women include their sexual rights,&quot;
and mentioned recent resolutions adopted by the EU on integrating
gender issues into programs of development aid. The EU also managed
to get in a few paragraphs supporting sex education for adolescents,
and total support for the Cairo and Beijing Platforms.

<p>

In her opening speech in the general debate, U.S. representative
to the Commission Linda Tarr-Whelan promised that America &quot;is
very serious about the implementation of the Beijing Declaration
and Platform for Action, and about fulfilling our particular commitments
announced at Beijing....It is our goal to institutionalize as
much change as possible.&quot; In establishing the President's
Interagency Council on Women, she said, the U.S. has for the first
time created a formal mechanism to deal with the follow-up to
a U.N. conference.[2]

<p>

<center><h3>THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUES</h3></center>

<p>

From March 13-18 the U.N. staged a series of what it called &quot;interactive
dialogues&quot; (discussions between panels of experts chosen
by the U.N. Secretariat, and delegates to the Commission) on three
out of the 12 &quot;areas of concern&quot; mentioned in the Beijing
document. The three subjects covered at the current session were
&quot;Women and Poverty,&quot; &quot;Women and the Media,&quot;
and &quot;Child and Dependent Care, Including the Sharing of Work
and Family Responsibilities.&quot;

<p>

The Women and Poverty discussion ran for two half-day sessions,
March 13 and 14. A Secretariat report which formed the basis for
the discussion stressed the &quot;gender dimension of poverty,&quot;
noting that women constitute a majority of the world's poor, and
contending that they experience poverty differently from men,
because historically women have been disadvantaged in terms of
obtaining education, training and access to employment opportunities,
productive resources and capital.

<p>

Experts for this panel came from five U.N. system agencies: UNIFEM,
UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA (the U.N. Fund for Population) and the World
Bank, as well as from various governmental and non-governmental
grass-roots organizations. To remedy poverty among women, the
panelists urged the adoption of policy agendas which would assure
women of employment and income. They also agreed on the need for
an integrated approach to poverty which would go beyond provision
of money and creation of jobs to address gender discrimination
and violence. Arguing for the value of reproductive health services
for adolescent girls, UNFPA, which insisted that &quot;education
together with reproductive health are the most important means
of empowering women,&quot; was the only expert in this dialogue
to even mention &quot;reproductive health.&quot;

<p>

In the exchange that followed, more than half the delegates had
harsh words for the World Bank, whose insistence on painful structural
adjustment policies, they said, was hurtful to women.

<p>

The U.S.'s Tarr-Whelan managed to turn her intervention in the
dialogue into a sort of Clinton campaign speech praising the administration's
concern for the poor in America and slamming Congress for neglecting
them. &quot;There is now a polarized debate in the U.S. on poverty,&quot;
she said. &quot;There is not a sufficiently shared societal concern.
In the past, we have focused on a transfer payment method. But,
increasingly our social safety net is being dismantled. Poverty,
especially among children, is increasing....We are, however, trying
new strategies and methods.&quot; Among them: efforts (encouraged
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) to expand business ownership
development for women and new forms of community-based credit
as well as stronger initiatives to recoup child support payments
from &quot;deadbeat dads.&quot; Tarr-Whelan's mention of the commitments
the U.S. had made at Beijing and Copenhagen made her one of the
very few delegates to bring up &quot;family planning&quot; in
connection with poverty.

<p>

The CSW discussion of &quot;Women and the Media&quot; took place
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, the 13th and 14th. The
Secretariat report on the subject noted that &quot;the representation
in the media of violence against women, particularly sexual violence,
has increased tremendously in past years&quot; as have the production
and marketing of sexually explicit material, which is now a business
with established links to forced prostitution and trafficking
in women. The report also complained that in many countries women
lack access to new communications technologies. It also objected
to the fact that the media often portrayed women unfairly and
urged efforts to combat gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The expert panel on the subject, which included speakers from
governmental organizations, non-commercial media and the U.N.,
generally ignored the report's statements on violence and sexually
explicit material. They denounced the stereotyping of women and
praised women journalists covering the former Yugoslavia for contributing
to the focus on systematic rape during armed conflicts.

<p>

Discussion of &quot;child and dependent care, including the sharing
of work and family responsibilities&quot; ran on March 15 and
March 18. It was arguably the dialogue which will spark the largest
amount of subsequent discussion and have the greatest impact on
the family in the future.

<p>

The Secretariat report on the subject argued that &quot;women
carry a double burden of work and family responsibilities which
reinforces inequality between the sexes.&quot; More and more women
worldwide are going into the labor force all the time, and becoming
heads of households. At the same time, said the report, women's
home responsibilities do not diminish, but they continue to grow
as fewer and fewer women have the support of a spouse or of a
large or extended family to help them care for children or other
dependents. This leaves women crowded into a narrow range of low-status,
low-paying jobs from which they are unable to escape.

<p>

Panelists for child and dependent care were an odd choice for
putative child care experts. Along with a speaker from the Norwegian
Ministry of Family Affairs and representatives from the International
Labor Organization, UNICEF and the Population Council, there was
a woman from the China Family Education Association and a family
policy bureaucrat from Romania.

<p>

The Norwegian spokeswoman said that her government had recently
begun recruiting men for child care and -- although there had
been recent major court cases in Norway dealing with men's abuse
of children -- the government believed that &quot;more experience
by men of such caring and nurturing experiences will actually
prevent violence.&quot; The Population Council said that &quot;though
there is great (and not unfounded) suspicion of non-family 'center
care' in traditional societies,&quot; demand for such centers
could be created among the public by linking child care centers
up with health and vaccination programs, as well as with family
planning services. The Chinese expert gave a cheerful report on
child care in the People's Republic -- three meals a day, naps,
playtime and the possibility of Monday-to-Friday boarding facilities
from 3 years of age and upwards. The Romanian representative inveighed
against her country's &quot;repressive patriarchal tradition.&quot;

<p>

In the subsequent delegate exchange with the panelists, nearly
every country (including even Sudan and Iran) reported that it
already provided some kind of day care to help free employed mothers
from family burdens.

<p>

<center><h3>CSW RESOLUTIONS AND AGREED CONCLUSIONS</h3></center>

<p>

With the close on March 18 of the &quot;dialogue&quot; section
of the CSW session, delegates settled into smaller working groups
to negotiate the resolutions or &quot;agreed conclusions&quot;
they proposed to adopt on the issues under review. They also met
from time to time in full session to hear statements from those
delegates who had not spoken in the general debate and from concerned
NGOs.

<p>

By Thursday night, agreement had been reached on all the amendments
proposed for addition to the resolutions. By the evening of Friday,
March 22, more than a dozen resolutions were adopted.

<p>

Among them was a very commendable statement condemning &quot;traffic
in women and girls&quot; and calling for ratification of conventions
on trafficking in persons and for law enforcement against trafficking
networks and sex tourism. Another good resolution condemned &quot;violence
against civilian women and children in areas of armed conflict
and hostage taking,&quot; and a third worthwhile resolution condemned
&quot;violence against women migrant workers.&quot;

<p>

The resolution adopted on the subject of &quot;women and poverty&quot;
stressed female empowerment as essential to poverty eradication,
and urged governments to develop education and training programs
to promote women's employment and make legislative reforms concerning
the right of inheritance, land ownership, natural resources, technology,
decision-making, and protection during unemployment and maternity.
International financial organizations, including the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, were urged to assist.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;women and the media&quot; asked, among
other things, for an end to gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;child and dependent care, including sharing
of responsibilities between men and women,&quot; asked governments
to recognize the importance of making changes in societal attitudes
toward the work that women do at home, to promote increased participation
of men in family responsibilities including domestic work and
child care, to provide for family leave, and to adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value (akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; debate that has taken place in the past decade in
the United States).

<p>

Several resolutions were adopted which were specifically related
to the implementation of the Beijing document. A draft resolution,
prepared for consideration by the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), approved the CSW role in overseeing implementation of
the Beijing document as well as a schedule naming which of Beijing's
&quot;critical areas of concern&quot; will be considered in future
CSW sessions. A resolution on &quot;mainstreaming the human rights
of women and girls&quot; urged that the issue of the human rights
of women and girls be integrated into all U.N. policies and programs.
A resolution commented on the U.N.'s &quot;System-Wide Medium
Term Plan for the Advancement of Women,&quot; describing how the
Beijing Platform for Action is to be incorporated throughout all
the work plans of the U.N. system, including education programs,
technical assistance programs, and contacts with governments,
academic and other institutions and NGOs. Another resolution dealing
with drafting an &quot;Optional Protocol to the Convention on
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)&quot; asked
for a report on the views of members of the international community
on the feasibility of initiating a reporting procedure on violations
of women's rights in states which are parties to CEDAW.[3]

<p>

<center><h3>THE FAMILY AS AN ISSUE AT THIS SESSION OF THE CSW</h3></center>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have children 
at some time in their lives, the family remained a non-issue at the 
March 11-22 CSW.

<p>

There was almost no mention of the family in the 
Secretariat reports which formed the basis of the dialogues, in the 
panelists' speeches, in the delegates' comments, or in the adopted 
resolutions -- not even a mention of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights' definition of the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot;

<p>

And, of course, there was no suggestion that the family has value
or that it contributes anything meaningful to society. There was
no discussion of how to preserve the family now that it is under
siege, or how to shore it up.

<p>

In the poverty discussion and elsewhere, women were seen primarily
as a labor force, with success as workers and economic decision-makers,
recipients of credit, and consumers of child and elder care assigned
as their highest goal.

<p>

Listening to the speakers at the dialogues and at the negotiations
for the resolutions, one had the impression the traditional family
had already almost totally disappeared. The great question with
regard to human relationships was how to reassign and rearrange
the roles of men and women in whatever kind of partnership in
which they are now living.

<p>

<center><h3>CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE AS DISCUSSED AT THIS SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

There were really two questions approached in the discussions
and resolutions on child and dependent care. The first was the
question of how to ease the double burden women must bear in attending
to jobs as well as to family responsibilities. In the resolution
the Commission adopted on child care, measures suggested included
redistribution of family responsibilities, provisions for parental
leave from work,[4] arrangements for part-time work, more provision
of child care services, and provision of elder care and support
to persons with disabilities. (No reference was made to relieving
the burden of taxation on families with children. The Beijing
Platform for Action focuses on getting women out of the home and
into the labor force. It has no interest in bolstering the family
by tax relief or any other means.)

<p>

The second problem connected
with the question of child care was how to put a market value
on the unpaid work that women do in connection with the home.
Last September the 1995 Human Development Report published by
UNDP estimated that there is $16 trillion worth of unpaid work
done around the world annually, some $11 trillion of it by women.
Unpaid work is an issue about which women's groups staged silent
vigils at Beijing, complaining that lack of remuneration greatly
contributes to women's low social status. If the value of women's
unpaid work were to be counted, they say, it could greatly affect
inheritance rights and divorce settlements, as well as access
to credit and other issues determined by economic contributions.

<p>

At this CSW session, the question of unpaid work was complicated
by introduction into the discussions of the radical feminist terms
&quot;productive&quot; and &quot;reproductive work.&quot; &quot;Reproductive
work,&quot; used in contradistinction to &quot;productive work&quot;
(work outside the home for pay), was applied to such tasks as
&quot;child-bearing, breast-feeding, child-rearing, cooking, housework
and transmission of values [and also, in some places] fetching
water and collecting wood.&quot; The Secretariat report on child
care noted that &quot;reproductive work does not normally carry
with it the entitlement to an income, and those who bear responsibility
for it must take on additional work to generate income of their
own.&quot;

<p>

After making some attempt to wrestle with the terms &quot;productive&quot;
and &quot;reproductive&quot; work, delegates finally dropped the
terms altogether. In the resolution on the subject, they referred
to work connected with the home simply as &quot;unremunerated
work&quot; and urged the recognition of its social and economic
importance. They also urged that governments adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value, akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; proposals that gained some notoriety in the United
States in the 1980s.

<p>

Although the Beijing Platform for Action (Para 68b) urges that
national and international statistical organizations should: &quot;Devise
suitable statistical means to recognize and make visible the full
extent of the work of women and all their contributions to the
national economy,&quot; including women's contribution in &quot;the
unremunerated and domestic sectors,&quot; CSW delegates decided
to skip the question of how governments might go about putting
a value on this unpaid work.

<p>

There were, however, some suggestions for devising a methodology
to include data on unpaid work in calculations of GDP[5] and other
indicators, put forward by some of the more imaginative NGOs and
by their supporters at INSTRAW (a small U.N. research institute
on women's issues). Essentially, this methodology involved conducting
&quot;time-use&quot; studies, paid for in developing countries
by development institutions and other donors, to count the time
women spend doing household tasks (including those they do simultaneously,
such as caring for children and cooking). Governments could then
factor estimates of the value of this work into the &quot;satellite&quot;
(or parallel) accounts that some countries compile as annexes
to their figures on paid work.

<p>

The present U.S. administration has shown some interest in the
issue of unpaid work by women. Hillary Clinton's speech at Beijing
made a critical reference to the lack of recognition of unwaged
work by governments, and during this CSW session's poverty dialogue,
U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan announced that &quot;the Departments
of Labor and Commerce are undertaking consultations to determine
how best to construct reliable estimates of the value of unwaged
work in the U.S.&quot;

<p>

Last year, apparently there was a bill in the Congress (H.R. 966,
The Unremunerated Work Act) which called on the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to conduct time-use surveys of the unremunerated work
done by women and men in America, so that its value could be included
in the GDP. The AFL-CIO Executive Council in February 1995 issued
a statement on the bill, declaring that reliable statistical data
about unpaid work in the U.S. is essential to provide for the
well-being of large numbers of women, children and families in
the U.S.

<p>

<center><h3>THE UNITED STATES AS AN ACTOR AT THE CURRENT CSW SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

Since the purpose of this meeting was only to approve implementation
of provisions already adopted at Beijing, the U.S. was generally
less assertive at the CSW session than it has been at other recent
U.N. meetings. Even the NGOs at this session complained that the
U.S. did not cheer them on as enthusiastically as it has in the
past.

<p>

The U.S. was on its good behavior at this session even with its
recent opponents. At a negotiating meeting on the poverty resolution,
for example, when the G77 and China proposed an amendment calling
on governments to provide day care centers in very poor neighborhoods
&quot;in order to facilitate the training and integration of mothers
into productive work&quot; (&quot;a fin de facilitar la capacitation
incorporacion de las madres al trabajo productivo&quot;), the
Holy See Observer suggested to U.S. delegates that they might
not really want to back a paragraph implying that motherhood was
a &quot;non-productive effort.&quot;

<p>

The U.S. said they would &quot;take care of it&quot; and did.
When the text resurfaced the next day, it asked for day care centers
&quot;to facilitate the training of mothers for their entry into
paid employment.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SWIMTEP</h3></center>

<p>

According to the schedule of meetings adopted in the resolution
on the &quot;Follow-up to the FWCW&quot; (that is, the Beijing
conference), the CSW will not get around to holding a &quot;dialogue&quot;
on the women's health section of the Beijing document until 1999.
Since the recent CSW session was not specifically concerned with
the issues of women's health or women's rights, there was no talk
about sexual orientation, no open mention of abortion, and no
attempt to trip the Cairo language wire on &quot;reproductive
rights.&quot;

<p>

Proceedings at the session were, in fact, so bland and bureaucratic
that one had to remind oneself that the session had quietly approved
the System-Wide Medium Term Plan for the Advancement of Women
(also known as &quot;SWIMTEP&quot;), which gives details of how
the Beijing Platform for Action --- the complete Platform for
Action, including issues relating to women's health and reproductive
rights -- is already being implemented in all U.N. policies and
programs. This is an enterprise that could radically affect society
for years to come.

<p>

To mention only a few of the tasks assigned by SWIMTEP to U.N.
entities on behalf of women's health and reproductive rights:

<p>

UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF and UNESCO will report to the U.N.'s Population
Division on promotion of women's reproductive rights worldwide;

<p>

WHO and UNFPA will provide technical guidance to governments in
the area of fertility regulation, by providing technical guidelines
on specific methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives;

<p>

WHO and UNICEF will develop practical methodologies in the area
of women's reproductive health in support of governments' efforts
to implement reproductive health programs;

<p>

The U.N. system will prepare training and counseling materials
for NGOs, women's groups and health providers, and provide special
programs for girls and boys regarding responsible sexual behavior.
These programs will be run by WHO, UNESCO, UNDP, U.N. Volunteers,
the Center for Human Rights, U.N. Department for Development Support
&amp; Management Services, UNICEF and UNFPA. N.B. These provisions
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.

<p>

How much effect the U.N.'s Beijing health strategy will have on
national health policies throughout the world depends to a great
extent on what resources will be available for the enterprise.
The U.N.'s budget problems must be factored into consideration
of this issue. The U.S. has not paid its assessed debt of $699
million for this year's regular U.N. budget, which, among other
things, covers operating expenses of the CSW. In addition, there
are the cuts which Congress made recently in U.S. voluntary contributions
to U.N. agencies (a total of only $285 million for such agencies
as UNICEF, UNDP and the Population Fund this year, compared to
$374 million in 1995). This will certainly be a limiting factor.

<p>

Speaking of finances for the implementation of the Beijing Platform,
SWIMTEP notes that funding &quot;will have to be identified from
all sources and across all sectors....Mobilization of additional
resources, both public and private, including resources from innovative
sources of funding, will be necessary.&quot; Speaking to this
question at the current CSW, U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan reminded
the U.N. that the U.S. had warned it at Beijing that it expected
the Platform to be implemented &quot;within existing resources, through
reordering priorities and thinking creatively.&quot;

(3/6/96) of the results of a recent U.S. Government survey
on the use being made of the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993.  This law says that companies with more than 50 employees
must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers needing
to care for seriously ill parents, spouses, themselves, or their
children.  The survey showed that only 2 percent of U.S. workers
have availed themselves of the provisions of the law since it
was enacted; 59 percent of leave-takers said they did so to attend
to their own health, not to take care of elderly parents, sick
spouses or children.

TOWARDS THE OFFICE</h2>

<p>

The good news is, being a &quot;family-friendly&quot; corporation
is now considered <I>in</I> by professionals in the field of human
resources.  The bad news is, this new family-friendliness does
<I>not</I> include empowering one parent to support a family on a
single income. Instead, what it means is domestic partner benefits,
on-site day care, business support for intrusive &quot;home visit&quot;
schemes such as Missouri's &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program,
and helping new mothers &quot;return to work&quot; (the words
imply that child-rearing is a leisure activity) as soon as possible.

<p>

This is the conclusion this writer reached after attending a two-day
conference entitled, &quot;The 1996 Work and Family Conference:
Is the Family a Corporate Stakeholder?&quot;  The conference
was sponsored jointly by the Conference Board, a leading organizer
of business conferences, and the Families and Work Institute,
a grantee of the U.S. Department of Education.  The conference
was underwritten by Johnson &amp; Johnson and IBM, and was held
in New York City in late April.

<p>

<center><h3>COMPANIES THAT &QUOT;GET IT&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

The first panel of speakers was called &quot;Family Values in
a Corporate Context.&quot;  Andrew D. Sherman, vice president
of the benefits consulting firm The Segal Company, said his company's
criterion for family benefits eligibility is &quot;two adults,
not related by blood, in a relationship that is non-platonic,
financially linked, and intended to be permanent.&quot;

<p>

Providing such benefits has been very inexpensive, in part because
only about 1 percent of Segal's employees have chosen to enroll as 
domestic partners.  According to Sherman, this makes domestic partner 
benefits a &quot;win-win&quot; for his company: Its gets praise for its
enlightenment at very low cost.

<p>

The only question, he asked, is why more companies do not offer
such benefits? Sherman's answer was that many CEOs don't &quot;get
it.&quot;

<p>

Detailing other companies policies, Sherman noted that Xerox includes
extended family members as well as domestic partners.  Lotus offers
domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples <I>only,</I> on
the theory that opposite-sex couples 
can acquire those benefits by marrying.  Lotus's aim, Sherman
said, is to be known as &quot;the employer of choice for talented
people of all descriptions.&quot;  Kodak offers benefits to same-
and opposite-sex couples, because of its self-image as a &quot;progressive
and innovative corporation,&quot; Sherman said.

<p>

Wendy Starr, a consultant in the field of &quot;work-family programs,&quot;
and a former human resources executive at Xerox, said the human
resources field has matured from the shuffling of benefits paperwork
to &quot;support of the total person.&quot;  This mandate is all
the more extensive, she noted, because in the field of  benefits,
notions of legal marriage are giving way to &quot;a variety of
significant people.&quot;

<p>

Xerox, whose CEO &quot;gets it,&quot; defines &quot;extended family&quot;
for benefits purposes as those who reside in the employee's home,
are financially dependent on the employee, are not eligible for
benefits elsewhere, and are related to the employee as domestic
partner (same- or opposite-sex), parent, parent-in-law, grandparent,
grandparent-in-law, or child.  (Missing from the list is &quot;spouse,&quot;
but one assumes that not even Xerox has taken the step of affirmatively
penalizing the married.)

<p>

Perhaps the goal of &quot;supporting of the total person&quot;
which many of today's human resources specialists are suggesting
is overreaching.  Laura Nash, who teaches business ethics at Boston
University's School of Management and School of Theology, suggested
the possibility at one time, in her book <I>The Nanny Corporation</I>.
In her Work and Family Conference presentation this year, however,
Nash seemed more concerned with assuring attendees that she is
not really that far off the reservation.

<p>

What happens in the employee's family, she said, affects the company.
The really &quot;progressive&quot; companies are driven by non-economic
values such as &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;universal access&quot;
-- though she admitted it is difficult to point to shareholder
value created by such policies.

<p>

&quot;You are progressively changing the face of the social fabric,&quot;
Nash told the assembled human resources professionals.

<p>

One could argue that companies should just pay salaries, and not
get into employees' lifestyles, she said, but employers have legitimate
concerns about how employees will spend the extra money.  On the
one hand, conformity and dependence are dangerous, but on the
other, employers want healthy employees, not employees with poor
health and a Porsche.

<p>

Christian C. Kjeldsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice president
of corporate staff, spoke glowingly of his company's on-site day
care centers.  The one at the company's headquarters has 200 children,
and there is a waiting list!  Johnson &amp; Johnson aims to build
to more centers, Kjeldsen said.

<p>

In a stunning illustration of the power of the print media in
elite circles, and an equally stunning illustration of contemporary
corporate values, Kjeldsen noted that the problem of proving the
bottom-line benefits of extensive employee benefits (including
on-site day care) never came up at his company.  The reason? 
<I>Forbes</I> and <I>Business Week</I> ran articles about changing
demographics.  That was all the proof  his company's management
needed to make on-site day care and other benefits a permanent
fixture even through downsizing, &quot;rightsizing,&quot; and
early-outs. In other words, Johnson &amp; Johnson was
building programs to enable mothers to work for them and warehouse
their children, even while it was eliminating programs -- i.e.,
<I>jobs</I> -- that enabled workers to provide for their families
without recourse to day care.

<p>

After a while one sensed that all the cheerleading for &quot;progressively
changing the face of the social fabric&quot; was coming mainly
from the presenters, while the audience had more mundane concerns,
such as getting sanity back into their lives and the lives of
the employees they were supposed to be taking care of.

<p>

Someone from the audience asked Kjeldsen whether all this paternalism
was not perhaps in direct conflict with what they heard at last
year's Work and Family Conference, which focused on the decline
of dependable employment and the consequent need for portable
benefits.  Kjeldsen looked uncomfortable and said that &quot;companies
still have a lot of control over who is and who isn't at a desk.&quot;
Perhaps Kjeldsen's meaning was that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like
many other companies, sees extensive benefits as a recruitment
and retention issue and that the function of those benefits is
to convince prospective and present employees that a corporate
&quot;social contract&quot; still exists, even though none does.

<p>

<center><h3>&QUOT;OUTDATED&QUOT; PERSONNEL POLICIES</h3></center>

<p>

Randall Tobias, CEO of  the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly,
said in the event's keynote address that although some argue that
taking care of the family is not something that should be done
within the walls of the corporation, he disagrees.

<p>

The problem, Tobias said, is that many managers have an &quot;outdated&quot;
view of the family, which is why so many U.S. companies have personnel
policies &quot;based on Ozzie and Harriet.&quot;  Tobias claimed
such a family structure accounts for only 18 percent of employees
in the U.S.

<p>

Eli Lilly has changed with the times, Tobias said.  It is building
an on-site day care center for 220 children.  Its cafeteria prepares
take-home dinners four nights a week.  Other available benefits
include dry cleaning, and a 24-hour counseling service.  &quot;The
child care facility,&quot; said Mr. Tobias, &quot;will benefit
not only the families that use it, but all our employees, stockholders,
customers -- all who benefit from the <I>undivided attention</I>
of our employees.&quot; (Emphasis added)

<p>

Are we perhaps recreating the dreaded &quot;company town&quot;
from a bygone and unlamented era of U.S. labor relations?  Tobias
is not concerned.  &quot;You're kidding yourselves,&quot; he said,
&quot;if you think you can tell employees to leave their problems
at the factory fence.  You cannot hire <I>part</I> of a human
being.&quot;

<p>

Eli Lilly's employees seem to agree.  According to Tobias, the
company's internal surveys show that its employees do not see
the company's policies as intrusive.  They feel they are being
made more productive, and are glad to be part of an effective
corporation.  Human resources today, he said, requires attention
to the &quot;entire lives of our employees,&quot; and its professionals
must help &quot;break down the barriers to change.&quot;

<p>

After lunch, I chose to attend a session featuring Donna Klein,
a human resources executive with Marriott International.  I wondered
if perhaps Marriott's Mormon ownership would lead it toward more
traditional forms of family-friendliness.

<p>

Interestingly, what Marriott is doing is not exactly traditional.
At its headquarters in Atlanta,  Marriott has gotten together
with other hotel chains to establish Atlanta's Inn for Children,
a &quot;family center&quot; for low-income members of the &quot;hospitality
profession.&quot;  It is a 250-slot day care center that also
provides immunization, parent education, and nutrition counseling.

<p>

Marriott has also set up an Associate Resource Line (ARL), which
combines an &quot;employee assistance program&quot; with a 
&quot;case-management approach.&quot;  In other words, the hotel company 
brings the social work profession fully into the private-sector workplace.
In fact, Klein said this decision was made based on the fact
that some of Marriott's managers were spending more than half
of their time on social work rather than with business management.

<p>

In fairness to Marriott, their work force gives them an unusually
pressing need to bring social work into the workplace.  The company
has a high percentage of immigrant employees, many of whom need
help integrating into American society.  For instance, the ARL
has, to date, administered counseling in 15 different languages.
Still, one cannot help but be startled at the breadth of issues
that Marriott now considers to be workplace-related, including
housing, marital problems, and school problems.

<p>

Why have more companies not gone the way of Marriott?  Klein had
a simple explanation:  The wives of their CEO's &quot;don't work.&quot;

<p>

At this session, the audience was on board.  One participant praised
Marriott for having &quot;got religion&quot; on the need to subsidize
&quot;working mothers.&quot;

<p>

&quot;To some extent,&quot; Klein said, &quot;we are just rearranging
our overwork.  Still, better to overwork flexibly than inflexibly.&quot;

<p>

I left that first day remembering an old <I>New Yorker</I> cartoon
in which guests are being announced as they arrive at an ultra-posh
reception.  The butler/herald calls out:  &quot;The Duke and Duchess
of Exxon.  The Earl and Countess of Kodak.  The Marquis and Marchioness
of Glaxo,&quot; etc., etc.  Just as that cartoonist envisioned,
corporate leaders are the aristocracy of today, and they are very
serious about the paternalistic doctrine of &quot;noblesse oblige.&quot;
Whether this is good for the family as institution is another
question.

<p>

<center><h3>NO LONGER SUBSIDIZING THE FAMILY</h3></center>

<p>

A panel on &quot;Corporate Implications of the Fatherhood Debate&quot;
featured William Galston, professor of philosophy and public policy
at the University of Maryland.  Risking the opprobrium of the
mainly-female audience, Galston noted that the surge of women
into the paid work force over the past forty years has coincided
with the replacement of the &quot;military&quot; model of life,
left over from World War II, by the &quot;self-expression&quot;
model.  The result, he said, is that the family is weaker than
ever.

<p>

Galston saw a limited, but real role for the corporation.  It
can ease, but not eliminate, the tension that men feel between
work and home.  Corporate culture should change so that men do
not feel they are endangering their chances of promotion -- or
even of surviving a downsizing -- if they show by their actions
that they take their family responsibilities seriously.

<p>

Kathleen Gerson, professor of sociology at New York University,
was much more optimistic about the state of the family.  Men face
more economic insecurity than before the gender-role revolution,
Gerson said, but that very insecurity gives them the opportunity
to discover that &quot;motherhood and fatherhood are not very
different.&quot;

<p>

Gerson declared that the gender-role revolution is irreversible.
Women in the workforce and &quot;fluidity of marriage,&quot;
she said, are two of the immovable pillars of the new order.

<p>

Those who want to keep corporations out of people's lives fail
to understand those changes, Gerson said.  Companies used to subsidize
an unsalaried caregiver at home by paying the breadwinner (usually
the husband/father) a sufficient salary, she said, but because
of today's  &quot;irreversible&quot; social changes, corporations
must now take responsibility for their employees' whole well-being.

<p>

<center><h3>EMPLOYERS AS TEACHERS</h3></center>

<p>

The conference press kit included a glossy booklet entitled <I>Employers,
Families, and Education</I>, which was produced by the Fatherhood
Project at the Families and Work Institute.  The booklet covers
a variety of topics, including recommendations on how businesses
can provide family-friendly policies such as flextime, working
at home, and paid time-off for parent-teacher conferences.  These
are packaged, however, as ways of  &quot;making family involvement
in learning a goal&quot; and &quot;encouraging employees to get
involved in their children's schooling&quot; -- evidently assuming
that most parents are utterly unconcerned about their children's
education until given a nudge by their employers.

<p>

This assumption is carried forward in many of the specific recommendations
in the booklet.  One section touts an eight-hour &quot;parenting
seminar&quot; created by the U.S. West Education Foundation, and
available for purchase by human resource professionals for use
with their employees.  &quot;Interactive exercises and structured
discussion groups aim to give parents the understanding, confidence,
and skills they need to become positively involved in their children's
education.&quot;  One does not get the impression that parents,
as such, are viewed in a very positive light by the emerging 
corporate-business &quot;partnership&quot; in education.

<p>

The very next paragraph of the Families and Work Institute's booklet
touts the &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program, which, despite
the Orwellian choice of words in its name, assumes that 
parents lack even the most basic skills for bringing up their
children, never mind being their children's teachers, and therefore
need ongoing supervision by social workers.  Here is the entire
paragraph verbatim:

<p><blockquote>

<i><b>Parents as Teachers (PAT).</b> A home-school-community partnership
program designed to support parents of children from birth to
age 5 through home visits by parent educators, parent support
groups, and a referral network.  Established originally by four
school districts in Missouri, PAT is now mandated as a service
in that state, and has been replicated in hundreds of other school
districts around the country.  Scott Paper sponsors PAT in two
communities, IBM sponsors it in five, and Honeywell has adapted
the program for its own employees.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Employers, Families and Education was &quot;developed under contract
to the U.S. Department of Education.&quot;  The same notice specifies
that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Department
of Education, even though Secretary Richard Riley's name appears
on the title page.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

As shown by the above-quoted text, and by many of the presentations
at the Work and Families Conference, it would be a great mistake
to assume that everything that is &quot;private sector&quot; is
necessarily free from bureaucracy, institutionalized patronization,
and a control-mentality.

<p>

While some of the initiatives discussed at this conference are
no doubt helpful and commonsensical, others are intrusive, paternalistic,
and more or less explicitly aimed at undermining the traditional
family by subsidizing alternatives to it.  These are offenses
that we generally associate with the overweening state.  But private
industry is likely to work hand-in-glove with government in the
campaign for direct access to our children, whom industry views
exclusively as tomorrow's employees and consumers.

<p>

Robert E. Allen, CEO of AT&amp;T, says it better than I could
in a quote prominently featured in <I>Employers, Families, and
Education</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We have not traditionally linked the well-being of children to
the success of business or the governance of nations.  Yet increasingly 
we're acknowledging that upheavals in the American family aren't 
self-contained -- they intersect with business and economic circles 
and loop into the social fabric of this nation. As a society, we 
assume a larger affiliation -- one that implies, not just family 
ties, but added obligations.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This view would be less threatening if it were less accurate.
Anyone who recognizes that family breakdown has consequences
beyond the particular family in question deserves applause.  The
problem comes when we reduce those consequences to their impact
on &quot;business and economic circles,&quot; and then imply that 
they signify the failure of the family as such, and a consequent 
need to deploy &quot;a larger affiliation.&quot;

<title>THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE EMPLOYMENT<br>
NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT:<br>
AN UNWARRANTED EXPANSION<br>
OF FEDERAL POWER</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Touted as a logical extension of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act,
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 1863, S. 972) is actually
a radical change in workplace discrimination law. Backers of ENDA
say, without any credible substantiation, that homosexuals need
heightened protection not afforded to other employees in the workplace.

<p>

But ENDA is being brought up now to complicate efforts to pass
the Defense of Marriage Act. ENDA is bad legislation because it:

<p><ul>

<li>Sets the stage for an enormous expansion of federal power
over employers. This violates the principle of federalism embodied
in the 10th Amendment.

<p>

<li>Guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation which could hurt
small businesses most of all.

<p>

<li>Paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference, regardless
of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed. (Remember
Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights Act would
never lead to racial quotas?)

<p>

<li>Prohibits employers from disciplining or taking into account
in any way any sexual activity on or off the job by an employee.

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot; so broadly that all
sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality, are given
special protection and therefore moral status on a par with sex
within marriage.

<p>

<li>Suggests the federal government is officially supportive of
sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals by definition have sex with
more than one person.

<p>

<li>Creates a broad cultural force that rewards and protects sexual
dysfunction at the expense of traditional marriage and family.

<p>

<li>Poses a serious threat to employers' and employees' freedoms
of religion, speech and association. The law would ensure that
employers could no longer take their most deeply held beliefs
into account when making hiring, management and promotion decisions.
This would pose an unprecedented intrusion by the federal government
into people's lives.

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists claim that as many as 84 percent of the American
people support &quot;equal rights in terms of job opportunities.&quot;[1]
Well, yes. Most Americans believe that homosexuals should have
the same rights all employees have -- but no more than that.

<p>

It depends on how the question is asked. When the question is
asked whether homosexuals should have fewer rights, the same rights
or more rights, a majority says they should have the same rights.
A <I>Newsweek</I> poll in May 1996 asked, &quot;Has the U.S. done
enough to protect gay rights?&quot; Fully 66 percent answered
either &quot;done too much&quot; (40 percent) or &quot;done enough&quot;
(26 percent). Only 27 percent said &quot;more effort needed.&quot;
Polls also show that a majority of Americans believe that it would
be wrong specifically to enact new legislation in this area.[2]

<p>

Sometimes, the question is asked during debates, &quot;Do you
think someone should be fired just for being gay?&quot; Most people
would answer &quot;no.&quot; Few people want gays &quot;discovered&quot;
and fired, and most homosexuals can honestly report no real discrimination
against them. But the loaded question ignores crucial facts, such
as how the person's sexuality was made manifest and whether and
how it affected the workplace or even if children are involved
in any way.

<p>

The Boy Scouts have already suffered numerous legal attacks by
homosexual activists, and ENDA would only make their efforts easier.
There is no protection whatsoever in ENDA for professional Scout
employees. Homosexual activists contend that the Scouts would
be protected in their &quot;primary activities&quot; as a volunteer
group,[3] which is possible, but this could be swept aside by an
activist judge.

<p>

ENDA's sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
eliminates any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual
behavior.

<p>

Here are some examples of how ENDA-like policies have already
been or could be abused:

<p><ul>

<li>In Seattle, a CPA referral specialist, Bryan Griggs, laid
off all of his small staff except his wife in 1994. One employee
later charged Mr. Griggs with discrimination and sexual harassment
under Seattle's gay rights law even though Mr. Griggs did not
even know the man was a homosexual. Before he cleared his name,
Griggs spent thousands of dollars defending himself. The homosexual
employee charged that Mr. Griggs had created a bigoted atmosphere
of hatred toward homosexuals because he aired in the office Christian
talk radio on a station on which he had run advertising and kept
a letter from Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) regarding the issue
of homosexuals in the military. The letter from Rep. Dunn was
included in a packet of letters from a variety of public officials,
including President Clinton. Another employee, who also happens
to be homosexual, submitted an affidavit stating that Mr. Griggs
at no time ever created a hostile atmosphere toward homosexuals
nor did he ever harass the other employee in any way. Even the
liberal <I>Seattle Times</I> editorialized that the complaint
represented an abuse of Mr. Griggs' rights as an employer. The
<I>Times</I> wrote: &quot;Now Griggs unfairly faces spending thousands
of dollars in legal fees to defend himself against a problem he
never knew existed. Already, some are calling this a landmark
test. Frivolous is a better name for it. It is a tortured reach
to redefine 'hostile work environment.' It is a scary assault
on the First Amendment.&quot;[4] Such incidents could become common
on a national scale under ENDA.

<p>

<li>In 1991, Shell Oil was fined $5.3 million for dismissing an
executive, Jeffrey Collins, who had used company equipment at
a Shell subsidiary firm, Triton Biosciences, to produce and copy
a flyer advertising a &quot;safe sex&quot; party for homosexual
men.[5] Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Taber ruled that the California
company violated a policy that it would judge employees only on
job performance and not on activities unrelated to work. The ruling
effectively means that California employers like Shell must turn
a blind eye to even the most outrageous outside &quot;activities&quot;
of employees, even when the employee uses company-owned equipment
to promote them. Taber cited a 1979 California Supreme Court ruling
that employees cannot be fired for off-the-job &quot;political&quot;
activities. Promoting &quot;safe sex,&quot; she reasoned, constitutes
a &quot;political&quot; activity. She also made it clear that
Collins' activities were protected not in spite of but because
of his sexual orientation. &quot;The evidence is overwhelming
that homosexual group sexual activity was beyond the pale of conduct
acceptable to the top management of Shell,&quot; she wrote.[6] Taber's
ruling explored, in her words, &quot;the relatively new issue
of how far a corporation may go in demanding that its managerial
staff, in their respective private lives, deport and conduct themselves
in a manner acceptable to and meeting the corporation's concept
of propriety.&quot;[7] By deciding against Shell, the judge ruled
that private companies cannot discourage employees from participating
in homosexual orgies or any other behavior broadly covered under
&quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Loudoun County, Va., Jeffrey Bruton, a teacher/coach at
a public middle school and high school, was found to have appeared
in several hard-core homosexual porn films.[8] Loudoun School Superintendent
Edgar B. Hatrick III said that the teacher would be dismissed
if the allegations are true because, &quot;We believe that teachers
as people who are chosen to be instructors as well as leaders
of our young people, should be exemplary in their professional
as well as personal lives.&quot; He also said he would ask the
state to revoke Bruton's teaching license. Virginia state law
stipulates that a teaching license can be revoked for &quot;conduct
such as immorality, or personal condition detrimental to the health,
welfare, discipline, or morale of students.&quot; Before the school
acted, Bruton resigned and turned in his teacher's license. Under
ENDA, Bruton could have claimed that his &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is nobody's business -- certainly not his employer's -- and that
school officials would be discriminating against him if they even
mentioned it.

<p>

<li>In 1993, a computer software company in California hired a
temporary employee, who turned out to have been a man dressed
as a woman. One of the women who worked at the company suspected
the &quot;woman&quot; was really a man, and she warned other women
that &quot;she&quot; might use the rest room. Many of the female
employees opted to go several blocks away to use the rest room
of a fast-food restaurant. When &quot;her&quot; temporary employment
was at an end, the &quot;woman&quot; applied for permanent status.
The employer, who still did not know the &quot;woman&quot; was
really a man, declined on the basis that &quot;she&quot; was overqualified
for the position and also had &quot;a chip on her shoulder.&quot;
The &quot;woman&quot; sued the company, claiming discrimination
based on &quot;sexual orientation.&quot; The employer settled
out of court in 1995, paying the &quot;woman&quot; $600,000, as
well as incurring $600,000 in legal bills. As a result of this
expensive legal attack, the company immediately laid off eight
employees and has not yet recovered, dropping from more than 50
to 30 employees.[9]

<p>

<li>An electrician at a large company in Michigan recently wrote
a letter to company management politely protesting a visit by
two homosexual clergymen who had presented materials claiming
that the Apostle Paul, The Old Testament's Jonathan and David,
and probably Jesus Christ were all homosexual and that the Bible
never really condemns homosexuality. The electrician's letter
rebutted the theories. A copy of the letter was taken from one
employee's personal mailbox and left in the mailbox of a woman
known for her lesbian activism within the company. She complained
that this constituted harassment because of her sexual orientation.
The man whose mailbox the letter had been in originally was downgraded
in tradesman's status, effectively costing him $3,000 to $5,000
per year in salary. Other employees who helped type the letter
were summoned before Human Resources and disciplined individually.
The man who wrote the letter has been told his job is now in jeopardy
and faces more hearings before the Human Resources Department.[10]

<p>

<li>In Hollywood, an orthodox Jew was working at his desk when
two homosexual colleagues stopped nearby. They discussed openly
and graphically a homosexual porn film that one of them had seen.
The Orthodox Jew, who says he has nothing against homosexuals
but does not approve of homosexuality, asked them politely not
to talk about pornography around him. The two men charged him
with sexual harassment. Apparently, any interference with their
enjoyment of a sexually-explicit, &quot;gay&quot; pornographic
film (even after the fact) constituted disapproval of their &quot;sexual
orientation.&quot;[11]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

ENDA is so broad that any bizarre sexual behavior would be protected.
Under this legislation, if an employer heard that a highly visible
employee was openly flaunting his sexual tastes, having highly
noticeable adulterous affairs, or discussing his taste for pornography
with other employees, the employer would have no recourse. Even
asking about such activities might be construed as sexual harassment
based on sexual orientation. Since courts consistently have found
that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is meaningless without sexual
activity itself, any legislation based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
defends all sexual behavior and declares it to be irrelevant to
the employer and to customers.

<p>

What at first glance appears to be a harmless gesture of 
&quot;tolerance&quot; toward homosexuals in the workplace actually is 
a mighty weapon to be used against employers, other employees who 
believe that homosexuality is wrong, and against the freedoms of 
association, religion and speech. It would distort the concept of civil 
rights by creating an unprecedented behavioral component whose outer
limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

<center><h3>KEY POINTS</h3></center>

<p><ul>

<li>ENDA has nothing to do with the Defense of Marriage Act and
should be judged on its own merits at a later date.

<p>

<li>Americans favor equal rights, not special rights, for gays
in the workplace. Homosexuals deserve the same rights as other
Americans -- no more, no less.

<p>

<li>Senators Kennedy, Jeffords and Lieberman dismiss opposition
to ENDA as mere &quot;prejudice.&quot;[12] If they prevail and ENDA
becomes law, then the biblically-held views of millions of Americans
will be actively suppressed by their own government in the name
of &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<p>

<li>ENDA ought to be called the Government Lawyers Expansion Act,
since it would result in so many opportunities for the use of
lawsuits to expand federal power.

<p>

<li>Legitimate minorities will see their own efforts to ensure
equal treatment undermined by this unwarranted expansion of claims
by a group that in no way shares their history.

<p>

<li>As a group, homosexuals enjoy enormous economic and political
power, and are not disadvantaged the way true minorities have
been.[13] Civil rights laws were enacted to
offset discrimination against African-Americans, but homosexuals
can claim no such victim status as an oppressed, poor minority.
They are trying to hijack a movement for their own advantage.

<h2>THE FACTS ABOUT<br>
TEEN DRUG ABUSE:<br>
WHAT THE SURVEYS SAY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Parents are rightfully concerned about and possibly confused by
the recent flurry of teen drug abuse reports.  The numbers seem
high and appear to be getting worse.  This paper will profile
the latest reports focusing on drug abuse by adolescents (ages
12 to 17).

<p>

The studies found:

<p><ul>

<li>Teenagers in trend-setting California are abusing drugs at
levels that rival peaks more than a decade ago.

<p>

<li>There is a significant downward shift in the number of teens
who perceive drug risks.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among teenagers.

<p>

<li>Parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs can make
a significant difference.

<p>

<li>In 1995, heroin- and marijuana-related emergency room episodes
rose 19 and 17 percent, respectively.

<p>

<li>Most of the rise in heroin abuse is due to increased snorting
and smoking rather than needle injecting.

<p>

<li>Black teenagers are the most affected by the surge in marijuana
abuse (up 195 percent for males and 253 percent for females).

<p>

<li>Nearly half (44 percent) of all high school students smoked
cigarettes at least once last year.

<p>

<li>There is conflicting evidence that cigarettes may or may not
act as a gateway to illicit drug abuse.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>1995 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

On August 20, 1996 the federal government reported that adolescent
drug abuse is rising fast.  Alarms over the drug scourge sounded
across the country.

<p>

Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, warned,
&quot;Drug, alcohol and tobacco use by young people is a poison
in the well of our national future.&quot;  White House Drug Policy
Director General Barry McCaffrey said, &quot;We must not allow
drug use by young Americans to return to the disastrous levels
of the 1970's and early 1980's. That would be a tragedy.&quot;[1]

<p>

The 1995 National Household Survey (NHS) on Drug Abuse found that
an estimated 12.8 million Americans were current illicit drug
users.  In 1992, the rate of past-month illicit drug abuse by
adolescents (ages 12 to 17) reached a low of 5.3 percent. By
1995 it had climbed to 8.2 percent and now it is at 10.9 percent.
That is a 105 percent increase over the past three years.[2]

<p>

The NHS is a representative national sample and has been done
annually since 1971.  Since 1992, the survey has been supported
and directed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), which is part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.

<p>

In 1995, the teen drug of choice was marijuana.  The rate of past-month
use of marijuana jumped 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Since
1992, the rate has more than doubled.

<p>

The abuse of so-called &quot;hard&quot; drugs is especially alarming.
The NHS found that past-month adolescent abuse of cocaine shot
up 166 percent between 1994 and 1995, and LSD abuse rose 55 percent.

<p>

Perhaps more alarming are the number of recent first-time abusers.
Looking back over the past three decades (1964 to 1994), the
number of first-time adolescent abusers (ages 12 to 17) across
many illicit drugs has increased dramatically and especially over
the past four years. Consider the facts.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Since 1991 the number of first time adolescent
abusers has risen 95 percent. Looking back three decades to 1964
there were 4,400 first-time marijuana users while in 1994 there
were 74,200.  That's an incredible increase of 1,600 percent.
<I>(Marijuana First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
1)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. The number of first time adolescent cocaine
abusers has risen 820 percent since 1964 and 127 percent in just
the past three years.  In 1964, there were 1,100 first-time abusers
and 10,200 first-time abusers in 1994.<I>(Cocaine First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 2)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Inhalants</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time inhalant
abusers has increased 98 percent, and the number of first-time
inhalant abusers has increased 11,100 percent since 1964.  In
1994, NHS found that 22,200 teenagers abused inhalants for the
first time.  <I>(Inhalant First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994,
Figure 3)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time
hallucinogen abusers has increased 108 percent and the number
of first-time hallucinogen abusers has increased 2,000 percent
since 1964.  In 1994, NHS found that 23,300 teenagers abused
hallucinogens for the first time.  <I>(Hallucinogen First-Time
Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 4)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time heroin
abusers has increased 320 percent and the number of first-time
heroin abusers has increased 600 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 2,100 teenagers abused heroin for the first time.
<I>(Heroin First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 5)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time alcohol
abusers has increased 38 percent and the number of first-time
alcohol abusers has increased 277 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 171,900 teenagers abused alcohol for the first
time. <I>(Alcohol First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
6)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time cigarette
abusers has increased 16 percent and the number of first-time
cigarette abusers has increased 33 percent since 1964.  In 1993,
NHS found that 125,400 teenagers abused cigarettes for the first
time.  The study found that teenagers who smoked were about eight
times as likely to use illicit drugs and 11 times as likely to
drink heavily as nonsmoking teens.  <I>(Cigarette First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 7)</I>

</ul><p>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, also conducted by SAMHSA, reported
an increase in drug-related emergency room visits.  There were
531,800 drug-related visits last year, and the greatest increases
were attributed to heroin and marijuana-related episodes (up 19
percent and 17 percent, respectively, from 1994).  The most commonly
reported motive for taking a substance was &quot;suicide attempt
or gesture&quot; (38 percent).[3]

<p>

<center><h3>MONITORING THE FUTURE STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Another government-sponsored study found similar teenage drug
abuse trends.  &quot;Monitoring the Future:  A Continuing Study
of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth&quot; is conducted by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.[4] The study surveyed 50,000
8th-, 10th- and 12th- graders from 435 public and private schools
during the spring of 1995.

<p>

The proportion of 8th-graders taking any illicit drug has doubled
since 1991.  Since 1992 the proportion of any illicit drug abuse
has risen 65 percent among 10th-graders and 44 percent among 12th-graders.
The details are outlined below.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Between 1991 and 1995, lifetime abuse among
8th-graders rose 166 percent (from 6 percent to 16 percent). 
Among 10th-graders annual abuse almost doubled from 15 percent
in 1992 to 29 percent in 1995.  Among 12th-graders annual abuse
increased 59 percent from 22 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in
1995. Nearly one in 20 high school seniors was a daily marijuana
abuser.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. LSD abuse continued to rise.  The proportions
reporting abuse were 3 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders respectively. Between 1991 and 1995 annual
abuse rose 76 percent for 8th-graders; 89 percent for 10th-graders;
and 54 percent for 12th-graders. For 12th-graders abuse within
the last month was up 37 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Hallucinogens other than LSD showed
a smaller increase in 1995. The annual prevalence rates for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders were 2 percent, 3 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse rose 136
percent for 8th-graders; 59 percent for 10th-graders; and 14 percent
among 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Crack cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse
rose 129 percent for 8th-graders; 100 percent for 10th-graders;
and 40 percent for 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Annual abuse in 1995 was between 1.1 percent
and 1.4 percent for all three grade levels -- a rise of 57 to
150 percent.  The investigators hypothesized that non-injection
forms of use like snorting and smoking account for the recent
rise.  Many heroin abusers reported only non-injectable use (32
percent, 45 percent, and 57 percent of past-year heroin users
for grades 8, 10 and 12, respectively).

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a
row) was reported by 15 percent of 8th-graders; 24 percent of
10th-graders; and 30 percent of 12th-graders.

</ul><p>

Fewer students report seeing drugs as dangerous.  The risk perception
for marijuana dropped from 79 percent of 12th-graders in 1991
to 61 percent in 1995.  There was also a decline in the perceived
dangers of using crack cocaine, cocaine powder, LSD and heroin.

<p>

Lloyd Johnston, principal investigator of the Michigan study,
blames the lack of information and anti-drug emphasis for the
growing drug problem.  &quot;These newest waves of children entering
adolescence,&quot; said Johnston, &quot;have had less opportunity
to learn about the dangers of drugs than did youngsters who grew
up in the eighties.... During the last three or four years the
amount of public attention paid to the drug problem, and its ravages,
has plummeted.  There are dramatically fewer newscasts on the
subject and fewer anti-drug commercials are getting on the air.&quot;[5]

<p>

Johnston says that most Americans still see drugs as dangerous
but warns &quot;there is a clear erosion in these attitudes and
beliefs, and we conclude that this erosion explains most of the
change in their actual drug-using behaviors.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>TREND-SETTING STATE ABUSE UP</h3></center>

<p>

California has long been identified as the nation's trend setter.
A recent report from that state should shock all Americans.

<p>

On August 26, 1996, California's Attorney General released a new
statewide survey that shows drug abuse rising rapidly.[6] Dan Lungren,
the attorney general, said, &quot;In the late 80's, drug use among
California students decreased.  In the early 90's, it mostly leveled
off, with some warning signs of small increases.  Over the past
four years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in drug use
among students -- back to levels that rival peaks ten years ago.&quot;

<p>

The sixth biennial &quot;California Student Substance Use Survey&quot;
polled public school students in grades 7, 9 and 11. Based on
student reports of drug use within the past six months, it found:

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. More than a third (34.2 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 60 percent
rise in four years.  Nearly half (42.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 46 percent
rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Amphetamine</b>.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of
9th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past six months,
a 227 percent rise in four years.  More than one in ten (10.4
percent) of 11th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past
six months, a 53 percent rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. Nearly one in ten (9.9 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 161 percent rise
in four years.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 33 percent rise
in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Heroin abuse for 9th-graders has jumped from
1.0 percent in the last survey to 2.9 percent, a 190 percent increase
in just two years.  Eleventh-graders have seen a 69 percent increase
in the last four years.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Cocaine abuse among 9th-graders has jumped
78 percent in the last four years.  For 11th-graders it has risen
9 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Most teens have used alcohol in the last
six months (50.3 percent of 7th-graders; 67.2 percent of 9th-graders;
and 75.3 percent of 11th-graders).

</ul><p>

Attorney General Lungren blames parents and the pop culture for
rising abuse rates.  He says some of the parents are abusers themselves.
The glamorization of heroin is the most recent example of media's
drug promotion effort.  &quot;We can look to the advertising business
to spot a trend,&quot; says Lungren. &quot;Companies such as Gucci
and Versace use emaciated, pale models with dark circles under
their eyes, known as the 'heroin chic' look, to sell clothing.
One company goes so far as to have one of its models roll up
his sleeve, as if he is getting ready to 'shoot up.'&quot;

<p>

Lungren called for a &quot;return to the power&quot; of the truth.
&quot;Our national commitment in the 1980s to a cultural discouragement
of drugs with its emphasis on youth prevention and zero tolerance
worked,&quot; said Lungren.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S LARGEST PARENT GROUP<br>
FINDS HIGH DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) announced
that teenagers are using drugs more and too few parents are doing
what they can to prevent it.

<p>

On November 2, 1995, PRIDE reported significant increases in cigarette
and marijuana abuse among students in grades 6 through 12.[7] There
were also rises in cocaine and hallucinogen abuse.

<p>

PRIDE's annual survey, which included nearly 200,000 students,
found the following levels of drug abuse.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana.</b> One third of high school seniors smoked
marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent smoke monthly.  Nine
of 10 marijuana smoking seniors said they started pot smoking
during high school years at ages 14 to 17.  Young blacks are the
most affected by the surge in marijuana abuse.  Use among black
males rose by 195 percent (4.5 percent to 13.3 percent) in the
past four years, and use by black females rose by 253 percent
(1.9 percent to 6.7 percent).

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. PRIDE found a 36 percent increase (3.3 percent
to 4.5 percent) in cocaine use by high school students since 1991-92.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogen</b>. Use has risen 75 percent (4.4 percent
to 7.7 percent) since 1988-89.

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Cigarette abuse has reached its highest
level since PRIDE began surveying.  Nearly half (44 percent) of
all high school students smoked at least once in the past year,
compared with 37 percent in 1988-89.

</ul><p>

PRIDE found that parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs
can make a difference. Drug abuse declined among students whose 
parents frequently discussed drugs with them.  Among high school 
students whose parents &quot;never&quot; talk about drugs, 
one-third (34 percent) smoked marijuana, versus
one-quarter (24 percent) among high school students who said they
talk with their parents &quot;a lot&quot; about drugs.

<p>

Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE, said, &quot;The most effective
drug prevention program in the world -- parental intervention
-- is used far less than we think.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>1996 SURVEY BY PARTNERSHIP FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA</h3></center>

<p>

Drug surveys have consistently shown that abuse rises as perception
of risk falls.  A recent nationwide survey validates this observation.

<p>

&quot;Changes in attitudes drive changes in behavior,&quot; said
Ginna Marston, director of research and strategic development
for Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  &quot;These findings
tell us one thing:  drug use will continue increasing among teenagers
until these attitudes change.&quot;[8]

<p>

In 1996, PDFA announced the results of its annual Partnership
Attitude Tracking Study.  This is the largest, ongoing body of
research on drug-related attitudes in America.  The survey sampled
teenagers, pre-teens and parents about attitudes, parent-child
communication and risks.  It found:

<p><ul>

<li>Adolescents see fewer physical and social risks in illicit
drugs.

<p>

<li>Most (60 percent) baby boomer parents are drug experienced.

<p>

<li>Three out of four boomer parents do not want their teenagers
experimenting with drugs.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among their teenagers (14 percent of parents believe their children
have experimented with marijuana but 38 percent of teens report
smoking pot).

<p>

<li>There is a communication gap between teens and parents.  Most
parents (95 percent) say they have talked with their children
about drugs, but only 77 percent of teens agree.

</ul><p>

There has also been a shift in the drug risks perceived by teenagers.

<p><ul>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement &quot;taking
drugs scares me&quot; declined from 47 percent in 1993 to 36 percent
in 1995.

<p>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement that they
do not want to hang around with drug users declined from 55 percent
in 1993 to 39 percent in 1995.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in regular and trial use of marijuana.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in both crack and cocaine abuse.

</ul><p>

The study speculated about why there has been a drop in perceived
drug risks.

<p><ul>

<li>Select music groups encourage marijuana legalization.   In
1995, Capricorn Records released <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit
album for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML).  At least 45 bands have declared support for legalizing
marijuana.

<p>

<li>Marijuana abuse is portrayed lightly or as inconsequential
behavior. The number of drug-related stories airing on the three
major television networks between 1989 and 1994 declined by more
than 83 percent (from 518 stories in 1989 to 82 in 1994).  Some
of the programs were veiled drug promotions like <I>ABC</I>'s
&quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 6, 1995) and <I>Discovery Channel's</I> &quot;The War on
Drugs&quot; (June 20, 1995).  Even the network news favorably
profiled marijuana.  For example, <I>NBC</I>'s <I>Nightly News</I>
aired a one-sided viewpoint by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a member
of NORML.  The <I>NBC</I> &quot;Health News&quot; segment by Robert
Bazell interviewed many people who claim marijuana helps them
with medical problems that include AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma,
and cancer.  <I>NBC</I> ignored more than 10,500 scientific studies
which chronicle the adverse consequences of marijuana use.

<p>

<li>The marijuana fashion craze in the early 1990s attracted wide
media attention.  Companies like Adidas have popularized marijuana
through the introduction of &quot;The Hemp&quot; shoe.  Hemp is
a name for the type of plant from which marijuana is derived.

<p>

<li>The public continues to debate the legalization of drugs.
Several years ago, the Surgeon General called for a study of
drug legalization.  Noted conservative columnist William F. Buckley,
Jr. called for legalization in a widely publicized edition of
<I>National Review</I> (February 12, 1996).  On November 5, 1996
Californians will be asked to decide whether to legalize marijuana
for medicinal purposes.

</ul><p>

&quot;With teenagers seeing fewer risks with marijuana and drug
use,&quot; said Partnership Chairman James Burke, &quot;we can
expect to see another increase in adolescent drug use in 1996....
After years of tremendous progress, the country is losing precious,
hard-won ground in its effort to curb adolescent drug use.  Today's
drug trends are similar to those of the late 1960s, and the outlook
for the near future is disturbing.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SURVEY LINKS DRUG ABUSE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h3></center>

<p>

Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.

<p>

The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[9]

<p>

&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
president and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;

<p>

The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents,
asked, &quot;What is the most important problem facing kids today?&quot;
One-third of the adolescents answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant
second with 13 percent was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot;
which often also involves drugs.

<p>

<center><h3>TARGETING THE TOBACCO GATEWAY</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration has chosen to avoid the epidemic of
illicit drug abuse and/or attack it indirectly via a frontal assault
on tobacco.  It has launched a major assault on teen tobacco abuse
by issuing a presidential executive order to classify nicotine
as a drug.  Apparently the President believes reducing tobacco's
availability will protect teenagers from the temptation of cigarettes
and will impact the illicit drug problem because tobacco abuse
as a gateway to illicit drugs.  But not all experts agree.

<p>

Tobacco is not necessarily a gateway for illicit drugs.  According
to an Abt. Associates Inc. memorandum dated August 28, 1995 and
given to the White House, &quot;Smokers do not necessarily become
marijuana users.&quot;  Abt.'s reports that &quot;about two of
every three marijuana users became marijuana users before they
smoked cigarettes.&quot;[10]

<p>

The &quot;gateway&quot; theory is bolstered, however, by Lloyd
Johnston, the principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future
Study.  He wrote in 1995, &quot;[c]igarette smoking is strongly
correlated with the use of marijuana, and suggest[s] that the
upturn in cigarette smoking during the past four to five years
may well have contributed to the increase in marijuana use of
the same period.  Because smoking usually precedes marijuana use
and teaches youngsters how to take smoke into their lungs to secure
a drug-induced effect, it provides an excellent training ground
for learning how to smoke marijuana.&quot;[11]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool are only part of the answer
to the illicit drug plague.  Leaders at all levels must speak
out against the danger of illicit drugs.  Strong law enforcement
must stop the supply, and parents must communicate frankly and
frequently with their children.  Drugs should be demonized not
glamorized by the media.  These changes will go a long way to
increase the perceived level of risk for teenagers.

<p>

The facts about drugs are clear  -- illicit drug abuse is rising.
Now is not the time to divert attention away from the dangerous
threat of illicit drugs.   Most Americans want a tough line on
drugs.  They know that taking a tough line will save lives and
taxpayer money.

<title>FAITH-BASED PRISON PROGRAMS CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</title>

<h2>FAITH-BASED<br>
PRISON PROGRAMS<br>
CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Crime in America seems out of control.  The government's response
has been to build more prisons and keep convicts behind bars longer.
But that won't cut growing incarceration costs and high recidivism
rates. Such cuts should be the goal, and faith-based prison programs
can help.

<p>

&quot;I believe moral rehabilitation,&quot; says Burl Cain, warden
of the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola, &quot;is the only
true rehabilitation there is.&quot;[1]

<p>

Although most Americans support punishment for criminal offenders,
there is a growing consensus that there is more to solving the
crime problem. &quot;The nation's crime and prison problem is
fundamentally a moral and spiritual problem,&quot; says Richard
Rettig, chairman of University of Central Oklahoma's sociology
and criminal justice department.  &quot;We should bring the criminal
abusers not to a punishing environment which hurts and kills,
but unto a God that heals,&quot; Rettig says.[2]

<p>

Whitney Kuniholm is the executive vice president of Prison Fellowship,
the world's largest prison ministry.  Kuniholm explains, &quot;You
can have job programs, literacy programs, drug programs and educational
programs, but unless something changes on the inside [of the person],
that stuff isn't going to make a difference.&quot;[3] Inmates agree.

<p><ul>

<li>Bill McCall, a convicted murderer in Indiana, explains, &quot;Before
I became a Christian, there was no way I could deal with what
I had done.  But now that I know God has forgiven me, I can forgive
myself.&quot;[4]

<p>

<li>Mark Wiggins, a Texas inmate convicted of possession of a
sawed-off shotgun, says, &quot;I was just out of control, totally
out of control.  I had no love, no sense of caring, no sense of
anything.  I just...didn't care.&quot;  Wiggins says he became
a Christian through the unswerving efforts of his wife.  He says
he was simply tired of losing and wanted to change.  &quot;Now
I feel a sense of peace inside of me that I've never felt,&quot;
he says.[5]

<p>

<li>Ex-convict Billy Greer, once an armed robber and drug dealer,
has been out of prison and straight for three years.  &quot;I
place God first and I'm able to overcome the temptation,&quot;
says Greer, &quot;because God, to me, is greater.&quot;[6]

</ul><p>

North Carolina's former secretary of corrections, Aaron Johnson,
says Prison Fellowship's religious programs made his prisons more
manageable.  &quot;There was a change in the environment in those
prisons.  Infraction rates went down in almost every prison.&quot;[7]
This is good news for taxpayers because these programs lead
to lower operating costs, more frequent parole, and reduced recidivism.

<p>

Cost-conscious states are taking notice.  Texas Governor George
Bush may soon give approval for a private, faith-based prison.
Not only does the program promise to save the taxpayer millions
in operating costs, but it gives hope to Texas citizens that fewer
convicts will leave prison only to commit more crimes.

<p>

Before considering the benefits of faith-based prison programs,
however, consider a profile of the worsening crime problem and
America's prison system.  This profile will help one appreciate
just how desperate we are for better solutions.

<p>

<center><h3>SOCIETY COPING WITH CRIME</h3></center>

<p>

The U.S. has tripled its prison population in the past 15 years,
and the Rand Corporation projects it will double again over the
next decade.[8] Meanwhile, prison costs doubled to $24.6 billion
over the past decade, and experts foresee substantial increases
in the future.

<p>

A U.S. Justice Department study found that more than half (62.5
percent) of all released state prisoners are rearrested for a
felony or serious misdemeanor within three years, and almost half
(41.4 percent) return to prison.[10] This is in spite of a serious
decline in the crime clearance rate (the rate at which police
identify and arrest suspects).  Since 1955, the probability of
a murderer being arrested has declined 26 percent, and for a rapist
the probability has gone down 27 percent.[11]

<p>

Keeping chronic and violent criminals in jail makes sense.  &quot;All
of us look at the futility of having to spend money on prisons,&quot;
says John Engler, governor of Michigan, &quot;but we recognize
the public necessity.&quot;[12] That's why Virginia's governor, George
Allen, ended parole and more than doubled expected prison time
for many offenders.  &quot;People were disgusted with the dishonesty
and leniency of the system,&quot; Allen says.[13]

<p>

Americans aren't so concerned about punishing criminals as they
are about keeping the fox out of the chicken coop.  For example,
a 1994 nationwide Wirthlin Group poll asked, &quot;What do you
feel is the main purpose of prisons?&quot;  To that question,
61 percent said, &quot;to keep criminals out of society.&quot;[14]
Almost three in four (73 percent) Americans told <I>ABC News</I> 
that they approve of building more prisons so that
longer sentences can be given to prisoners.[15]

<p>

John J. DiIulio, a criminologist and Brookings and Manhattan Institute
scholar, explains that there are financial benefits to locking
up chronic criminals.  &quot;It costs society at least twice as
much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.&quot;[16] In fact,
according to Patrick Langan, a senior statistician with the Justice
Department, tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 likely
prevented 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults
in 1989 alone.  Given that each murder costs society $2.4 million,
each rape $60,000, each arson $50,000, imprisoning violent criminals
can be a bargain.

<p>

Indeed, many Americans are persuaded that prisons are worth the
cost.  According to William and Mary College economists Thomas
Marvell and Carlisle Moody, 21 crimes are averted for each criminal
who is kept off the street.[18] That translates into hundreds of
billions of annual savings in costs to society.

<p>

The enthusiasm for more prisons and longer sentences is not universal,
however.  Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU's National Prison Project
opposes the current rate of incarceration.  &quot;There is a spirit
of meanness, selfishness and punitiveness,&quot; says Bronstein,
&quot;that seems to have no bounds.&quot;[19] Tim Matthews of the
American Probation and Parole Association says, &quot;It doesn't
take an Einstein to tell you if prison were the answer, crime
should have dropped.&quot;[20]

<p>

The immediate answer, of course, is that crime <I>has</I> dropped.
Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and murder 
dropped 12 percent, the largest drop in the murder rate in years and six 
times larger than the drop in the same period in 1994.[21]

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics &quot;will
give us a false sense of security.&quot;[22] This is especially true
for young offenders, where problems have been growing in recent
years -- and are apt to get worse before they get better.

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking rate of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens from 15 to 19 years of age
will increase by 23 percent, and a very large proportion of these
teens will be coming from homes without fathers.  Given the clear
and established correlation between father absence and crime,
some experts estimate that violent crime like murder could increase
to 40,000 killings per year -- up 60 percent from current levels.[23]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles, warns, &quot;There's a tornado coming.
We can't stop it.  We have to prepare for it.&quot;[24] The future
portends escalating violent crime and a growing need for prisons
and longer sentences unless something dramatic is done.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICAN PRISONS: PUNISHMENT OR REHABILITATION?</h3></center>

<p>

The question that must be answered is, &quot;What are prisons
supposed to do?&quot;  The U.S. has a history of vacillating between
rehabilitation and punishment for inmates.  The pendulum is now
moving away from rehabilitation.

<p>

&quot;I'm sick and tired of these people getting by with murder
and rape and child molestation and just being allowed to be in
jail.&quot;[25] Illinois Senator Adeline Geo-Karis said these words
just before the state senate approved legislation setting up a
chain gang program. She explained, &quot;I say, let them out
in the rock pile to pay their penalty. No more mollycoddling!&quot;[26]

<p>

A 1995 <I>Time/CNN</I> poll found that two in three Americans
(67 percent) believe prisons are too lenient.[27] Two-thirds favor
chain gangs and half would deny inmates television and barbells.[28]
Texas Senator Phil Gramm says, &quot;We've got to stop building
prisons like Holiday Inns.&quot;[29]

<p>

Within the penal system, there are a variety of prisons and operating
philosophies.  There are ultra-maximum-security prisons like the
one near Florence, Colorado.  Here are housed the nation's 484
toughest federal prisoners.  The 428,000-square-foot facility
has 168 videocameras and 1,400 electronically controlled gates.
Each cell has unmovable cement furniture and a small black-and-white
TV.[30]

<p>

Despite its effectiveness, James Joy, Colorado's ACLU director,
says, &quot;The prison is designed to drive people crazy, to break
them psychologically, by locking them up with no meaningful human
contact.&quot;[31]

<p>

Sheriff Joe Arpaio runs a no-frills prison for Maricopa County,
Arizona. He has organized prisoners into chain gangs, houses
them in tents in the scorching desert sun and feeds them baloney
sandwiches with no coffee. Inmates are denied broadcast television
but given educational programming. &quot;I want to make this
place so unpleasant that they won't even think about doing something
that could bring them back,&quot; says Arpaio. &quot;I want them
to suffer.&quot;[32]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called for a fundamental overhaul
of the prison system.[33] He's joined by Rep. James Moran (D-Va.),
who wants a better balance between punishment and rehabilitation.
America needs &quot;an effective criminal justice system,&quot;
says Moran, &quot;not only punishing offenders, but also on teaching
the skills and discipline necessary to keep them from becoming
repeat offenders.&quot;[34]

<p>

The cadillac of prisons is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania.
McKean Medium-Security Prison is labeled by some as a &quot;resort&quot;
or &quot;country club.&quot;  The taxpayer pays $15,370 for each
inmate per year.[35]

<p>

DiIulio says, &quot;McKean is probably the best-managed prison
in the country, and that has everything to do with a warden named
Dennis Luther.&quot;  Luther's success is attributed to his philosophy
of building a &quot;prison culture&quot; that includes unconditional
respect for inmates as people.  Luther explains, &quot;If you
want people to behave responsibility, and treat you with respect,
then you treat other people that way.&quot;[36]

<p>

Nearly half (47 percent) of McKean inmates are enrolled in education
classes.  According to DiIulio, &quot;In some prison systems,
cost-effective management is possible only because programs keep
prisoners busy, with less supervision than you'd need otherwise.&quot;[37]

<p>

McKean is the exception among prisons.  Most prisons are by design
very inhospitable places.  William Weld, governor of Massachusetts,
expresses a widely-held view about prisons saying they should
be &quot;a tour through the circles of hell,&quot; where inmates
learn only &quot;the joys of busting rocks.&quot;  The fact that
most prisons are &quot;a tour through the circles of hell&quot;
explains why an inmate serving a life term in New Jersey said,
&quot;You create Spartan conditions, you're gonna get gladiators.&quot;[38]

<p>

This inmate's perspective is understandable and all too common.
According to former Arkansas corrections commissioner Don Hutto,
&quot;One prison I worked in had a sewage problem....But the state
budget people told me it would take four years to get the money
for a new sewage treatment plant....The inmates knew they were
at risk and they protested.  We had to discipline them, even though
they had a good case. It was like that with nearly all the projects
I tried to get started, and then people wonder why there's a prison
riot.&quot;[39]

<p>

Incarceration has at least four social benefits:  retribution,
deterrence, rehabilitation and incapacitation.[40] Recent trends
have been weighed more heavily on the side of retribution and
incapacitation. Meanwhile, prisoners are more diverse, harder
to control and often re-enter society better criminals than ever
before.  Evidence abounds that our penal system is failing to
curb recidivism and costs, and in many instances prisons serve
as advanced training centers for more sophisticated or violent
crimes.

<p>

Overcrowding is driving a rush to build new facilities, such as
in Texas, which has launched a prison construction boom to raise
its capacity from 38,000 in 1987 to 150,000 by 1997.[41] The U.S.
has 1,037 state and federal prisons which are operating at between
17 and 36 percent above capacity.[42]

<p>

Incarceration costs are also rising.  For 1995, states appropriated
$18 billion for corrections, making this the fastest-growing item
in state budgets.[43] According to the Justice Department, the average
annual spending per prisoner is $15,586 for the states and $14,456
for federal prisons.[44] These figures do not include hidden and
indirect costs which significantly elevate the outlays to anywhere
from $25,000 to $40,000 per prisoner.

<p>

A number of factors drive escalating costs -- more inmates, numerous
drug-addicted and violent offenders (who cost more to supervise
than other prisoners), more prison gangs and other anti-social
groups, diverse ethnic make-up, more elderly prisoners who require
special care, and the unprecedented explosion of prisoner lawsuits.
The most expensive prison service, however, is health care.

<p>

Prisoner health care takes 21 percent of the typical state's corrections
budget.[45] The high costs are dictated by the generally rising costs
of health care in society, but also because inmates are far more
likely to have chronic diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis than
the general population.  Annual health care costs per prisoner
range from $634 per inmate in Louisiana to $3,264 per inmate in
Massachusetts.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISONS FOR PROFIT</h3></center>

<p>

Jimmy Turner, now a prison warden with the for-profit Corrections
Corporation of America (CCA), spoke of the Texas state prison
system, explaining, &quot;We were taught that communication only
went one way....A prisoner did what you told him. That works,
if you can afford to let prisoners get angry and tear up the place.
No one is going to care if he wrecks a $1,500 sink in his jail
cell. The state will foot the cost.&quot;[47]

<p>

Many states are seeking commercial prison alternatives because
costs are spiraling out of control.  CCA is the largest private
operator of prisons in the U.S.  The chairman of the CCA said,
&quot;It seemed such a logical idea when we started....As long
as there's a monopoly, there is going to be inefficiency, and
government is the biggest monopoly of all.&quot;[48]

<p>

CCA contends that it can build prisons cheaper and run them better
than can the government.  &quot;Anyone who has worked in prisons
learns pretty quickly that when people are treated humanely, in
a way that maintains their dignity, the environment is safer,&quot;
says Don Hutto, who helped found the corporation in 1983, &quot;but
that's not what often happens in public prisons.&quot;[49]

<p>

James Wiedenman, a CCA shift commander, prefers CCA's approach,
explaining, &quot;The atmosphere in those places [state-run prisons]
was awful....The prison administration was even more of an enemy
than the inmates were.  You didn't see the warden for more than
once in six months....Most of us [guards] got into this business
because we like what we do, but if I hadn't moved into the private
sector, I think I would have found another career.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISON POPULATION</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, 1.6 million people were in federal, state and local prisons
and/or jails.  That's 387 incarcerated Americans per 100,000 population,
up from 139 in 1980, making the U.S. the leading jailkeeper in
the western world.[51] More than half (60 percent)[52] of all federal
prisoners are serving time for drug-related offenses, while 94
percent[53] of state prisoners are serving time for violence-related
offenses.

<p>

Most prisoners have long criminal histories beginning with extensive
juvenile records. Two out of three prisoners have served time
in a juvenile institution, but their juvenile files are seldom
available to judges when deciding on adult sentences.[54]

<p>

What's more frightening than the offenses for which these inmates
are currently serving are those crimes they committed for which
they were never convicted.  In the late 1970s, the Rand Corporation
surveyed prisoners in Texas, Michigan and California and found
that the median number of admitted crimes committed by each inmate
in the year prior to their incarceration was 15.[55]

<P>

Most state inmates become hardened veterans of the prison system.
More than 60 percent have been incarcerated before, and nearly
all of these (91 percent) have been in jail or prison for an offense
within the five years preceding their current offense.[56] Convicted
rapists and murderers are by far the most likely of all felons
to return to prison.[57] Only 19 percent are serving their first
sentence.[58]

<P>

The typical prisoner is poorly educated.  Seven in 10 inmates
have no high school diploma, and most (66 percent) are illiterate
with limited marketable skills.[59] Three-quarters are drug or alcohol
abusers at the time of incarceration, and most female inmates
leave children behind when they go to prison.[60]

<P>

The prison culture is often as bad as or worse than the lifestyles
inmates left behind.  Prisons are filled with some of society's
worst offenders.  Besides a host of bad company, the prisoner
experiences many deprivations which include restricted movement,
loss of possessions, loss of autonomy, and reduced contact with
family. Prisoners live in a very regimented, highly regulated
environment designed to control every aspect of behavior.

<p>

Male prisoners must often fight to survive.  They must be constantly
on guard for personal safety.  Homosexual rape is common, especially
for new inmates.  Gangs often define and control the prison experience.

<p>

<center><h3>DOES PRISON REHABILITATION WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

The taxpayer has a right to expect the prison system to be more
than a holding tank or a revolving door for criminals.  Most prisons,
however, are little more than expensive warehouses within which
inmates finely hone their criminal skills.

<p>

A 1974 review of 231 prison rehabilitation studies found that
correctional treatment showed no effect on recidivism. Robert
Martinson published a review, &quot;What Works - Questions and
Answers About Prison Reform,&quot; which helped move the rehabilitation
pendulum toward &quot;nothing works.&quot;[61] But Martinson's analysis
lacks support from some contemporary experts.

<p>

&quot;You are not going to rehabilitate the chronic offender,&quot;
says DiIulio, &quot;but it is also wrong to say we are not going
to rehabilitate anybody.&quot;[62] Most prison officials agree.

<p>

In 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee polled prison wardens
to discover their views on rehabilitation.  Wardens overwhelmingly
favor prison rehabilitation programs.  Ninety-three percent favor
literacy and other educational programs, 92 percent favor vocational
training, and 89 percent favor drug treatment.[63]

<p>

J. Michael Quinlan, a former director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, supports rehabilitation because it makes prison operations
more efficient.  &quot;It is absolutely the most important ingredient
in managing a safe and secure institution,&quot; says Quinlan,
&quot;to keep the inmates productively occupied, in either work
or education or drug treatment or structured recreation.&quot;[64]
Quinlan says, &quot;It is really a question of do we want to
pay now, or do we want to pay later.&quot;[65] Ninety-five percent
of inmates return to the streets. If they have been sitting idly
in prison, their chances of recidivating are higher than if they
have been involved in productive programs.[66]

<p>

Most prisoners are poor employment candidates.  A 1991 Justice
Department survey found that most (70 percent) prisoners earned
less than $15,000 in the year before their arrest.[67] A prison term
also worsens their job prospects.  These facts should support
efforts to increase inmate skills so as to improve their post-prison
employment chances.

<p>

A 1993 study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that many
prisoners want to participate in education programs to improve
their chances of finding a job, and thus not committing a crime
after release.[68] Numerous other studies have also found a strong
relationship between prison education and lower recidivism.[69]

<p>

Paul Barton, the co-author of a 1996 prison-based Educational
Testing Service study, found &quot;[s]olid information...about
how low the literacy level of prisoners is in relation to what
the job market needs.&quot;  Barton said, &quot;Education may
not be the sole answer to cutting recidivism, but the evidence
shows that it helps.&quot;[70]

<p>

Barton's study found that two-thirds of all inmates are substantially
behind the general population in literacy, even lower than the
average unskilled laborer. He said, &quot;They're not going to
make it when they get out. This is where a whole lot of our youth
are these days, especially minority youth.  For many of them,
it's their last chance for education.&quot;[71]

<p>

Prison-based work experience is another form of rehabilitation.
Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association,
says, &quot;It is a matter of public safety: inmates who have
worked in prison and gained new skills have a significantly better
chance of not returning to crime and prison.&quot;[72]

<p>

Former Attorney General Edwin Meese favors prison-based programs
as a means of reducing recidivism. &quot;Prison industries is
one management strategy that shows promise,&quot; explains Meese,
as a way to &quot;reduce recidivism and increase public safety.&quot;[73]

<p>

A 1991 Federal Bureau of Prisons study followed 7,000 inmates
after release.  Those who worked in prison had a 35 percent decrease
in recidivism the first year.[74] Prison-based work programs also
save on operating costs.

<p>

Prisoner wages are garnished to help pay for incarceration costs.
At least 25 states now have contracts with private firms that
employ inmates.[75] But such work programs are restricted by two
1930s-era federal laws that limit interstate commerce in prison-made
goods.

<p>

<center><h3>FAITH-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

Now that we have an overview of the prison problem and the most
popular approaches to dealing with the incarcerated, let's look
at other programs that have proven to be effective and most efficient
-- faith-based programs.

<p>

Todd Clear, a Rutgers University criminologist, says, &quot;Religious
programming is the single most common form of institutional program
for inmate management and rehabilitation.&quot;[76]

<p>

Jailhouse conversions are viewed skeptically by judges and parole
boards.  John Wiley, a UCLA law professor, cautions, &quot;There's
such an incentive to fabricate [a conversion] that it's difficult
to be convincing....The problem is that the best evidence of a
genuine conversion comes after the person leaves the prison.&quot;[77]

<p>

Wiley says people are often too quick to label conversions as
fake. &quot;Actually,&quot; says Wiley, &quot;prison is the kind
of environment that might well prompt a conversion.  It's a shattering...monkish
existence...a complete change in your life.  Sure, some turn to
the worst instincts.  But I don't think it's implausible that
some turn to the best.&quot;[78]

<p>

Todd Clear, who is also a fellow at the National Institute of
Justice, believes spiritual commitment makes a difference.  &quot;Prison
is designed as an experience to pull people out of their realities
so they can, in fact, confront who they are and what they've done
and try to commit to a different version of themselves....I mean,
we would want people who go to prison to admit that they did wrong....These
religious traditions fit into what we really want prison to do.&quot;[79]

<p>

Louisiana prison warden Cain agrees with Clear.  &quot;All these
men were looking for was something, just looking for something
to hang their hats on.  We ought to be ashamed for what we hadn't
done for them before. They were ready for God.  They were probably
more ready than anyone. Even though some of these people may
never be free from this place, they'll be free with eternal life.
That's what it's all about.&quot;[80]

<p>

Charles Adkins, an Indiana state prison official, says religion
is one of several rehabilitation avenues.[81] But it's the only approach
that addresses the root problem -- a moral crisis inside the inmate.

<p>

Paul Robinson, a law professor at Northwestern University, dissects
the root of crime.  Robinson asks, &quot;Why do people obey the
law?  People obey the law because they fear the disapproval of
their social group and because they generally see themselves as
moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it.&quot;[82]
The fact that many offenders come from social settings that approve
of anti-social behavior might, in part, explain their crime history.

<p>

&quot;Reinforcing the compliance powers of the social group and
personal morality,&quot; says  Robinson, &quot;could reduce crime
even if policing and prosecuting functions cannot be made more
effective.&quot;[83] Perhaps  this is why religion has been effective
for some prisoners.  Inmates who simultaneously experience a changed
personal morality (salvation or conversion) and then are totally
immersed in a faith community experience religion's life-changing
power.

<p>

Religion serves four roles in prison.  First, it provides answers
to the prisoner's questions about life.  Second, it provides rules
to adhere to, which makes inmate management easier.  Third, it
is experiential. In other words, something intrinsic takes place
(salvation or conversion) which is evident to the inmate and later
to those around him. Finally, religion plays a social role bringing
together like-minded inmates for worship, Bible study and other
faith-related activities. This togetherness gives the inmate
a sense of belonging and positively impacts the prison's culture.[84]

<p>

There is evidence that religion helps make prisons more manageable.
A 1992 Rutgers University study found that prisoners often seek
God to cope with inmate life, which is marked by depression, guilt
and self-contempt.[85] Todd Clear, the Rutgers researcher, found
that highly religious inmates evidence lower rates of depression
and commit fewer disciplinary infractions than other inmates.
In another study, correctional officials from three states credited
Prison Fellowship's religious programming with improved morale,
lower rates of depression and fewer disciplinary infractions.[86]

<p>

Inmates who are highly religious while in prison also tend to
have lower recidivism rates. A 1990 Prison Fellowship study of
360 ex-convicts found that only 40 percent of those who were heavily
involved in religious programs committed new crimes after release
compared with 51 percent of the non-religious group.[87] Although
this isn't an especially large margin, it's better than recidivism
results attributed solely to education, work or drug treatment
programs.

<p>

A 1996 Prison Fellowship study of 201 inmates involved in religious
programs found that high participation in Bible studies is related
to lower likelihood of arrest during the one-year follow-up period.[88]
A 1992 Prison Fellowship study of 225 New York inmates also found
that high religious program participation meant lower odds of
being re-arrested.[89]

<p>

<center><h3>BRING MORE RELIGION TO PRISON</h3></center>

<p>

If religion works better than other forms of prison rehabilitation,
then the taxpayer ought to favor more religious programming.
There is a problem however and it has more to do with what goes
on inside the prison than laws separating church and state functions.

<p>

Suzanne McElwain, chief chaplain at the Luther Luckett Correctional
Complex, La Grange, Kentucky, says, &quot;It's not cool to be
a Christian on this yard.&quot;[90] She finds that many inmates believe
Christ was killed on the cross because he wasn't smart enough
to avoid it.

<p>

&quot;We've got a lot of unchurched men here,&quot; says McElwain,
&quot;a lot of unbelievers, and a lot of people with an unhealthy
(image of ) God.&quot;[91] If religion is to help change inmates,
these barriers must be removed.

<p>

One means of removing these barriers is to embrace a prison concept
that involves all inmates in a prison-wide faith-based program.
Sociologist Rodney Stark writes in the <I>Journal of Research
in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;Religion only binds people
to the moral order if religious influences permeate the culture
and the social interactions of the individuals in question.&quot;[92]

<p>

A prison operated on a faith-based philosophy offers great promise.
Such an approach would introduce into the prison many desirable
attributes.  It opposes antisocial values, emphasizes responsibility
and accountability, advances non-deviant over socially deviant
behavior, promotes reconciliation, seeks to mediate conflict,
and champions social support and comfort for those in need.[93]

<p>

Although such a program is not for every inmate, it will work
for many.  For example, the Association for Protection and Assistance
of the Sentenced (APAC) is based on a unique prison model started
in Brazil 20 years ago.  The program restores inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families
and Creator. It also promises to reduce prison costs and reduce
recidivism. Prison Fellowship researched the approach and found
that ex-convicts who completed the Brazilian program had an incredibly
low four percent recidivism rate.[94]

<p>

The first APAC program could be run in Texas by the Community
Corrections Institution, a faith-based nonprofit organization.
CCI proposes to run a corrections institution for Texas for 90
percent of the current per prisoner cost and promises to reduce
recidivism by half.[95]

<p>

CCI's program will provide jobs and job training for up to 500
residents per facility.  It will satisfy all statutory requirements
for a penal institution, and it guarantees accreditation by the
American Correctional Association.  It will teach inmates marketable
skills and assure that skills will be marketable upon release.
It will also pay prevailing wages for the skills learned.  Inmates
will contribute to room and board, support their families, make
restitution to victims, establish savings accounts and have spending
accounts.[96]

<p>

To be eligible for the CCI facility, inmates must be at least
one year, but no more than two years, from initial parole eligibility
or mandatory release.  They must agree to stay at least one year
and make themselves available for all programs, services and employment.[97]

<p>

On May 8, 1996, CCI representatives met with representatives of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice System to discuss key
points of a Texas-based APAC program.[98] CCI answered the Justice
System's legal questions:

<p><ul>

<li>A corrections program may be authorized for management by
nongovernment participants to further state interests and secular
purposes. State interests include lower incarceration costs,
lower recidivism rates and lower, long-term state expenses.

<p>

<li>The state must give a contractor the discretion to provide
religious or values elements without necessarily causing impermissible
state endorsement, so long as inmates voluntarily participate.

<p>

<li>Nonreligious elements can be funded with direct state support,
but religious elements should not be funded without legal authority.

</ul><p>

CCI's proposal satisfies these legal requirements.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Bill Glass Prison Ministry goes across the country spreading the
Gospel to hungry inmates.  &quot;I give myself to going to prisons,&quot;
says Glass, &quot;because men in prison...have come to a point
they realize they have a need, and they're willing to trust the
Lord...and what we're trying to say is that you can have a new
life.&quot;[99]

<p>

Chuck Colson, Prison Fellowship's founder and himself a former
prisoner, says prison may just be one of the best places to start
over again.  &quot;The Gospel is better news in prison than anywhere
else,&quot; says Colson, &quot;because these people really understand
the depths of their own sin.&quot;[100]

<p>

Religious rehabilitation programs work for many prisons.  They
provide a moral compass for inmates who have been led astray by
a corrupted value system. Work, education and drug programs,
although important, can't change the inner man which is the target
of faith-based programs.

<p>

The prisoner who acquires an intrinsic faith has a better chance
to live a crime-free post-prison life.  For those who must remain,
they are easier (translated less costly) to manage.  The taxpayer
collects the benefits from a rehabilitation philosophy that embraces
the life-changing power of religious faith.  It is an experiment
well worth trying.

Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health
Insurance?
</B></center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

<I><B>According to Congressional Ratings of Small Business

</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

<P>
&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Average SBSC Rating        2.3%<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

September 17, 1996<BR>
<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<b><CENTER>Small Businesses Harboring Chemical Weapons?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>American Businesses To Be Subjected to Foreign Inspections
Under Proposed Chemical Weapons Convention<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Foundation
(SBS Foundation) &#173;&#173; a nonpartisan research and education
organization focusing on public policy issues relating to small
business and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; has called on candidates
to focus closely on the issues in this year's campaign.  To help
this process along, the Foundation re&#173;released its comprehensive
guide to issues impacting entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A 
Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues.&quot;
<P>
SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Entrepreneurs,
business 
owners, and their employees are looking for a substantive, issues&#173;based
campaign in 1996.  
<P>
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; will help candidates
at both the federal and state levels, 
as well as the media and citizens in general, to sort through
the real issues affecting small 
business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96,&quot; echoed these comments by noting, &quot;As
the campaign season moves 
into high gear, the tendency increases for rhetoric to overwhelm
substance.  Our 
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; booklet attempts to
keep attention and offer guidance on 
substantive issues.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Each chapter in &quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot;deals
with important public 
policies and how they impact entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
tax policy, government 
spending, regulations, monetary policy, trade, immigration, health
care, government 
reform, as well as key issues at the state and city levels.  The
booklet also examines the role 
of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy and
over the next century.    
<P>
Keating concluded: &quot;Our economy has been growing at a slow&#173;to&#173;mediocre
pace 
since the late 1980s and we need to be debating policy options
that will place the economy 
on a high&#173;growth track.  Of course, real economic growth
and job creation are generated 
through investment and entrepreneurship.  &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96&quot; offers an 
entrepreneur&#173;friendly agenda.&quot;

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; To mark the start of
National Small Business Week, the Small Business Survival Foundation
&#173;&#173; a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization
focusing on small business issues &#173;&#173; released a new
report today the &quot;Small Business Survival Index: Ranking
the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small
Business Survival Foundation 
and author of the report, noted: &quot;The Small
Business Survival Index provides a measure of 
government&#173;related costs affecting the decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses &#173;
&#173; the engines of economic growth and job creation.&quot;<p>
 The study combines nine major costs 
(whether rates, ratios, or indexes) levied on small
businesses and entrepreneurs into one 
comparative index number:<BR>

<P>
<B>Top
Personal Income Tax Rate</B>.  State personal income tax rates
impact economic 
decision&#173;making related to working, saving,
investing, and risk taking. 
<P>
<B>Top
Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate</B>.  State capital gains taxes
are direct levies on 
investment and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; the
sources of growth in the economy.  
<P>
<B>Top
Corporate Income Tax Rate.</B>  State corporate income tax rates
affect a broad range of 
business decisions &#173;&#173; most clearly decisions
relating to investment and location.
<P>
<b>Property
Taxes (per $100 of personal income).</B>
State and local property taxes impact 
decisions as to where businesses and entrepreneurs
choose to locate, as well as decisions 
relating to investments in facilities.
<P>
<B>Sales
Taxes (per $100 of personal income)</B>.  State and local sales
taxes impact the
economic decisions of individuals and families, as
well as various retail businesses.
<P>
<B>Death
Taxes</B>.  Estate taxes amount to nothing more than a government
hostile takeover of 
a business at the time of the owner's death and impact
investment and location decisions.
<P>
<B>Top
Unemployment Tax Rate Paid by Employers on Taxable Wages</B>.
 The unemployment
tax rate on taxable wages affects labor&#173;versus&#173;capital
as well as location decisions.
<P>
<B>Workers'
Compensation Costs (cost index)</B>.  High workers' compensation
rates also 
impact labor&#173;versus&#173;capital and location
decisions.
<P>
<B>Total
Crime Rate</B>.  Just like taxes, a high crime rate acts as a
disincentive to entrepreneurs, 
who naturally seek out environments where life and
property are protected.  <BR>

<P>
Keating acknowledged that other obstacles are placed
in the path of entrepreneurs 
and businesses at the state and local levels, particularly
regulations.  Unfortunately, no 
reliable, comparative measure for state and/or local
regulatory costs is currently available.  
<P>
<B>Under the Small Business Survival Index, the lower
the index number, the lighter the </B>
<B>governmental burdens, and the better the environment
is for risk taking. 
</B>

<P>
Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival
Foundation, noted: 
&quot;According to our Index, South Dakota, Wyoming,
Nevada, and Washington rate best for 
entrepreneurs because they don't tax personal income,
capital gains, or corporate income.  
Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alaska, and Florida
rank very high as well.  
<P>
Unfortunately, places like Minnesota, New Mexico,
Maine, Montana, Vermont, New York 
State, Iowa, Hawaii, California, and Rhode Island
treat job&#173;creating entrepreneurs and 
small business owners rather shabbily.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
Keating added: &quot;The District of Columbia ranks
as most hostile to entrepreneurship 
when compared to the 50 states.  However, if you
add New York City into the mix, it 
offers the worst environment for entrepreneurship
&#173;&#173; by far.  For entrepreneurs, the Big 
Apple is rotten.&quot;  <BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
-- a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization
-- today released a statement regarding the observance of Small
Business Week.  SBSC President Karen Kerrigan prepared the following
statement:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Every year small businesses and entrepreneurs become more
vital to the growth and dynamism of the U.S. economy.  Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and chief job producers
of America, and without their activity our economy would stagnate
and ultimately deteriorate.  National Small Business Week commemorates
the sacrifices made by entrepreneurs, and gives politicians the
opportunity to talk about the sacrifices they've made for small
business.<BR>
<P>
The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.
 Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships increased
from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167%.  It is
interesting to note that as over 500,000 Americans lost their
jobs due to downsizing in 1994 (according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics), new business incorporations skyrocketed to
a record 750,000 in the same year.  Not surprisingly, more Americans
are taking advantage of technological advances and economic trends
to start their own business.  They have no interest in &quot;corporate
responsibility,&quot; but rather creating their own long-term
economic security.<BR>
<P>
It is essential that elected officials recognize the strong economic
forces that will dominate the 21st Century workforce -- trends
that Senator Connie Mack's Joint Economic Committee fittingly
describe as a workforce controlled by diversity, mobility and
entrepreneurship.  Though these trends have been identified by
the 104th Congress -- with scores of proposals offered to take
advantage of our exciting economic future -- the agenda of growth
and entrepreneurship has been vehemently rejected by President
Clinton.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton has been given sufficient opportunity to support
the entrepreneur's agenda, but through the use of his veto pen
and through countless policies passed and presented by his Administration
-- he has decided to support and advance a European model that
mistakenly places the government at the center of the economy.
<BR>
<P>
President Clinton likes to claim that he's tough on crime and
criminals.  What is more evident, however, is that he has gotten
even tougher on innocent small business owners.  In fact, &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out&quot; -- the trendy slogan for various tough-on-crime
proposals --  is now an appropriate label for President Clinton's
small business record.<BR>
<P>
What are those strikes against the Administration?  STRIKE #1:
 The 1993 Clinton tax hike.  Touted as a soak-the-rich scheme,
small businesses took a bath on  the 'I feel your pain' increase.
 According to the IRS, 70% of those impacted by the hike were
small businesses.  A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey
of small businesses revealed that 69% of respondents took some
action in response to the Clinton tax hike.  STRIKE #2:  The Clinton
Health Care Plan.  Adorned with its proposed employer mandates
as the primary mechanism to achieve 'universal coverage,' the
plan would have been devastating to our nation's small businesses.
 Mrs. Clinton claimed that she could not be held responsible for
&quot;every undercapitalized entrepreneur in America,&quot; and
no one asked her to be.  Small businesses want to succeed or fail
on their own, but without the government as a &quot;silent partner&quot;
forcing them into collapse.  STRIKE #3:  The minimum wage hike.
 President Clinton used to be against the wage hike as a &quot;New
Democrat,&quot; but that was before the labor unions took over
his election-year agenda.  The Clinton wage hike is another silly
ploy to appease his boisterous left-wing at the expense of small
business owners.<BR>
<P>
Of course, President Clinton has also vetoed many of the important
reforms recommended by his own White House Conference on Small
Business (WHCSB).  The President has opposed practical and moderate
reforms at OSHA and EPA; securing property rights; reforming outdated
labor laws and <U>repealing</U> Davis-Bacon; giving small business
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in health care reform, to name
a few items.  The WHCSB recommended, but the President promptly
<U>vetoed: </U> an increase in small business expensing; capital
gains tax reduction; estate tax reform; tax equity in health care
reform; pension reform; and tort reform -- all important to small
business growth and survival.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton will make every attempt this week to talk about
how friendly he has been to small businesses, and they will be
rightly incensed by his crass election-year rhetoric.  Moving
bureaucrats around agencies like pawns on a chessboard does not
help the entrepreneur's bottom-line.  &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;'
schemes have not lifted the paperwork and regulatory burden on
small businesses.  Conversely, increasing taxes and regulations
only serve to hurt entrepreneurship and economic growth.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton's track record on small business speaks louder
than his words.  Indeed he has embraced an economic model placing
government at the center of the economy.  The opening exists,
therefore, for a certain White House challenger to expose the
President's bias against small businesses and offer an agenda
that properly places the entrepreneur at the economy's center
--  producing a dynamic and exciting economy offering opportunity
for those who seek the path of entrepreneurship.  A Presidential
candidate who advocates this agenda would truly make National
Small Business Week, a week to celebrate.&quot;<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> - Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan today released the following statement after the
United States House of Representatives increased the starting
wage: <BR>
<P>
&quot;Small businesses are the job creating engines of the United
States - making up nearly two-thirds of American businesses. 
Mandating the wage hike would effectively throw a monkey wrench
in that engine. The wage hike amounts to an unfunded mandate.
 As such, it should not make its way out of Washington.  And without
a doubt, small businesses will shoulder most of the cost of mandate.
To offset the cost of the wage hike, small business owners will
either be forced to reduce current employee hours, forgo hiring
additional workers, or raise the prices of goods and services.
 All of these consequences -- viewed by us as anti-worker -- 
will not put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers.
The wage hike gives President Clinton a chance to again say 'I
feel your pain' during this election year.  But every time the
President 'feels our pain,' his compassion is followed by another
blow to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  For the small business
sector, this false compassion has meant increased taxes and costs,
courtesy of Bill Clinton.&quot;  <BR>

Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and

<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.

</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>News Release<P>
Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>

<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

                            <P>
Washington, D.C. </b>-- In a newly released booklet, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation substantiates the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) crushing impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth, driving high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas.
                                     <P>
SBS Foundation -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization examining issues crucial to the entrepreneurial sector of  the economy -- has published a booklet entitled FDA Hazards:  How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy.
                                               <P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of "FDA Hazards," offers numerous examples of where and how the FDA has gone awry.  From orange juice raids to export hurdles to shutting down the last smoked-herring company in the United States, the FDA has moved beyond a traditional role of reasonable safety regulation and education to a harsh, confrontational stance with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses.
                                                            <P>
And while FDA enforcement tactics have become more aggressive and intrusive, its ability to meet deadlines in terms of medical device and drug approvals deteriorates.  Keating notes that the average FDA approval times in these critical areas fail to even come close to what is required.  As approval times become more lengthy and costly to U.S. firms, FDA's inflation-adjusted budget increased by almost 53 percent between 1989 and 1994, and the number of full-time FDA employees increased by more than 25 percent.
                                                                       <P>
"FDA Hazards" examines the record of the FDA in terms of its ability to move medical devices and drugs through its approval process in a timely manner;  its strategies and tactics when dealing with entrepreneurs and businesses;  its budget and number of employees;  the incentives under which FDA employees operate;  and more.
                                                                                <P>
Several market-based reforms are suggested in "FDA Hazards":
                                                                                         <ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  The private sector should be tapped for medical device and drug approvals.
                                                                                              <P>
<li>The government has a role in helping to secure consumers against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, et al.
                                                                                    <P>
<li>The marketplace needs to rest upon sound legal and regulatory systems.  Unfortunately, both systems have gone awry, and some of our most dynamic industries -- medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- suffer accordingly.  Legal reform is needed.
                                                                          <P>
<li>The FDA ban against manufacturers distributing information regarding off-label uses of drugs such as independent journal articles and studies, should be lifted.
                                                                  <P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as it processes and standards for determining what products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.
                                                       <P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals.
              </ul>   <p>
In addition to a total restructuring of the FDA, Keating also advocates the elimination of capital gains taxes, which will help attract capital to such high-risk industries as medical devices and pharmaceutical.
                                    <P>
Keating summarizes the FDA's woes as follows:  "A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving devices and treatments."
                                                                                                                 <P>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the value of business investment in durable goods by $42.5 billion</b> in today's dollars; $15.4 billion of this is lost investment in computers.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>

<li>See Technical Notes for a full description of how these figures were calculated.  It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1996 presidential campaign has rekindled the debate over tax reductions. Among the proposals being considered are an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, the repeal of rate increases imposed in 1990 and 1993, the deductibility of payroll taxes, and a modified flat tax. But regardless of the particular features of each change under consideration, the argument is the same. Proponents argue that lower tax rates will spur economic growth by reducing the penalty on working, saving, and investing. Opponents disagree, claiming that the economy is doing fine and that tax rate reductions, if enacted, will help the rich disproportionately while widening the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fortunately, there is a way to judge the desirability of lower tax rates. The United States has had three major episodes of tax rate reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. By looking at how the economy performed during these periods, and by examining what happened to the deficit and the degree to which different income classes were affected, it is possible to gain useful evidence about the desirability of tax rate reductions today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The evidence provides strong support for those who believe the economy is weak and favor reductions in tax rates. Recent history is especially compelling. Tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 boosted the top rate to 39.6 percent (and over 42 percent including the Medicare payroll tax). This means a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship when compared with the 28 percent rate in effect when Ronald Reagan left office. The effect has been dismal:
<p><ul>
<li> During the post-Reagan era, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.
<p>
<li> Real median family income, the best measure of living standards for the average American, has fallen by more than $2,000 since Reagan left office.
<p>
<li> Assuming there is no change in policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth for the next ten years will average less than 2.1 percent annually.<sup>1</sup>  This is well below the post-World War II average of 3.2 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy's sub-standard performance in recent years should come as no surprise. As seen below, major changes in tax policy inevitably affect growth.
<p><ul>
<li>Across-the-board tax rate reductions in the 1920s reduced the top rate from 71 percent to 24 percent. The economy boomed, growing by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929.
<p>
<li> In 1930, Herbert Hoover raised tax rates from 25 percent to a maximum of 63 percent, and Franklin Roosevelt boosted them to 79 percent later in the decade. The 1930s, to put it mildly, are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li> Across-the-board tax rate reductions introduced by President John F. Kennedy reduced the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. These lower rates, along with substantially lower taxes on savings and investment, are associated with the longest economic expansion in American history.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li> The Johnson surtax, enacted in 1968 during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson, combined with the inflation-induced bracket creep of the 1970s (subjecting taxpayers to higher rates even though their real incomes had not changed), resulted in a decade of stagflation.
<p>
<li> Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts ushered in America's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new jobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs.
<p>
<li> The tax rate increases imposed under George Bush and Bill Clinton, as outlined below, are associated with the slowest growing economy in 50 years and a decline of more than $2,000 in the average family's income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If legislators want to unleash stronger growth and more prosperity, the best tax policy would be the flat tax. Under that proposal, all three major problems of the current tax code -- high rates, anti-capital bias, and complexity -- would be minimized. To the extent that politicians are reluctant to adopt a flat tax, however, any change that moved in the right direction would be helpful. If history is any guide, any tax rate reduction, whether a 15 percent across-the-board cut, a repeal of the Bush and Clinton tax hikes, or some other reform, would boost the economy and raise living standards.
<p>
<b>LOOKING AT CASE HISTORIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of tax rates on economic activity should not be overstated. The economy, after all, can be affected significantly by trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, and many other government actions. Even within the context of fiscal policy, tax rates are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Keeping all these caveats in mind, there nonetheless is a distinct pattern throughout American history: Simply stated, when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with subpar economic performance and stagnant tax revenues.
<P>
<b>The 1920s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Administrations of Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, tax rates were slashed from the confiscatory levels they had reached in World War I. The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Spurred in part by lower tax rates, the economy expanded dramatically. In real terms, the economy grew 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, and annual economic growth averaged more than 6 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction in tax rates, personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of no inflation).<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The share of the tax burden borne by the rich rose dramatically. As seen in <a href="bg1086c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, taxes paid by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent of the total tax burden in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This surge in revenue was no surprise to Mellon:
<p><blockquote>
	The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1960s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation the following year dropping the top rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Kennedy tax cuts helped trigger the longest economic expansion in America's history. Between 1961 and 1968, the inflation-adjusted economy expanded by more than 42 percent. On a yearly basis, economic growth averaged more than 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Tax revenues grew strongly, rising by 62 percent between 1961 and 1968. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to President Kennedy:
<p><blockquote>
	Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.<sup>8</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1980s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts were dramatic. When Reagan took office in 1981, the economy was being choked by high inflation and was in the middle of a double-dip recession (1980 and 1982). The tax cuts helped pull the economy out of the doldrums and ushered in the longest period of peacetime economic growth in America's history. During the seven-year Reagan boom, economic growth averaged almost 4 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Critics charge that the tax cuts caused higher deficits, but they misread the evidence. The Reagan tax cut, though approved in 1981, was phased in over several years. As a result, bracket creep (indexing was not implemented until 1985) and payroll tax increases completely swamped Reagan's 1.25 percent tax cut in 1981 and effectively canceled out the portion of the tax cut which went into effect in 1982. The economy received an unambiguous tax cut only as of January 1983. Thereafter, personal income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the "rich" who paid the additional taxes. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts was then-U.S. Representative <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY). According to Kemp:
<p><blockquote>
	At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THE LESSONS
<p>
1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of virtually no inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
<b>2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>13</sup>

<p>

<b>THE 1990S: IGNORING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike reductions in tax rates, increases in tax rates have a history of failure. The Hoover and Roosevelt tax increases of the 1930s certainly contributed to the dismal economy during the Great Depression. Tax revenues fell during much of the period, and the deficit increased. And as <a href="bg1086c11.gif">Chart 11</a> shows, the high tax rates of the 1950s resulted in sluggish revenue growth. Ignoring history, both Democrats and Republicans at the time argued that tax rates reaching over 90 percent could not be cut for fear of revenue loss. Moreover, the 1970s, which began with the Johnson surtax and later were hit by bracket creep, triggered the tax revolt and the Reagan tax cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps more than any other decade, however, the 1990s make the best argument against higher tax rates. In both 1990 and 1993, the economy was subjected to record tax increases, the ostensible purpose of which was to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. As <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a> illustrates, however, these increases backfired. Total tax revenue, as a percent of economic output, is expected to be lower this year than it was when Reagan left office.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, the modest decline in revenues relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is due to the slower growth in personal income tax revenues. As shown in <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a>, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of economic output in 1989. By 1996 -- two large tax increases later -- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.5 percent of economic output. In other words, the tax that was increased the most accounts for the drop in tax revenue as a share of national output.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
High tax rates are bad for the economy. High tax rates that increase the deficit by reducing the growth of tax revenue are even worse. What makes recent history especially tragic is that the economic and budgetary losses could have been avoided if Bush and Clinton had simply kept Reagan's policies in place. In 1989, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit, which then was $152 billion, would continue to fall for the next five years assuming no change in Reagan's policies. As of 1995 -- again, two large tax increases later -- the budget deficit had risen to $164 billion, and it is projected by the CBO to reach more than $400 billion by 2006 if Clinton's policies are left in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dismal budget numbers, however, tell only part of the story. The economy has been the real victim of higher tax rates. As <a href="bg1086c13.gif">Chart 13</a> shows, the post-Reagan era has seen the slowest growth of any seven-year period since the end of World War II. As discussed earlier, this slow growth has left people with more than $2,000 less income when inflation is taken into account. The biggest losers have been the poor. As Chart 14 illustrates, income for the bottom 20 percent has fallen the most during the Bush/Clinton era. The politicians who imposed the higher taxes, needless to say, argued that the rich would be the ones to suffer.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy is limping, incomes have been falling, tax revenues are stagnant, and it is projected that the deficit will more than double in the next ten years. This is the legacy of higher tax rates and a tax code that punishes working, saving, and investing. History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates. Legislation to reduce rates would do this. Better still, Congress should scrap the current system as quickly as possible and replace it with a flat tax that treats all taxpayers equally and minimizes the burden on productive behavior.

<h3>WHO ARE YOU, COMRADE ZYUGANOV?</h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/volk.htm">Evguenii Volk</a>, Ph.D.<br>
Coordinator, The Heritage Foundation Moscow Office<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

June 6, 1996<br>
<P><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clich‚s: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

</h3> <h2>Getting on With the Business of Governing</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Now that
the shallow rhetoric of the inauguration is history, and now that the latest Gingrich matter
has been disposed of at least for the moment, may we please get down to the business of
running this nation?<p>

There is much pious talk about everyone getting along. There are all of these platitudes
about bipartisanship. There are visions of leaders meeting at a summit to come up with grand
agreements.<p>

Now let's get real.  The fact is while everything has been at a standstill since the
elections, the national debt has continued to expand.  Not a word has been heard by any of
our leadership about tackling that one. Oh, the deficit is down. But the deficit isn't the
problem.  It is the debt that is the problem and almost no one from either party is
discussing this little item which threatens to sink us all.<p>

Then there is the matter of Social Security. Some members of the latest Commission have
actually recommended that Social Security be privatized.  The defenders of the status quo
have, of course, said no.  At least this issue is at last, after years of total silence,
being debated.  The advocates of privatization need champions in the Congress.  They have
none in this Administration. Right now there are too many voices accusing and defending
Speaker Gingrich to find out if anyone is aware that we do have a Social Security problem on
our hands which urgently needs fixing.<p>

And then there is Medicare.  The President wants a fix which will last just long enough for
him to get out of office without the "gone bankrupt" sign being nailed to the door on the
oval office.  Some Republicans are talking about block grants to the states.  Others are
talking about privatization of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts.  There are lots of
proposals.  No real solutions at hand. And the beat goes on.<p>

The food stamp problem gets worse every year.  The Congress did not have the political will
to do something about it in the 104th.  Does anyone think that the 105th Congress has more
political will than the last gathering?  If, however, this problem isn't tackled, the
welfare reform bill which passed in the last Congress and which Bill Clinton now wants to
repeal will end up effecting very little of the welfare mess this nation has amassed.  That
bill, after all, effected just six percent of the welfare and entitlement programs which are
federally funded.<p>

I am just touching on a few things here.  I haven't tackled regulation, national defense,
the evils of multinationalism, trade and a whole host of other problems staring us in the
face.  And we have time to utter meaningless slogans such as "nothing big has ever come from
being small?"  These problems come close to overwhelming us and yet we can spend days
pondering where the money should come from to pay Speaker Gingrich's fine?<p>

The way we are governed reminds me of how certain of my kids became experts at diverting
their parent's attention from the real issues we wanted them to face.  They did this by
creating a series of side shows.  The side shows were amusing for a time.  They even
succeeded in distracting us for a while.  Sooner or later, however, we and they had to face
the music.<p>

That time has come for America.  We've had our little vacation from reality.  The
celebrations are over.  Now, will someone, anyone, please propose some solutions which will
have lasting impact on the genuine problems facing the country?  Or as my kids used to ask:
"Are we there yet?" <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 20, 1997
</h3> <h2>Clinton's Second Term</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> William Jefferson Clinton has
now begun the term which will render a judgment of his Administration for history.  He is
the first Democrat to have begun a second elected term since FDR.  Ironically, he may be the
Democrat who presides over the beginning of the end of the welfare state which FDR left us. 
And it is even more ironic that Clinton's unending capacity to say one thing while doing the
opposite may just permit him to do so.  No Republican President would have been able to pull
it off.<p>

I have no idea what the next four years have in store for President Clinton.  He presided
over a first term during which inflation remained low, the stock market set new records, the
deficit shrunk, employment was high, and while our troops were spread far too thin, few have
come in harm's way, so far.  We all know that Presidents get and take far too much credit
for such developments, but it is fair, because had inflation tripled, the stock market
crashed, the deficit ballooned, unemployment set records, and our troops come home in body
bags, President Clinton certainly would have been blamed for all of this, whether he was
completely responsible or not.<p>

Clinton, given his record of a lifetime of close calls, may well escape Whitewater, Paula
Jones, the Lippo scandals, a recession, international disasters and anything else which can
befall a President.  Or all of his chickens could come home to roost during his second term,
much the same way Richard Nixon, after a successful first term, ended up in disgrace in his
second. Only God knows the answer, and speculation at this time is pointless.<p>

The fact is, whether we like it or not, the American people gave Bill Clinton this second
chance and he is entitled to his day of glory.  As for me, I am grateful that we live in a
nation where Clinton's opponent is given the medal of freedom instead of being put in jail. 
I thank God that opposition voices can be heard, even though those in power would have them
silenced.  That is nothing new. Just about every monarch and Prime Minister in history has
wanted to stifle opponents who had a following because of their opposition.  What is new is
that we live in a nation which, for the moment at least, has a Constitution which protects
those voices.  I appreciate the fact that we manage to carry on, often despite those who
lead us.<p>

Let us therefore rejoice in this day which the Lord has made  you who think Bill Clinton is
a great and worthy President and you who do not; you who find shame in the events of this
day and you whose heads are high  let us celebrate together.  Some will celebrate the man. 
We celebrate the idea  a fragile idea which, in many ways, defies history  that this
Republic shall continue to be a place for the brave and the free.<p>

Let us be mindful of what Pontius Pilot forgot.  All power in Heaven and on Earth comes from
above.  Neither Bill Clinton nor anyone else would have any power were it not for Almighty
God.<p>

The idea that God is still in charge, despite the frailties and foibles of our leaders, is
indeed something to celebrate this Inauguration Day, 1997. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 17, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Lecture that Can't be Missed</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I was so happy to
learn that Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA), who may be prosecuted for his handling of the illegal
recording of the Gingrich tape, is giving a speech in Seattle on February 16th, entitled,
"Privacy in the age of new technology." The speech will be presented at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mary Matalin said she had managed to
get a number of people to sign up for the $150 event. It would be worth it at any price.<p>

Well, that got me to thinking about what other lectures I might be missing. Then, I did an
Internet search, and what do you know, there are just lots of them. So I'll be very busy for
the next couple of weeks. For example, there is the $500 tax deductible lecture given by
Speaker Gingrich on "How to use a 501c3 Foundation to help Republicans make further gains in
Congress." It takes place in Atlanta next week. However, the ticket says "ethics committee
public hearings could produce the need for a rain date."<p>

Then there is the London lecture by Fergie for only $120 American dollars entitled, "How I
learned to live with fat." It seems it was booked before her latest deal with Weight
Watchers.<p>

Oh, and here is one I am really excited about: $100 per hour. Hmmm. That seems like an odd
price for a lecture. Well, anyway, it is by Dick Morris and is entitled, "How to have it
both ways: Enjoy a stable marriage and a swinging lifestyle at the same time." It takes
place at the Jefferson Hotel near the White House on Monday night, during Inauguration
festivities.<p>

Here's one that will take a bit of time, but I can't wait to hear it. The lecture will be in
the ancient city of Hebron and is being given next week by Benjamin Netanyahu. Its title is,
"When you elect a hard-liner to office, you can expect him to keep his campaign promises." 
Cost is 30 pieces of silver.<p>

Here's one I probably will miss: It is Mayor Marion Barry's lecture on "How I saved home
rule by standing up to a Republican Congress and a Democratic president." The cost is an
ounce of cocaine.<p>

But the $75 lecture by O.J. Simpson on "How I landed the Bruno Magli shoe contract after
everyone said I was through in advertising" is definitely worth flying to L.A. for.<p>

While I am there I will be taking in the $1,000 lecture by Barbara Streisand entitled, "How
my pal Bill Clinton let me sleep in the Lincoln bedroom with my boyfriend while he and his
girl were right next door." Speaking of pricey lectures, this one goes for $250,000 -- Wow.
But I guess it's worth it. The money goes to Al Gore who speaks on "How I continued the
traditional practice of separation of church and state while learning the value of the
Buddhist religion."<p>

But then, I have to hurry back to pay $350,000 for Bill Clinton's lecture. This is really
titillating. The President's topic will be "How to proposition a government employee while
avoiding sexual harassment charges." It would be worth it at twice the price. Proceeds, by
the way, go to the Bill Clinton Legal Defense fund.<p>

Of course that means I will have to miss the Tanya Harding lecture entitled "How graceful
moves and good PR made me a star."<p>

And all of that is this month, too. Wait till February when Boris Yeltsin gives his lecture,
from his hospital bed, on "My opponents only thought I was dead." The lecture is $450.00.
Cash only. No rubles.<p>

We'll I've got to run. There is still time to catch the lecture by David Bonior entitled
"How I brought down Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House." I especially don't want to miss
this one: Bonior pays people to listen. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 16, 1997
</h3> <h2>We Used To Call It Extortion</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I've told this story
before but it bears repeating.  A high official of Quaker Oats in Chicago told me that some
years ago Jesse Jackson held a press conference announcing that Quaker Oats would be
boycotted by his organization because Aunt Jemima is a racist symbol.  The corporate board
at Quaker Oats went crazy.  They held an emergency meeting.  My friend was called on to
negotiate with Jackson.  It turned out that what Jackson really wanted was money for his
Rainbow Coalition.  The Quaker official conveyed this to his board and they quickly agreed
to a huge contribution from the company to Jesse Jackson. Jackson then held a press
conference saying that upon reconsideration, Aunt Jemima was really a cultural symbol, not a
racist symbol and there would be no boycott.<p>

We used to have a name for that sort of behavior.  We used to call it extortion and people
used to go to prison for making such proposals.<p>

The story was called to mind again because yesterday in New York Jesse Jackson and the
National Organization for Women (NOW) announced they were calling off their consumer boycott
of Mitsubishi Motor Company in return for $200 million in potential business opportunities
for minorities and women.  I don't know what sort of business opportunities Mitsubishi has
in mind but I can just guess what the cut is for the Rainbow Coalition and now.<p>

Meanwhile, the parent firm of Denny's restaurants on the same day handed out $1.5 million to
nine civil rights organizations.  Guess who is in on the deal?  Why, the Rainbow Coalition,
of course.<p>

Now, I don't believe any company should engage in racial discrimination.  That is if race is
really at the bottom of it.  I do believe, however, that restaurants ought to be free to
tell people who behave badly to get lost.  I believe restaurants ought to be allowed to have
certain standards and if people come in who violate those standards the restaurants ought to
be able to throw them out with the help of the police.<p>

Race did seem to be a problem in some Denny's stores. that being the case, the managers of
these stores ought to have been summarily fired. Anyone who had been effected by their
behavior should have been entitled to a year's worth of free food or whatever.  The
Mitsubishi case is much weaker and seems to be confined to a very few individuals.  The
problem Mitsubishi has is the same one Quaker Oats had.  They don't want the bad publicity
caused by a Rainbow Coalition/NOW boycott.  So they write off millions as a cost of doing
business.  This is the American counterpart to bribing foreign bureaucrats in exchange for
business in some third world country.  Companies don't fight it, they just pass the cost on
to the consumers.<p>

Remember when the radical feminists boycotted the State of Colorado over the Equal Rights
Amendment some years back?  This got incredible coverage.  The fact that Colorado set a
record for tourism that year never got any attention.  You see, some of us held meetings in
Colorado that year just to make the point.  Colorado officials never backed down.  They
didn't suffer.  The radical gangs haven't boycotted a state since.<p>

They go where they get satisfaction.  When are these companies going to learn that they need
to stand up for their investors and for the customers who get stuck with the bill as well? 
Again, if some people are making slurs against blacks, fire them and make an example of them
for the whole company.  Word will get around.  Denny's corporate officials should have come
in to some of their stores and booted out personnel who wouldn't wait on blacks or other
minorities.  They could have then put their pictures in every Denny's to remind managers and
employees of what would happen to them if they were guilty of the same thing.  That would
make it clear. But to stick the investors of Flagstar Companies, the parent of Denny's, with
$54 million to settle a lawsuit because some people had to sit and wait to be served is
obscene.  Every Denny's I have ever seen is right next to about three of their competitors. 
I can't imagine these folks couldn't live without food prepared by Denny's prize winning
chefs!<p>

Some day soon, companies which are being held up this way are going to have to draw the
line. Some day the people who are calculating what business to strike next need to have
charges preferred against them under our extortion statutes.  Then the issue will finally be
debated for what it really is. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 15, 1997
</h3> <h2>Where Are the Democrats of Conscience?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Frankly, I
would like to comment more on the so-called peace accord announced in the Middle East,
President Clinton's plan for the District of Columbia, developments in Belgrade, changes at
the Justice Department and other stories.  I am tired of the never-ending Gingrich story,
but I am compelled to comment once again on the actions of Congressman Jim McDermott, the
ranking Democrat on the so-called Ethics Committee.<p>

Please understand that I do not come from the camp which says Democrats are evil and do
nothing but evil things and Republicans are pure and none of their motives is suspect.  My
mother didn't raise an idiot.<p>

Yet even as much corruption as I have seen in three decades in both parties and involving
people from all parts of the political spectrum, I must say the McDermott flap takes my
breath away.<p>

Let's look at this situation from the other side.  Let us suppose instead that it was Dick
Gephardt who had been elected Speaker by a majority of Democrats two years ago, and that
Republicans were angry over this development so that they filed charge after charge against
Gephardt.  Nearly all the charges are dismissed.  In the process, however, they have caused
a two-year long investigation to take place that has resulted in a Special Counsel. In this
process, the ranking Republican on the Ethics Committee, Nancy Johnson, does not seem
interested in getting at the facts.  While not vocal in the outside world (she leaves that
to Tom DeLay), she nevertheless uses every tactic in the book to obstruct the investigation.
 She gives out information when she has no right to.  She leaks information about sensitive
matters to major media outlets.  Chairman McDermott is at his wits end. He has done
everything to try to be accommodating, but nothing satisfies Johnson.  When a bipartisan
agreement has been reached on hearings and a vote to punish Gephardt on the one charge which
finally was investigated, she blows apart the agreement, even to the dismay of other
Committee Republicans who have signed on board. While complaining constantly about a breach
of House rules, she breaks all the rules herself and throws the whole situation into
chaos.<p>

Then, along comes a couple of Republican activists.  They somehow manage to intercept a
cellular phone conversation which involves Speaker Gephardt talking with Martin Frost, David
Bonior and other Democratic leaders about how to deal with the media spin which Johnson and
DeLay and others were likely to put on the upcoming release of the ethics committee report.
The couple at first gives their tape to their local Congressman Mark Foley of Florida.  He
later says he never listened to the tape, and yet when these activists subsequently show up
at his office, he helps them write a letter to Johnson and suggests that they give her the
tape.  Johnson accepts the tape and has it for several days.  Then a transcript of the tape,
along with Johnson's spin, appears in the Wall Street Journal.  Suddenly the focus shifts
from Gephardt's problems to Johnson's handling of the tape. Leading Democrats call on
Republican Johnson to step down from the Committee.  She refuses to do so.  Instead, she
doesn't even mention the tape and issues a blast saying that Congressman McDermott, the
Chairman of the Committee, was responsible for conducting a charade and that his
chairmanship of the Committee was "arbitrary and authoritarian and autocratic."<p>

Now, I ask you?  Would all of that fly? <p>

How long do you think it would take other Republicans to distance themselves from Johnson? 
My betting is that by close of business today, at least 25 Republicans of all shades would
have said that Johnson doesn't speak for them, that the tape episode is a disgrace, that
Johnson should be prosecuted, and that she should resign as ranking Republican on the
Committee.  In fact, I think a handful of her colleagues would even suggest she resign from
Congress.  By tomorrow others would join that cry.  By Friday she would have resigned from
the Committee.  By the end of next week she would be gone from Congress.  And such would
have been the case if the roles and the parties had been reversed.<p>

I am not surprised that McDermott has behaved as he has.  He is one of the most bitterly
strident liberal Congressman the Democrats have in their caucus. His pathological hatred for
Newt Gingrich is well known.  I use the term advisedly.  McDermott is a psychiatrist by
profession.  What does surprise me is that the rest of the Democrats have stood by him. 
They continue to do so.  But why am I surprised?  Not a single democratic voice was raised
about Bill Clinton's scandals throughout the four years of his first term.  No one broke
ranks.  Some said privately they thought his administration was a disaster.  But was any
voice heard publicly?  Many Democrats are decent men. Some vote with conservatives on nearly
every substantive issue.  There are those who, by all appearances, have nicer families and
treat them better than do many Republicans.  But where are their standards?  Why doesn't
this outrage them the way it does some of the rest of us.  I am not outraged because
McDermott got caught stooping as low as he could to do in the Speaker.  I am outraged
because here is someone who has been an incredible obstructionist on the Ethics Committee
who is now engaged in something which, by every objective standard, is a lot worse, at least
in criminal terms, than anything Gingrich is accused of.  Why aren't we hearing from the
voices of decent Democrats on this matter?  Why do they, by their silence, defend the
indefensible? Perhaps most of them have been here too long. But there are some new Democrats
on the scene. By all accounts Congressman Virgil Goode of Virginia is a decent man.  He ran
against Chuck Robb in the Democratic primary for the US Senate because he said he was
offended by Robb's scandals. Why don't we hear him speaking out, calling for McDermott's
resignation?  There are other new Members such as Congressman Kind of Wisconsin, a former
prosecutor.  Friends tell me he is a decent fellow.  Where is his voice in all of this? <p>

I expect liberal scoundrels to behave like liberal scoundrels.  Even though the sheer
brashness of McDermott is worth noting, I am not ultimately surprised by his actions.  What
surprised me is the silence of those, like my long-time friend and associate Ralph Hall of
Texas, who know better. America needs to hear from them.  If Republicans who voted against
the Speaker can be praised by the media as men of conscience, where are similar men of
conscience in the other party? <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 14, 1997
</h3> <h2>Colorado's Growing Importance in Party Politics</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>In
one of Ayn Rand's novels, the final fight for freedom takes place in Colorado. Well, I don't
expect this to be the final fight, but it is entirely possible that the National Chairman of
both parties will be from Colorado.<p>

President Clinton has now named Roy Romer, the three term Governor of Colorado, as the new
Democratic National Chairman and there is a fair chance that Republicans will end up with
GOP National Committeeman Jim Nicholson of Colorado as the successor to Haley Barbour. 
Perhaps all the news organizations will suddenly need bureaus in Denver.<p>

I have known Romer for over 30 years.  When I was News Director for a Denver radio station
in the mid 1960's, then-State Senator Romer was a candidate for the US Senate in the 1966
elections. His opponent was incumbent Senator Gordon Allott who was seeking a third term. I
spent a day with each of them traveling the state to produce a half-hour documentary on each
candidate called "A Day with..."  That is how I met Allott who a few months later brought me
to Washington as his Press secretary.<p>

Romer is described as a Centrist Democrat.  I suppose compared with some of the outright
Marxists occupying Congressional seats these days, that may be a correct description. 
However, the real Romer is very much like Bill Clinton.  He talks right, acts left.  And he
has been able to stay in the Governor's chair, with a Republican legislature, for years now.
 As with Clinton, the voters like the rhetoric, and don't watch the actions.  I last saw
Romer when I was covering the Democratic National Convention last Summer in Chicago.  This
was at the time of the Dick Morris scandal and Romer complained bitterly that Morris was
being accused of all sorts of things without his side of the story being heard.  I asked him
if he spoke up at the time Clarence Thomas was going through the same ordeal.  He said "No,
but I thought about it."<p>

In Romer, Clinton will have someone who is almost as comfortable with the right spin as is
the President himself.  It is truly a match made in, well, probably not Heaven, but you get
the idea.<p>

On the other side, it is clear now that no candidate has a majority of the votes to become
GOP National Chairman.  Just-retired Governor Steve Merrill had the inside track until it
was revealed that he had appointed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign chairman to the State
Supreme Court.  It was the only appointment he had, and not only was his appointee tied up
with Clinton, but he was a director of the hated Legal Services Corporation as well.  That
may be too much for even some of the bland wimpy Republicans who make up the majority of the
National Committee.  The Texas GOP Chairman, Tom Pauken, is also one of the front-runners,
and certainly is my sentimental favorite.  He has been laboring in the vineyards for nearly
four decades for the principles I support.  But given the composition of that committee it
is hard to believe that Pauken will make it, especially since former Governor Bill Clements
has said that the worst mistake he ever made was supporting  Pauken for state chairman. 
Translated, Pauken brought in so many of the great unwashed rural Protestants and urban
Catholics that the business establishment no longer controls the party.  My guess is that
Pauken won't fly.<p>

I also think that Norcross of New Jersey may prove to be too liberal for even this crowd. 
In former years Ohio Chairman Bob Bennett would have had a good chance because he has a
splendid record of party-building in Ohio, but he doesn't look attractive on television.  So
the race may boil down to a couple of businessmen, Chuck Yob of Michigan or Jim Nicholson of
Colorado.  The voting system eliminates the lowest vote-getter one at a time, so if he can
hang in there until the end, Nicholson stands a good chance.<p>

Nicholson is a businessman who has taught himself to be articulate.  He has also learned
through his business that it is the culture that really matters in the long run, so he would
be more attuned to those sorts of issues than would the usual Republican.<p>

This race is more important for the Republicans than the Democrats. Bill Clinton will
overshadow Roy Romer simply because he is in the White House.  Romer will be left to explain
what Clinton does.  Whoever becomes Republican Chairman will often be their voice going into
the '98 elections.<p>

Still, anything can happen in the Republican contest.  It depends on who is able to put the
best coalition together.  If it does turn out to be Romer for the Democrats and Nicholson
for the Republicans, I feel it will be absolutely necessary for NET to open a Colorado
bureau.  I think I'll consult with the Chairman of the Free Congress Foundation Board, which
currently owns NET, on that issue.  His name happens to be Jeff Coors. <P>

</h3> <h2>The Passing of True Patriot</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>I was tempted to devote
this commentary to the triumph of the Green Bay Packers Sunday.  Unless you are from
Wisconsin, you can't possibly imagine what that team means to Green Bay and even the rest of
the state.  With the possible exception of Chicago Cubs fans, I don't know of any group of
fans who are more loyal to their team.  They have had to wait 30 years for this moment and
yet they stuck by the Packers year after year even in losing seasons.  Out of deference to
Genevieve Wood, however, and because I have a much more serious topic to cover, I shall not
say anything further about Green Bay until after New Orleans.<p>

On a more somber note, today at the Heritage Foundation, some of us who have been active in
what is loosely called the conservative movement said good bye to one of our best friends. 
It was hard to do because for most of us it is hard to believe he is gone. Among those who
paid tribute to this author, broadcaster and historian were Heritage President Ed Feulner,
Publisher Jamison Campaigne, my daughter Dawn Ceol, Father Vince Rigdon of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, and yours truly.<p>

I first met Jeffrey St. John more than 25 years ago.  He was a syndicated columnist
operating out of New York.  I was a Senate aide.  We just hit it off and in the subsequent
years we developed an abiding friendship which is hard to put into words.<p>

Back before the op-ed pages were filled with conservative columnists of one sort or another,
Jeffrey St. John was there.  And he was fearless.  He later became business correspondent
for the "Today" show, and also reported for the CBS Morning News.  In addition he worked for
ABC radio news, and a host of local stations.  Indeed, when Senator Jesse Helms was elected
to the US Senate in 1972, it was Jeffrey St. John who took his place doing editorials.<p>

I always felt somewhat guilty because I passed on to St. John a report from an eye witness,
who happened to be a United States Senator, about disgusting behavior by the President of
the United States at a State dinner at the White House.  Fearless St. John asked President
Ford a question about this during a broadcast interview and President Ford was so outraged
he saw to it that St. John lost his network reporting job.  I felt terrible. St. John felt
it was a badge of honor.<p>

It is hard for those who have come into the general orbit of right-of-center politics since
Ronald Reagan won the Presidency in 1980 to imagine the plight of those of us who believed
in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral
values in the 1960's and 1970's.  After the defeat of Barry Goldwater, even sensible people
wouldn't use the "C" word. Retreat was evident nearly everywhere. Not with Jeffrey St. John.
He was always pushing the envelope.<p>

But the real Jeffrey St. John was a man of history.  He was, for example, among the nation's
foremost experts on John Randolph of Roanoke, one of the most interesting pioneer figures in
our Republic. St. John was at his best when he was relating history to contemporary
politics.  His three-book series on the deliberations of the founding fathers, done in the
style of a modern day reporter covering the Constitutional Convention, was so attractive to
Chief Justice Warren Burger that Burger not only wrote the introduction, but sent the books
to every high school library in the nation at the time of the Bicentennial.<p>

The difference between Jeffrey St. John and me is that he loved the battle.  I view it as
duty. Consequently he was always having to give me perspective when I would get down about
political happenings.<p>

An orphan, Jeffrey St. John was adopted at a young age and raised by a family in Canada. 
But he left home at age 14 and never saw his adoptive parents again.  He joined the military
and covered the Korean war for Stars and Stripes.  After the war, he became a reporter and
was a pioneer in the field of interactive talk radio, the format which is so celebrated
today. St. John was, as usual, decades ahead of his time.<p>

He married later in life and he and his wife Katherine had no children.  It is a pity
because he would have made a great father.  He and his wife became close friends of all of
the Weyrichs, as they frequently stayed with us when he came to Washington.<p>

It is important that we remember those brave souls who made it possible for us to stand
where we are today.  Jeffrey St. John was one such patriot.  His golden voice now stilled,
his pen now put to rest, the nation is the poorer for it all.  Thank God, before he died, he
returned to the Church of his youth.  He will be missed by all who love liberty and admire
courage.  May God have mercy upon his soul.  Jeffrey St. John, dead at age 66. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 10, 1997
</h3> <h2>Excluded from the White House List</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I'm really
bummed! I mean here I and my co-conspirators -- I mean colleagues -- here at NET have spent
more than three long years trying to make the White House' top-ten "right-wing nut-cases"
chart and we didn't cut it! What's a CEO to do?  All of those millions of Dollars wasted.<p>

And to think that all of the scandals the Clinton Administration has been involved in are
the result of one meddling millionaire named Dick Scaife.  Now, I've received money from
Scaife to be sure, but apparently I'm not high enough in the conspiracy structure to have
received his orders.  I feel offended.  Scaife and I have been friends for some 25 years
now, and after all these years, he didn't even let me in on the conspiracy.  It just shows
you can't trust even friends anymore.  I mean, don't I deserve just one little directive
from him demanding that we cover some totally concocted story against Bill Clinton and the
Democrats?  What's the matter with us?<p>

I mean, I realize I was born on the wrong side of the tracks, so maybe it's a class thing. 
You see, I thought I had a real in with Scaife.  You see, just between us, the truth is that
the two of us belong to an elite group of unique people who love electric streetcars.  Now,
on that basis alone you would think he would have at least given me a plain brown envelope
with a hint of what new charge I should make up against Clinton. But no, apparently, at
least according to the White House, Dick Scaife prefers to send all of his orders to the
American Spectator.  Well, I don't mind admitting it.  I'm jealous.<p>

Not only does Bob Tyrrell apparently have an in with my trolley jolly friend Scaife, but
apparently he spends all of his time feeding his totally made up stories about Clinton's
scandals to the Internet.  Boy, that's a surprise.  You see I sort of thought of Tyrrell as
a classy playboy.  I mean I always see him at parties with some good looking chick on his
arm.  Now I learn this is all a facade.  Secretly, in the middle of the night, Tyrrell was
really not having a fun time.  He was obviously creating new web sites so the likes of the
Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times could get their biased and slanted information
on Clinton without so much of a trace of a phone call between them.<p>

But then, the plot really gets clever. It is really amazing that London tabloids pick up all
of this stuff and give it legitimacy over here by printing it in their papers over in the UK
so that Congressional Republicans will immediately call hearings on these totally made up
scandals – scandals like Whitewater and Travelgate and Troopergate and the Democratic party
money laundering scam and who knows what else.<p>

Come to think of it, now I understand why Al D'Amato, Jim Leach and Bill Clinger kept
yelling at their staffs "where is my latest London tabloid?"  You, see it is finally making
sense.  And this guy Scaife is really good.  I mean to have all that control over the
Congress, just to get them to investigate phony, made up stories on Clinton so that the
Washington Post and the New York Times would be forced to cover the stories. And these are
the same papers Scaife and his friends have always criticized as biased and slanted! Imagine
the cleverness of making establishment newspapers the unwitting fellow-travelers of this
incredible conspiracy.  Wow!  That's impressive.<p>

I'm still ticked at Scaife, though, for keeping me in the dark.  Twenty-five years and not a
hint of any of this.  I mean a quarter of a century and not one demand that I do anything
for his money.  Maybe he doesn't like Greek Catholics.  Well, now that I know how this one
guy in Pittsburgh controls the media worldwide.  I know one thing: forget Rupert Murdoch. 
Nix on Katherine Graham and her ilk.  Heck, don't even mention Disney.  When it comes to
media empires that really matter, I know all of my spare money is going to buy stock in the
Pittsburgh Tribune Review.<p>

Still and all, I can't help but think that I've heard this whole plot before, some time ago.
 Come to think of it, it was another President who had this theory about a big media
conspiracy.  What was his name again?  Surely you remember.  A medium-sized fellow with his
hands always flung in the air giving the victory sign.  Come on, help me out.  His last name
began with an "N."  Let's see Richard Milhous Nut-case?  No, that wasn't it.  Well, anyway,
you know who I mean. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 9, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Separate Class for the Elite</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Bill Clinton is
someone who doesn't like to face major problems.  He seldom proposes politically risky
solutions to serious difficulties facing the nation.  His Medicare fix, for example, would
simply tide the system over until Clinton leaves office.  That has been true of much of what
he has proposed, with the exception of his first term health care initiative, which was
really Hillary's baby.<dd>

So Bill Clinton is praying that the Supreme Court will see things his way as the Paula Jones
case is taken up once again.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers, including the highly-priced Bob Bennett, argue that the President should
be protected from civil lawsuits while in office.  Richard Cohen, the liberal columnist for
the Washington Post, puts the argument this way: "In the end, only two people know what
happened that day in Little Rock, and their stories are not likely ever to conform.  Jones
deserves her day in court -- but not necessarily right away and not if it means that
Presidents can be legally harassed by their political enemies."<dd>

Paula Jones was no enemy of Bill Clinton.  She wasn't involved in politics at all.  It is
true that she received and took bad advice by surfacing her case at C-PAC, the Conservative
Political Action Committee annual conference in Washington.  It is also true that the
attorneys she ended up with are partisan Republicans.  That has more to do with her economic
standing than it has to do with any political motives on her part.<dd>

But those facts should not obscure the fact that what this case is really all about is
sexual harassment.  If Army drill sergeants must face the music for their misdeeds, why not
the President of the United States, their Commander-in-Chief?<dd>

What is really at stake in the Supreme Court action on the Paula Jones case is whether the
President of the United States constitutes a special class all by himself.  One set of rules
applies to him. Another set of rules applies to the rest of us.<dd>

By the way, I have taken this position consistently for nearly thirty years.  Richard
Nixon's imperial style Presidency was as offensive to me as is this Clinton argument on Paul
Jones.  I said so publicly back then.<dd>

The President's legal team argues that were he to have to stand trial on this lawsuit, it
would interfere with his work as President.  This is a President who plays golf frequently;
a President who just attended the Renaissance week-end where he mostly played hooky and
didn't attend many lectures.  This is a President who just returned from a family vacation
in the Virgin Islands.  I don't begrudge him these interludes.  Some of our better
Presidents have had a decent amount of leisure time. President Eisenhower played lots more
golf than Bill Clinton does, and Ronald Reagan frequently took naps in the middle of the
day.  On the other hand, Jimmy Carter worked day and night.  So the success of a Presidency
is not necessarily tied to hard work.<dd>

By the same token, a President who has time to engage in frequent recreation and who does
not hesitate to vacation, cannot at the same time argue, which Clinton does, that he is just
too busy to tend to this lawsuit.<dd>

The notion that political enemies would simply file frivolous lawsuits against the President
to harass him if the Jones case is allowed to go to trial now is preposterous.  A President
is sued almost daily over his policies in office.  That is fair game.  But a lawsuit
alleging improper personal conduct would have to have some basis or else it would be
dismissed immediately. <dd>

Paula Jones, before she filed the suit, had nearly gotten Bill Clinton to acknowledge that
he knew her, that they were in the same hotel together, and that he would apologize if
anything he had said had been misinterpreted by her.  At the last minute, Clinton decided
not to settle and the case went to court.<dd>

I also have no idea what went on in the hotel room where Paula Jones contends that then
Governor Bill Clinton exposed himself to her.  We would soon find out in a trial if she made
this story up. <dd>

But I do know this.  It is a dangerous doctrine which suggests that the President of the
United States is, even temporarily, above the law.  One of the reasons why the United States
was so different from other nations, even other nation states with democratically elected
governments, is precisely the fact that we always viewed our Presidents as men of the
people.  Yes, they may receive special treatment while in office to facilitate their conduct
of official business, but they are, in the words of Richard Nixon's critics, "not above the
law."<dd>

If the court goes along with Clinton, and I suspect they will because they themselves view
themselves as part of the nation's elite, then we will have established a special class of
citizen. Someone who, for four or eight years, does not have to face the consequences of his
own actions. Who will be next?  Senators?  I worked for two of them and I can attest that
they had mind boggling schedules.<dd>

True if Bill Clinton's trial is postponed, he will still have to face Paula Jones when he
leaves office.  But by then national interest in the case will be minimal.  Who pays any
attention to what happens to George Bush in his personal life these days?  The very
compensation which Jones seeks in her lawsuit, namely the restoration of her good name,
would be effectively denied her if the trial is postponed.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers say that Jones would not have suffered the loss of her good name if she
hadn't stepped forward with her lawsuit.  Let's not forget that she only did so when an
Arkansas State Trooper contended in an article for the American Spectator that Paula Jones
was the willing girlfriend of the Governor.<dd>

I am very afraid that this court will disregard what is really at stake in this case and
will grant the extra time to Bill Clinton.  Thus they would be blinded to the fact that
Clinton's behavior is the basis for this lawsuit.  Why haven't we had lots of personal
lawsuits against former Presidents who did not have any court ruling that they would have to
be protected from trials while in office.  Simply put, these recent former Presidents never
conducted themselves in such a way so as to provoke such lawsuits.  They were by no means
perfect, but they weren't out cruising for trouble with strangers either. <dd>

If Bill Clinton is upheld in this case, we will take another giant step away from a
government of the people, by the people and for the people. <P> <blockquote> <a

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 8, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Second Chance for Gingrich</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Considering the burden
on his shoulders,  Newt Gingrich performed well yesterday as he became the first Republican
Speaker to be re-elected to that post since l928.<dd>

His speech to the House was statesman like and hit just the right tone for the occasion.
Gingrich's re-election was not the foregone conclusion the rest of the House leadership
claimed it was for the past two weeks. There were nine Republican defectors.  Four of them
were really serious defectors.  They voted for another candidate.  Had the other five who
voted "present" cast their ballots for a different candidate than Gingrich and had they
added just one more defector to their ranks, Gingrich would not have been re-elected, at
least not on the first round.  It was close.  Some of those who voted "present" had been
inclined to vote for another candidate but were talked out of that scenario by some in the
leadership, including Gingrich himself.<dd>

Whether Gingrich has really learned anything from this episode or not will be determined by
two factors.  First, how does he treat his defectors. Ronald Reagan was an artful leader.
His then Secretary of Education Terrell Bell complained bitterly in his book about the
Reagan years that he had seen me on television attacking one of Reagan's policies on one day
and then bumped into me as I was going into a meeting with the President the very next day.
Reagan did not take it personally when some of us opposed his policies.  The first Gingrich
term was often marked by petty hostility to those who crossed him, especially if they were
conservative.  The Speaker needs to look beyond the vote yesterday and to the larger
question of where he is going to lead his majority.  If he treats the nine defectors too
badly he is buying further trouble with some of his supporters.  More than one Congressman
has warned the Speaker that his tenure as Speaker could be cut short if he takes it out on
those who didn't vote for him in the Republican ranks.  A move to reconsider the vote as
Speaker can be made by anyone who voted for Gingrich at any time and it becomes a privileged
motion.  The Speaker, after all, has to still face a vote on he report by the Ethics
Committee, perhaps as early as the end of this month. <dd>

That brings me to my second point.  I was asked last evening on a syndicated radio show how
Gingrich could overcome the media created image which now has a majority of Americans
believing that the Speaker has more ethical problems than the President of the United
States.  I answered with just three words: "Push an agenda".  A solid agenda which advances
the cause of limited government, a strong defense and traditional moral values, will
overcome the Speaker's adversity in a matter of a few weeks.  If Americans can be involved
in the policy process of governing the country, and if they generally agree with the
Speaker's agenda, they will forget about the Speaker's problems, even though his Democratic
opponents will raise those issues every chance they can get.<dd>

Even though this commentary is about the Speaker, a word needs to be said about the conduct
of some of  the Democrats.  When minority leader Dick Gephardt turned the gavel over to the
Speaker, he said it was his "responsibility" to do so.  He didn't say it was his high honor
or privilege to do so, words which usually accompany that ceremony.  Perhaps Gephardt was
still smarting from Monday's Washington Post editorial entitled "Why Gephardt will never be
Speaker".  It suggested that  Mr. Gephardt's ethics problems are worse than the Speaker's
and are almost certainly deliberate, as opposed to Gingrich's problems which appear to be
more inadvertent.<dd>

And then there was Minority Whip David Bonior.   While his fellow Democrats were giving
Gingrich three standing ovations during the course of the Speaker's 19 minute oration,
Bonior sat down, did not clap, and frowned angrily, a reaction no doubt to the fact that he
took on Gingrich and lost. <dd>

Despite a passion for a good fight, most Americans still admire sportsman like conduct. 
These Democratic leaders didn't display any of that yesterday. <dd>

So, Speaker Gingrich is being given another chance.  Either he will seize this moment in
history, as he did with his fine speech yesterday, and he will lead the country in the right
direction or he will not.  When all is said and done, Speaker Gingrich will be remembered in
history not for his ethics problems but for whether things changed in a positive direction
during his tenure or things declined further.  History only gives most political figures one
chance.  Speaker Gingrich needs to thank God for this second chance and to take the
responsibilities of governing for the common good very seriously. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 7, 1997
</h3> <h2>Rethinking Diplomatic Immunity</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A sort of
international drama has been playing out in both Washington and New York over the
long-debated question of diplomatic immunity.<dd>

In Washington, a 16-year-old girl, Joviane Waltrick, was killed in a tragic traffic accident
caused by an apparently intoxicated diplomat from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The
United States has formally asked the nation of Georgia to lift diplomatic immunity and
permit the young Georgian diplomat to be tried on a change of negligent homicide here in the
United States.<dd>

Meanwhile in New York City, two diplomats from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus got
involved in a brawl with New York City police after the police tried to arrest them for a
traffic violation. Officials from Belarus charge that the police engaged in brutality and
broke the arm of one of the diplomats in the process. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said
the diplomats were drunk and disorderly and moreover didn't pay their parking ticket. He has
now suggested that such members of the diplomatic community ought to go back to where they
came from and has ordered his police to begin towing their cars the same way cars of
ordinary citizens get towed if they violate parking regulations. The Russians, for example,
have 14,437 summonses for 222 cars stationed in New York, primarily at the United Nations,
which they have yet to pay.<dd>

Back in Washington, the U.S. State Department was on the defensive arguing that diplomatic
immunity needs to continue. In answer to the questions of angry reporters, the State
Department could not point to a single instance where diplomatic immunity has been waived by
a nation after a serious crime was committed. In most instances, such diplomats are simply
sent back to their native land.<dd>

It should be understood that the idea of diplomatic immunity was pushed by the United States
in the first place. It was this nation which insisted on most of the treaties or
understandings in this regard which are currently in effect. This is because the United
States was afraid, and rightly so, that its citizens could  break some unknown law in a
foreign country and thus be subject to punishment for such infractions according to local
practices. In the former Soviet Union, it was easy to break their laws. Many were made up
along the way, according to circumstance. Infractions there could well have caused Americans
to have been put to death or to have suffered long incarcerations in Soviet prisons. Right
now, in this age, it is unlawful in Saudi Arabia to attend a Roman Catholic Mass, for
example. A diplomat who simply wanted to exercise freedom of religion as he knows it in this
country could actually be put to death for doing so.<dd>

So there are valid reasons that the practice of diplomatic immunity was pushed by this
nation. And our diplomats will continue to need this sort of protection since rights which
we take for granted here are not guaranteed in most of the other nations of this world.<dd>

On the other hand, it seems to me that the negotiation of new agreements is in order. The
idea of diplomatic immunity was meant to protect citizens from arbitrary punishment for
violating unknown or obscure laws or laws which contradict practices which are commonly
accepted in the United States. Driving while drunk and thus endangering the lives of others,
it seems to me, is not acceptable in any nation. Without endangering the concept of immunity
which still has its utility, we need to see if we can't come up with agreements on such
issues which have the same meaning in all nations.<dd>

Georgian President Edward Shevrednadze has hinted that his government might consider waiving
diplomatic immunity in the case of his diplomat. If he does, that would set an excellent
example. But such a precedent is not good enough.<dd>

If we as a nation are capable of negotiating the fine points of peace between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, if we are capable of coming up with agreements for Northern Ireland or
Bosnia, surely we can do better than the present situation.<dd>

The Congress should mandate that the State Department form an immediate task force charged
with the responsibility of making recommendations on new agreements covering situations such
as the death of Joviane Waltrick or even Mayor Giuliani's complaints.<dd>

If our diplomats abroad drive while intoxicated and kill local residents of some nation,
they ought to suffer the appropriate local consequences. Issues like this have little to do
with the notion of protecting diplomats from arbitrary and capricious rules and laws which
are meant to entrap foreigners. I know I am talking about the State Department here, but
let's get down to some common sense. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 6, 1997 </h3>
<h2>Will the Supreme Court Turn Lose Dr. Death?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> In many ways,
a nation can be judged by how it treats the weakest of its people, those unable to fend for
themselves.  No, I am not making an argument for welfare benefits here.  Much of the
government assistance which has been granted over the past many decades has made people weak
and dependent.  There government intervention is counterproductive.  I am talking here about
those who cannot speak for themselves.  The unborn constitute one such group at one end of
the spectrum.  The aged and infirm, especially those who are disabled, are at the other end
of the spectrum. <dd>

The U.S. Supreme Court, having taken away the force of law which at one time protected the
rights of the unborn, is now about to hear Glucksberg vs. the State of Washington and Vacco
vs. Quill.  These cases will determine if the Supreme Court will now find a "Constitutional"
right to die the way the Court found the "right of privacy" which led to abortion on demand.
 Also being tested is physician assisted suicide.  In other words, will the Supreme Court
turn lose Dr. Deaths, symbolized by Jack Kevorkian, in every community in the land?.  The
way this Court has shown such an utter disregard for the sacredness of life, I would not be
at all surprised to see a majority opinion affirming death at this end of the spectrum as
well. <dd>

Evan Kemp, Jr., who was Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the
Bush Administration, and who has had a disabling disease since he was 12 years old, had a
moving piece in Sunday's Washington Post op-ed section entitled, "Could you Please Die Now?"
 In it, Kemp argues forcefully against the idea that assisted suicide should be legalized,
because, he rightfully contends, disabled people like himself have the most to fear from
such an idea. <dd>

Already, some hospitals are virtually forcing patients to sign "do not resuscitate" or DNR
orders requesting that so called heroic measures not be taken to keep the patient alive in
the case of an emergency which might develop.  Kemp goes on to cite several cases which are
just a sample of things to come if the court rules the way that some us fear it will.  Joe
Ehman is a 30 year old newspaper reporter in Rochester, New York who uses a wheelchair. 
Social workers hounded the poor man to sign a DNR form when he entered the hospital in 1995
for back surgery.  He declined to do so.  But just a few hours after surgery, while he was
still half under the anesthetic, another social worker tried to again get him to sign such a
form.  He managed to let her know that he would not because he didn't want to die.  God only
knows what would have happened had Ehman not had the presence of mind to resist. <dd>

He might have suffered the fate of Marjorie Nighbert, a 76 year old Florida woman who was
hospitalized last year after a stroke.  She did sign a DNR order, so her family used that to
push the apparently willing hospital authorities to deny the lady food and water.  The
hospital medical ethics committee ruled that she was "not medically competent to ask for
such treatment."  The lady starved to death 10 days later, strapped down to her hospital bed
to prevent her from stealing food from other patient's trays.<dd>

Kemp, for whom my daughter once worked as a speech writer, has more than a casual interest
in the subject.  When he was diagnosed with a progressive neomuscular disease, doctors gave
him just two years to live.  That was 47 years ago.  He, as with so many people we have
known, beat the odds.  What if, on the basis of their original estimate of his life span,
his doctors had decided that it would be better for him to die.  That way, he wouldn't have
been such a burden to his family.  Yes, Kemp is right when he suggests that the right to die
is going to lead to health care rationing.  Once we give physicians the right to help people
who supposedly are terminally ill and want to die, it is just a very short leap to permit
these same physicians to determine that a person should die even against his will because he
would require too much medical care for too long. It is coming and coming fast. The fact
that no jury in Michigan would convict Dr. Kevorkian tells us that society has bought the
notion that we, not God, ought to determine when we die.  If we can do that for ourselves,
why not someone else?.<dd>

It is not for nothing that Evan Kemp draws an analogy between what we are seeing today and
Hitler's first attempt at killing, which was of those who had disabilities, which he did on
the basis that such people were "useless eaters" and constituted "life unworthy of life". 
When that was tolerated by the society, the mass killing of Jews was not far behind. <dd>

Kemp, despite his disabilities, will be one of hopefully thousands who will be keeping vigil
outside the Supreme Court as they hear these cases. It is an unusual coalition.   Dr. C.
Everett Koop, former Surgeon General, will be among those addressing this mass protest
because he believes that the disability community is "so threatened by physician assisted
suicide."  For once the Clinton Administration, the AMA, the Catholic Church, Orthodox Jews,
the disability community and most conservatives are all on the same side.  The ACLU, which
always claimed to speak for the less fortunate, is to be sure on the side of death.  <dd>

Many of you watching this commentary can't be there with this Coalition.  But you can write
and let the Supreme Court know what you think on the subject.  Perhaps had that been done in
1972 when oral arguments were heard on Roe vs. Wade, the nation would have been spared that
horrendous decision which has led us directly to this point.  Never make the mistake of
believing that the Court is isolated from public opinion.  Not this court anyway.  This is
one issue where all of us have a stake in letting this aging court know where we stand. 
Maybe, just maybe, considering that they may one day soon be in a position where some doctor
or family member wants them to die before their time, just maybe they will understand. <P>

<h2>Senate Should Not Seat Landrieu</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> It was exactly 30 years
ago, January 5th, 1967, when this naive, eager 24-year-old set foot inside what is now the
Dirksen Building (Dirksen was still alive then) to begin to work in the U.S. Senate. What an
education that was. Within the first month I learned something which utterly shocked me. The
Senator I worked for introduced a bill in the Senate with which he didn't agree. When I
questioned this, he said he did so to help a constituent. I said, in my ignorance, "But what
if the bill gets passed?" Gordon Allott smiled at my question and said reassuringly, "I have
a deal with Scoop [Jackson (D-WA), then Chairman of the Senate Interior Committee] that the
bill will never see the light of day." And this, by the way, was done by one of the most
honest men ever to have served in the Senate.<dd>

Such began my insight into the long-playing game of Washington deception. The trick is to
look like you are doing one thing while doing the opposite. These games never cease.<dd>

The Senate is getting ready to seat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana "without prejudice," meaning
that if it turns out there is sufficient evidence of voter fraud in the recent Senate
election there, theoretically the seat could be vacated and a new election held. I say
theoretically because, although key Senators are telling Landrieu's opponent Woody Jenkins
otherwise, the fact is the way this is being orchestrated means the race is over. Even if
the Senate Rules Committee concluded that there was enough fraud in the election to have
turned the results (and more evidence is coming in every day), all the Democrats would have
to do is to filibuster and Mary Landrieu would keep her Senate seat. And they would, of
course. This is all a cozy little deal worked out between the majority and the minority in
the Senate.<dd>

The fact is, if the Republican majority were serious about the problems in Louisiana, they
would not allow Mary Landrieu to be seated at all. That is what the Democrats did to Louis
Wyman of New Hampshire, the certified winner of the Senate race in that state in 1974. The
Democrats claimed voter irregularities. There was no evidence whatsoever of the sort that
has turned up in Louisiana. In any case, the majority in 1975 refused to seat Wyman.
Governor Meldrim Thompson then appointed just-retired Senator Norris Cotton to the Senate
seat to serve in the interim and a new election was held. In that election, the certified
winner, Louis Wyman, was defeated by the loser of the general election in 1974, John
Durkin.<dd>

This took place before Vice President Nelson Rockefeller maneuvered to change the Senate
rules. In those days, Republicans could have mounted a filibuster with just 34 votes. They
had 38 Senators that year. Democrats didn't take that chance. They did not seat
certified-winner Wyman conditionally.<dd>

The fact is that there is evidence enough right now to deprive Mary Landrieu of that Senate
seat. If only the Republican majority had the stomach for confrontation this is exactly what
they would do. Instead, we will go on with the charade of an investigation. From their point
of view, the Republicans will do Woody Jenkins the favor of validating his claims and lay
the blame on the Democrats for filibustering a move for a new election.<dd>

Well, Republicans, how about doing the nation a favor? How about preserving the integrity of
our electoral system? How about, for once, standing up and behaving as if you were the
majority? Mary Landrieu should not be sworn in as a Senator in the 105th Congress on
Tuesday. This would be the perfect occasion to stop playing games and to start leveling with
the American people.<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 2, 1997
</h3> <h2>The Truth Is Spreading</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A quarter of a million
people jammed into Belgrade's main square New Year's day to continue their protest against
Yugoslavian Communist President Slobodan Milosevic's having voided opposition  victories in
23 municipal elections. <dd>

These demonstrations have been continuing on a daily basis for weeks now, and they have
begun to threaten the last Communist regime on the European continent. <dd>

The demonstrators are unarmed.  Milosevic's troops are armed to the teeth, yet betting is
with the street demonstrators.  Why?<dd>

The real weapon which the people have today in Yugoslavia which wasn't available to people
in past decades who lived under Communist regimes is underground media.  A low power FM
station in Belgrade, which can't even be heard in some parts of the city, has now formed an
alliance with other small stations throughout the country and is broadcasting the truth to
the people.  Meanwhile, the state controlled radio and television, which dominate the
country, hardly mention that anything is happening.  Thanks to the Internet, which kept the
voice of the radio station alive for a short period when the government shut it down,
information is now available to citizens which would have been unthinkable a decade ago.
<dd>

A Communist regime can exist only if the people are ignorant and isolated.  That is how the
Soviets kept power for seven decades.  I am no fan of Mikhail Gorbachev.  His own people
demonstrated what they thought of him by giving him a half of one per cent of the vote in
last year's Russian Presidential primaries.  But Gorbachev did one positive thing which
ultimately led to his downfall.  At the urging of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Gorbachev stopped the jamming of the BBC worldservice, the Voice
of America and eventually Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe a decade ago.  No doubt
Gorbachev did not understand the dynamic of the information age.<dd>

Yet once the people of the Soviet empire had access to alternative information, the
Communist regime there was doomed.  The Communists had the tanks and trained armies and a
huge spy network, but it could not compete with the truth.  I well recall an official
government hosted dinner I attended in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, in the same lodge where a
couple of months earlier Secretary of State James Baker and then Soviet Foreign Minister
Edward Shevrednaze had met.  Irkutsk is in the middle of Siberia.  Yet officials there were
more up on American politics than most Americans and more sympathetic to America than at
least a third of its own people.  This was in 1990, a full year before the flag of the
Soviet Union was lowered over the Kremlin.  The reason?  These Siberians had built
themselves tiny little crystal set type radios and pulled in information from Voice of
America which for the previous decades they could not hear.  I knew after I attended that
dinner that the Soviet empire as we knew it was doomed.<dd>

Broadcast information had created a bigger fifth column inside the Soviet Union than the KGB
could handle.<dd>

The same thing is happening in Yugoslavia a decade later.  Even some in the Milosevic
controlled army have told their commanders that they will not shoot at the opposition
demonstrators.  There may yet be much bloodshed, because dictators don't give up easily. 
But in the end the Communists will fall.<dd>

Remember Tienamen Square? Recall that for the first several days of street demonstrations
there the local soldiers were sympathetic to the students.  The reason the confrontations
dragged on for so long is that the Communist Chinese had  to call in troops from the far
provinces to suppress the democracy movement. The local troops would not shoot.  Troops from
the backwater places in China, where information is not readily available, were told that
China had been invaded by a foreign power. It took that kind of lie to crush democracy. But
as the Internet advances and more information is now available from Taiwan and elsewhere,
that sort of lie won't cut it  forever.<dd>

That is why I am betting on what has been called "the information Guerrillas" in Yugoslavia.
 The truth, ultimately, is more powerful than armies.  It is too early to tell at the
moment, but 1997 could be the last year for the Milosevic regime.  His ability to keep his
people loyal has been dependent on keeping the truth out.  But the truth is spreading.  As
with the mighty Soviet Union, the truth may prove too powerful for the remaining Communist
regimes to survive. <P>

<h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The Media Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the 
news media and, in the words of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, 
"people are tired of the media elite."
<DD>
It is about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a 
long while, especially with the shift to advocacy journalism which 
occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's accelerated by Watergate.
Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the facts 
rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public 
figures.
<DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the 
following: Journalists ignore people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if 
he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically biased. The funny 
thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree 
with that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. 
The real problem here isn't that journalists are paid off. The problem 
is that the powerful have access to important information and they 
become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that 
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any 
story, on television or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find 
that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of the story will either be 
at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be 
entirely missing.
<DD>
Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude 
in newsrooms these days is that America is among the worst places on 
earth and that we are responsible for most of the world's problems. If 
you have that view, it is not hard to be negative. Journalists have too 
much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have 
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of 
which was driven by fears of the media and not by what was best for the 
nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the press. Nothing is sacred 
anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their slogan, 
regardless of who is hurt.
<DD>
Journalists don't care about people. We live 
in a cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by 
surveying any newsroom. The media makes people guilty until proven 
innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop the story. The 
media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public 
has an insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and 
judging by the ratings of various TV shows, the media may be right on 
that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for accuracy went 
out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, 
since expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone 
suing the media over misstatements had to prove malice in order to 
collect. That is well understood by the lowest journalist on the 
ladder.
<DD>
The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look 
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational 
coverage of things which gets the ratings and sells the papers. 
Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed. Retractions happen all 
too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally 
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper.
I agree with most of the findings of this survey, but one issue greatly 
disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public says that the government 
could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the point 
of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a 
minute here. The same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey 
find the media too liberal, wants the Clinton Administration to force 
balanced reporting?
<DD>
When we had the so called "Fairness Doctrine" in 
force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know 
them because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines 
time for opposing viewpoints.
<DD>
Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as 
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind 
the statement of Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense 
Secretary." Government," he said, "is the enemy  until you need a 
friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans 
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as 
soon as there is a problem as big as this one is, we want the 
government to solve it. The government is the last place we want to 
turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media. Most 
Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control 
all of this. If we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend 
their money to reach fewer and fewer numbers. These papers will go out 
of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and television that 
we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do 
them in.
<DD>
We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with 
the media with our willingness to continue to buy their product. That's 
all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h2>U.S. Inherits Soviet Traits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Two recent incidents with two different airlines well illustrate how the United States is fast becoming a nation of bureaucratic rules rather than a nation of individuals empowered to make common sense judgments.
<dd>The other day I had to make a quick trip to Phoenix to address the annual meeting of the Arizona Transit Association. I chose Southwest Airlines out of Baltimore Washington International airport because that airline saved me literally four hours over the other choice I was given, was a United flight out of Dulles airport.
<dd>Southwest is a well-run and efficient airline with lower fares than all of the competition.
<dd>Somehow they have managed to get in and out of interim terminals in 20 minutes while their competition takes at least an hour. The only problem with Southwest is that in order to keep costs down they always seem to have the last gates in any given terminal concourse. Gates are usually auctioned off and Southwest wants to pay the lowest price possible in order to keep their fares down.
<dd>As some viewers know, I broke my back early this year and am held together by 16 metal parts. I am very blessed to be walking at all. I can now walk reasonably well but when I have to carry a bag it is quite difficult. I had only one bag when I arrived at BWI. When I got through the security system, which at BWI now requires that hand carried bags be unpacked and searched, I asked if there was an electric cart to take me to gate 16 at the very end of the concourse. I was told that Southwest did not operate such carts, whereas other airlines on other concourses did. They do need to cut costs to keep the fares low. So I managed to walk carrying my bag to the end of the terminal. I wanted to check in early because on Southwest, there is open seating. Southwest doesn't serve real food and this was 1 p.m. so I wanted to get something to eat, but the cafeteria was half way down the concourse. So after I received my boarding pass, I asked the gate attendant if I could leave my bag with him, explaining my circumstances. Southwest is known for its cheerful, even funny employees. Not this fellow. He literally growled at me, &quot;Your bag has to be attended at all times.&quot; I replied, &quot;yes and if you keep it, it will be.&quot; Then he really got surly. &quot;You have to keep your bag with you at all times,&quot; he barked. So off I went carrying my bag. When I got to the cafeteria, the arrangement was such that I could not set it down anywhere and keep an eye on it. So I carried my bag and a tray at the same time. Unfortunately carrying both elevated was more than I could handle and some of the contents on the tray ended up on the floor.
<dd>The second incident involved a United flight out of New York. We pulled away from the gate and onto the runway, whereupon the pilot came on and said, &quot;We're sorry folks, we are 18th in line and because of the weather, take-offs are very slow. We will be here at least a half hour.&quot; The man across the aisle from me summoned the stewardess. He told her, &quot;I almost missed this plane. I didn't have a chance to get to the bathroom and I was counting on going after takeoff. I need to get to the bathroom.&quot; She told him emphatically, &quot;You must stay in your seat while we are on the runway.&quot; He asked again: &quot;Please, this is really an emergency. I am not feeling well.&quot; She got very agitated for no good reason as the gentleman was as polite as could be. &quot;You stay in your seat and if you try to get up I will have you arrested,&quot; she told him. At that point other passengers around the man hissed and booed at her. I got her attention and told her, &quot;You know if this man is ill and suffers any damage as the result of your order he could sue you.&quot; At that point she threatened to have me arrested. Then just like the Soviet attendants on Aeroflot used to do before the collapse of the Soviet Union she stood in the aisle of the plane with her hands on her hips and shouted, &quot;I have complete authority to enforce FAA regulations. If anyone else objects I will get the police.&quot; The poor man was forced to sit there in agony for over 40 minutes until the plane was in the skies and the captain had turned off the seat belt sign.
<dd>In an earlier time, in both instances, an attendant would have been able to use his own judgment. To the Southwest gate attendant I had pointed out that my bag had just been completely unpacked and repacked and that he himself had removed the red tag indicating that the bag was okay. I don't think I exactly fit the profile of a terrorist. He should be allowed to make such judgments. Aboard the United flight the other passengers all assured the stewardess that if she let the man go to the bathroom, they would not ask for the same privilege. No, this &quot;lady&quot; wanted to play the role of the enforcer.
<dd>The irony is that on my last Aeroflot flight from Ulan Bataar to Moscow, the stewardesses were as polite and helpful as could be. They accommodated several unusual requests from passengers. They now have competition from Mongolian Air which is a superbly run U.S.-style airline using Boeing 737's.
<dd>Maybe the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was correct. He predicted convergence between the Soviet system and ours. As far as I can see, the Russians are becoming more like the United States used to be and we are becoming more like the Soviets used to be, a land of mindless regulations where the individual counts for nothing.

<h2>
Strategic Control in the Hands of Liberal Senators
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>There has been a great deal of talk about how Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is leading the most conservative group of Republican Senators in at least 50 and maybe even 70 years.
<dd>True enough. And it is also true that there is only a small group of liberal Republicans left: Chafee (Rhode Island), Jeffords (Vermont), Specter (Pennsylvania), Collins and Snowe (Maine), with Warner (Virginia) and Gorton (Washington) and sometimes D'Amato (New York) falling into the moderate category.
<dd>By my count that leaves 47 votes ranging from moderate conservative to rock solid conservative in the GOP Caucus. I call that a pretty good majority, 47 - 8.
<dd>So the policies coming out of the Senate should be pretty good, right? In fact, most commentators have suggested that it will be the Senate which takes conservative initiatives now, not the House as it was in the 104th Congress.
<dd>Well, think again. Thanks to the new Senate GOP Conference Chairman Connie Mack having chosen Senator Slade Gorton (Washington) to chair the Committee on Committees, and thanks to only a two-vote margin of Republicans vs. Democrats on each committee, it is now the case that the moderate and liberal Republicans are controlling the show. They are strategically placed on each major committee so that all one of them has to do is to vote with the solid lineup of liberal Democrats and they can block anything positive from getting out of committee. In the case of the finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth (Delaware) is stuck with two such votes so this Committee Chairman, who is as solid as a rock on taxation issues, can't control his own committee.
<dd>That puts these eight Senators in control of the agenda. Either the Committee Chairman compromises with them or they vote with the Democrats and nothing happens. Of course a couple of them, Jeffords and Chafee, remain Committee Chairman themselves, thanks to a lack of fortitude on the part of any of the Conservative Senators to challenge them under the new rules of the GOP caucus. So in those cases, they can control what is even discussed in Committee. 
<dd>How a rip roaring majority of 47 can be outdone by eight is really an incredible development. Apparently Senator Mack (Florida), who had just been elected Conference Chairman, was just too naive to figure out what was happening. A good question is this: Since he is supposed to be such a solid conservative, how is it that, out of the whole group of 47, he managed to ask one of the group of eight to be in charge of the Committee selection process?
<dd>Unless the Senate leadership wants to now take the highly unusual step of initiating legislation from the floor instead of in committee, don't look for any positive, constructive pro-growth, pro-family measures coming out of the Senate. You don't have to worry about the Democrats filibustering such proposals. Heck, they'll all be killed in committee.

<h2>
Political Correctness and the Media
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>On the show "Ways and Means" Tuesday night, my colleague Bob Siegrist and I had as one of our guests Mr. Roderick Conrad of Project 21, the black conservative group. We were discussing the brutal attack by Congressman Clay of Missouri, the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on the just defeated black Republican Congressman Gary Franks. We asked Mr. Conrad twice what was driving political correctness in the black community and twice he replied, "the media" - an interesting answer.
<dd>Both Siegrist and I have been around long enough to have witnessed the profound change which has taken place in media circles which makes Mr. Conrad's answer the correct one. Mind you, most who populated the media were always liberal. But despite that they played by certain rules.
<dd>Siegrist's reporting career dates to the late 1930's, and mine to the late 1950's. Siegrist was once the celebrated prodigy of the powerful WGN radio in Chicago. Both of us worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel a decade apart. He wrote editorials. I covered local politics. About 31 years ago, I worked for Bob Siegrist as an editorial assistant. At the time, Siegrist had put together his own radio network to carry a daily commentary show. (Yes, Rush Limbaugh wasn't the first in the nation to do so). I was hired by Siegrist because he knew I generally agreed with his point of view. But I found out all too quickly that when it came to the copy I wrote for his show every day, he could have cared less about my opinion. He wanted facts. If I couldn't back up every word I wrote with cold hard data, I was in big trouble.
<dd>I mention all of this because even in this case, when I was hired because I had a point of view, I was expected to put that aside to help Siegrist deliver accurate information. When I was working for the Milwaukee Sentinel during the Goldwater campaign of 1964, the management made it clear that I was not to cover the campaign because of my political passion for the then Senator from Arizona. I sat across from Cy Rice, who did cover the campaign, and even though I heard his interviews and what he said privately afterwards, I never knew his political views and readers couldn't tell either.
<dd>That is the way it was back then and the way lots of people still think it is now. As recently as 1984, I received from one of the major daily papers in San Francisco an unsolicited letter of apology after running a tough piece written by one of its reporters. The reporter had soundly trashed a pro-family conference we were running there just prior to the Democratic convention of that year. The reporter turned out to be a homosexual activist who hated what we stood for. In the letter of apology, the paper's managing editor said he had not understood this when he assigned the reporter to cover us, and when he found out he removed the reporter from that assignment. The managing editor assured me we would receive fair treatment from there on out. We did.
<dd>That would not happen today. Whereas back then if editors found out you were involved with one group or the other, if they didn't fire you for such activity, they made it clear that you could not cover the activities of such a group. At the time I was an active journalist, black reporters  were not assigned to cover the civil rights movement precisely because editors felt they had an emotional stake in the coverage.
<dd>It is exactly the opposite today. Today homosexual reporters are deliberately assigned to cover the recent court decision on same sex marriages in Hawaii on the grounds that only they understand the feelings of that community and thus can give the correct picture of the impact of that decision. Black reporters cover the civil rights movement. That accounts for the astounding statement by Mr. Conrad that his organization, Project 21, which is the leading organization of black conservatives in the country, had yet to receive a single call from the national media asking for reaction to Congressman Clay's assertion that Congressman Franks had sold out his race because he didn't follow the liberal line. In today's media, if you are not a liberal woman, the assumption is that you cannot possibly comprehend the women's movement, so mostly radical feminist women today write about the so-called women's movement. That's why the white reporter for the Washington Times was told by the black principal and students at a Washington, DC, school to get her "white ass"  --  forgive the direct quote  --  out of the school. You see, in today's media no white person can possibly write accurately about the conditions of the oppressed blacks. Anyway, you get the picture.
<dd>Well, then, hearing all of this, you may think that things probably balance out because these same media outlets hire conservatives to cover the conservative movement and born again Christians to cover evangelicals. Wrong. That doesn't happen because from today's media perspective, what is happening in those movements is largely irrelevant. We are in what the New York Times has labeled "the post Christian era." As to conservatives and Republicans, even the back-to-back Republican control of Congress for the first time in 68 years is looked on as a temporary aberration on the inevitable road to resurgent liberalism, so why bother.
<dd>Siegrist and I were always a minority in our chosen profession. But it didn't matter as much then. True, it did effect what stories were covered. But once a decision was made to cover a story, even liberal reporters felt some obligation to cover the facts without getting caught up in the insider feelings of the moment.
<dd>No, what you are getting today, which passes for news and factual information, is beyond bias. It is a reflection of the agenda of those who are doing the reporting. That is why, more than ever, you need NET. We have an agenda too. But it isn't partisan. It is called telling the truth. Three years ago when we started NET, I was asked by Stone Phillips of NBC who was going to provide the balance in NET's coverage. I replied that we are the balance, and I said "we need a whole network just to balance out Bryant Gumbel." I haven't been back on the "Today" show since. That's just fine. I stand by my statement.

<h2>
Leadership in Lott
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 <DD>Trent Lott was re-elected Senate Majority Leader
today by his fellow Republicans without any opposition. He leads
the most conservative group of Senate Republicans since, perhaps,
the 1920's.  Lott is a symbol of the changes in his own party.
He came to Washington as a Democrat. He served on the staff of
the late William Colmer, Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
and one of the last of the crusty old Conservative Democrats to
rule a House Committee with an iron hand.
<DD>
 Lott left Colmer to run for the House as a Republican
in 1972, the year that Richard Nixon swept the South. Ed Feulner
and I told Lott he was crazy for doing so. [Feulner, now the President
of the Heritage Foundation, back then was an influential House
staffer.] Lott could see already then what we didn't yet recognize
and that was that the Republicans were going to one day dominate
the South.
<DD>
 In 1980 when Ronald Reagan swept many new and conservative
Republicans into the House, Lott ran for and was elected House
GOP whip. He defeated Bud Shuster, the favorite of the GOP establishment
at the time. He held that position, largely in frustration, under
Bob Michel for eight years and finally opted to run for the Senate.
<DD>
 When in 1994 another large crop of freshmen Senators
was swept into office, Lott challenged then Majority Whip Alan
Simpson and defeated him by one vote. When Bob Dole resigned,
Lott faced off against his fellow Mississippian Thad Cochran and
beat him 44 to 8. Lott has never lost an election at home or in
the Congress.
<DD>
 It is clear that Lott knows when to hold 'em and
when to fold 'em. Two votes were added to Lott's majority in an
election which saw Bill Clinton sweep the nation. Not only that,
most of the incoming Republican Senators are more conservative
than the Republicans they replaced. The liberal wing of the party
is down to a few votes.
<DD>
 But the one thing Lott doesn't have which he had
when he entered the leadership in 1980 is conservative Democrats.
Lott became famous for being able to reach across the aisle to
get votes for Ronald Reagan's favorite programs. Conservative
Democrats trusted him. He may have changed parties but at heart
he was still one of them. Today when Lott looks across the aisle,
he finds almost no moderate to conservative Democrats left. Those
he could get from time to time in the last session, Heflin of
Alabama, Johnston of Louisiana, Exon of Nebraska, are all gone,
replaced either by Republicans or liberal Democrats.
<DD>
 In the Senate, even if Lott can keep his 55 Republicans
together on some votes, he still needs another five votes to break
a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle knows that and
will play it for all it is worth.
<DD>
 Lott is, when all is said and done, a wily Southerner.
He likes to make deals, but sometimes, when he feels a great principle
is at stake, he can be tough as nails. Following the Civil War,
Southerners learned to adjust. They learned to sound accommodating
even when they didn't intend to be. Lott is very much that way.
What you see and hear is not always what you get. And that often
surprises friends and enemies alike.
<DD>
Lott is the most clever GOP leader in the Senate
since the late Everett Dirksen passed on to his eternal reward
in 1969. He is a man who keeps his word once you can be absolutely
sure what his word is.
<DD>
Lott is someone who knows how to use power, but he
uses it very sparingly. He is often compared with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. He likes the comparison. Mitchell
just smiled and smiled while he was driving a stake through the
heart of the Republicans. Lott wouldn't mind repaying the favor
from time to time.
<DD>
 Lott will have at his side a conservative team to
help him. That team reflects where the GOP has gone these past
years: Don Nickels from Oklahoma as whip; Larry Craig of Idaho
as Policy Committee Chairman; Connie Mack of Florida as Conference
Chairman; Paul Coverdell of Georgia as Conference Secretary; Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky as Chairman of the Senatorial campaign committee.
The South and the West, that is where Republicans tend to do well
and that is where the leadership team comes from.
<DD>
The Senate is a far different place than it was 30
years ago when I first encountered it. Half of the GOP membership
back then was liberal and Southern Conservative Democrats dominated
the structure.
<DD>
Trent Lott is truly a creature of the body which
he will lead for another Congress. As with the South itself, what
change comes about during his term will be incremental, steady
and managed. Trent Lott is no revolutionary but in terms of the
Senate itself, it is revolutionary that he is its leader.<BR>

<h2>
Clinton's Difficult Choice
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Poor Janet Reno. She can't win no matter what she does. Just a few days ago, the Republicans were singing the praises of the Attorney General calling her "honest and independent". That was because close aides of the President had been all over town telling anyone who would listen in the media that the President wanted to dump Miss Reno because she had been too willing to apply the independent counsel statute. Four times she had invoked that procedure regarding Clinton Administration officials and so there are that many high level investigations going on at the present moment.
<dd>The White House was especially concerned that the Attorney General would invoke the independent counsel statute in the matter of the foreign fund-raising practices of the Democrats, which became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
<dd>Well, whether the threat to her job was enough to get her attention, or whatever the reason, and at this point the lady deserves the benefit of the doubt, Janet Reno declined to invoke the independent counsel statute in the Democratic party fund-raising case. In her reply to Senator John McCain of Arizona, signed by a Deputy Attorney General, Janet Reno said one thing which is absolutely true and another which is highly questionable. First, she said that the statute itself was not designed to cover issues involving a political party, which is a private organization. True enough. But then the Attorney General went on to say that there is no evidence that either the President or Vice President has been improperly involved in the case (which, if true, would trigger the statute) and thus the investigation will be handled internally by the Justice Department and not by an independent counsel. But that statement misses the whole point.
<dd>We don't know what the role of the President and Vice President was in this episode. True, they both have denied any wrong doing. Richard Nixon also assured us he wasn't a crook. But it is essential to understand just what sort of influence foreign money paid in determining our government's policies. While Al Gore says he had no idea that a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple handled illegal contributions, (including several $5,000 contributions from Buddhist nuns who had taken a vow of poverty), the really suspicious activities involve the President himself. He met several times with Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, formerly with the powerful Indonesian conglomerate known as the Lippo group. In at least one case, U.S. policy toward Indonesia changed following one of those meetings. Maybe that was all just coincidence, but that, at least, is one huge question mark hanging over this matter.
<dd>So Senator McCain, (who had written Reno to ask her to invoke the independent counsel statute) and Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have both suggested that in view of Reno's decision, the Republican majority in Congress will just have to hold hearings on Democratic fundraising. That is entirely appropriate under the circumstances, because those hearings will put pressure on the internal unit at the Department to Justice to make its investigation honest.
<dd>Attorney General Reno did say that if the internal investigation warranted it, an independent counsel could always be appointed later. Maybe after the President reassures her that she will be retained during her second term she will feel more liberated to act.
<dd>The issue, in any case, is not going away. Now the Attorney General has earned harsh words from the same folks who had been lauding her  just days ago. It remains to be seen, however, if the White House aides who had been trashing her will now feel she has demonstrated sufficient loyalty to the President to be kept on the job. Bill Clinton has a big problem regarding Janet Reno. If he fires her, he will suffer great political damage because the assumption will be that she got the axe because she was too anxious to see his Administration investigated. On the other hand, if he retains her, he does run the risk of her rediscovering her independence because she retains considerable credibility with the media and the Congress and could easily recover from this temporary setback.
<dd>Yes, poor Janet Reno. The lady is not well physically and she has problems no matter which way she elects to go. It is Bill Clinton who deserves the real pity, however. He has a problem if he fires his Attorney General and he may well have a problem if he doesn't. It is for this reason that Presidents have always looked for close friends to put in that position. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's third choice. They hadn't even met until he made the appointment. Maybe, considering all the trouble he is in, Bill Clinton really wants a close friend in the  Attorney General's office. Too bad Vince Foster didn't live to see this day. He might well have made the ideal Attorney General for Bill Clinton.

<h2>
Time to Reform the FDA
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Another in the long line of appointees of President Clinton is stepping down and in this case, not a moment too soon.
<dd>David A. Kessler will resign early next year as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Actually he was first appointed by President George Bush, but toward the end of the Bush Administration he signaled that he really was a Clinton supporter and Clinton kept him on as FDA Commissioner.
<dd>During his tenure, Kessler engineered several major power grabs which opponents contend are unconstitutional at worst or against the will of Congress at best.
<dd>Actually, Kessler's adventures against tobacco, widely embraced by Bill Clinton, is one of the key factors in continued Republican control in the House of Representatives. Although union and environmentalist money defeated many GOP incumbents in the North, Republicans picked up enough seats in the South to offset those gains and Republicans hung on to the House. Several GOP incumbents in the South and border states, thought originally to be in political trouble, all kept their seats due in part to the Administration's war on tobacco.
<dd>Kessler's departure comes at a time when Congress was beginning to take an increasing interest in his power maneuvers. There were signs that the 105th Congress was finally going to confront the FDA chief so Kessler probably thought it was a good time to get going. Former FDA General Counsel Peter Barton Hut said Kessler's unexpected announcement yesterday was "great news both for the FDA and for the public health." The FDA is "in the worst state of disarray in four decades," Hut said. The agency "now needs a real leader who will focus on the agency and not on their own personal agenda."
<dd>Indeed that is Kessler's legacy.
<dd>He greatly expanded FDA's power and in the process ran roughshod over the legislative process. The more controversial his actions became the more he seemed to enjoy the fight. Ralph Nader-style proponents of big government view him in heroic terms. Business concerns which were victims of his arbitrary and often capricious harassment view him as the devil incarnate.
<dd>As with all practitioners of power politics in Washington, he got a bit carried away with his own office. The Washington Legal Foundation just issued a report accusing Kessler of padding his expense account during his tenure. In truth, that may have prompted his resignation more than anything else. Better to leave now while some segments of the media and the public consider you a hero, then to fight charges which will tarnish your image and give opponents the opening they had longed for.
<dd>President Clinton has made noises about accommodating the realities of a Republican Congress by appointing more centrist people in his Administration. The FDA would be an excellent place to demonstrate his sincerity.
<dd>While Commissioner Kessler has used his time and energy to assume jurisdiction over products where he had no authority to do so, the United States has lagged way behind the rest of the developed nations of the world in approving new life-saving drugs. It is a travesty that U.S. citizens now have to travel abroad to seek medical treatment deemed safe in Europe and Japan but not available here. The poor, which Kessler and his friends always claimed they were championing, cannot afford to go abroad for treatment. They have been left to die untreated here at home. Kessler was bold in seeking new power, but extraordinarily timid in taking action to save the lives of U.S. citizens.
<dd>Congress should now pass legislation to reform the agency to force it to function as it was set up to do. The FDA  ought to swiftly test and put on the market new products that further the health of the nation. The FDA ought to get out of those areas where Congress has not given it jurisdiction.
<dd>The President, for his part, should look for someone sensible to head the agency. Kessler, for all of his great public relations, has actually succeeded only in tying up the agency with various lawsuits which will take years to settle. Those law suits can be put behind us if the President will make the right appointment. Bill Clinton won't appoint any conservative to office, but he doesn't have to appoint a power-mad ideologue either.
Now we will get a chance to see if Bill Clinton wants to behave as a "New Democrat," at long last, or if he intends to replace Kessler with another headline-seeking Commissioner with his own agenda. That choice, which is bound to be given significant scrutiny by the Congress, will tell us a great deal about Bill Clinton's plans for a second term.

<h2>
The Speaker's Profound Remarks
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was approved by his party caucus for another term as leader of the House of Representatives, said something very important which got little coverage yesterday. The media was busy talking about the Speaker's pledge to cooperate with President Clinton and his acknowledgment that he had made some mistakes.
<P>
<DD>
Yet of far more profound significance were these words by Speaker Gingrich:
"The country will never again be healthy if we don't have the courage to confront the spiritual and cultural and moral deficit that is an even greater threat to our future than the economic deficit.
<P>
<DD>
"In the core documents of our freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, is says unequivocally, we are 'endowed by Our Creator with certain unalienable rights'. And I think we have an obligation to reassert in a calm, open way, involving people of all backgrounds, each approaching God in their own unique way, that this nation comes from God, that it is in fact only successful when it is submissive to God's will, that while all of us are sinners and all of us fall short, that does not excuse any of us forgetting where our powers and our responsibilities come [from]; and somehow reestablishing in the public square that it is legitimate, in fact it is vital, that we recognize the degree to which, in the broadest sense, if America does not get its rights from Our Creator, there is no explanation of America and there is no way of thinking of the future. 
<P>
<DD>
"I am not suggesting here in any way a state religion. I'm not suggesting in any way a theocracy. But I am suggesting to you that if you read Lincoln and you read the Founding Fathers and you read as recently as FDR, and then you look at our modern 30-second attack commercials and you look at the decay in our society, that maybe we lost a great deal when we became too timid to talk openly about the source of the American dream and the source of our rights and that we have an obligation to re-establish them."
To this I can only add "Amen and Amen." It is a mark of our time that the Speaker feels he would have to add as many qualifiers as he did in making a very valid statement. The early leaders of our nation were much more straight forward in proclaiming their belief in God.
<P>
<DD>
Important civil documents invoke the name of the "Most Holy Trinity." The argument then was between those such as Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged a distant deity and those who proclaimed that we were a Christian nation, albeit one which was tolerant of other beliefs.
<P>
<DD>
Today the argument is between those who want only to acknowledge God in the public square, as the Speaker did in his speech, and those who insist that belief in God is at most a private matter, and any utterance or acknowledgment of God in the outside world is not only improper but should be forbidden. Unfortunately, in what the New York Times has described as the "post-Christian era in America," those who want not to separate church and state but to ban God from government, have won the day.
<P>
<DD>
Viewers know I have many differences with the Speaker. But I applaud him for raising this issue. He did so on the day on which his father, Robert Gingrich, who had adopted him at age three, died of cancer at age 71.
<P>
<DD>
The words of Speaker Gingrich were a fitting tribute to the only father he ever knew. There is something that happens to us when our fathers die. We begin to look at life more seriously. Somehow when they are still alive, we think of ourselves still as kids, no matter how old we or they may be. But when we lose our fathers, we understand that the future now is up to us. We take responsibilities more seriously.
<P>
<DD>
I believe in the Providence of God. I believe nothing happens by accident. The Speaker said with the passing of his Dad, he felt strongly that he had to bring up the issue of God in the public square, even though it might be a little controversial. I believe he was inspired to do so. The Speaker spoke the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Let us ask Almighty God to find rest for Robert Gingrich in a place where there is no pain nor grief but only everlasting life. Let us ask that same God to inspire and bless Speaker Gingrich that he might find the wisdom and strength to do exactly what he suggested needs to be done: namely to help to reestablish God's rightful place in the affairs of mankind.

<h2>
The Declining Conscience of America
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Those who watched this program regularly earlier this year may recall that when President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion measure, I predicted that this would be the high water mark of his administration. That act, I suggested, would bring about his defeat in the Fall. It is true that Clinton, who at that moment enjoyed a 56% approval rating, the highest of his Presidency for more than a day or two, never did achieve that high water mark again. But it is not true that this issue made a controlling difference in this election. 
<p>
<dd>
The liberal columnist Mark Shields, also host of CNN's Capital Gang, said today that post election survey data revealed that abortion was important to a much greater portion of the electorate than had originally been believed. Moreover, of those for whom abortion was deemed their most important issue in this election, Bob Dole defeated Bill Clinton two to one. So much for the myth that the so called pro choice position is an automatic winner with the electorate. It can be correctly argued that abortion did not effect the outcome of the Presidential race because Bob Dole refused to make it an issue. 
<p>
<dd>
Even when, in the final debate, a minister handed Bob Dole a soft ball question about the decline in morality in America, Dole did not raise the issue and gave President Clinton a pass. Unless voters went to one of the churches where pastors made this an issue or unless voters received mailings from the National Right to Life Committee, they probably were simply unaware that this was an issue. Indeed, another survey released last week revealed that among voters who followed and understood the issues, Dole was a decisive winner. 
<p>
<dd>
But among those who simply voted without following what was going on in the country, Bill Clinton won in a landslide. There were races, however, where the abortion issue became a principal focus. In Louisiana, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan declared that it would be a sin for Catholics to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Mary Landrieu because of her abortion position. What followed was days of discussion in the media about the separation of church and state, so that voters almost could not escape hearing about the issue. Since Louisiana has the greatest share of Catholics in the South, Hannan's statement was thought to be the death blow to Landrieu. But, barring the ability of Republican candidate Woody Jenkins to present evidence to the Senate of overwhelming fraud, Mary Landrieu will take her place as a Senator in January. Just a few years ago a statement such as Hannan made on abortion would have been a death blow to Landrieu. There is at least some evidence that Hannan's statement may have actually moved some Catholic voters to vote for Landrieu out of spite. 
<p>
<dd>
Likewise in Iowa, the race for the Senate against incumbent Senator Tom Harkin became, in the words of Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot's campaign manager John Maxwell "a referendum on partial birth abortion". Lightfoot's initiative on the issue hurt incumbent Senator Harkin badly enough that it forced Harkin to air a television commercial accusing Lightfoot of distorting his record. Harkin claimed that he really was against partial birth abortion. That caused Lightfoot to air a commercial featuring a retired Catholic priest who looked like he stepped out of a Bing Crosby movie. The priest explained partial birth abortion and said Harkin had not told the truth when he said he was against it because he had voted to keep the procedure legal twice. Then the priest looked into the camera and said :'If Harkin would lie about this...." The commercial ended. It seemed to do the trick. Lightfoot came back up in the polls. But on the day before the election President Clinton came to Iowa and supported Harkin on the issue and Harkin went on to win the closest Senate contest against an incumbent. 
<p>
<dd>
But still Harkin won. So I was dead wrong about America. The Presidential race can be explained away. The Iowa and Louisiana Senate races cannot be. Yes, both were very close races. Yes there were many other issues involved. But abortion was front and center in both cases long enough for the electorate to make an informed choice. The electorate went for the candidate who supported near infanticide, the act of killing a baby by sucking its brains out moments before it is delivered from the Mother's womb. Because I thought America still had a conscience, I was confident that this issue would be decisive with voters. It was with some, but not enough.  
<p>
<dd>
I regret to say that I was wrong about this issue, not because I made a mistake. The Good Lord knows that I make lots of mistakes every single day. I regret that I was wrong not because the candidates I hoped would win lost. I regret to say I was wrong because of what it says about the American electorate. It tells me that no matter how brutal the crime, no matter how unconscionable the act, no matter how dire the consequences for the society, a majority of those who bother to show up at the polls will blind themselves to reality. That, my friends, does not bode well for the survival of our nation.

<h2>Public Prayer Launches Romania’s New Era</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
It was a scene worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille production. Thousands of people were gathered in University
Square early Monday morning in Bucharest, Romania, as Emil Constantinescu addressed them from a 
balcony overlooking the square. "I am here to tell you that I will never betray you. We are here for the people 
who fought the guns with their bodies," Constantinescu said. With that, the new President-elect of Romania 
asked the crowd to pray with him. Thousands of people dropped to their knees, bowed their heads and 
recited The Lord's prayer.
<DD>
Thus began a new era in Romanian history, the last of the Eastern European nations to shed the old 
Communist regime. At Christmas time in 1989, just after the Berlin Wall came down and following changes 
in other Eastern European nations, Communist Dictator Nicholas Ceaucescu was captured and executed. 
The man who gave the order for the execution was Ion Illiescu, who subsequently was elected and then 
re-elected President of Romania. He loosened some government controls of people's lives which Ceaucescu 
had imposed, but he kept his government in the hands of the Socialists. Almost no privatization. Huge heavy 
and unproductive industries still owned and operated by the government. Rampant inflation and a population 
which could scarcely get by.
<DD>
Illiescu was able to keep control with his own cleverness. His agents infiltrated the Democratic 
opposition and caused them to fight each other over the smallest of points. He inaugurated political parties 
with near identical names to those of the Democratic parties so that uneducated peasants would have trouble
 telling the difference. His tactic worked. His neo-Communist Socialists hung on for seven long years.
<DD>
Finally the Democratic opposition got its act together. Finally the voters caught on to who was really 
responsible for the terrible conditions in their country. It began earlier this year when anti-Communists swept
 municipal elections. Following that, in the November 3rd parliamentary elections, the Socialists were roundly
 defeated, leading to Sunday's runoff election for the Presidency. Romania has finally taken the step which 
everyone else in Eastern Europe took years ago.
<DD>
Bob Krieble and I and our team of political trainers were the first Western democracy specialists into 
Romania, just two months after Ceaucescu was killed. Candles were still burning day and night in the streets 
under mounted icons to commemorate those who were killed in the bloody exchanges culminating in the 
Dictator's death.
<DD>
Religious believers were still meeting secretly in apartments. There were no street lights at night. 
Neighborhoods took on an eerie feeling as people shuffled about in the dark. Streetcars rumbled through the 
city jammed with passengers, but with lights off. Foreigners were looked at with suspicion. I recall one lady 
approaching me in the back of an Orthodox church, speaking to me in German. I replied that I spoke English. 
She then asked me where I was from. I said America. She threw her arms around me and began to cry. 
"God Bless you for coming here," she said, surprising herself at her public display of emotions which 
attracted the attention of other worshipers in the now-jammed church. "You are the first foreigner I ever spoke 
to," she sobbed. "Two months ago, I would have been executed if I had spoken to you this way," she beamed. 
It was a scary place. Our meetings to teach the fractured opposition were infiltrated by the Communists.
<DD>
The opposition parties, then coming out of hiding after decades in the underground, were fixated on the past, 
each blaming the other for Romania's decades of suffering under Communism. Our pleas that they work 
together at first fell on deaf ears. But gradually the efforts to divide and conquer the opposition were 
recognized and overcome.
<DD>
To Bob Krieble's credit, we continued to do training there in the years to come, long after many others had 
given up and pulled out. Sunday that effort finally paid off.
<DD>
Romania followed Bulgaria, which had just elected an anti-Communist parliament a couple of weeks ago 
along with a pro-free market President as well. Now comes the hard part. Romania is so far behind, it will take
an extraordinary effort to catch up.
<DD>
In today's Washington Post, right next to the article about the developments in Romania, is a long article to 
the effect that the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, 17 years after she first took office, are now finally 
paying off for Britain big time. Things are booming in the old British empire. But that took 17 years of 
uninterrupted rule by the Conservative party -- the same party which the voters seem poised to retire from 
office next year.
<DD>
Romania, in this new highly competitive atmosphere in Europe led by Britain, will find the going rough. 
However, the suffering people there kneeling in the streets praying to the Lord is an auspicious start. The 
situation may look on paper hopelessly complicated, but the Romanians know, with God all things are 
possible.

<h2>Dornan Will be Missed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Congressman Bob Dornan called me yesterday afternoon to say that in the absentee ballot count, he had lost his race for re-election. Dornan contends that the election was stolen from him. Boxes and boxes of illegal ballots, he says, were brought in after the polls closed and the voters they supposedly represented were never matched with the voter rolls. Dornan says these are the votes of illegal aliens and he blames the Motor Voter act for making this sort of thing possible.
<dd>Dornan told me that the Republican party, which had pledged to help him go to the wall on this race, has now abandoned him when they realized that they would have to challenge Hispanic groups in the process. Some Hispanic groups have threatened to shut down the Congress if Dornan's opponent, Loretta Sanchez isn't seated. The GOP, he said, doesn't want this sort of confrontation, even if it means losing a seat in the Congress.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be missed. I first met him in 1975 when he was a talk show host in California and I appeared on his show. Ironically, Dornan called me earlier this year when one of the radio networks had approached him with a healthy contract to do a syndicated radio talk show. He has often filled in for Rush Limbaugh. Dornan asked me for my advice on this offer. I told him he should take it, because I was convinced that he would do more good on the outside than he could do on the inside, where he was constantly clashing with the Republican leadership. He did not follow my advice but instead ran for re-election. Now he hopes the network offer is still available.
<dd>Ever since bursting on the electoral scene in 1976, Bob Dornan has been a thorn in the side of liberals. The White House, for example, was thrilled yesterday when they heard that Dornan had gone down. For years Dornan has been on Bill Clinton's back on everything from draft-dodging to baby killing. In 1992 he made more speeches than George Bush warning the nation what the election of Bill Clinton would mean. Unfortunately much of what he predicted would happen has proved to be true.
<dd>Dornan served a total of eighteen years out of the last twenty, taking off a two year stint for an unsuccessful try at the United States Senate. In 1996 he ran for President, not because he ever thought he could win, but because he felt his presence would force the other Presidential candidates to address the social issues. Dornan was wrong about that and his poor showing and prolonged absence from his district were not helpful in his re-election bid. What also didn't help Dornan or others in California was the early declaration by all the media that Bill Clinton had won the Presidency while the polls were still open out there. That caused many Republican leaning voters to skip the election. The Democrats did turn out, but participation by voters in California was at an historic low.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be most remembered for his passion on the issues of the sanctity of life and on our national defense which earned him the nickname B-1 Bob.
<dd>He was always ready for a confrontation. It was Dornan who helped to convince Pope John Paul II to issue the declaration forbidding Catholic priests to hold civil office. That forced Congressman and Catholic priest Robert Drinan to have to retire from his Congressional seat. Dornan particularly disliked Drinan's politics because he felt his fellow Roman Catholic had betrayed his faith.
<dd>It was Dornan who was willing to confront the homosexual lobby. The pro-life movement has other passionate advocates, but no one else in the entire Congress of either party is willing to take on the homosexuals. Dornan did and they were among the groups working hard for his defeat in this election.
<dd>Dornan is from the Fidel Castro school of political rhetoric. He can give a two hour speech and never notice the time. Moreover, I've been present when he has done so with the whole audience sitting on the edge of their chairs hanging on every word. He is tough to follow on the podium, I can tell you from personal experience.
<dd>Perpetually disorganized, Bob Dornan's office always looked like a scene from the movies just as the Second World War concluded. Yet he always knew exactly where everything was.
<dd>Congressman Robert Dornan is above all else a man of his convictions. In an era when pale pastels seems to be the way to get elected, Bob Dornan's colors are blinding. He distinguishes himself from most of his colleagues because he actually believes in what he says.
<dd>Bob Dornan leaves a great void in the Congress. Lots of conservatives were elected last week, but not a one of them has the sort of passion Bob Dornan represented. In that sense, he belongs to another era when politicians, without the benefit of slick television commercials, actually had to excite people. That he does. You are either for him or against him.
<dd>Bob Dornan's voice in the Congress may be silenced but I can assure you, you haven't heard the last of him yet. Some radio network will be fortunate enough to employ him and when they do, it won't be long before the nation will be talking about him the way it now talks about Rush Limbaugh.
<dd>He is one of a kind. Without him in the Congress, we need to invent someone just like Bob Dornan.

<h2>Remaining Undecided Races</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It has been a week since the voters have spoken but throughout the nation not all of the races have been settled yet.
<dd>Oregon supposedly adopted the most modern election system of all with its vote-by-mail operation. In the special election to replace the ousted Senator Bob Packwood, voters could cast their ballots over a three-week period. Well, that system wasn't in effect for this election, but the voters thought it was anyway. So over a third of the state's voters asked for and received absentee ballots. Come election night, officials could declare no winner in the contest to succeed retiring Senator Mark Hatfield. It took until last Friday night to determine that State Senate President Gordon Smith had won the election. Rep. Jim Bunn of Oregon had to wait still another day to find out he had lost his election.
<dd>Meanwhile in California, Rep. Bob Dornan has been hanging on by the skin of his teeth to the 233-vote margin he had on election night. Counting of absentee ballots is proceeding but election officials said they won't release the final results until tomorrow. Why on earth must it take over a week to count absentee ballots? Dornan now thinks there may have been tampering with these same ballots. He is toying with possibly seeking an injunction to keep the election records intact.
<dd>Up the coast in Washington state, not only the networks but also both parties have pronounced Rep. Linda Smith defeated in her re-election bid. The only problem with that is Smith is now leading as officials count the absentee vote. Her office contends there is no way she will lose the election. Meanwhile, in another Washington state district, Rep. Jack Metcalf, who was also pronounced as defeated by everyone, has narrowed the numbers between him and his opponent. If the that trend continues, there is some chance that he, too, could rise from the political dead.
<dd>Down in Louisiana, the canvass of all the precincts shows that Mary Landrieu has defeated State Rep. Woody Jenkins by 5,800 votes out of 1.7 million cast. However, Jenkins is morally certain that more than 5,800 fraudulent votes have been cast in that election. Proving it may be another problem. In Louisiana you sign a document when you register to vote and you sign another document when you actually show up to vote. If there is fraud, a comparison of signatures should do the job. Except that the Motor Voter law, on which Republicans acquiesced to President Clinton, makes those original signature cards, which used to be public documents, private documents. It now takes a court order to permit the Jenkins campaign to inspect the cards and there is no guarantee that the federal court will permit him to do so. If he fails in that attempt, he can ask the United States Senate to examine the election, but that would be unprecedented.
<dd>In Pennsylvania the recount is underway in the district where Rep. Jon Fox has held a 10-vote lead since election day. No one is alleging any fraud in that election. It was just an uncommonly close contest. Likewise, Rep. Peter Torkildsen of Massachusetts is hoping a recount will reverse his paper-thin defeat in that state's Democratic landslide. In these two races, the delay in the final results is justified because the results on election day were about evenly divided. But out on the West Coast, the delays in reporting the results are indefensible. In all three states where I have lived, absentee votes are counted on election day itself and simply added to the total, precinct by precinct. That way both candidates and voters know the results when the totals are reported. True, an election here or there can be so close that a recount must take place before a winner is certified. That happened in the Virginia Senate race of 1978 when John Warner finally emerged the winner by 4,000 some votes. But at least the preliminary totals were known on election night itself. This is all a matter of state regulation and it seems to me those West Coast states would do well to get with the rest of the nation in the way they count their ballots.
<dd>What has happened in Louisiana, however, is quite distinct from the other contests. The Jenkins campaign has been gathering evidence that gambling interests, which had several ballot propositions at stake in that election, spent money illegally to bus voters to the polls, which is not permitted by Louisiana law. Moreover these same gambling interests distributed ballots to those they recruited to vote. The ballots had Mary Landrieu's name on them, which is a likely violation of the law forbidding corporations to participate in federal elections. Jenkins has been an outspoken opponent of gambling in Louisiana. The most outrageous aspect of all of this is the open invitation to fraud which the Motor Voter law has brought about by not making the original registration signature cards available for public inspection. Former Congressman Rick Tonry was elected in that state in the 1970's when corrupt precinct officials added to the tally many of those who had registered but had not shown up to cast their ballots. When the voting records were examined, Congress vacated the seat and ran a new election and Congressman Bob Livingston was the victor of an honest count. In a state with that sort of history, cheating on elections should be made more difficult, not shielded by federal law. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that cliffhanger, the law there must be changed to make the sort of outcome we are now dealing with in Louisiana impossible to ever happen again.
<dd>If in this day and age elections can still be stolen with ease, then our system of government isn't safe. Who is to say how many Senate votes decided by a margin of one would go the other way if an election had been honest instead of corrupt. The whole nation has a stake in the outcome in Louisiana.

<h2>Speaker Should Step Down Temporarily</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Oklahoma's just re-elected Congressman Steve Largent has suggested that Newt Gingrich step down as Speaker of the House temporarily until ethics charges against him are cleared up. Gingrich has rejected the idea. 
<dd>Let me say at the outset that I believe that Gingrich will be exonerated from these charges. I have said so from the beginning. I continue to believe that.
<dd>But let me tell you why I think Largent is right when he argues that Gingrich should step aside for the time being.
<dd>One of the most important issues facing this Congress is how to handle the many scandals of the Clinton Administration. If Republicans go after Clinton in what is perceived to be too partisan a manner, they will end up getting into trouble with the voters. On the other hand, the charges against Clinton, unlike those against Gingrich, are serious. Many, especially the recent questions about campaign contributions by foreigners in exchange for subtle changes in US policy, are extremely troubling and could add up to real trouble for the President and his Administration.
<dd>Gingrich has a problem. From the time he took office and defended a multi million dollar book deal to the collapse of his no exit strategy on getting President Clinton to agree to Republican proposals on the federal budget, Gingrich has not fared well image wise with the American public. Add to this the hundreds of millions spent by the unions and others to attack Gingrich, and what we have is a weakened Speaker of the House. Granted, the Democrats do not control the Congress. But the margin is very close. A tarnished Gingrich will have problems upholding the Republicans as ethically sound while he weighs in against the many problems of the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>By stepping aside temporarily as Largent suggests, Gingrich would pave the way for himself to return stronger than ever. In effect, he would wipe the slate clean of his previous problems with the American public.
<dd>I know that would be a tough decision for the Speaker to make. His position is that since he believes he is innocent, there is no reason for him to do this. 
<dd>But think about it for a moment. Gingrich steps aside with an agreement that the investigations against him will be completed by a time certain. He says he is so certain of the outcome that he is willing to take this action so that the American public will have confidence in him and the Republicans when he is vindicated. 
<dd>This action contrasts with Bill Clinton. All we have heard since the election out of the Clinton Administration are rumors about trying to remove Janet Reno as Attorney General. Trying to find  a way to get at Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Clinton himself says he wants to go after his political enemies who have made Whitewater and other matters an issue.
<dd>Bill Clinton isn't going to be willing to step aside until he is vindicated of charges against him because, as he well knows, he is not likely to be vindicated. 
<dd>This Administration has been brilliant, however, at deflecting its own problems. Their rule is to attack the attacker. So if Gingrich makes any statements, as he did toward the end of the campaign, about the many serious charges pending against Clinton and his associates, spokesmen for the President will simply say that Gingrich has no right to make such charges when his own house isn't in order. 
<dd>While Harold Volkmer is gone, David Bonior is very much alive. The Gingrich inspired campaign to defeat him failed miserably. Bonior is going to be back full tilt in the 105th Congress. 
<dd>I believe that Steve Largent has suggested a course which is actually best for Speaker Gingrich and the country as a whole. It will enable Gingrich to seize the moral high ground. Assuming I am correct that Gingrich will be vindicated, he would take a short step backward to take a much larger step forward. If cleared of these ethics charges, he would return to the Speakership then with the ability to take on the Clinton Administration without their capacity to point to Gingrich as a way of shielding themselves.
<dd>But, you say, Congressman Bonior and his ilk would just file more charges as soon as the Speaker returns. That is , of course, possible, although Gingrich in the second half of the 104th Congress hasn't gone to the bathroom without checking with the ethics committee first. Yes, Bonior might file more charges but if the Speaker was willing to step aside and was subsequently vindicated, he would show those charges for what they are: pure politics and a payback for his having gone after Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright. 
<dd>I am sure that that the initiative Largent took has made Gingrich either hurt or angry. The Speaker should rise above his feelings. Largent has actually suggested a way for Gingrich to restore his moral credibility with the nation.

<h2>Drunkenness at the Helm of Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Back in the Cold War days, political leaders routinely saw blocks of nations dividing the international landscape. In those days our heads of state worked hard to maintain a balance between opposing forces: the Communist world and free world; the East against the West; Russia and China verses the United States.
<dd>Apparently, many of our citizens have forgotten the struggle that gave us the Iron Curtain, mutual assured destruction, and communist subversion within the U.S. counterculture.Today a new set of opposing forces has gathered with little notice in the press. 
<dd>While the U.S. is still the dominant force for freedom and democracy, that course is uncertain as we approach the 21st century. Much of the problem rests with an outdated world perspective upon which our elected leaders and appointed officials presuppose our nation's foreign policy. The Administration and its State Department still see the world as a collection of nations divided according to geography. Stabilization, democracy, and now environmental unity are the altruistic goals of the 90s.
<dd>Unfortunately the world has become far more complicated than the two-dimensional map would suggest. Like the Cold War, a serious division has emerged. This time the battle lines have been drawn between opposing cultures, one of which has become united behind a religion whose logical conclusion is world dominance.Unwilling to recognize this, Washington is squandering our nation's military and economic preparedness, by allowing our future to become steadily drunk at the international saloon of the United Nations and its appeasement politics. <dd>Drunkards slur their speech; our foreign policy experts make vague pronouncements. Drunkards are make fools of themselves; America's foreign policy leaders have disgraced their country. Drunkards are slow to react to sudden danger; America's foreign policy drunkards scarcely see what is happening in the world around them: leaders of the modern Islam have declared war on our society.
<dd>Islamic cultural leaders are committed to the ultimate destruction of the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It is a holy war, or jihad, as they call it. The generals of this war have constructed an unlikely alliance with China and Russia. Remember, Communist China still hates the U.S.  Also, half of Russia's population are anti-West and would willingly return to life as a communist nation. Over the past several years, these two nations have helped arm key Islamic client states, such as Syria, Iran and Iraq.Foreign policy inebriation is nothing laughing matter. 
<dd>Our nation cannot remain silent while its elected leaders and their appointees wile away our future and sacrifice our safety, passed out in the UN saloon. As citizens, we must demand from our government the thing our government has no right to possess. We must demand that Washington give America back to the people before it is too late.

<h2>An Examination of Election Results</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Some random and hopefully not too disconnected thoughts about yesterday's elections. 
<DD>First, we had the lowest voter turnout since the Presidential election of 1924 when the Democratic nominee John Davis was actually more conservative than the Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Those who wanted change opted out. It says a lot about our system when half of those who registered have declined to participate. Candidates of both parties failed to address the real concerns on the minds of the American people. Both parties are on life support systems, but, as if often the case, neither recognizes it yet.
<DD>Second, the big loser in this election was organized labor. They spent a minimum of $200 million to try to buy the Congress and it didn't work. Some of the money which was spent was spent illegally. That needs to be investigated.
<DD>Third, coming out of this election will be a big push for Common Cause-style campaign reform. If the Congress is foolish enough to pass such a bill, it will only make a bad system worse. Yes, we need to get foreign money out of politics. But as far as American citizens are concerned, we need to deregulate the process, not make it more difficult for candidates to comply with cumbersome laws.
<DD>Fourth, the caucuses of both parties in Congress in both Houses will be further apart as the result of the election. Republicans in this Congress are more conservative. It is hard to find liberal Republicans these days. It is equally hard to find conservtive Democrats. The Democrats in the Congress are more liberal.
<DD>Fifth, Bill Clinton may, in due course, wish he had lost. Investigations of wrong-doing in the Administration will continue and this time the Republicans will have their act together a bit better. Moreover, the bills are now going to come due for Bill Clinton from organized labor, the enviornmentalists and the radical lifestyle community. He will have to pay up or risk losing his base. But when he pays up, he will be perceived as moving to the left. That, in turn, will strengthen the Republicans in the next election, known as the six-year-itch election.
<DD>Every six years of a Presidential cycle where one party keeps the Presidency for eight years in a row produces a six-year reaction of great proportions. FDR caught it in 1938. Truman in 1946, Eisenhower in 1958, Johnson in 1966, Reagan in 1986. The last two years of the Clinton Administration, if he survives that long, may turn Clinton into the all-time lame duck.
<DD>Sixth, some of the non-Presidential and Congressional results may be, in the long run, more significant. The California Civil Rights initiavtive was passed handily, dealing a blow to affirmative action programs. Look for similiar initiatives elsewhere in the USA , which may even force the leadership of the 105th Congress to act. Meanwhile, Tax limitation initiatives passed nearly everywhere. A unique term-limits measure passed in nine states and may even yet pass in two others. If upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, this particular measure may finally be the key to winning the term-limits issue at the national level. If a district votes in favor of term limits and the Congressman disregards the voter's wishes, that information would be right there on the ballot the next time that Member of Congress came up for election.
<DD>Seventh, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who became the whipping-boy of the liberals, can take some comfort in the defeat of Harold Volkmer in Missouri. While David Bonior was very strident, Volkmer became a pathalogical opponent of the Speaker's. Volkmer will not be back next year. Gingrich will be. But all the power he managed to get the Republican caucus to cede to him at the beginning of the 104th Congress may not be appropriate for him as he tries to govern his reduced majority in the 105th Congress. He may be forced to give back some of that power to his colleagues to keep the ship together. By the way, the GOP loss in the House which will be anywherefrom 7 to 10 seats, compares very favorably to pick-ups for Presidents being re-elected to a second term. Ronald Reagan, in winning his landslide in 1984, gained 14 seats in the House.  
<DD>Finally, while there were some excellent men and women who were elected to Congress yesterday, there were few known leaders. We suffer so greatly for lack of leadership. Maybe the Lord will see fit to raise a few of them up to help lead this nation back to sanity.
<P>

<h2>Election Results Seldom Meet Expectations</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>In some locations in the nation, the polls are about to close, in others the polls will be open for another four hours yet, but soon enough we will know the verdict of the American people in this election.
<dd>Whatever the outcome, it is good to keep this election in perspective. Every two years I hear several people say, "This is the most important election we have ever faced in our history." Usually they cite some burning issue of the day as their reason for feeling that way. It is true that elections have significance, but usually that significance is not as profound as we think. When FDR was returned to office with a landslide and the Democrats actually gained seats in Congress for the fourth election in a row, FDR thought he could get whatever he wanted. He proposed packing the Supreme Court which had ben resistant to some of his initiatives. Yet it was that very Congress, where FDR's opposition had been reduced to next to nothing, which stopped his court-packing scheme.
<dd>My first election in which I was active in a major way was 1958. I was by then the youngest member ever to serve on the Board of the Young Republicans of Racine, County, Wisconsin. That year, we got wiped out by the explosion of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education or COPE. The Democrats won huge majorities in the Congress. Yet that Congress produced little of what the Democrats wanted. All of President Eisenhower's vetoes were upheld. He actually was a better President with that Congress than he had been when he was dealing with a much friendlier Congress. In fact, that Congress -- which was practically owned by big Labor -- passed the Landrum Griffin Labor Reform act over the strident opposition of the very Members of Congress who had been elected to stop it.
<dd>It is true that in 1964, then Conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater got crushed by Lyndon Johnson and the Congress which followed gave us all of the dreadful Great Society legislation we are still trying to cope with today. But also out of that election was born the modern conservative movement which produced Ronald Reagan, first as Governor of California and then as President.
<dd>The Democrats again crushed the Republicans in 1974 and some of my friends were suicidal. Yet that Congress upheld all but one of President Ford's vetoes. By the way, in my three decades here, the two least damaging Congresses were the Congress elected in 1966 and the Congress elected in 1978. Both anticipated the election of Republican Presidents and the Republicans finally got their act together and held off just about everything that was destructive.
<dd>Expectations were high for the Congress which came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980, and indeed the first eight months of the Reagan Administration were exciting and did good things. After that, it was back to more of business as usual. By the second session of that Congress, the largest tax increase in history, up until Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993, was passed and signed into law by Reagan.
<dd>The election of Bill Clinton with a Democratic Congress in 1992 was very troubling. Yet many bad initiatives were stopped by that Congress, some of which were passed by the Republican Congress which followed it. Expectations were never higher than two years ago. The first few months of the 104th Congress were terribly exhilirating. But that Congress too left town with a whimper with most of its urgent business left undone.  My point is simply this. Whichever way this election goes tonight, it will be neither as good nor as bad as contemporary observers believe it will be. If Bill Clinton gets back in with a Democratic Congress, probably a united and outraged Republican opposition may get its act together. On the other hand if somehow the voters deft the odds and elect Bob Dole with a Republican Congress, true believers out there who think the nation has now been saved will be disappointed. We may, in fact, get mixed results. I have come to believe that the American people do that by design. They give us a President of one party and a Congress of the other because in their minds less damage will be done that way, and sometimes they are correct.
<dd>What is important, in the long run, is not this particular election. What is important is that we begin to face our real problems as a nation. These are not the problems which were ever talked about by the major candidates in this election. They are the sort of problems being discussed by my colleagues Bill Lind and Brad Keena on the "Next Revolution." Sooner or later elected officials will be forced to face those problems. Let us fervently pray that at that moment in our nation's history, there will still be time.

<h2>Politicizing a Murder</h2>
<p>
Direct Line Commentary<br>
by <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>President Clinton is pretending
to be tough on crime and has taken to exploiting the murder of
12-year old Polly Klaas in order to get re-elected.  <dd>In a television
ad, narrated by Polly Klaas's father, Mark Klaas, he praises President
Clinton for forcing Congress to pass his tough crime bill.  He
goes on to say that the recent attacks on Clinton's character
are just politics and claims the President's character is evident
in his courage to protect children.  <dd>All politicians exploit tragedy
to get elected - Republicans used paroled murderer Willie Horton
as their example of how Michael Dukakis was soft on crime.  Now,
Democrats are doing it to show how Bill Clinton is tough on crime.
<dd>It is an election year, and we should expect nothing less from
any politician - if Mark Klaas were a Republican, I'm sure we'd
see him in a Bob Dole ad.  But the Clinton campaign has gone too
far in using Mark and Polly Klaas to counter Bob Dole's attack
on Clinton's character.  The truth is, Bob Dole has done nothing
that even resembles an attack - he has barely scratched the surface.
<dd>There is so much material fact on Clinton's lack of honor and
morality that this campaign has missed, that the Clinton campaign
would be better off not responding at all.  To top it off, Bill
Clinton is far enough ahead in the polls that there was no need
to even mention the word character. I have to admit that I have
a personal sadness when I see a grieving father embrace an administration
that has done nothing to prevent crime.  In fact, it has encouraged
crime by putting drug prevention on the back burner, putting lenient
judges - anti-death penalty judges - on the bench for life, and
by trying to outlaw ownership of guns by law abiding citizens.
<dd>But Mark Klass is an adult and he is free to endorse whichever
candidate he chooses.  I just don't have the faith that he is
getting all the facts.

<h2>Dole's Record Solid on Judges</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>I keep having people come to me asking the same question: "Give me one reason I should vote for Bob Dole for President," they ask. Okay, I'll give you a reason: The federal judiciary.
<DD>To date President Clinton has appointed 202 federal judges and 26% of the federal judiciary overall. His future appointments will even more dramatically shift the balance of the federal bench because the percentage of his activist appointees replacing more restrained Bush/Reagan appointees has steadily risen from 14% in 1993 to about 25% in 1995. That number will continue to rise because instead of activist Clinton judges replacing activist Carter judges, they will be replacing more restrained judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Whatever you may think of George Bush, by the way, his federal judge appointments were overall slightly better than those of Ronald Reagan.
<DD>13 judges have already announced that they will take "senior status."  132 district court and 42 appeals court judges will be eligible to take senior status by the end of a second Clinton term. So Bill Clinton's appointees could comprise almost 60% of the federal judiciary and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court if he has a second term in office.
<DD>Let me give you a few examples of the judges Bill Clinton has already managed to get on the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, regarded as "moderates" by Clinton standards, voted against single sex education, voted to block a ban on quotas for homosexuals, voted to require discrimination against religious expression, voted to allow race preferences in government, voted to allow the creation of racially segregated congressional districts, voted to block the voters wishes to have federal term limits and have voted to empower the federal government to regulate virtually every aspect of the economic life of the country.
<DD>This is just a sample of the sort of people Clinton has put on the court. Judges Blaine Michael and Diana Motz voted against excluding homosexuals from the military. Judge Carlos Lucero voted to declare a city seal with a cross unconstitutional, Judge Theodore McKee voted to abolish student-led graduation prayers. Judge H. Lee Sarokin argued that prison inmates have a constitutional right to receive mail uninspected by prison officials. Judge Martha Daughtrey voted to throw out drug and child pornography evidence. Judge James Beaty voted to overturn a double murder conviction because a juror had driven past the house where the murder took place. And so it goes. I could go on and on but you get the picture.
<DD>The same goes for those Clinton appointees left hanging when the 104th Congress adjourned. Clarence Sundram supports the legalization of drugs. Margaret Morrow supports gun control and has an extensive record of feminist activism. Margaret McKeown helped to turn the American Bar Association toward its current pro-abortion position and was the lead counsel in homosexual rights litigation. William Fletcher believes there is a "discretionary Constitution" judges may use to legislate from the bench. And believe me it would only get worse in a second Clinton term.
<DD>But, you may protest, Bob Dole voted for most of those Clinton judges. True enough because Dole supports the right of a President to pick judges as he wishes. He expects the same treatment from the Senate if he gets the chance to pick judges. Nevertheless, an August 1996 report by the Judicial Selection Monitoring project of the Free Congress Foundation gave Dole a 100% score. The tally included votes on 20 closely-divided, controversial judicial and Justice Department nominations. Each of the nominations chosen for the report presented a genuine choice between judicial activism and restraint. On each vote, Bob Dole chose restraint.
<DD>Now does that guarantee that all of Bob Dole's judges will be judges we would approve of? No it does not. President Bush made a concerted effort to pick good judges and wound up with David Souter on the Supreme Court. But that is because he took the word of his then Chief of Staff John Sununu who insisted that Souter was a judicial conservative. The former right wing Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thompson agreed with Sununu and said he would stake his career on Souter being conservative. Both were wrong. 
<DD>I know from personal experience Bob Dole has always worked hard to confirm judges which the left fought hard against. Ask Dan Manion, approved by a single vote margin in the Senate for an appeals court seat. Ask Clarence Thomas, approved by only a four vote margin. Each prevailed despite overwhelming opposition from the Left, and thanks in no small part to Bob Dole.  Moreover Dole has proposed doing away with the role of the American Bar Association in the judicial selection process. The ABA is controlled by the liberals and has often shot down some of the better judicial nominees which Reagan and Bush sought to put forth.
<DD>Bob Dole has said that "the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the utmost restraint - without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny."
<DD>Over the next four years the president will likely decide several Supreme Court Justices and perhaps a third of all federal judges. I don't know about you, but I would rather trust someone who has Dole's philosophy than I would the current occupant of the White House to decide those appointments. Let's put it this way. We know what sort of federal judges Bill Clinton will give us. There is a fair chance that Bob Dole's picks will be a lot closer to what the founding fathers had in mind.

<h2>Schools Sending the Wrong Message</h2>
<P>
"Direct Line" Commentary<br>
By Special Columnist <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<P>
<br>
<DD>Lately it seems that America's schools are spending more time playing parent than teaching our kids how read, write, and spell. Schools all over the country are getting out of hand with their "It Takes A Village" mentality, confusing their role as educators with the role of parents, or acting fearful that one wrong move will bring on a lawsuit.
<P>Take for example the most recent news of Kimberly Smartt, the girl who was suspended for four months for taking a Midol tablet and giving one to a friend. The school claims that she violated the drug policy and is forcing her to pay for and undergo drug counseling. Kimberly, who is black, claims she is a victim of race discrimination and is suing the school superintendent, school principal and the county board of education. All of this over a drug that is as harmless as Tylenol and caffeine and a problem that could have been solved with one trip to the principal's office. What makes this situation more outrageous is that this very same girl could be given a condom or help in obtaining an abortion by the school without a blink of an eye.
<P>You may also remember the case in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania where 39 8th grade girls were given gynecological exams without their parents' consent. The school not only didn't think there was anything wrong with this, they actually argued that they were mandated by law to do it. No outrage on the part of the school there.
<P>And how about the schools around the country that are making it mandatory for students to volunteer as a requirement of graduation. Not just any volunteer work will do, it must be approved by the school and as you may have guessed, activities including religion or pro-life work is frowned upon or not allowed at all.
<P>What all of this means is that the liberal Department of Education and Hillary devotees are having an impact on our school system to the degree that education is now secondary. The schools know what's best for your child even if it defies common sense and violates your moral beliefs. Bob Dole articulated the first step in solving this problem the other night during the debate. When asked if he still supported abolishing the Department of Education, he said yes. What more needs to be said?

<h2>A Preview of a Union-Controlled Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<DD>The U.S. Senate should have adjourned last night, but instead it is still in session because Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of organized labor, invoked arcane Senate rules to try to "exact one more pound of flesh for labor as we head out of here," as Majority Leader Trent Lott put it.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin wanted a certain provision dropped from the bill which funds the FAA and other agencies. This provision would have corrected what is viewed as a mistake in legislation which passed the last Congress. That mistake had the effect of making it easier for unions to organize Federal Express. Senator Fritz Hollings, one of only few Democrats not owned by the labor unions, sponsored the rider which would correct the mistake and put Federal Express back on a level playing field with everyone else.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin even caused the bill in question to be read to the Senate for hours on end. This hasn't happened in anyone's memory, but anything to please organized labor. Senator Harkin is up for re-election in Iowa and so confident of victory that he can afford to engage in such blatantly special-interest politics. By the way, 80% of Harkin's big war chest for his re-election comes from out of state, and most of that from the unions. No wonder he is doing their bidding. 
<DD>I mention this obscure moment in history because it is an illustration of things to come if the unions are successful in their quest for a change in who controls Congress. Already union bosses have a disproportionate influence over public policy way out of line for the number of people they now represent. There was a time, in the private sector, where unions had organized a third of the work force. In some states the unions were so strong that employers had to ask their permission before hiring anyone. Today union strength is at around 10% of the private sector work force and it is continuing to decline. Public sector unions are much stronger but even there big labor's grip has been loosened in some states with Republican Governors and legislatures.
<DD>The fact is that old fashioned unionism is out of step in our highly competitive society. The unions believe otherwise. Ask ValuJet. They began flying again yesterday after a three-month shutdown following the fatal crash in the Florida Everglades. While no one wants to cut corners on safety, the shutdown ordered by the FAA is unprecedented considering the type of crash. But ValuJet is non-union and the unions wanted the airline grounded. So, the FAA obliged, shutting down ValuJet even before investigators had determined the cause. Union lawyers are still in court trying to get an injunction to once again ground ValuJet. This argument is not about safety. ValuJet, with months of non-stop inspections and a good portion of its fleet not yet up and running, is probably the safest airline in the skies right now. This argument is about unions. If ValuJet can make a go of it with its highly attractive prices, the contracts the unions have negotiated with the other airlines come under great pressure. So it appears that the unions used their friends in the Clinton Administration to ground the airline. Unfair you say? Again, just a preview of coming attractions if the unions prevail.
<DD>And it does look promising for them. They are spending huge sums of money to defeat Republican freshmen and to win open seats. Republicans, who hoarded their money until these last weeks before the elections, are still not competitive. Meanwhile, the unions have pulled out all the stops, even to the point of deliberately violating federal election law, just so they can spend more money to buy the Congress. They don't care at this point. They are confident of winning.
<DD>Unions should have been out of business in the 104th Congress, yet they forced the issue of a minimum wage increase and the Republican Congress gave in. In fact anything objectionable to the labor unions was either killed in Congress, which didn't want the fight or was vetoed by President Clinton.
<DD>If the union bosses can get that much accomplished in the Republican 104th Congress, imagine what they can do with a Congress whose majority they have bought and paid for. This should be a hot issue in this election. But, alas, the union bosses have succeeded in intimidating the Republican majority who are now afraid to take the union bosses head on.
<DD>Go ahead. Tune into C-Span 2 and watch the union bosses at work through their surrogates Kennedy and Harkin and others. Then close your eyes and imagine the next session of Congress when these people could well be in the driver's seat. If that isn't enough to motivate you to get active in the electoral process, I don't know what will.

<h2>A Look Back at the 104th Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The 104th Congress whimpered to an end, a mere farthing of its former self. This is the 15th Congress I've had the privilege of witnessing from start to finish. In the past three decades, only this Congress and the 97th Congress, which came in with Ronald Reagan, actually seemed poised to pass positive initiatives for the American people. Each passed one truly significant piece of legislation. In the 97th Congress it was the Reagan tax cuts. In this Congress it was welfare reform. Each of those Congresses did pass other positive legislation as well. The 104th Congress may well be remembered in the future for the line item veto, but if Bill Clinton is President the next four years, that is not likely to be a positive memory.
<DD>Each Congress is also noted for having lost its nerve along the way. In the 97th Congress, that meant passing TEFRA, which up to that point was the largest tax increase in history. For this Congress, it was throwing in the towel in the attempt to kill all sorts of undesirable government programs.
<DD>Expectations were unreasonably high for this Congress. But then the American people had just caused one of the largest Congressional turnovers in modern history. They wanted to be heard through their representatives. The first few months were exciting. The House of Representatives passed item after item in the Contract with America. But the U.S. Senate broke the back of that momentum when it failed to pass a Constitutional Amendment for a balanced budget. Even though that amendment would not have been ratified instantly by state legislatures, it would have provided a framework within which Congress would have most likely operated. When that battle was lost, Congress then tried to pass a balanced budget through legislation. But when Bill Clinton stopped that and it was back to business as usual for the remaining session.
Except for welfare, this Congress never came to grips with the rest of the entitlements. It never tackled the crippling national debt we shoulder. It left much of the important work to the next Congress.
<DD>The freshmen Republicans, who came to Washington so determined to make a difference, found that they were unable to move their more senior colleagues who were not impressed with the election results. Now, most of those freshmen are seriously threatened for re-election. The unions are spending up to $2 million per Congressional district to defeat them. This doesn't include what the environmental groups, radical lifestyle organizations and the Democratic party itself is spending. When you hear that Republicans have more money to spend in this election than the Democrats, don't you believe it.
<DD>Despite GOP Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon's brave words, a number of these freshmen won't be back. Unfortunately for those that do return, the lesson they may learn from this could be that you can't tackle the Washington establishment and win.
<DD>Sunday night on PBS, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott debated would-be Speaker Dick Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. I say debated. It was more like a friendly argument over who had indeed spent the most money for education and school lunches and who could better protect Medicare.
<DD>All of the passion which brought the Republican Congress to power was gone. There seems to be far too little difference between the two political parties. The differences seemed profound only two years ago.
<DD>For the 105th Congress, the American people need to send to Washington another crop of freshmen similar to the ones they sent in 1994. That seems less likely, however. This election is not being fought over the issue of freedom. Even though it is true, no one has made the case that the future of the very Republic is at stake this time around. In 1994, Republicans painted the big picture of the threat of intrusive government promoting radical ideas. That big picture is almost entirely missing from this election.
What a pity that Republicans lost their nerve. The folk lore here is that the government shut down was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans. I disagree. They were on the road to winning the issue when they caved in and they haven't recovered from that mistake since. 
<DD>We can only hope that in local races for Congress, absent the overarching theme, there are candidates who still believe that tackling the crippling problems of America the Bankrupt are important. Maybe we just aren't hearing about them back here. I fervently hope so. America does not need a 105th Congress less committed to sanity and true reform than this one was.

<H2>Watergate All Over Again</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is an honest but doctrinaire liberal. There is hardly an issue where he and I don't disagree. Recently, however, he reversed himself on the partial birth abortion issue because, he said, he was misled by the pro-abortionists who had claimed – incorrectly – that it was a rarely-used procedure.
<p>
But Cohen can usually be counted on to boost the liberal end of the Democratic agenda. That is why it was startling to read his column in this morning's Post in which he suggests that we might be on the verge of reliving history. The sort of history Cohen has in mind is Watergate, 24 years ago. Then, as he correctly points out, Washington was consumed with the Watergate story but out in the countryside it didn't mean a thing. Richard Nixon was overwhelmingly re-elected. Then the nation had to come to grips with the Constitutional crisis that followed.
<p>
What troubles Cohen and should trouble all of us is the reaction of the White House in the face of the latest report by the office of Inspector General of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hillary Clinton was involved in an effort to deceive federal regulators into approving a sham real estate transaction, the report said. But the reaction of the White House is to attack those who have written the report. According to the Clinton White House, those who wrote the report were unduly pressured by Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
<p>
As to the other troubles visited on the Clintons, why, that is all the fault of the alleged partisan activities of Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Even Clinton himself has gone on the attack against Starr, echoing the complaint of Susan McDougal who says she'll rot in jail because Starr wants her to lie about the Clintons. Of course, this same Bill Clinton has hinted that he would not rule out a pardon for Susan McDougal and the others.
<p>
All of this has a familiar ring not just to Cohen but to the rest of us who were here in Washington at the time of Watergate. I cheered when then Republican National Chairman Senator Bob Dole told us that Watergate was just the product of the liberals being pushed by the left-wing Washington Post. "Tell it like it is, Bob," I thought as I watched Dole defend misdeeds at the White House. It turns out Dole had been lied to about the situation by Nixon and company so he was doing what he thought was right.
But the tactic is the same. When you can't explain your actions, blame someone else for asking the questions.
<p>
In the same paper in which Cohen's column appears there is a headline spread across page A-10 which reads "GOP Says White House Logs on Readers of FBI Reports have 6 Month Gap." Hmmm. Sound familiar? The 18 minute gap on a tape-recording just about sealed Richard Nixon's fate. But, of course, the Clinton White House blames their gap on a low-level aide named Mari Anderson, who just happens to be in hiding right now, unable to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't worry Mari. Congress is about to go out of session and then you can come out of hiding. After all, it's only five weeks until the elections and Bill Clinton's second term triumph. He'll take care of you and all the rest after that.
<p>
Yes, Cohen is exactly right. We have heard all of this before and it has an eerie ring to it. The fact is Richard Nixon's list of transgressions is minor compared with Bill Clinton's. If, in one narrative, you string together all of the problems this Administration has had, it is absolutely mind boggling. Yet the nation seems to care less. Things are going well. Unemployment is low. Inflation is stable. The stock market is high. We are all just fat, dumb and happy.
<p>
However, it is clear to Cohen and should be to the rest of the country that we may well be headed for the repeat of what happened in 1972: a Presidential re-election triumph and then a Constitutional crisis thereafter. No wonder the cartoon character Doonsbury, penned by the liberal but politically savvy Gary Trudeau, is preoccupied with Al Gore pretending to already be President. If this is indeed history repeating itself, then Gore ought to be President by 1998.
<p>
But wait a minute, folks. We are not the victims of some unstoppable historical forces. We have the power to make a difference. The clock hasn't stopped yet. We can still determine who wins in November. There is still time to wake up from the collective dream we Americans seem to be in to do something about this sorry mess before it is indeed too late.<p>

<h3>September 25, 1996</h3>
<H2>New Hope for the Senate</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
As a follow up to a commentary of a couple of weeks ago, there is some good news to report. After we took on Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the GOP Senatorial Campaign Committee, over the matter of his lack of support for Woody Jenkins, the endorsed GOP candidate in Louisiana, things began to happen.
<P>
Picking up that theme, Columnist Bob Novak wrote a column quoting this commentary and his piece ran in the New York Post. D'Amato got the message. Realizing that if the Louisiana general election ended up with two Democrats facing each other he would have it hung around his neck, D'Amato swung into action. The Senatorial committee began to poll to see which of the six GOP candidates had a chance to be in the runoff. They found, to their utter surprise, that Woody Jenkins was that candidate. Jenkins had built up a significant organization to the point where he scored in lower double digits even though most of his opponents had spent millions of dollars on television which Jenkins didn't have to spend.
<P>
Based on that data, D'Amato first tried to get other candidates to withdraw from the race. They would not do so. So, D'Amato got together with other GOP leaders in the state and one by one they agreed to support the candidate so that in the last week before the election, each day a different prominent Republican endorsed Jenkins. Four days before last Saturday's election, D'Amato then wired the Jenkins campaign about half of the money they could have given under the law so that Jenkins could, at the end, have lots of television and radio commercials. All of this created a surge effect. When the ballots were counted, Jenkins was not only in the runoff, he placed first among all the candidates. As a result, Republican Woody Jenkins will face Democrat Mary Landrieu, the daughter of the former mayor of New Orleans.
<P>
D'Amato called me to assure me that what happened was all part of the plan from the beginning. His own staffers assure me that it was not. But in any case, what happened worked. Now Republicans have a better than 50-50 shot at taking the Senate seat. In the primary, all the Republican candidates combined got about 58% of the vote. The Democratic candidates got 42% of the votes. Landrieu is on the far left of the Democratic party, although she is now trying to run as a moderate. Jenkins is the most solid conservative running for the U.S. Senate in the country. He is not backing away from his views at all. So we have a classic philosophical contest. Of course, the turnout in November will be far higher and right now Bill Clinton has a huge lead in Louisiana, but still Jenkins can be considered the slight favorite. 
<P>
What happened in Louisiana mirrors what has happened in just about all the states except in the East. Conservatives have been nominated for the U.S. Senate. Except for Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican nominees are good on the issues. 
<P>
The liberal mantra is that conservatives can win primaries but they will all be defeated in the general election. Some no doubt will. But some will also likely be elected. Al Salvi is running an outstanding campaign against Congressman Dick Durbin in Illinois. He is behind, but he showed in his primary that he knows how to come from behind to win. Sam Brownback in Kansas is an excellent campaigner. He is slightly ahead in his contest with Jill Docking. In Alabama, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is slightly ahead. Congressman Tim Hutchinson has a shot at winning the Senate seat in Arkansas despite Bill Clinton's being at the top of the ticket. In Colorado, Congressman Wayne Allard is even in the polls with lawyer/lobbyist Tom Strickland. And so it goes. I don't have time to mention all of the races at this point. 
<P>
But the point is this. Unless the Republicans are completely destroyed by a Democratic surge at the end of the election, similar to what happened with the Republicans in 1994, the Senate should be an improved body after November.
<P>
That is good news for those of us who have been so frustrated by the Senate's resistance to constructive measures passed by the House.
<P>
Oh, and by the way. If it is clear that Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected, the Wall Street Journal poll reports that by a margin of 53% to 39%, voters want a Republican Congress to keep Clinton in check, rather than a Democratic Congress which can enact more of Bill Clinton's agenda.
<P>
The fact is there is some hope after all in this otherwise dismal political season.
<P>

<h2>VMI Decision Tragic for the Nation</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
A tragedy occurred in the State of Virginia over the weekend for which the whole nation will pay. By a one-vote margin, the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted to end its 157 years as an all-male academy. Beginning with the 1997 school term, VMI will admit women.
<P>
By the same 9 - 8 vote, the Board also rejected a plan to take the school private - a move by which the Board could have avoided a court order requiring the admittance of women.
<P>
The action against VMI began in the Bush Administration. The State of Virginia fought against it. But earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-supported all-male schools are unconstitutional. Never mind that the State of Virginia has opened a military academy just for women so that women who desired a military education could have an equal chance to do so under the law. No, that wasn't good enough for the fanatical Supreme Court, the majority of whose Justices deserve to be impeached for undermining the Constitution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Virginia Board of Visitors could have maintained VMI's all-male status by voting to take VMI private, thereby placing the school out of the reach of the court ruling. But, the Board voted not to. What was tragic about that narrow decision is that it was dictated not by what is right for the country whose military VMI serves, not by what was best for the students attending VMI, not by the wishes of the alumni who were prepared to raise the money to buy the school, but by the liberal media and its accomplices in the political community.
<P>
Virginia's Republican Governor, George Allen, who had originally supported VMI in its court case, changed his position, a few days before the Board of Visitors meeting. Allen got a case of political correctness and declared VMI should not go private because the media would make it into a pariah institution. That statement was enough to tip the balance in favor of admitting women. Several of Governor Allen's appointees to the Board of Visitors voted to reject the motion to take the school private.
<P>
Thanks, Governor Allen, the supposed conservative Republican with national ambitions. We'll remember this whenever you seek whatever office it is you want after leaving the Governorship next year.
<P>
I well recall the words of Dr. Ben Alexander, the former President of The University of the District of Columbia. He courageously tried to get rid of the politician imposed students who were not there to learn but just to get a worthless degree. Dr. Alexander wanted to place standards on UDC. He was doing exactly the right thing. Many of us tried to help him. But he resigned. Afterward, I asked him why he resigned when it was the right fight at the right time. He said because he was told that if he continued to fight the Washington Post would ruin him. "If I had NET back then, I might well have stayed to fight," Dr. Alexander said. But this was in the early 80's before there were many alternative means of communications.
<P>
Ben Alexander at least had an excuse. What is the excuse of the majority on the VMI Board? That their Governor considers them an embarrassment? That they would be attacked by the national media? Just when are we going to get some people in this country who will say "I don't care if we get attacked. This is the right thing to do. We are going forward." I will tell you there would be an emotional outpouring of support that would amaze and overwhelm the politicians. 
<P>
But no, the majority on the VMI Board had to listen to the state's chief politician who just didn't want the fight, lest it damage his plans for national office. Well, Governor Allen has likely brought VMI to the end of the line as a viable institution. "Without a distinctive, attractive educational niche, VMI, a small school with limited offerings in close proximity to three major state universities, will lose its ability to compete for students," Anita Blair, a VMI trustee who voted in favor of taking the school private, said after the vote. "A coed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs at Virginia Tech and elsewhere." She is absolutely right. And who will suffer in the process? The U.S. military which has used VMI to train officers now for over a Century and a half.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public and the politicians asked themselves why it is that the media should be able to dictate what private citizens want to do? The pseudo macho majority on the VMI Board said they aren't going to change a thing at VMI when it admits women. Right. They claim that the tradition of treating freshmen cadets as rats, with shaved heads, will continue. It will never happen. But even if it did I would be against it. Women, even if they desire this kind of punishment, should not be treated this way and as the Citadel has proven, at the end of the day, they won't be.
<P>
It is all part of the effort to pretend that men and women are all the same. It is the same sort of pretend world that the Soviets invented with their concept of the "new man." It defies reality. But this sort of fiction is permitted to continue because politicians such as Governor Allen refuse to stand up and fight for what is right.
<P>
It is no wonder that Robert Bork was motivated to write his new book "Slouching Toward Gomorra." The culture is collapsing, not just because forces of evil such as elements of the media are pushing it in that direction, but because in public life there are no real men left who are willing to stand up and say "enough is enough."
<P>

<h2>A Gap Bigger Than Gender</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick of the Polling Company provided us with data on a survey taken from September 5th through the 12th on who will control the Congress. Her conclusion is that whatever happens in the Presidential race, Congress is going to remain in Republican hands. That conclusion is verified by several other recent polls which show the Republicans even or with a slight edge. The Polling Company finds Democrats with a one point edge, but traditionally Republicans perform better than the so-called generic ballot-test for Congress.<P>
We hear a great deal about the gender gap and indeed Kellyanne does find such a gap. But her research finds the gender gap at 8 points and not the 20 plus points which the so called mainstream media keeps touting. Kellyanne is the one, genuinely culturally-conservative pollster in the business and I trust her results. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a three-point advantage with Generation X voters (from 18 to 29 years of age) and a two-point advantage with Baby Boomers. But Republicans are down two points with so called pre-retirees (that’s my age group) and down five points among seniors. That’s not surprising considering the amount of propaganda put forth by the unions and liberals on Medicare and Social Security.<P>
Now come the kickers. Here are the real gaps in American politics. Singles favor the Democrats for Congress by six percentage points. Those who are married but without children favor the Democrats by eight percentage points. But those married with children favor the Republicans by a whopping 10 percentage points!<P>
I mentioned this to Kellyanne at a dinner last night and she said, "Yes, It’s the three M’s." Three M’s? What are the three M’s? "Marriage, Mortgage and Munchkins," she replied. If you want your children to vote for conservatives for Congress, not only do they need to be married, they also need to have children, Miss Fitzpatrick said. So the gap between those who are married and have children and those who are married without children is greater than the gap between men and women. Apparently, there is nothing like a few responsibilities to make voters understand who favors policies in their best interests.<P>
But let’s talk about the truly gigantic gap in American politics. Yes, there is a gap bigger than either gender or marriage. Among those who don’t listen to talk radio at all, the Democrats hold a nine-point advantage in the race for Congress. Among those who listen to talk radio five hours or more a week, the Republicans hold an incredible 16-point margin. Among those who listen to talk radio only one to four hours a week, the margin for the Republicans is just three points.<P>
So now things are clearing up nicely. If we care what kind of Congress we have, we must see to it that the young people we know get married and have children quickly. We must introduce talk radio to these young families immediately. I don’t have the figures for those who are married, have children and listen to talk radio, but the gap must be gargantuan.<P>
Mrs. Weyrich and I are about to become grandparents for the first time. My wife has all sorts of plans to get a cradle for the baby and car seats for each of the cars, and heaven knows what else. Well all of that is fine. But as for me, I’m buying this new little family several radios, each tuned to the best talk shows in the business. Hey, I care about my future!<P>

<h2>Dwelling in the Past</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Yesterday I attended part of a two day conference called " A Dialogue on race" at Towson State University in Baltimore. The conference was sponsored by a group called "Search for Common Ground" which promotes dialogues between opposing groups worldwide. They are active in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and have set up a dialogue between pro life and pro choice groups here in the United States.<p>

I stayed for only part of the conference because once my friend Lawry Chickering, the President of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in California, for whom I have great respect, persuaded me to go, we had a next to impossible time finding out the schedule of the event and meanwhile I got committed to other things. <p>

But I was present for the entire session which dealt with the barriers to racial progress. The group consisted of about half whites and half blacks. There were no Hispanics and only one Asian American present. Four of us were conservative philosophically. The rest ranged from left to far left. <p>

What struck me about the whole exercise was the fixation most of the blacks and many of the whites had on the past. The outstanding editor of the Heritage Foundation's magazine Policy Review, Adam Meyerson, tried to introduce the notion that many blacks represent the American dream. They have overcome slavery and segregation and have gone on to become prosperous and successful and have made important contributions to the society in which we live. Meyerson suggested that it would be well to study those examples as role models since they had, in fact, achieved the progress the others were seeking. <p>

That did not go over very well in this room filled with professionals, many of whom make their living working on the issue of racial conflict. After all, if we solved racial problems, some of these folks would be out of work. 
We were told that unless we could identify with and experience the pain suffered by blacks because of slavery, segregation and racism, we could never  make any progress. <p>

I began to think about that. The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed impossible demands on Germany after World War One, caused my family terrible trouble. They had never been wealthy. But what little they had was wiped out. They became poverty stricken and unable to support themselves financially. For such a reason did my father become the first in his family, at age l9, to journey to America in l923 to seek a decent living.<p>

All my life I have heard stories about that era and the pain it caused. I can acknowledge, and have done so, that the Versailles Treaty was unwise and unjust. But should I go around and insist that everyone else comprehend the damage done to my family because of that injustice? Granted, those conditions lasted a much shorter time than did slavery and segregation. But the principle is the same. <p>

I want to know about that era because I want to understand why my family on my father's side came here. I want to understand what happened in case world leaders ever again try to humiliate a nation the way France insisted on humiliating Germany back then. We know the consequences of that action. The Versailles Treaty created the conditions which made Adolph Hitler possible. <p>

But I did not remain dead in the water because of that injustice. Nor do I insist on discussing it constantly. 
Now I was told at that conference that, of course, my family could make progress because we were white. Oh, really? Does anyone remember what it was like being a German in-between the two World Wars? You were suspect. You were discriminated against. Laws were passed to prevent German language newspapers from being printed. A law in Wisconsin even stopped the sermons in German at the local parish church and the church bulletin had to be printed half in English and half in German. It was not a fun era. It was overcome by perseverance, discipline and hard work. <p>

Even though my family came from Germany and Norway, long after slavery had been instituted here, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that this did great injustice to black people. I am perfectly willing to stipulate that segregation laws were unjust and that blacks got the short end of the stick for many years. <p>

But I am not willing to try to go through some exercise where I am expected to identify with the pain black people suffered back then any more than I should expect them to understand the pain my family suffered because of the unjust Versailles Treaty. These things happened. One participant did acknowledge that it was liberating for him to have learned that in history blacks sometimes oppressed other blacks and that whites sometimes enslaved other whites because he had been brought up with the notion that only whites had enslaved blacks.  True enough. Some of the blacks who came to the United States were sold to their white slave owners by other blacks. <p>

History is good to know and to understand, but it is not healthy or, productive to try to constantly relive that history. That is what prevents progress in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and elsewhere. Yes, we must acknowledge and ask God's forgiveness for injustices. But the main thing is that we work to be sure there is a level playing field because, as Meyerson has pointed out, many who have used that level playing field have made great progress.<p>
 
As for me, I don't need a conference to tell me what needs to be done. All I have to do is to take my Christian faith seriously. Many blacks are very religious people. I have more in common with them than I have with secular non believing whites. We can all move forward because of shared beliefs. Christianity is nothing if it is not a religion of forgiveness. In that context, and with the acknowledgment of past injustices, we have the framework for real progress. <p>

No, we should never forget the past. Nor should we try to relive the past. God put us here and now in this time and in this age. For that we should be grateful. We might start by thanking God for the privilege of living here. Having visited more than 50 nations in the world, I can affirm that it is a privilege even for the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps then, with a sense of gratitude, we can move to overcome artificial barriers to progress, some of which are constructed by the very people whose job is supposed to be to tear them down.

<h2>Absent Shame, Morris Profits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>




<P>In the latest chapter involving former Presidential advisor Dick Morris, it now seems that he is about to become a TV talk show host and will be paid a huge talent fee for doing so.
This comes after his $2 million deal with a publisher in which Morris has agreed to write a book about his exciting year and a half with Bill Clinton.<P>
The more sordid the details which emerge about this whole affair, the greater the profit for Dick Morris. And that says all you need to know about the wretched state of things in contemporary America.
When the story first broke about Morris during the Democratic convention and he was forced to resign, who was it that called him from their campaign bus to offer sympathy? Why President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. As one observer noted, it was as if Morris had been injured in a car accident. Not since that day has Bill Clinton or the prematurely canonized Al Gore ever said a single word to the effect that they disapprove of what Dick Morris did. We know Clinton and Gore think it is terrible that the prostitute was disloyal. We know they think it is terrible that the rest of the media published her tabloid account. What the American people have not heard from the President and Vice President are words to the effect that "we are sickened by what has been done here and we think Dick Morris should be ashamed of himself."<P>
No, indeed. In the past, political figures who had done far less were sent into exile for years. But Morris didn't have to endure even a day of shame for what happened. Not even from his wife. I am all for forgiveness and I don't like to see any marriage break up for any reason. My initial reaction when I heard the Morris story was to extend sympathy to Mrs. Morris whom I regarded as the real victim. But I should not have bothered. She didn't need my sympathy. She was too busy posing for the front cover of Time Magazine. By that gesture not only did she tell her husband that such behavior was acceptable, but by implication she was critical of any other wife who would have suffered extreme humiliation over what happened. She said she didn't want the details because she is an adult. How positively noble. She even quoted scripture saying that "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". It is comforting to know, I suppose, that anything from the scriptures has penetrated the consciousness of those two. <P>
Far from suffering, Dick Morris is actually better off financially from what happened than if he had simply stayed in the background and had continued to advise Clinton all the way to the election. No doubt, if Clinton is re-elected, there will be a line of future candidates at Morris' door just waiting to sign him up for all his brilliance. In fact, now even if Clinton loses, Dick Morris won't suffer. He can claim it is because he was forced to resign.<P>
It isn't just that all of this has happened that is so bad. It is the deafening silence about it from the rest of the political community. Granted Bob Dole is not in a position to say much about this, but what of the rest of his party? In their bid to show extreme tolerance, the Republicans have contributed to this dreadful situation by failing to proclaim that what Morris did is just plain wrong. The most we heard from the Republican camp was a bit of chortling because the incident caused Bill Clinton problems. That even stopped abruptly when the media pointed out that Morris had worked for Trent Lott and Jesse Helms among others. <P>
In the Old Testament God sent a plague of snakes to bite the Israelites just because they complained that they were sick of  eating the Manna from Heaven which the Lord had provided. God punished their audacity.<P>
What will it take to punish ours?<P> 
It is true that all through the history of humanity, from the Garden of Eden on, God's laws have been broken by mankind . But I guess one would have to go back to Sodom and Gomorra to find a time when people flaunted their immorality as much as they do today. Of course, God destroyed those cities.
Must we tempt God to do the same here by completely destroying the sense of shame in this nation?<P>

<h2>Conventions Losing Their Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>

<P>A few parting thoughts about the Republican convention in San Diego.<P>
First, we will never know if my VP prediction would have come true. I had Bob Dole picking Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio as his running mate, but Voinovich took himself out of the running before the convention ever started. He told me privately that "no one with a last name like mine would ever get selected as a nominee of this party," a reference to his Eastern European roots. Be that as it may, Voinovich was a Catholic from a large Midwestern industrial state and might have helped Dole there. But I admit that Dole got a great deal more from his actual choice. Jack Kemp has fused the Dole campaign and Dole himself with energy and that is something that Voinovich would not have done as well. Moreover, Kemp is able to communicate with lots of voters Dole had virtually no chance of getting. To the extent that Vice Presidential picks ever help their Presidential nominees, this one certainly did and Dole has to be given an A for imagination and surprise on his choice.<P>
The convention itself was another matter. Having participated in one way or another in eight other Republican conventions since 1960, this was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a real convention. It was a four-day glorified infomercial. To be fair, the Democrats started that trend with the convention they produced in 1992 which bore little relationship to the delegates in attendance but was calculated to recast Bill Clinton as a New Democrat. They succeeded and Republicans got the picture.<P>
The delegates themselves had nothing to say about this convention. Every word, every image, even the demonstrations were scripted. To be sure there was a certain amount of scripting which occurred at every convention in the modern era. But the control of this convention was breathtaking. Members of the Politburo would have been proud. Next week we will have the Democratic version of the same scripted orchestration.<P>
The institution of the political convention cannot endure this level of contrivance for very long. Delegates who go to the trouble of getting themselves elected, based on representing grassroots networks of followers, are simply not going to tolerate paying all of that money to become a delegate only to be told they count for nothing and can't even cast the vote for which they were elected in the first place.
No, what we witnessed in San Diego and what we will witness in Chicago is not a political convention. I've been to enough of them to know the difference. What we witnessed was a grand scale TV production, in the case of San Diego, run by Mike Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image maker who later went to federal prison for improper lobbying. The irony is that most people did not watch this television spectacular. The Democrats are now worried that even fewer people will watch theirs. Except for the question of how Hillary's speech will match Elizabeth Dole's, there is really nothing interesting likely to take place there. So for all of their efforts to put on a good TV show, and it was that, the convention handlers did not achieve what a real convention, with some drama, conflict and good old fashioned political battles would have done. It did not produce an audience.<P>
With major media outlets already saying enough is enough, the era of this sort of political convention is about over. For my money good riddance. If the price of a party getting its message out is to deprive the delegates of their freedom to act as delegates, then this kind of convention is not worth having. Haley Barbour, Republican National Chairman, is busy congratulating himself on a flawless convention. I hope he has fond memories. It will probably be the last of its kind.<P>
Thanks to the many of you who called us, wrote us, E-mailed us or faxed us on our convention coverage. Our crew in San Diego, led by Peter Estrada and Greg Jenkins, worked incredibly hard. They drove themselves to the point of exhaustion. While others were out partying, the NET crew was still working. We had to. We did with less than 20 people what the major networks did with 500. We appreciate many of you saying that our coverage was better than theirs.<P>
As to Bill Lind's commentaries which some of you disliked, I asked Bill to write about this convention the way that the late H.L. Menken wrote about politics in the earlier part of this Century from his headquarters at the Baltimore Sun. Lind did just that, and he made some people angry in the process. Well stay tuned. He is going to write about the Democratic convention as well.<P>

<h2>Republicans Can Count on Whitewater</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>
Some Republicans have been smug all along  since the l994 elections, believing that they were destined to win the Presidency and keep the Congress. Even as even their own polls show Bill Clinton way out front, the smugness in these same Republican circles had continued. The reason? The belief that that somehow Whitewater or some related Clinton scandal was going to bail them out. <p>

Well, look again, Republicans. A jury in Arkansas has acquitted two Arkansas bankers on four charges of fraud in connection with the l990 Clinton gubernatorial campaign and it has deadlocked on seven others.<p>

 That trial had the most promise of directly linking Bill Clinton to wrong doing. It failed. Moreover, Whitewater Special Counsel Ken Starr has indicated that he does not believe that his investigation should interfere in the political process. What that means is if Starr did have plans to indict Hillary Clinton, and there are solid reasons to believe he did, such an indictment will wait until after the l996 elections. Starr well remembers Lawrence Walch's political inspired indictment of former defense Secretary Cap Weinberger on the eve of the l992 election and he was bitterly critical of it. He does not intend to follow that model.  <p>

So now here are the Republicans. 90 days away from the general elections and their silver bullet theory has gone out the window. Moreover Bill Clinton has done an excellent job of running to the center politically. It is hard for the electorate to distinguish Clinton's positions from Bob Dole's positions.<p>
 
What that means is that if they have any chance to win, the Republicans are going to have to come up with some real barn burner issues. These must be issues that excite the electorate. These must be issues which indicate that there is a clear cut difference between the candidates. These have to be issues which would force Bill Clinton to abandon his own base and risk losing the Presidency if he chose to echo the Republican position as he has thus far done with most of the issues Dole has weakly raised .<p>

That is a tall order for any Presidential candidate. It is an especially tall order for candidate Dole, who has made a point of running as fast to the center from the right as Clinton has run to the center from the left. It is little wonder that a poll issued late last week indicated that there is almost no interest in this year's Presidential contest, with only 20% of the electorate feeling strongly about re-electing Bill Clinton and a mere 11% of the electorate feeling strongly about electing Dole President.<p>

Miracles do happen. The Olympics demonstrated that very well. But usually they happen to people who have been working hard to prepare to take advantage of the moment. Unfortunately for Dole and the Republicans, that doesn't seem to fit the description of their candidate. With Whitewater all but gone from the political scene, Dole and the Republicans will need a sharply defined message to take to the electorate and that is something which is strangely missing from this year's political process. 

<P>

July 31, 1996
</h3>
<h2>Congressman Gunderson's Allegations</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
A point of personal privilege. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin yesterday held a press conference which attacked me personally. Here is the background. Last year Gunderson, who has served in office in the 3rd Congressional District from Wisconsin since l980, announced that he would not seek another term in Congress. <p>

Subsequent to that time, Congressman Pat Roberts, who has been Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, decided to run for the U.S. Senate for the seat now held by Nancy Kassebaum. The man in line to succeed Roberts as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson, died. Thus Gunderson, who was next in line, began to change his mind. He asked the Republican candidate for Congress Jim Harsdorf to step aside. He declined to do so. Notwithstanding that Gunderson, one of the openly homosexual Members of Congress, encouraged a write in candidacy on his own behalf. Yesterday he announced that he was pulling the plug on that effort and that he would not be a candidate for re-election after all.<p>

In the process of making that announcement, Gunderson said the following: "It has come to my attention that conservative social groups in this country, led by Paul Weyrich, have informed the Speaker they would initiate a major independent expenditure against me. I have been informed that these people were prepared to do whatever was necessary to not only defeat me, but destroy me. I have been informed these groups were going to make allegations regarding my health status and AIDS. I have been informed that they were going to engage in other elements of character assassination....... Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that to some people in this country, the possibility of someone who is openly gay assuming the chair of a major Committee in Congress somehow legitimizes their personal life. And sadly, they could not accept that. "<p>
 
Gunderson said he had been assured by Speaker Gingrich that he would support Gunderson all the way if he chose to do the write in. This is the same Speaker Gingrich who is punishing Congressmen Smith and Dornan for standing on principle. <p>

Now let me make this clear. I wish I could take credit for driving Steve Gunderson out of the race. His lifestyle is his own business, and I have not sought to make it an issue. He did. He openly flaunted his lover at Congressional functions. His partner, whose name is Rob, even enjoyed a spousal pass in Congress which meant he had a special parking place and get into otherwise restricted areas. <P>

But I opposed Gunderson because of what he believed in. He was one of these so called "moderates" who was nearly always working at cross purposes with those of us who believe in traditional values.<p>
 
The fact is , however, that Gunderson made up this charge about an independent expenditure against him. I have made no such move. I have never discussed such an idea with anyone. Anyone who knows me knows that I deal with issues. Lifestyles only become important when the high nature of the office demands it (for example, a President who was on drugs could not perform his duties appropriately) or when the person himself makes it an issue by his or her conduct. <p>

Speaker Gingrich would not possibly have known about such an independent expenditure because I have not spoken to the Speaker or his staff or any other Member of the leadership or their staffs or anyone else for that matter about such a campaign. <p>

The fact is, and he admits it in his own statement, that leading Republicans in his own state were adamantly opposed to his running. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. I never spoke with any of them. Gunderson, despite the poll he released which claims that the people were clamoring for him to run, was afraid he would lose. In Washington, the game these days is to blame someone else for your decisions. I guess for Gunderson, I was a convenient target.<p>

As difficult as it is for anyone who is considered a public figure to win a libel or slander suit these days, I have my attorneys looking into the matter. As happy as I am to see him leave the Congress, Steve Gunderson should not be permitted to make things up about me or anyone else. He should not be permitted to sully my good name.<p>
 
Gunderson said that "ugliness has become the rule, rather than the exception in modern day campaigns." If that is true, then what Gunderson did is one of the worst examples of ugliness I have ever seen in the electoral process. He is truly a pathetic public figure. All of us should pray for him.<P>

<h2>Clinton and Terrorism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
It is an all too familiar sound. President Clinton, in a broadcast to the nation, offers
                      sympathy to the families of the victims of terrorism. Then he insists that no stone
                      will be left unturned to track down and punish those responsible. 
<P>
                      Those words, used over and over again recently after the blast in Saudi Arabia,
                      after TWA's Flight 800 and after the Olympic pipe bomb incident, just to name a
                      few in the past weeks, may comfort the nation. But the deeds of the Clinton
                      Administration are another matter. 
<P>
                      One of the nation's leading experts on terrorism told me privately the other day that
                      this Administration has resisted doing what is absolutely necessary if we are
                      actually serious about tracking down those responsible, and if we truly want to
                      prevent future incidents of terrorism. The Administration doesn't want to use human
                      agents to infiltrate suspected terrorist groups. 
<P>
                      "The problem with the Clinton Administration", this expert in terrorism told me, "is
                      that they think you can track down everything by satellite and other electronic
                      means. But in combating terrorism, there is no substitute for having real live bodies
                      on the scene. That's how you really get the job done". 
<P>
                      It is ironic too because after Oklahoma City, when it was clear that the suspects
                      were domestic anarchists, the Administration was only too willing to engage in
                      spying. The Republican Congress finally stripped most of those powers from the
                      legislation which Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. 
<P>
                      But when it comes to the international variety, the Administration, trapped by its
                      own l960's view of the world, rejects escalated spying. 
<P>
                      That is, in fact, typical of the attitude of the far left, which formed its attitudes about
                      spying in the depth of the cold war. Somehow, for the far left, it was acceptable for
                      the Soviets to have their agents everywhere in the United States. But it was
                      impermissible for the United States to spy on Soviet activities. The left has never
                      been shy about double standards. 
<P>
                      President Clinton is one of the most able Presidents we have ever employed when
                      it comes to sympathizing with the victims of terrorism. The relatives of those killed
                      in TWA Flight 800 sang the praises of Clinton as he spent several hours with them
                      last week. His efforts in that regard are commendable.
<P>
                      But the one effective thing Clinton could do for those relatives-- to track down
                      those who were responsible for the tragedy itself by the most effective means
                      possible, the President is reluctant to do.

<h2>Sacrificing Conscience to Republican Totalitarianism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p><p>

In two nations which were part of the NATO alliance, conservative political parties which were at one time dominant forces in those countries, have all but disappeared. In Canada, the Progressive Conservatives went from a solid outright majority in the Parliament to just two seats following the last Canadian election. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the party of the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly always the central partner in Italy's many post-war governments, has nearly vanished following recent elections there.
<p.
In the United States, the Republican party may be next. This week the party took another giant step in that direction. House Speaker Newt Gingrich inflicted ex post facto discipline on Reps. Bob Dornan (R-CA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) for supporting former Congressman Joe DioGuardi in his primary race against the militantly pro-abortionist Rep. Sue Kelly (R-NJ). Dornan and Smith were forbidden to serve on key conference committees which are bringing forth crucial bills to be passed before this Congress becomes history. Moreover, both Congressmen have been denied travel funds even though both are chairmen of international subcommittees where travel is required as part of the responsibilities of the committee.
For Rep. Smith especially, opposing Kelly was an exercise of his conscience. Rep. Kelly is one of five Republicans to vote with Bill Clinton on the partial birth abortion issue. Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has called the brutal murder of the baby in the partial birth abortion procedure infanticide. Mr. DioGuardi is in the race because of that issue.
<p>
Rep. Smith has introduced a freedom of conscience resolution in the House Republican Conference. It declares that any Member of Congress shall have the right to back any candidate for office according to his own conscience. Moreover, if sanctions were to be imposed on a Member for doing so, the resolution would require a vote on the issue by the entire House GOP Conference.
<p>
Smith needs 50 signatures on his resolution to have it considered. He is having trouble getting the signatures because Speaker Gingrich has so intimidated Members with his disciplinary measures that many who are sympathetic to Smith are now afraid to sign up.
<p>
The fact is there was no rule in the GOP Conference against a Member supporting a primary opponent of a sitting congressman. In a display of Soviet style justice, the sanctions were imposed after the fact.
If we have come to the point where, because he serves as a Republican Member of the House, a Member of Congress can no longer follow his conscience (and anyone who knows Smith knows that he is genuinely a man of conscience), then we have changed our form of government overnight without the consent of the governed. If these sanctions are allowed to stand, the Republican party, in due course, will surely follow the way of the Canadian Conservatives and the Italian Christian Democrats.
<p>
If to be a Republican means one has to give up his freedom of conscience, then the price, as Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) has suggested, is much too high.

<h2>Casino Gambling Reform Hits Roadblock</h2>
<p><p><p>
<blockquote>
When both sides of a highly contentious issue claim they are satisfied with the result of a compromise, it is a sure sign that very little will be accomplished. That is exactly the case with a bill, for which the House of Representatives gave final approval, which would create a federal commission to examine the $40 billion gambling industry.
<p>
That any bill was passed at all was due to a rare combination of the religious right, who believe that gambling has hurt families, and liberals who target the gambling industry as another example of the corruption of free enterprise. 
<p>
The original bill, as conceived by Congressman Frank Wolf, an evangelical Christian from Virginia, was greatly weakened. 
<p>
Originally the commission would have had broad subpoena power. But the bill which passed the Congress, now permits the commission to only subpoena documents, not people. In addition, if material is not available from public sources, the Commission must keep its information confidential. Wolf said he is satisfied with the powers the commission has. But so is Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Chairman, who represents the gambling industry in Washington. He says he welcomes a "balanced" inquiry into the industry. 
<p>
What all of this means is that Congressman Wolf got just enough out of the commission that he doesn't have to deny that his bill was gutted, while Fahrenkopf is satisfied that the commission doesn't really have enough power to do any real damage to the industry. So there you have it. Another "Washington Commission" has been born. It will spend lots of taxpayer money. It will issue reports. Most likely few will read the reports. Nothing will change. 
<p>
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the commission was needed to know the implications of the growth of the gambling industry. A couple of decades ago there was legalized gambling in only two states, Nevada and New Jersey. Now only two states, Utah and Hawaii, ban legalized gambling, and there are operating casinos in 23 states. 
<p>
The Family Research Council points out that in states where gambling is flourishing, more and more families are becoming impoverished. They contend that gambling is addictive in many cases and has led to financial ruin for many families who otherwise would be able to maintain themselves. The gambling industry, on the other hand, contends that only 5% of gamblers are addicted. And so the debate goes on and on. 
<p>
It is really a part of an age old debate about what sorts of activity, which if done in excess can lead to the destruction of human beings, should thus be legal and open for all citizens to participate. Such a debate preceded the passage of the Volstead Act, the Constitutional amendment which outlawed the sale of liquor and was in force for more than a decade. Enforcement of the Volstead Act, critics claim, was responsible for the establishment of the Mafia in the United States, as liquor sales went underground. The same question now pertains to gambling. Should it be open and above board where it can be seen and regulated? Or is society better off if gambling is underground, even if authorities have a much harder time policing it?
The new Gambling Commission may provide some data, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue. The real question, as it is with pornography on the Internet or drug usage and other such matters, is simply this: what damage is caused to society when potentially sinful activities are engaged in by a substantial percentage of its population? And if it can be proven that substantial damage is done by such activities to society as a whole, what right does society have to curb the choices which can be made by free citizens?
Libertarians contend that citizens should be free to do as they wish, because it is a matter of their choice to use their resources as they see fit. Traditionalists contend that society must protect itself against any behavior which is seen as self destructive and should therefore be free to curb such behavior. Thus far, the Supreme Court has tended to side with the Libertarians. 
<p>
But in any case, that will continue to be debated so long as we have the freedom to do so. It will be debated long after the new Gambling Commission issues its ponderous reports, which when all is said and done, are not likely to effect the outcome of the debate in this society much at all. That's all for Direct Line for tonight.

<p></h3><h2>
The Next American Revolution
<p></h2><p><p>
<blockquote>
This past Spring, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of praising his opponent, Bob Dole, for insisting that a disclaimer be added to the Republican Party platform.  The disclaimer calls for tolerance for opposing opinions.  For weeks, the issue was the Republican's so-called anti-abortion plank.  The establishment media feasted on the debate over whether to amend the language.  While Clinton cheered him on, Dole finally resolved to put the tolerance disclaimer in the preamble to the platform, although for awhile he seemed wrestle with a decision to put the tolerance language directly in the paragraph which addresses the issue of abortion.
<P>
Interestingly, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic Platform.  Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would have no guarantee of saving unborn lives.  The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the practice.  Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.
<p>
Ultimately the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms.  The real contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest which pits Washington against its own citizens.  Let's be honest about one thing: the Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by establishment politicians. Yet, what our culture badly needs is honesty in its political process.  Our society desperately needs elected leaders who maintain the courage of their convictions.
<p>
All of this may require a third political party.  If that is the case, then so be it.  You see, America has reached a great crossroads in its history.  Our nation faces a great dilemma – our government is in debt bordering on insolvency.  Meanwhile, increasingly, our country faces threats from unknown entities throughout the world in the form of terrorism.
<p>
What we need more than anything else is prayer; the prayer of honest citizens that our elected leaders act responsibly; prayer that our culture turns from its tailspin of depravity; prayer that God, who at one time blessed this great nation of ours, will again restore our nation to moral and fiscal health.
God has given us a wonderful gift. He has given us a nation in which its citizens are free to worship, speak, own property, and elect popular leaders. But slowly we have allowed our elected leaders and cultural elitists to squandered that gift, through debt, moral erosion, lawlessness and political deceit. I believe God can judge America or save America. It's up to us. But time is running out, both for our economic and spiritual well-being.
<p>
If we as a nation return to the faith and righteous principles upon which this country was founded, I believe God will once restore to our nation the America we once were. May God help us to pray for that to happen.

<h2>Business-As-Usual No Longer Works</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>

This morning's Washington Post is just gloating over Republican Senators who, the Post says, have rediscovered government. They cite among others, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah who fought to add another $10 million to the appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts because, he says, the Endowment supports dozens of small cultural entities in Utah.<P>
The Post describes Bennett as a Mormon with strong culturally conservative views. Those views, the paper is happy to report, were not enough to override his desire to bring federal money to his state, even though the National Endowment for the Arts funds pornography and homosexual art. The last time I checked, neither was well thought of in Mormon circles.<P>
But the case of Bennett, and several other Republican Senators mentioned, serves to illustrate why the Republican attempt to balance the budget by 2002 absent a Constitutional Amendment is folly. There are always just enough so-called conservative Senators who are willing to play the game of trying to be the local hero who brought home the federal bacon. Therefore cutting federal spending becomes next to impossible.<P>
We had cultural activities in my hometown, but local people supported them with their own money. If they didn't, the local symphony and museums and other projects would have disappeared. And this is as it should be.<P>
If the question is should cultural projects in Utah be funded by the rest of us taxpayers, sure voters will say yes. But if the question is should we as a nation go into debt to fund these projects, my betting is the answer would be different. Bennett, I am willing to wager, could maintain his political support by posing the second question rather than the first.<P>
This Congress came within a single vote of passing a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. With Bill Clinton continuing to lead Bob Dole and Ross Perot by such impressive numbers, I fear that the next Congress will be even less willing to pass such an amendment. Yet the fiscal condition of the nation demands that this be done. We are on the verge of bankruptcy.<P>
I have to give credit to Perot and Dick Lamm, the rivals in the Reform party. At least they are talking about this issue. You don't hear either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole saying much about it, and they would say nothing at all if the Reform party weren't in the mix.<P>
If the next Congress is unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to pass a Constitutional Amendment, then there is no alternative to a Constitutional Convention to take up that issue, term limits and other such questions which are beyond the courage of the Congress. Then at least the states would be given the chance to ratify or reject such proposals. My guess is that at the state level, a balanced budget would get overwhelming approval.<P>
The politicians like Bennett just don't get it yet. The way we've done business for the past sixty years just doesn't work anymore. The nation can't afford it. But since there seems to be no hope of replacing enough ordinary politicians in the Congress, our only hope is an extraordinary measure such as a Constitutional Convention. I regret that is the case and there are dangers in calling such a convention. But the alternative is to have business as usual and this business is going belly up.<P><P>

<h2>Bob Dole and His Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>It is a strange world, this world of politics. Reality seldom penetrates the consciousness of the players. Perceptions, which are often created by one's political enemies, become reality. And politicians act upon that false reality. <P>Such is the case concerning the 1992 Republican national convention in Houston.<P>On the first day of the convention, the man who challenged President Bush, Pat Buchanan, gave a barn burner of a speech. The late John Chancellor of NBC called it one of the finest speeches he had ever heard at a convention and that was saying something since Chancellor had covered politics since the 1950's. Also speaking that evening were former Education Secretary and Drug Czar Bill Bennett and former President Ronald Reagan. Both gave excellent speeches. Polls were taken that night and for the one and only time during the peak political season, George Bush led Bill Clinton in the Presidential race.<P>But other media began to criticize both the Bennett and Buchanan speeches, especially the part of Buchanan's speech where he suggested we were in the midst of a culture war. Excerpts of that speech were played over and over again, out of context, and Buchanan was ripped apart by the media and by liberal politicians. When George Bush lost to Bill Clinton, this same media blamed his loss on Buchanan and conservatives who allegedly scared moderate women away from the Republicans. <P>Now mind you, those speeches, including Buchanan's, only helped Bush in all actuality. In truth, George Bush was fired by the American people for two reasons. First because he pledged not to raise taxes and then engineered the largest tax increase in history up to that point. Second because Bush seemed to be preoccupied with foreign affairs at a time when the United States was in a mild recession. <P>One person, however, bought the media line about 1992 wholesale. That person is Bob Dole. Determined not to scare these same fictitious voters, Dole has banned Pat Buchanan from speaking in a major time slot at the convention, even though Buchanan ended up the runner up in the Presidential contest. Such a move is without precedent in modern American politics. Moreover, Dole has put forward the feminist Republican Susan Molinari as the keynote speaker. Colin Powell, a self declared Rockefeller Republican who disagrees with most of the GOP platform, will also be featured that first night. The Dole advisers are confident that when he puts forth this moderate image to the American people they will come flocking to him in droves. <P>It is an interesting theory. By that measure, Dole can be elected President by doing what the media wants. Never mind that in reality Dole will be driving away millions of conservative voters in the process. That is the truth. Oh, yes, and there is one other little problem. The media loves Bill Clinton much more than Bob Dole no matter what Dole does to try to please them. When all is said and done they won't give him much credit for doing what they have proscribed for the Republican party. Perceptions will vanish and reality will hit home to Bob Dole on election night. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h2>Racism, Sexism Revisited</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>
Bill Lind's recent series of commentaries on Political Correctness created quite a stir here at NET.  We have had a substantial internal debate about whether, particularly, his commentary of Monday, July 9 promotes or invites racism.  We've also had some discussion about his July 10 commentary on sexism.
When authentic, racism is extremely harmful because it fails to consider the worth and dignity of each person as an individual.  As Mr. Lind noted in one of his commentaries, "Wise people judge other individuals as individuals, not as members of any group."<P>
Our culture has indeed become so Politically Correct, so infected by false racism and irrational sexism, that it has become quite difficult to discuss any of these issues without being accused of committing that which one would condemn.  People today are so often told that they are victims of characteristics beyond their control that they tend to believe it.  Worse, those who have experienced real discrimination, yet whose lives are dedicated to rising above it by courageously finding ways up, over and around it, are the most seriously harmed by false discrimination.  Why?  Because false discrimination tends to become confused with authentic discrimination.  Real discrimination thus becomes harder to detect, which means that fewer citizens take action to stamp it out.<P>
The late Dr. Martin Luther King urged Americans to judge people by the content of their character.  We at NET, and at its founding organization, the Free Congress Foundation, agree with that statement.  We do not espouse or condone racism in any form.  We are committed to the fair treatment of everyone.  Consequently we condemn both real and false racism.<P>
As Mr. Lind also noted in last week's series, we recognize that men and women are different.  Complementary, but different.  Thus we believe, for example, that single-sex education, recently condemned by the Supreme Court, should be supported in this country; we endorse parental choice in education.  That does not deny that many young men and women do well in a co-educational environment; nor does it deny that most men and women are able to perform the vast majority of  jobs equally well.  However, we disagree with the feminist view that there are no differences between men and women.  That view is a delusion. It is a failure to recognize physical reality.  We are not all the same; each of us is a unique individual, deserving of respect as such.<P>
In our NET commentaries, we intend to discuss difficult, contentious issues.  Our editorial viewpoint is, for example, uncompromisingly pro-life and pro-family.  We will continue to express ourselves, and to present guest commentaries on controversial issues, because we believe you, our viewers, are well-served by discussions of issues rarely presented elsewhere with forthrightness based on a search for truth.  And when our commentaries create controversy internally, we will continue to have open, frank discussions.  Your views are important to us as well; they enrich our discussions, and they help us to know you better.  So we invite you to call, write, fax and e-email us whenever you wish to comment on an issue, or on anything else we do.<P>

<h2>Lamm Candidacy Adds Dimension</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
I was out of the country when former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm announced that he was going to run for President. Fortunately, I returned last night from Bulgaria just in time to see the repeat of that press conference on C SPAN.<P>
Lamm has burned his bridges and has now agreed to support the nominee of the Reform party, even if that nominee is Ross Perot, against whom Lamm is now running for the Presidential nomination.<P>
On the surface Lamm's candidacy looks like a quixotic one. He is barely known outside of Colorado. He is running in the party which Perot founded with Perot's money. It is unclear who will vote in that party primary, which is being conducted by mail over a several day period.<P>
Lamm has only about a month to get himself well enough known that he would have a shot at defeating Perot in the Reform party primary. Given his lack of financial resources, Lamm would seem to be a sure loser to Perot. But Lamm is touching a chord with his message. In fact, his candidacy was the result of his stark assessment of where we as a nation have gone wrong. He delivered that assessment to a state convention in California. Delegates, right then and there, circulated a petition and urged Lamm to run. Other states followed. This prompted Perot, who had planned on a coronation for the Reform party nomination, to announce prematurely that he was likely to run again and so the campaign has begun.
Mind you I completely disagree with Governor Lamm's social issues policies. We are about as far apart as two people can get on that spectrum. But I have long admired Dick Lamm as a man who believes in what he says and has the courage of his convictions.<P>
I am also a big fan of former Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong, who in my view, missed his calling by not being a Presidential candidate in 1996. I think he would have swept all the others away. Were he the nominee, Republicans would not now be facing the sort of electoral disaster that awaits them if Bill Clinton continues to hold on to the sort of numbers he has now.<P>
The year was 1984 and Armstrong was seeking his second term in the U.S. Senate. Dick Lamm was then Governor of Colorado and widely thought to be a possible candidate for the Senate. Armstrong proposed that if Lamm were the Democratic candidate for the Senate, the two of them should go city by city throughout Colorado together, debating the issues. For whatever reason Lamm did not run that year. I suspect he wasn't sure he could defeat the equally articulate Armstrong.<P>
What a Senate campaign that would have been. Two of the most knowledgeable and attractive candidates ever to have run for public office debating real issues in the public forum. That is the way our system ought to work. <P>
Now Lamm is out there for President and the odds are very much against him. Unfortunately he has to run at a time when the American voters are least tuned into politics. It is a pity because, agree or disagree, they need to hear what Lamm has to say. He is making points that other politicians simply refuse to talk about. True, Bob Dole does pay lip service to the notion that excessive spending by government is not a good idea, even though he has helped to pass much of what he now complains about.<P>
Lamm, coming as he does from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has the greater impact on such issues. What Dole says is expected from a Republican candidate. When Lamm says it, it has real credibility. Dick Lamm is to entitlements and the bankruptcy of America what Richard Nixon was to China. His message is tough, but he has a non-threatening personality. Lamm can say what he says without scaring people the way some republicans manage to do so. He makes you stop and think. And by the way, what he says about entitlements is the same thing that senators Al Simpson of Wyoming and Robert Kerry of Nebraska have been saying now for some time. Perhaps at the Presidential level Lamm can get the audience Simpson and Kerry have never managed to get.<P>
I wish Dick Lamm well. His policies on values questions preclude my voting for him but I think he is doing the nation a service just by running. He brings a desperately needed level of candor to the Presidential campaign in which Bill Clinton lies, Bob Dole speaks unintelligibly, and Ross Perot speaks only in platitudes.<P>
If by some wholly unexpected chance he were to defeat Perot in his own primary and go on to the general election, Lamm would totally destabilize the November election scene. Liberals would have an alternative to Bill Clinton and conservatives whose primary focus is our entitlement mess would have an alternative to Bob Dole. A debate between the three of them is a Presidential campaign to die for.<P>
Just like the exciting possibility back in Colorado in 1984, it is unlikely to happen. But given this uninspiring political campaign, our thanks to Dick Lamm for giving us something to at least dream about.<P>

<h2>Disney's Moral Whitewash</h2>
<P>

Awhile back the Southern Baptist convention passed a resolution at their annual convention of Messengers calling on their members to boycott Walt Disney theme parks, movies and merchandise.<P>
Granted the Southern Baptists can’t control what their members do and many of them are not likely to go along with the boycott; still it is an uncomfortable position for Disney to be in with the largest Protestant denomination in the United States telling its membership to stay away from Disney properties.<P>
The Southern Baptists were protesting not only the Disney decision, as a corporation, to grant benefits to homosexual partnerships but also recent Disney distributed films.  For example, last year Disney released "the Priest," a movie which portrayed a homosexual clergyman sympathetically. Indeed, even what are supposed to be classic style Disney movies such as "the Lion King" and the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" are now filled with sexual references. Reviewers are even suggesting that "Hunchback" is not an appropriate movie for children. Michael Eisner and company have taken the Disney company a long way from its pro family roots. No wonder the Disney theme parks now sport a Gay and Lesbian pride day with special discounts for public displays of such behavior.<P>
So to the rescue comes Father Leo O’Donovan, the President of Georgetown University, one of the most venerable Catholic institutions in the nation. He has just been elected to a two year term on the Disney board. Father O’Donovan can be expected to uphold traditional Judeo Christian moral values, right? O’Donovan is Eisner’s market response to the move by the Southern Baptists, right?<P>
Well, think again. O’Donovan is to traditional Catholics what John Chaffee is to traditional Republicans. O’Donovan is a liberal Catholic. He has been elected to the board not to make the Disney company sensitive to traditional morality but to give Eisner cover. Already he has defended the Disney decision to grant benefits to homosexual couples as standard industry practice and he has defended the Disney distribution of the movie "the Priest." O’Donovan says that a company or an individual can’t be judged by "a single act or production, or we’d never lead lives or have businesses."<P>
Are you surprised? I’m not. Georgetown has its own Gay pride activities with the full blessing of O’Donovan. Indeed O’Donovan has done his best to remove what little vestiges of the Catholic faith remained at Georgetown.<P>
Soon after he became President six years ago, O’Donovan showed up here at a dinner party I had to discuss our pioneer television efforts. I say showed up because I hadn’t invited him. He came as the uninvited guest of someone we did ask to come. It was clear ten minutes into our conversation that he was a liberal who will defend just about anything on the liberal agenda.<P>
Eisner was not bowing to market pressure from the Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights which has similarly blasted Disney. Eisner was looking for someone with credentials who could defend the company and give a thumbs up for its immoral practices. Well since Notre Dame’s former President Theodore Hesburgh is too busy serving on Bill Clinton’s legal defense fund board, I guess O’Donovan was the next best thing. Besides, Hesburgh is well known as a liberal. O’Donovan isn’t, so he will be more useful to Eisner.<P>
No, if Disney is serious about wanting some moral input, I am sure Dr. James Dobson, or the Presbyterian intellectual D. James Kennedy or one of the many former Presidents of the Southern Baptists would be available. Or if Disney really does want the genuine Catholic point of view, I suggest Cardinal O’Connor of New York or Cardinal Law of Boston.<P>
What Disney needs is someone on its board who will represent the point of view of parents to the company and not the other way around. Eisner is clever.  Appointing O’Donovan is a good public relations move. But the Southern Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights are still correct. What Disney is producing these days is a disgrace. The company should be boycotted. Real economic pressure will force real change. The O’Donovan appointment, far from a bow to the traditional values community, represents business as usual.<P>

<h2>Faith and Global Stability</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations are happy over the result of the Russian elections this past week.  Incumbent Boris Yeltsin won.  The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations were not happy over the result of the Israeli elections last month.  The incumbent lost.<P>
This mentality speaks volumes for the modern world view of global stability.  The world leaders now put the concept of global stability above risk, higher than right and wrong, and ahead of principle.  This means that human rights, individual freedoms and even democracy now take a back seat to the new global imperative of maintaining stability, status quo, and "peace."<P>
No policy is without an overriding philosophy and global stability is no exception. Its philosophy is relativism, a mentality which holds that truth and even morality can only be defined within the context of today’s events.<P>
Today, those who question the philosophy of relativism are scorned by the popular culture, in the press, on TV and in Hollywood.<P>
Ask U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Speaking at separate events, Scalia and Thomas recently told of the importance of faith in God.  Thomas was criticized for his religious views.  Academia laughed at Scalia for believing in angels.  The culture wants to stop jurists like Scalia, Thomas and William Rhenquist for applying Constitutional absolutes to legal cases for a society which has begun to question eternal truth and moral absolutes.<P>
I for one agree with Scalia. Let them laugh.  Angels are real.  We can’t see God and we can’t see the wind.  Yet God and the wind exist whether the cultural engineers like it or not.  In fact, it’s not what they think that matters but what God thinks that really matters.  That’s the faith perspective. That’s exactly what’s missing from the new world view of the White House, the State Department and the United Nations.<P>
The faith perspective understands right from wrong.  The faith perspective realizes there is something much greater at stake than the futile pursuit of peace through stability.  A faith perspective requires leaders to take a moral stand, armed with absolutes which modern events simply cannot change.<P>
Murder and stealing are forbidden by our laws. Why?  Because life and charity are good things according to the precepts of God who does not change.<P>
Our society began with a belief in God and with faith.  Look at the words on our coins.  It doesn’t say in the world we trust, in the UN we trust, or even in government we trust.  Our nation began with a cultural trust in God and a societal faith in God’s precepts.<P>
The faith of a nation is a powerful quality.  It has made the twentieth century the century of America, a nation founded on belief in God.<P>
Our nation will never end with a belief in God, but it can end without a belief in God, and we must never let that happen.  It’s time to end the global stability and moral relativity lock on our future.  America doesn’t need a UN to tell us where we’ve been or a faithless government to tell us where we can go.  What America needs today is a few good citizens, of faith and courage, to safely guide us into the next great century.<P>
