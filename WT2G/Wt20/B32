<h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF<br>
GAY 'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing 
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was 
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

During the hearings on the 
Defense of Marriage Act in May, Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) posed
the rhetorical but earnest question:  Were he and his partner,
&quot;Herb&quot; -- settled, domesticated couple that they were
-- really imperilling the marriages of people in their neighborhood?
How could their example, as a gay couple, injure the institution
of marriage?  Had there been some decline, after all, in the attraction
of the sexes, so that men might cease being attracted to women
if they were suddenly more aware of gay men together as couples?
That would appear, on the surface, a plausible question, but
it masks a serious confusion about the standards of judgment or
evidence in assessing the problem.  We might as aptly ask whether
there would be any measurable fraying in the community if a brother
and sister took up residence as husband and wife.  Years ago,
in Stafford, Virginia, a 40-year-old mother was living in a common
law marriage with her 19-year-old son.  They were ordered by a
court to part, and as far as we know, their example produced no
breakdown of marriages in the town.  No one expects the sky to
fall in, or the local populace to break out in fits of stuttering.
That is not the test, and that is not the issue.

<p>

The question of what is suitable for marriage is quite separate from 
the matter of love, though it cannot finally be detached from love. 
No one doubts the love of men for men, or women for women, just as no
one doubts that there may be abiding relations of love between
brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren.  In the
nature of things, nothing in those relations of love could possibly
be diminished in any way if they were not attended by penetration
or expressed in marriage.

<p>

As I remarked at the hearings in May,
it becomes impossible finally to discuss this matter of marriage
and sexuality without using the N-word:  nature.  The question
must return to that sexuality stamped in our natures, or what
has been called the &quot;natural teleology of the body&quot;
--  namely, the inescapable fact that only two people, not three,
only a man and a woman, can beget a child.  We don't need a marriage
to mark the presence of love, but a marriage marks something matchless
in a framework for the begetting and nurturance of children.
Even on those occasions when marriages break down, the framework
of law has the advantage at least of fixing responsibility for
the custody and care of children.

<p>

I posed then a question of principle
for the Committee on the Judiciary in this way:  If marriage were
detached from that natural teleology of the body, <i>on what ground
of principle could the law confine marriage to &quot;couples&quot;?</i>
If the law permitted the marriage of people of the same sex,
what is the ground of principle on which the law would refuse
to recognize a &quot;marriage&quot; in the people who profess
that their own love is not confined to a coupling of two, but
connected in a larger cluster of three or four?  The confining
of marriage to two may stand out then as nothing more than the
most arbitrary fixation on numbers.  But if that arrangement of
plural partners were permitted to people of the same sex, how
could it be denied in principle to ensembles of mixed sexes?
That is to say, we would be back, in principle, to the acceptance
of polygamy.

<p>

I sought to be clear, also, in the discussion
in the Judiciary Committee that I was not making a prediction
-- I was not predicting that, if we accepted same-sex marriage,
we would be engulfed by polygamy and incest.  I was a raising
question, again, of principle:  What was the ground on which the
law refused to accept the polygamous union once it accepted the
notion of gay marriage?  It could not be, &quot;That is not what
we do here,&quot; for that answer would suffice right now.  One
young legislator, testifying before the Committee, was pressed
on this matter of polygamy, and he replied that he simply understood
marriage as an exclusive contractual relation between two people.
Others might come back and retort that we happen to consider
marriage an exclusive, contractual relation between a man and
a woman.  On the level of assertion, one meets another;  but neither
one states a ground of principle for denying same-sex marriage
-- once marriage is detached, as I say, from its defining ground
in nature.

<p>

I would go further and say that I take Congressman
Frank and other gay activists at their word when they declare
that they do not wish to injure the family.  I credit their avowals
about their attachments to their own families, and their wish
that other people in the country may have the blessings of that
life in a family.  But the problem here, as I sought to explain,
was that their argument ran well beyond their intentions.  Those
arguments must put in place the kinds of premises and understandings
that make it impossible to reject any longer the claims for polygamy.
To put it another way, every argument for gay marriage is an
argument that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not
have the remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but this much
may fairly be said:  They have the most profound interest, rooted
in the logic of their doctrine, in discrediting the notion that
marriage finds its defining ground in &quot;nature.&quot;  Their
rhetorical strategy, their public arguments, have all been directed
explicitly to the derision of that claim that sexuality in the
strictest sense involves the sexuality &quot;imprinted in our
natures.&quot;  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this this issue
by raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even
further.

<p>

The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot
accommodate couples of the same sex without so altering the cast
or character of marriage that it will cease to be that special
relation, which seems to be the object of such deep craving now
for so many people.  Once the notion of marriage is broadened
in that way, it will simply not be tenable any longer to hold
up marriage, in the laws, as a relation that deserves a special
place, a special commendation -- a special effort to sustain and
promote it.  And indeed, we fear that the movement to gay marriage
is fueled in part by a desire to remove that special standing
in principle -- to deny that there is anything about marriage
that deserves a special respect, or any favored standing in the
law.  And after all, people are not drawn to the &quot;gay&quot;
life because of an overpowering interest in raising children.
The question of marriage for gays or lesbians, or rights of adoption
for gay couples, take on their importance strategically:  They
provide further occasions for moving the law to pronounce that
homosexuality is, in the current phrase, &quot;virtually normal,&quot;
that homosexuality cannot stand on any lesser plane of legitimacy
than that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;

<p>

But it is worth reminding the press, and the public, as to what provided
the urgency, for the Congress, to come forth at this moment, with
the Defense of Marriage Act.  The litigation in Hawaii was percolating
for a few years, but matters moved into an alarming phase with
the argument before the Supreme Court, last October, in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>.

<p>

When I testified before the Judiciary Committee of the
House on May 15, the decision in that case was expected any day.
It arrived five days later, on May 20th, and it was quite as
bad as many of us had anticipated.  In that decision, the Court
struck down a constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused
to treat gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class, on
the same plane as the groups that suffer discrimination based
on race or gender.  We will hear, of course, different accounts
of that case, but in my own reading, that decision will be read
by many activists among the judges to produce this lesson:  that
a State may not incorporate in its laws or public policy an adverse
judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to accord to
homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that attaches to
that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;  With this
move, the Court may have armed federal judges to tie up any legislation
in a State that refused to honor homosexual marriages:  After
all, the argument might run, the State refuses to credit this
marriage only because of the gender, or the &quot;sexual orientation,&quot;
of the couple.  Would this not be, on the face, but another 
&quot;discrimination&quot; against people because they happen to be 
gays or lesbians?

<p>

As it turned out, we did not have long to wait.  This argument has
already been sounded by Professor William Eskridge of the Georgetown
University Law School (in the June 17 issue of <i>The New Republic</i>).
Several weeks ago, I taped a television program on this subject
with Professor Eskridge, who affected not to be aware then of
any such development that could undercut the authority of the
States in refusing to honor gay marriage.  In the hearings, Congressman
Frank was especially contemptuous of this bill on the ground that
it was an unnecessary extension of federal power -- that Congress
would act here to confirm to the States a power they already had.
When I pointed out the implications of the coming decision in
<i>Romer v. Evans</i>, there was no acknowledgement on the part of Frank
that he was aware of the case pending there. In a piece in <i>The
New York Times</i>, Professor Laurence Tribe affected the same want
of awareness.  Tribe joined Frank in arguing that the bill was
unjustified precisely because it was unnecessary -- that the States
would not require any prop to their authority in rejecting gay
marriage.  But now Professor Eskridge seems to have let the truth
slip.  He has made it clear that gay activists would indeed read
the Romer case in the way I've suggested, and that they can of
course be expected to cite it -- as they would cite anything else
even remotely supportive of their arguments -- as they seek to
challenge in the courts the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

And yet, this Act is the most delicate and limited measure that the 
Congress could produce on the subject.  It treats subjects that are 
evidently within the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least 
intrusion into the domain of State law.  What other institution could 
possibly have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?  It surely cannot
be a novelty to make explicit what has ever been our tradition,
that marriage &quot;means only a legal union between one man and
one woman as husband and wife.&quot;  In the second sentence of
the Full Faith and Credit Clause the Constitution reads:  &quot;And
the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which
such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
thereof.&quot;  Once again, we may ask:  If Congress may not legislate
under this federal clause, what other institution could possibly
claim the authority to legislate?  How could we legislate in any
more minimal way here than in the way the Congress has chosen
to legislate -- namely, by providing merely that no State would
be obliged to honor, as a marriage, anything but what we have
known traditionally as &quot;marriage,&quot; the legal union of
a man and a woman, as husband and wife?  As I say, it is hard
to imagine any law on the subject that moves with more delicacy
or with less intrusion into the powers of the States.  The States
that wish to honor gay marriage will suffer no restriction in
this measure.  But on other hand, this provision on the part of
Congress may supply the only ground of support for a State in
refusing to credit same-sex marriage, especially if a federal
court moves to strip from a State every other source of resistance.

<p>

In my own testimony last May, I anticipated that questions would
be raised about the power of Congress to legislate on the subject
of marriage through the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  That clause
was obviously not meant as a grant of power to Congress to legislate
more broadly on the subject of marriage, and that is the not the
power that the Congress is undertaking in this case.  I pointed
to some of the earlier flexing of congressional authority under
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, in dealing with the custody
of children and the protection of former spouses from threats
of violence.  The Clause had been used, in other words, to deal
with some of the fallout from divorce and the rupture of families,
in matters that ran beyond the powers of the States.  The same
situation would present itself here.

<p>

I suggested in my testimony
that an even more dramatic instance of the problem was supplied
in 1803, when Congress barred the shipment of slaves into any
state that itself prohibited the import of slaves.  The problem
did not arise for States in the North where slavery was prohibited,
for there was no point in shipping slaves into those States. 
The problem arose for States in the South, where slavery was protected
under the law, but where there was an effort to ban the import
of more slaves.  Under the Constitution, of course, a State could
not cast up barriers to trade across the boundaries of the States.
Only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce,
and so the power of Congress was called in here as an annex to
the policy of the State in forbidding the import of new slaves.
Yet, under the Constitution, Congress could exert no authority
over the import of slaves from abroad until 1808.  And it was
widely assumed that Congress had no authority to legislate directly
on slavery within the States.  Clearly, Congress was not thought
to possess the authority to legislate on the substance of slavery
within the States; it could deal only with the problem of fugitive
slaves, moving from one State to another.  But just as clearly,
Congress alone could close off the borders of a State to slaves
shipped from other States, and that authority had to be the source
then of this interstitial power to legislate on the substance
of slavery.

<p>

It seems to me that no more or less has been claimed
in this case, with the Defense of Marriage Act.  There is no way
to avoid touching upon the substance of marriage, and yet the
legislation bears all the marks of an effort simply to touch this
matter in the most minimal way.  It is evident that the drafters
assert no authority here to legislate more fully on the subject
of marriage.  The purpose, plain to any onlooker, was to make
the least intrusion into the powers of the States.

<p>

In contrast, there have been rather emphatic intimations, in other 
parts of our law, that the federal government could indeed reach far 
more widely in the domain of marriage and the family.  Chief Justice
Marshall once remarked in passing, in the Dartmouth College case
(1819) that an apt question might arise under the Contract Clause
if a State passed an act, say, &quot;annulling all marriage contracts,
or allowing either party to annul it without the consent of the
other.&quot; [<i>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheaton)
518, at 629]  When the federal courts strike down arrangements,
in the States, to assign custody to children on the basis of race,
they engage the Constitution in this matter, and with the effect
of remodelling, in substance, the laws of custody in the States.
[<i>Palmore v. Sidotti</i>, 466 U.S. 429 (1984)]  With this act in Defense
of Marriage, the Congress uses but the slightest portion of the
authority it might it claim to act in this field.  And again,
that deliberate confining of its reach must be taken as a measure
of the intent of the drafters to move with the lightest hand,
in touching nothing more than Congress needs to touch.

<p>

But as restrained, and as limited, as the reach of Congress is in this 
case, this move on the part of Congress is quite telling.  In fact, the 
studied silences in this bill, the simplicity and spareness of its moves,
serve to convey even more powerfully its significance as a legislative
act.  For it represents nothing less than a willingness of Congress
to take up again its warrant to act as an interpreter of the Constitution,
along with the courts and the Executive.  Against the concert
of  judges, remodelling on their own the laws on marriage and
the family, the Congress weighs in to supply another understanding,
and a rival doctrine.  But it happens, at the same time, to be
an ancient understanding and a traditional doctrine.  The Congress
would proclaim it again now, and suggest that the courts take
their bearings anew from this doctrine, stated anew, brought back
and affirmed by officers elected by the people.

<p>

This effort on the part of Congress to weigh in, to participate again 
in the interpretation of the Constitution, was made more urgent by the
prospect of <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, and now it has been made ever more
urgent by the advent, by the presence, of that decision in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>. The problem of gay marriage was not the only problem
deepened by the judgment in <i>Romer</i>, and if the Congress can counter
the courts on the question of gay marriage, it would be quite
as urgent for the Congress to take this first step, to begin acting
again, for the sake of inducing the courts to limit or narrow
the holding in <i>Romer</i>.

<p>

Here we offer no arrant speculation, but
we simply follow the precise warnings cast up by Justice Scalia
in his dissenting opinion, as he began to draw out for the public
the implications of this recent decision.  As Scalia pointed out,
the Association of American Law Schools now requires all of its
members to extract this pledge from law firms that are interviewing
candidates:  that the employer will be willing to hire homosexuals.
At the same time, the Supreme Court has now declared that people
who hold to the traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality
are fueled by an irrational &quot;animus.&quot;

<p>

As far as I know, no Moral Court has managed yet to refute the traditional
Jewish and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet
the Court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.  As Scalia has
observed, the Court now declares serious Jews and Christians to
be nothing less than bigots.  And so, as we put these strands
together, is there not an incentive now, for law firms, to gauge
whether the senior partners or young associates harbor views that
may put the firm at odds with the regulations of the law schools?
While affecting no prejudice, mind you, toward people who are
serious about their religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen
out people who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and
Jews.

<p>

The incentives will not emanate simply from the conventions
of the law schoools.  After all, if the Supreme Court itself has
now declared that a moral objection to homosexuality is indefensible,
irrational, the distillation of unreasoned prejudice or &quot;animus,&quot;
does the Court not in fact install the predicate for grievances
and litigation?  If a young, gay associate is denied standing
as a partner, could it not be claimed that the climate in the
firm was poisoned at the outset, or set in a discriminatory cast,
by the presence of senior partners who bore moral reservations
about homosexuality?  What can be said in this respect for law
firms could be said even more forcefully about the colleges and
universities.  Given the litigious experience these days in the
academy, we can virtually <b>count</b> on the fact that grievances will
be filed.  What if a member of an academic department has simply
done what I have done -- given public testimony, or published
articles, staking out a position or defending a moral judgment
on gay marriage?  Might that supply a <i>prima facie</i> ground for a
grievance later?  Might it not be argued--and will it not be argued
-- that the situation was at least biased, or tilted, at the outset
by the presence of that member of the Faculty?  Can we expect
then certain pressures, subtle and unsubtle, to separate those
members of the faculty from the decisions on tenure -- or hiring.
And might it finally be best to remove the problem at the root
simply by avoiding the hiring of people who bear these religious
and moral sentiments, which the Supreme Court has now declared
to be prejudicial and irrational, without any redeeming features?

<p>

In sum, the Court has fashioned, in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, a powerful
new instrument.  That decision provides now a &quot;clean&quot;
device for blocking from the academy, and the professions, people
who are &quot;overly religious,&quot; overly serious about their
Christianity or Judaism, which is to say, people who take seriously
the traditional moral teachings of Christianity and Judaism.

<p>

The uses of this decision are portentous in their possibilities
-- which is why it is so critical that Congress takes the first
step in forcing the question.  For in acting, the Congress sharpens
the question for the Clinton administration.  Mr. Clinton has
already indicated that he will sign the Defense of Marriage Act
-- something, presumably, he would not do if he thought there
was anything unconstitutional in this measure.  But at the same
time, his spokesman has announced that the administration welcomed
the decision in <i>Romer v. Evans</i> as quite appropriate or justified.

<p>

In that event, the administration will be pressed to settle
the jural mind of Mr. Clinton:  Would the administration agree
with Prof. Eskridge and the people who would extract the broader
principle from <i>Romer</i> and use it to challenge the constitutionality
of the Defense of Marriage Act?  If so, then presumably President
Clinton would veto this act as unconstitutional.  But if the President
is still inclined to sign the act, if he is inclined then to defend
its constitutionality, then his administration would be obliged
to show just where the gay activists are wrong.  They could help
to establish then just how the decision in <i>Romer</i> could be narrowed
and limited.  If the administration could do that, it would be
rendering, almost in spite of itself, a public service.  And if
the Congress induced the administration to perform that service,
then this Defense of Marriage Act will produce a good that moves
well beyond the question of marriage in the laws.

<p>

But I would return, in closing, to the problem I mentioned at the 
beginning of these remarks, the problem posed by Congressman Frank. I 
said that the sky would not fall in, there may be no signs of deterioriation
in the neighborhood, as a consequence of recognizing a gay marriage,
but that kind of evidence was rather beside the point.  We were
dealing here with certain questions of principle, and with harms
that may not be measured with immediate, material injuries.  Those
questions involved the grounds of principle that underly the laws
on marriage, and the ground on which we favor that structure of
commitment and lawfulness as the framework for begetting and nurturing
children.  Some of us drew attention to the problem of polygamy
as a place where those questions of principle may be sharply focussed.
But it also suggests the kinds of changes that may make a profound
difference for the character and fabric of our lives if the laws
of marriage begin to come apart.  During the hearings, Congressman
Frank's inclination was to treat these arguments with derision
and scoffing.  He was not aware of any national movement pressing
for the return of polygamy.  Mr. Ed Fallon, a legislator from
Iowa, had testified at the hearings in favor of gay marriage,
and when the problem of polygamy was posed to him by Congressman
Sensenbrenner, he remarked that polygamy simply &quot;wasn't a
big issue&quot; in his State.

<p>

But as I said, we had been raising
questions of principle, not making predictions about a new trend
toward polygamy.  Yet, the people who were inclined to dismiss
the matter so lightly were treating, with a certain nonchalance,
something that deserved to be treated with far more caution and
sobriety.  For as it happens, polygamy has persisted, in isolated
pockets in our own country, even in our own day.  For many years,
there have been centers of polygamy in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, which have proven intractable.  There were outbreaks
of violence in the late 70s, throughout the 80s, and on into the
90s, as the authorities carried out raids in an effort to repress
the practice.  Mr. Ed Fallon remarked, with offhandedness, that
polygamy just doesn't happen to be a big issue back in Iowa.
But it seems to have eluded this earnest man that polygamy doesn't
happen to be an issue in his State precisely because the law,
for many years, has cast up serious barriers to polygamy.  The
federal government once had to send troops into Utah as part of
the scheme to repress the practice.  If those barriers started
coming down, do we really think that our species is incapable
of manifesting an interest in that arrangement once again?

<p>

When the proponents of gay marriage show a flippant disregard then
for polygamy, they show not only a want of historical memory,
but a dimness of moral imagination. It does not apparently enter
their reckoning of the world that political movements are often
stirred on and channeled by &quot;principles.&quot;

<p>

Nor do they readily see that the argument for gay marriage would sweep 
away the impediments of the law that impede, among other things, the
interest in polygamy.  These innocent people, who casually dismiss
these prospects out of hand, are part of that tribe described
by Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>: Their defect of understanding &quot;is
not due to a lack of years but living the kind of life which is
a succession of unrelated emotional experiences.&quot;  As the
principles they are planting now work themselves out, and the
results kick in, these people, in their childish candor, will
be the first to record their surprise.  And to tell us, earnestly,
that they never expected things to go this far.

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</h2>

<i>by<br>
Brenda Destro, D.S.W.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Good morning.  Today, I would like to discuss the following points:

<p><ul>

<li>Those who advance an agenda of homosexual rights and same-sex
relationships have shown little regard for the developmental needs
of preteens and teens.

<p>

<li>It is most evident in the design of sex education curricula
offered to 10- to 18-year-olds in most public schools throughout
our country.

<p>

<li>The subject of homosexuality, along with other topics, is
included in most sex education curricula more as the &quot;politically
correct&quot; thing to do, and not balanced with the cognitive,
emotional, social, and moral, needs of the children who participate
with harmful results.

<p>

<li>As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are further sanctioned,
then these topics will be given even greater recognition and a
higher profile in sex ed curricula.  This will result in more
harm, unless more recognition is given to teenage developmental
issues.

</ul><p>

Sex education contains many delicate and controversial topics,
such as homosexuality and same-sex relationships, which are not
presented with a lot of consideration to the developmental needs
of preteens/teens.  This puts these children at risk of problems
ranging from developmental delay to more serious emotional problems
or even physical harm.

<p>

Developmental theorists, such as Piaget, Erikson, Kohlberg, and
even Freud believe that there are distinct differences in personality,
in thinking, in socialization, and in morality among children
and adults of different ages.  The pattern by which each of us
goes through these stages is an individual, interrelated, and
interdependent process.  For the most part, each of us acquires
skills in a sequential manner.  Moving into one stage requires
the completion of the previous stage.  And, the absence of certain
skills, makes the learning of new 
behaviors much harder.  Most school curricula is designed around
the theories of Piaget, and to a lesser degree Erikson and Kohlberg.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality, let me give another
example of a less controversial topic in sex ed that is usually
presented in a manner that is not consistent with cognitive development
or the learning capabilities of preteens and teens:  decision-making.
Many sex ed curricula teach decision-making to children, ages
10-18, so that they make appropriate choices regarding their sexual
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them identify a problem,
develop options, assess options, and then make a decision.  Although
my first reaction, along with many parents, was that this is a
good thing for preteens and teens to learn, there is a problem.
Many preteens and teens are not able to think ahead, assess risk,
or fully consider the feelings of others.  Instead, they are more
likely to be self-centered, idealistic, present-oriented, and
impulsive.  The result is that these kids may be able to memorize
or learn the elements of a d-m model, but they are not likely
to use it.

<p>

But the problem is more serious than a teen or preteen not using
a d-m model.  It is a problem of expecting preteens and teens
to act like adults, when they should be acting like teens.  As
much as none of us like it, teens are supposed to be self-centered,
idealistic, and grounded in the present.  These characteristics
provide protection for the teen who is in the process of experimenting
with new ideas and behaviors.  Ultimately, they make mistakes,
but hopefully they learn from these mistakes.  It is much easier
to brush off mistakes when you are self-centered, present-oriented,
and oblivious to consequences.  The role of parents and adults
is to provide a structure that allows the teen to experiment consistent
with their capabilites, and then to be available to help them
learn from the experience.  What is taught in sex ed asks a child
to skip an important stage and try to make critical decisions
without the skills and guidance needed.  This expectation can
and does lure preteens and teens into high risk situation that
are beyond their current capabilities, placing them at risk of
an unwanted pregnancy or even AIDS.  What is needed is for the
child to experiment on a more gradual basis that does not overwhelm
them.  They should experiment, first, with safer tasks and gradually
learn to handle more risk, and always with the guidance of a parent
or other caring adult.

<p>

In the case of learning about homosexuality and same-sex relationships,
the potential for harm also exists.  These are topics that are
now commonly found in sex ed curricula offered through most junior
high and high schools as a result of the growing debate about
homosexuality.  But, as it's being taught, many of these teens
and preteens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development
where it is characteristic for a girls to have one close girlfriend
and boys to have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is critical to forming healthy
relationships.  Yet, there is no distinction made between the
two events in the sex ed curricula.

<p>

All of us, as children first learn emotional intimacy or closeness
in the family as we bond with mother, father, siblings, etc. 
As we reach puberty, we begin to reach outside the family to form
similar bonds with friends of the same sex, and then with groups
of friends of both sexes.  A healthy level of intimacy beomes
an important element of romantic relationships and sexual relationships
in marriage.  This process for the most part occurs in a sequential
fashion.  At each stage the child learns a new level of emotional
intimacy or closeness, if the child has acquired the necessary
skills in a non-threatening and non-sexual environment.  If they
skip a stage or experience a crisis in a stage, the negative aspects
of the stage will predominate making it difficult to handle the
tasks of the next stage.  One way to alleviate the problems is
to go back to that stage and complete the tasks.

<p>

So what happens to the preteens and teens who receive information
about homosexuality and same sex marriages at the same time that
they are bonding with their friends, around the ages of 11 to
14.  Probably for most preteens and teens, they is no harm because
of the support they have from family and friends who can help
them distinguish between the two events.  But for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.

<p>

As the debate continues and homosexuality and same-sex marriages
gain legitimacy, I foresee these topics gaining greater visibility
in sex ed curricula.  If it is not presented in the best interests
of children, but rather in the best interest of the homosexual
rights movement, there is potential for more harm.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON EDUCATION OF HOMOSEXUAL 'MARRIAGE'</title>

<body>

<h2>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON<br>
EDUCATION CURRICULA AND<br>
POLICY OF HOMOSEXUAL<br>
'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Linda Page</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The legal recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; has the
potential to wreak havoc on an already failing public education
system.  Without a doubt, it can fundamentally affect every aspect
of schooling for children.  It will only further erode the moral
base on which our society depends and which our young people so
desperately need.  How ironic that teachers are prohibited by
law from sharing their Christian faith, or school from even posting
a copy of the Ten Commandments at the same time that homosexuals
are radically attacking our bedrock institutions.  What message
are we giving to highly impressionable students regarding our
society's most crucial values?

<p>

Doesn't it signify that legally equating same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;
with our most important social institution is in direct contradiction
to the most deeply held beliefs and values of the overwhelming
majority of Americans?  When was democracy also redefined to mean
that the beliefs and standards of the majority must succumb to
the whims of a special interest group -- even when those whims
are devastatingly destructive to the common good?

<p>

I've been a classroom teacher, reading specialist, an early childhood
education coordinator, and principal in the public schools.  I've
taught first-graders as well as older students.  I've worked the
suburbs and in the inner cities.  I've seen countless programs
implemented throughout the years based on whatever the policymakers
decided schools should teach or on the latest government- or 
university-sponsored ideas. Whatever the latest education craze 
happened to be, educators have been pressured to jump on the bandwagon.

<p>

Phonics was displaced by whole language. &quot;Modern math&quot;
replaced an emphasis on mastery of computation and problem solving
skills.  Explicit sexual training replaced &quot;family life 
education.&quot;  Consider the recent
classic example of William Spady's Outcome Based Education developed
as Far West Regional Lab.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have
been spent using our children as guinea pigs and our classrooms
as labs for unproved educational notions.  Programs which are
in direct contradictions to the values of mainstream America have
been created using taxpayers' money and implemented wholesale
in the schools time and time again.

<p>

As we have progressively made our schools <I><B>less</B></I> about
academics -- only 41 percent of the time secondary students spend
in schools is on academic subjects -- we have virtually expunged
traditional core values from our curricula and textbooks.  The
most far-reaching and damaging method for accomplishing this ignominious
feat has been through the implementation of values clarifications
programs.  According to William Kilpatrick, &quot;For students
it has meant learning to question values they have scarcely acquired,
unlearning values taught at home, and concluding that questions
of right and wrong are always merely subjective.&quot;

<p>

Theodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;To educate a person in mind
and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.&quot;  When
combined whit the unrestrained pursuit of self-interest, the values
clarification approach, also known as the decision-making model,
is reaping results of violence, mayhem, and devastating of the
worst kind among our students.  Why would we even consider further
denigration of values which have stood the test of time and opt
instead for the ill-conceived supposition that all values are
equal?

<p>

<center><h3>POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON SCHOOL CURRICULA AND EDUCATION 
POLICY</h3></center>

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; recognized by law has the mind's
numbing potential to bring with it untold quantities of new and
ravaging educational mandates.  It is possible that classroom
teachers all over the country will be required to implement any
or all of a range of potential changes in our schools.  They might
include:

<ul><p>

<li>Providing new and more intensified self-esteem programs, with
a special homosexual emphasis.  Project 10 was founded by Dr.
Virginia Uribe in 1984 in LAUSD as the first openly homosexual
counseling program.  It also includes sensitivity training for
faculty and tactics to prevent &quot;homophobia&quot; within the
classroom.

<p>

<li>Teaching students that homosexuality is a positive choice.
Three key strategies in Project 10 materials &quot;for managing
heterosexism and homophobia in schooling&quot; are:  1) Include
lesbian and gay issues in curriculum; 2) Include readings which
address homosexual issues on required reading lists; and 3) Encourage
students to write about and discuss &quot;the ways in which homophobia
has impacted their lives.&quot; (Project 10 Handbook)

<p>

<li>An increased emphasis on teaching critical thinking skills
based on students' <I><B>feelings</B></I> about issues instead
of the facts.

<p>

<li>Orwellian &quot;doublespeak&quot; of many new vocabulary words
to accompany the new definition of family.

<p>

<li>Using newly-revised tests and textbooks which are politically-correct.
A 15-page segment in the 443-page <I>Children of the Rainbow</I>
curriculum titled, &quot;Fostering Positive Attitudes Toward Sexuality&quot;
was authored by lesbian Elissa Weindling at the request of the
Gay and Lesbian Teacher's Association.  As a lesbian herself,
she states that, &quot;Teachers of first-graders will have an
opportunity to give children a healthy sense of identity at an
early age.  Classes should include references to lesbian/gay people
in all curricular areas. . . .&quot;

<p>

<li>Teaching &quot;tolerance&quot; of homosexuality in the context
of school to work preparedness.

<p>

<li>Teaching state and national standards which support the value
of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; while undermining traditional
values.

<p>

<li>Stronger moral relativism in all school programs.

<p>

<li>Teaching increasingly liberal, permissive sex education.

<p>

<li>Supporting students in the scorn of virtue and self-restraint
while promoting increased narcissism and self-gratification.

<p>

<li>Teaching the complete redefinition of the family in every
grade level and in every curricular area, beginning with kindergarten
and preschool students (since their social studies curriculum
is about the family).

<p>

<li>Teaching literature to which parents object.  (Selections
which could be included and required with the societal sanction
of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; and the lifestyle which spawned
it should cause every parent to be alarmed.)

<p>

<li>Using more of the already-diminished academic time on social
engineering.

<p>

<li>Teaching new revisions in history which could encompass a
scope far more vast and revisionist than those in the original
proposed national history standards.

<p>

<li>Supporting the politically-correct reinvention of society
even while &quot;research has documented that children without
fathers more often have lower academic performance, more cognitive
and intellectual deficits, increased adjustment problems, and
higher risks for psychosexual development problems.&quot; (George
Rekers)

<p>

<li>Teaching students that whatever they <I><B>think</B></I> is
right or <I><B>feel</B></I> is right <I><B>is</B></I> right, instead
of teaching students genuine critical thinking which necessitates
learning to discern and express what is true -- to submit to truth
and to a set of absolutes.

<p>

<li>Teaching students circular reasoning where they start with
the desired premise and make statements to support it which &quot;prove&quot;
the issue as fact.

<p>

<li>Teaching segments of the <I>Children of the Rainbow</I> curriculum
which promote homosexuality beginning at the earliest levels of
schooling.  (The implementation of this &quot;experiment&quot;
caused a furor in New York City not many years ago with its use
of primary-level reading books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>
and <I>Daddy's Roommate</I> which states that &quot;gay is just
another kind of love.&quot;  These books blatantly and frankly
promote same-sex parenting.)  What will happen to educators who
refuse to teach the new curricula endorsing same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;?

<p>

<li>Teaching major revisions in curricula for literature, reading,
health, sex education. P.E. and drama.

<p>

<li>Supporting extracurricular activities which accommodate gay
and lesbian dating. In May 1994, LAUSD authorized the first gay and 
lesbian prom in the country. (Michael Quintinella)

<p>

<li>Further undermining of parental values and beliefs with more
intensive erosion of the traditional rights of parents.  Same
sex marriage with the force of law will take the rights of parents
away to decide what their children are taught about homosexuality.

<p>

<li>Diluting character education programs to accommodate the new
value system.

<p>

<li>Implementing new state and national standards which present
homosexual marriage as equal to traditional family values.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

At precisely the time when schools and society are recognizing
the serious need for character education -- for personal responsibility,
self-discipline and other core virtues -- the most important social
institution on our society is receiving the most serious threat
it has faced in recorded history.

<p>

When doing what <I>feels</I> good matters more than doing what
is right, character education based on absolutes and traditional
moral standards will become a complete misnomer.  Self-control
and responsibility for the greater good will be a contradiction
to the same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; value system.  Since absolutes
of right and wrong will be negated, cheating in schools and students
stealing from each other will also have to be &quot;tolerated,&quot;
among other &quot;values.&quot;

<p>

As Thomas Sowell has stated so well, &quot;To teach issues instead
of intellectual principles to school children is like teaching
calculus to people who have not yet learned arithmetic, or surgery
to people lacking the rudiments of anatomy or hygiene.  Worse,
it is teaching them to go ahead and perform surgery, without worrying
about boring details.&quot;

<p>

Our schools reverberate with violence, declining achievement,
and disrespect for authority.  Legalization of same sex marriage
will only further erode the morel underpinnings and the culture
of the family which has been a primary source of strength throughout
the history of this country and of western civilization.

<p>

At one time in the history of our country, education was virtually
synonymous with moral training.  The traditional virtues and cultural
mores were passed down from generation to generation because they
work.

<p>

Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with their
futures long enough.  Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; is a result
of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking and of 
&quot;value-neutral&quot; curriculums.  One can only shudder to 
consider the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality 
continuum with the perpetuation of such policies.

<p>

Instead of &quot;tolerance and diversity&quot; training for teachers,
we need to implement training programs where educators learn the
noble facts about our country's history and how to teach them
to our students.  They need to become well-versed in the legal
parameters for teaching about religion and the values and virtues
which strengthen our society.

<p>

Amitai Etzioni in <I>The Spirit of Community</I> states, &quot;To
shore up the moral foundations of our society, we start with the
family.  Second in line are the schools.  They are more than places
in which people acquire skills and knowledge....Education includes
the reinforcement of values gained at home and the introduction
of values to those children whose parents neglected their character
formation and moral upbringing.  Third are the social webs that
communities provide in neighborhoods, at work, and in ethnic clubs
and associations....Fourth, the national society must ensure that
local communities will not lock in values that we ars a more encompassing
and overriding community, abhor...&quot;

<p>

He states further, &quot;In the 50s we had a well-established
society, but it was unfair to women and minorities and a bit authoritarian.
In the 60s we undermined the established society and its values.
In the 80s we were told that the unbridled pursuit of self-interest
was virtuous.  By the 90s we have seen the cumulative results.&quot;

<p>

Where do we go from here?  The destruction of one of our most
vital institutions is threatened.  We must protect our children
now.

<title>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS AFFECTED</title>

<h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS<br>
AFFECTED</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Mary Beth Style, M.S.W.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Whenever there is a discussion of adoption it is generally useful
to remind the audience of the purpose of adoption.  In the United
States, adoption has traditionally been an institution to create
families for children when their biological families could not
or would not raise them.  The law has been very careful to ensure
that adoptive families are treated the same, for all intents and
purposes, as families who gave birth to their children.  In addition,
the law also requires that the child be at the center of all adoption
policy and practice.  Unfortunately, in recent years, some who
have attempted to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing
the needs of children, but instead are promoting the cause of
adults.  Discussions about &quot;right to adopt&quot; are clearly
not child-centered, but adult-driven.

<p>

Adoption law varies substantially from state to state in matters
relative to time frames for taking consents or overturning adoption
decrees.  But the states are unanimous on one point:  an adoption
cannot be granted  by a judge unless it is proven to be in the
best interest of the child.  While there may be a difference of
opinion about what is in the best interest of a particular child,
the law is clear that it is the child that matters, not the adults.

<p>

Except for a very few exceptions, adoption law and policy has
attempted to stay away from categorizing who can and cannot adopt.
The exceptions generally would be limited to prohibiting persons
with a history of abuse or crime from adopting.  In addition,
Florida and New Hampshire prohibited by statute homosexuals from
adopting.  In virtually every other state, until recently, the
law has allowed only married couples or a single individual to
adopt.  The reason  for this policy, which I believe is sound,
is that the state believed that adults should make a legal commitment
to each other before making the commitment to a child to ensure stability
for the child.  A true family, which adoption is intended to create,
cannot exist if the only legal relationship between the parties
exists through the child only.

<p>

While it is true that this policy has prevented two homosexuals
from adopting a child, it also has prevented unmarried heterosexuals.
There have been exceptions to the rule as individual courts have
allowed adoptions by unrelated adults to proceed.  One of the
more celebrated cases is the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow adoptions.
Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage between homosexuals,
it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to adopt a child
because they will be meeting the marriage requirement.

<p>

However, while it is true that a judge must give final approval
to an adoption once he or she determines it to be in the best
interest of the child, the real decision making generally occurs
at an earlier point by the individual or agency making the placement.
While few of us would want social service agencies to arbitrarily
prevent appropriate people from being able to adopt, I do believe
that we must be very careful about suggesting that any individuals
or groups should have the right to adopt.

<p>

There is no &quot;right&quot; to adopt and to create one would
be contrary to the best interests of children because instead
of finding the most appropriate family for a child, the state
and its agents would have to ensure that adults are allowed to
adopt a child.  Since a &quot;right&quot; is a guarantee, the
state would be required to &quot;guarantee&quot; a child for adoption.
The absurdity of that position is obvious.  Yet, I am troubled
by discussions in recent years by some who are promoting &quot;gay
rights&quot; who are proposing that there ought to be a right
to adopt.

<p>

Instead, decisions about children should be made based on an individual
child's needs, taking into account any existing relationships
the child may have.  We have a growing body of evidence which
shows the damage done to children who are raised without fathers.
Much of that research emphasizes the differences in parenting
styles between mothers and fathers and shows that each is important
for the healthy development of children.  It is clear that it
is not an issue of quantity when it comes to parenting.  A child
who is raised by his mother and grandmother, may have tow parents
for all intents and purposes to share the load, but the absence
of a father is still very apparent in his development.

<p>

There is no denying that many children raised by single parents
and children raise by homosexuals are doing very well.  But the
child who is raised by a mother and a father has an easier time
of it and has the opportunity to experience and model the behaviors
of both sexes.

<p>

In adoption, it has traditionally been the responsibility of the
field and the state to stack the deck in favor of the child. 
Many policies appear to be unfair to adults, but again adoption
is not about  adults.  For example, many individuals balk at the
notion that adopting parents should be in good health arguing
that many individuals who give birth have chronic health conditions
or that none of us knows when we might be hit by a car.

<p>

While both of those arguments are valid, it is the obligation
of the social worker or agency to weigh the odds in favor of the
child.  It is more likely that healthy parents will be around
to see a child grow to maturity than a parent with a serious medical
condition.  So, too, policies which give preference to married
heterosexuals stack the deck in favor of the child.  While it
may be true that in certain cases, where an individual has a relationship
with a particular child or has a special gift to match the special
needs of a particular child, it is in the best interest of a child
to be adopted by a single person, whether heterosexual or homosexual.

<p>

But, if we truly are looking at the best interest of the and not
concerned about the appearance of being tolerant of adults, we
will select whenever possible, a mother and a father for child.
Kids do not care about being politically correct.  They just
want a mommy and a daddy.

<title>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS' ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<h2>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS'<br>
ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Peter LaBarbera</center>

<p>

This presentation was given at a July 2, 1996 briefing on Capitol
Hill regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p><br>

<center>&quot;Marriages between homosexuals should be recognized....<br>
We must accept a homosexual orientation in young people in the same<br>
manner we accept a heterosexual orientation....&quot;</center>

<p>

These are two recommendations by gay activist Paul Gibson in his
paper, &quot;Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide,&quot; which is
being used to promote &quot;gay friendly&quot; policies in schools
nationwide.  Recent months and years have witnessed the beginnings
of an unprecedented campaign by homosexual activists to affirm
homosexuality and so-called &quot;gay youth&quot; in schools.
This effort, advanced on a hundred fronts from Utah to New Hampshire,
has made steady gains while the nation's attention is focused
on another radical homosexual goal: legalizing gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p>

The campaign to teach schoolchildren and teens that &quot;gay
is OK&quot; benefits from the usual coordination of a united &quot;gay&quot;
movement which has the advantage of pressing for a <I>single radical
goal</I>, versus its pro-family opponents who face a multiplicity
of challenges.  Parents who simply want a good education for their
children are increasingly confronted with the prospect of seeing
precious educational resources spent on talking about homosexuality,
and they are drawn into time-consuming and divisive debates over
this issue.

<p>

Of course, the questions of homosexuality instruction in schools
and &quot;gay marriage&quot; are linked, as homosexual activists
and their educational allies argue that students need to be presented
with &quot;positive&quot; images of &quot;gay role models&quot;
to counter the negative representations of &quot;homophobic&quot;
society.  What could be more positive than teaching children that
-- just like heterosexuals -- gays and lesbians get married and
raise children?

<p>

As surely as summer follows spring, legal homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
would quickly be seized upon by pro-gay educators as the latest
teaching tool to inculcate the normalcy of homosexuality to young 
minds.  How young?  The publishers of the latest homosexual children's 
book, &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; tell us it is &quot;appropriate 
for children ages 2 to 6.&quot; The book uses colorful pictures to 
tell the story of a young boy, Nick, who is &quot;best man&quot; at 
the &quot;wedding&quot; ceremony between his &quot;gay&quot; daddy 
and his homosexual lover. One page shows the men kissing at the altar 
as young Nick looks on.  &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; is published by the 
same company that gave us &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and 
&quot;Daddy's Roommate.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>THE &QUOT;GAY YOUTH&QUOT; CAMPAIGN AND &QUOT;SAFE 
SCHOOLS&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Efforts to affirm so-called homosexual youth advance under the
rubric of promoting &quot;diversity&quot; and enhancing 
&quot;self-esteem&quot; -- two fads in today's faltering public 
schools.  The campaign rests on several tendentious suppositions 
that have barely begun to be fully debated by larger society, 
foremost among them is the myth that a certain percentage of kids 
have a &quot;gay&quot; (or <I>lesbian, bisexual or transgendered</I>) 
&quot;identity&quot; which they were likely born with, and which is 
unchangeable. Educators are tasked with affirming such children and 
helping them cope in the midst of a homophobic culture.

<p>

With this goal in mind of shoring up the &quot;gay minority&quot;
of students, gay activists have chosen a strategy of promoting,
not homosexuality, they say, but &quot;safe schools.&quot;  The
cunning strategy relies heavily on winning public sympathy for
&quot;gay youth&quot; as a besieged victim group in schools. 
It was  best outlined in a recent speech by Kevin Jennings, a
homosexual and former high school teacher who is now executive
director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network (GLSTN),
a 3,000-member organization crusading against &quot;homophobia&quot;
in schools.  Listen to Jennings describe how the &quot;safe schools&quot;
approach helped cripple the pro-family opposition and win passage
in Massachusetts of a 1994 law -- the first of its kind in the
nation -- banning &quot;discrimination&quot; in public schools
based on &quot;sexual orientation:&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>We immediately seized upon the opponents' calling card -- safety
-- and explained how homophobia represents a threat to students'
safely by creating a climate where violence, name-calling, health
problems, and suicide are common....We knew that, confronted with
real-life stories of youth who had suffered from homophobia, our
opponents would automatically be on the defensive:  they would
have to attack people who had already been victimized once, which
put them in a bully position from which it would be hard to emerge
looking good.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Keeping the above victim imagery in mind, it is easy to envision
pro-gay educators teaching their youthful subjects that the inability
of homosexuals to get married is just one more in a litany of
&quot;civil rights&quot; denied to homosexuals.  Hopefully this
will not be offered as part of a history course in the near or
distant future.

<p>

<center><h3>THE SUICIDE SCAM</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue of &quot;gay
youth&quot; suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in schools,
hyping a non-existent &quot;epidemic&quot; to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As Jennings said, &quot;In Massachusetts, no one could speak
up against our frame and say, 'Why yes, I do think students should
kill themselves.'  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.&quot;

<p>

There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of &quot;gay youth&quot; suicides is baseless,
and relies mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual
activist.  Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most &quot;gay-friendly&quot;
areas like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad
fact of homosexual life, not the fault of society.  As Alan Medenger,
a former homosexual, says, &quot;It is tragic, even criminal,
to lead a child into homosexuality because he or she showed some
degree of sexual confusion in adolescence.&quot;

<p>

And yet confirming &quot;gay youth&quot; in their homosexuality
is precisely the goal of GLSTN and countless other homosexual
organizations who routinely repeat the claim that homosexual youth
make up one-third of all youth suicides.  The figure has its origins
in a paper San Francisco gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was
part of an Health and Human Services report on youth suicide.
Gibson's report, which was repudiated by HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan, made the claim that &quot;gay youth&quot; made up &quot;30
percent&quot; of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus &quot;gay&quot; number -- that homosexuals represent 10
percent of the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University
psychiatrist and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent
suicide, said, &quot;I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's]
mathematics, but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.&quot;
Shaffer also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay
suicide is common is &quot;an excellent example of how bad research
provides misleading answers that can come home to roost.&quot;

<p>

To illustrate the tendentious nature of Paul Gibson's &quot;research,&quot;
it is useful to examine some of his other claims and recommendations
found in the paper he submitted to HHS and later repudiated by
Secretary Sullivan:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A substantial number of youth -- perhaps one in 10 --
have a primary gay male, lesbian or bisexual orientation....&quot;

<p>

&quot;Transsexual youth who are open about their identity face
extreme abuse and rejection from their families....The only known
course of treatment is to help transsexuals adjust to their believed
gender identity and obtain sex-assignment surgery.  Most transsexual
youth, however, are unable to obtain or afford the help they need
in resolving their identity conflicts...&quot;

<p>

&quot;Homosexuality...is a natural and healthy expression of
human sexuality...All youth need to be presented with positive
information about homosexuality that presents it as a viable adaptation....It
is important for schools to hire openly gay male and lesbian teachers
to serve as role models and resource people for gay youth.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Religions need to reassess homosexuality in a positive
context within their belief systems....Religions should also take
responsibility for providing their families and membership with
positive information about homosexuality that discourages the
oppression of lesbians and gay men.  Faiths that condemn homosexuality
should recognize how they contribute to the rejection of gay youth
by their families and suicide among lesbians and gay male youth.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

So, the next time you hear a homosexual activist claim that a
&quot;government study&quot; found that 30 percent of all youth
suicides are committed by homosexuals, remember that the same
gay activist who produced that &quot;study&quot; also calls for
reaching out to &quot;transsexual youth&quot; and says religions
need to shed their homophobia.

<p>

<center><h3>OTHER PRO-GAY PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS</h3></center>

<p>

Beyond hyping suicide as a justification for homosexual-affirming
policies in schools, gay educators and their allies are promoting
a variety of other strategies to accomplish their goal of normalizing
homosexuality, among them:

<p><ul>

<li>Promoting the celebration of &quot;Gay History Month&quot;
in schools to provide students with positive homosexual role models.
In these programs, notables like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
are often portrayed factually as &quot;gay&quot; without giving
contradictory historical evidence.  Even if such figures did have
homosexual tendencies, many question why this aspect of their
lives should be stressed in history lessons.  Brilliance is, sadly,
often accompanied by destructive behavior.  Certainly quite an
impressive list of historical notables could be compiled if it
were to be decided that schools should celebrate &quot;Alcoholic
History Month&quot; or &quot;Adulterers History Month.&quot;

<p>

<li>Creating &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth alliances in high
schools, which frequently become conduits for pro-homosexual propagandizing
to student bodies. In the conservative town of Dedham, Massachusetts,
this was done with taxpayer monies as parents were stunned to
learn that a &quot;gay-straight&quot; alliance (which they didn't
even know existed) had received $2,000 in state funds to distribute
a questionnaire on &quot;gay&quot; issues to all homerooms at
the local high school.  One of the survey's questions was, &quot;Do
you feel lesbian or gay people should be allowed to marry?&quot;
It goes without saying that &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth groups
play perfectly to a youngster's tendency to adopt political positions
contrary to those of his or her parents.  Hence rallying behind
the &quot;civil rights&quot; of fellow &quot;gay&quot; students
wins ample student support and will be fully exploited by adult
homosexual activist groups like GLSTN.

<p>

<li>Affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly
affirm their gay &quot;identity&quot; to schoolchildren.  One
lesbian teacher recently made headlines by using a pink triangle
to inform students that her class was a &quot;safe zone&quot;
for &quot;gays.&quot;  Parents were not informed of the decision.
GLSTN held five regional conferences for homosexual teachers
during the 1996-96 school year. At one such conference in Los
Angeles, lesbian activist Donna Redwing declared, &quot;We're
here, we're queer, we're in the classroom.&quot;  The assembled
GLSTN-affiliated teachers cheered Redwing's declaration.  Hence
GLSTN conferences serve to radicalize homosexual teachers, making
them more likely to openly promote homosexuality as something
positive (or at least benign or neutral) to their students when
they return to their classrooms.

<p>

<li>Address the issue of how to combat &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes in young schoolchildren (kindergarten through sixth-grade).
The homosexual activist group GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation) recently called on the FCC to demand that
children's television (&quot;Ernie and Bert,&quot; etc.) be used
to teach children about the &quot;horrors of homophobia.&quot;

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists are deadly serious about using the education
process to teach kids that homosexuality is okay, and that anyone
who thinks otherwise is a &quot;bigot.&quot;  If parents are not
vigilant in ferreting out such propaganda and countering it, they
will witness the rise of a generation hostile to five millennia
of Judeo-Christian teaching proscribing homosexual behavior.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: EXPERT TESTIMONY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
EXPERT TESTIMONY</h2></center>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>The following are excerpts from a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill
briefing regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

<center><h3>RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public
sentiment where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping
of public policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage.
These are: 1) That homosexuality is genetic, and that consequently,
2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea is true, and in
fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary.
The Americans being most severely harmed by the propagation of
these untruths are the very large number of homosexuals who wish
nothing more than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses
and establish quiet marriages and families.  The gay and lesbian
activism that claims to speak for these many struggling fellow
citizens speaks for their interests in no way whatsoever.  Completely
ignored are the very large number of people who have already succeeded
in leaving homosexuality behind....Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of over fifteen
years of massively-funded education programs.  They have also
found that a shocking 30 percent of all currently 20-year-old
young men who identify themselves as 'gay' will be either HIV-positive
or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30. Yet, as is widely known
and confirmed by recent research, many of these young men will
spontaneously leave homosexuality behind....With respect to genetics,
even those recent studies widely touted as demonstrating the innate,
biological and genetically determined nature of homosexuality
demonstrate precisely the contrary, and a careful reading of the
authors themselves makes this clear.&quot; -- <I>Jeffrey B. Satinover,
M.D., psychiatrist, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child Psychiatry
at Yale University, and author of</I> Homosexuality and the Politics
of Truth.

<p>

<center><h3>THE LAW AND MARRIAGE</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would
support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the remotest
interest in promoting polygamy, but this much may fairly be said: They 
have the most profound interest, rooted in the logic of their doctrine,
in discrediting the notion that marriage finds its defining ground
in 'nature.'  Their rhetorical strategy, their public arguments,
have all been directed explicitly to the derision of that claim
that sexuality in the strictest sense involves the sexuality 'imprinted
in our natures.'  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue by
raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even further.
The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot accommodate
couples of the same sex without so altering the cast or character
of marriage that it will cease to be that special relation, which
seems to be the object of such deep craving now for so many people.
Once the notion of marriage is broadened in that way, it will
simply not be tenable any longer to hold up marriage, in the laws,
as a relation that deserves a special place, a special commendation
-- a special effort to sustain and promote it.  This Act is the
most delicate and limited measure that the Congress could produce
on the subject.  It treats subjects that are evidently within
the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least intrusion into
the domain of State law.  What other institution could possibly
have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?&quot; -- <I>Hadley
Arkes, Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions at
Amherst College.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>REAL RECOVERY</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay. I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight. My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us. I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and, although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  America must take
a very strong stand against the very highly organized gay community
in this country by supporting The Defense of Marriage Act.  If
we don't say 'no' to the organized gay community now, the United
States will suffer the consequences of our complacency.  America
needs to start helping homosexuals recover from their sexual brokenness.
Putting a stamp of approval on a lifestyle by legally recognizing
it (and even calling it marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.
It's perpetuating a myth and delivering them over to a death-style.&quot;
-- <I>Anthony Falzarano, former homosexual, executive director
of Transformation Ministries.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE GAY RIGHTS AGENDA</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Most Americans believe in the philosophy of 'live and let
live.'  They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals any
more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.  When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business, but imposing it on every single citizen.  If you are
a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone who believes
homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law declares homosexuality
a protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside
civil law.  This has very serious implications, for if the law
declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry, then the entire
power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought against you.
Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love; religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged....The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack
in the states which have special rights for 'sexual orientation.'
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.&quot;
-- <I>Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family
Research Council.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE MYTH OF 'GAY TEEN SUICIDE'</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue
of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in
schools, hyping a non-existent 'epidemic' to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As (homosexual and former high school teacher Kevin) Jennings
recently said, 'In Massachusetts, no one could speak up against
our frame and say, &quot;Why yes, I do think students should kill
themselves.&quot;  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.'
(Editor's note:  Jennings is now executive director of the Gay,
Lesbian and Straight Teacher's Network, or GLSTN, a 3,000-member
organization crusading against &quot;homophophia&quot; in schools.)
There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of 'gay youth' suicides is baseless, and relies
mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual activist.
Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most 'gay-friendly' areas
like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad fact
of homosexual life, not the fault of society....And yet confirming
'gay youth' in their homosexuality is precisely the goal of GLSTN
and countless other homosexual organizations who routinely repeat
the claim that homosexual youth make up one-third of all youth
suicides.  The figure has its origins in a paper San Francisco
gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was part of a Health and Human 
Services report on youth suicide.  Gibson's report, which was repudiated 
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, made the claim that 'gay youth' made
up '30 percent' of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus 'gay' number -- that homosexuals represent 10 percent of
the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University psychiatrist
and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent suicide,
said, 'I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's] mathematics,
but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.'  Shaffer
also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay suicide is
common is 'an excellent example of how bad research provides misleading
answers that can come home to roost.'&quot; -- <I>Peter LaBarbera,
editor and founder of</I> The Lambda Report on Homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EFFECTS ON SAME-SEX FRIENDSHIPS</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Many...(junior and high school) teens and preteens are entering
a phase in their psychosocial development where it is characteristic
for girls to have one close girlfriend and boys to have one close
boyfriend.  This is an important phase in learning emotional intimacy
that is crucial to forming healthy relationships....So what happens
to the preteens and teens who receive information about homosexuality
and same-sex 'marriages' at the same time that they are bonding
with their friends (around the ages of 11-14)...for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.&quot; -- <I>Brenda Destro, D.S.W., Adjunct Professor for
Studies on Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and
former social work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and the Institute
for Human Resources (IHR).</I>

<center><h3>NO 'RIGHT' TO ADOPT</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Unfortunately, in recent years, some who have attempted
to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing the needs
of children, but instead are promoting the cause of adults.  Discussions
about 'rights to adopt' are clearly not child-centered, but 
adult-driven....Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage 
between homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to 
adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....There
is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary to
the best interests of children, because instead of finding the
most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.  The absurdity of that position
is obvious.&quot; -- <I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., former vice president
for policy and practice of the National Council for Adoption.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>SEX EDUCATION</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with
their futures long enough....Our kids will be bombarded with the
propaganda from books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
marriage is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums.  One can only shudder to consider
the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality continuum
with the perpetuation of such policies....We have communicated
to students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous...&quot;
-- <I>Linda Page, former school principal, education consultant,
talk show host and writer.</I>

<title>THE CASE FOR LIFE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE CASE FOR LIFE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Gracie Hsu</center>

<p>

This speech was presented before the Washington Health Policy
Fellows Program of the American Medical Students Association on
June 20, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

The first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is &quot;do no harm.&quot;
That pledge, which each of you will undoubtedly take before you
become full-fledged physicians, is grounded in the simple truth
that human life is valuable and precious at all stages of life
and that the high call of the physician is to help preserve, not
destroy, human life.  This could also be the motto of the pro-life
community, for it is that truth which motivates, indeed, compels
the pro-life community to do what we do.

<p>

And what is it that we do?  In the words of Proverbs 31, we &quot;speak
up for those who cannot speak for themselves.&quot;  On the individual
level, we help women who feel they have no other choice but to
abort their unborn children to choose a better, albeit not easy,
alternative.  We seek to minister to her emotional, spiritual,
physical, and financial needs because many women have expressed
the fact that they chose abortion because they lacked the resources
to meet these needs.  Indeed, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports
that women usually choose abortion for three main reasons.  Three-fourths
of respondents say that having a baby would interfere with work,
school, or other responsibilities.  Two-thirds say say they cannot
afford to have a child.  Half of the respondents say they do not
want to be a single parent or that they have problems in their
relationship with their husband or partner.

<p>

Thus, the pro-life community strives to meet the needs of these
women through crisis pregnancy centers.  These centers help pregnant
women one woman at a time.  They find out her needs, and seek
to help her choose life for her unborn baby by aiding her either
through an adoption process or by providing the soon-to-be mother
with material goods such as maternity clothing and baby necessities.
Counselors provide emotional and often spiritual support and
are committed to helping that mother for as long as she needs.

<p>

On the policy level, we seek to influence members of Congress
to uphold laws that acknowledge the humanity of the unborn and
overturn those laws which do not respect the moral opposition that the 
public holds against abortion.  Banning partial-birth abortions and 
amending the abortion mandate for medical school accreditation are just
two examples of our efforts during this 104th Congress.  I will
address each of these initiatives in more detail later on in the
presentation.

<p>

For right now, though, the most important thing that I want to
communicate to you is why pro-lifers do what we do.  There are
three main reasons which can broadly be stated this way:  (1)
Abortion takes the lives of unborn children; (2) Abortion hurts
women; and (3) Abortion is detrimental to society.

<p>

I realize that those are broad generalizations, but I'd like to
delve into each aspect individually here, in more detail.  We'll
tackle the first aspect first:  Abortion takes the lives of unborn
children.  This is the most well-known of the three arguments.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the saying that &quot;abortion
stops a beating heart.&quot;  Well, it does.  With the development
of modern technology and advancements in the fields of embryology
and perinatology, the public is being made more aware that a fetus
is far from &quot;a blob of tissue,&quot; but rather an unborn
human being which bears great resemblance to, nothing less than,
a baby.  Although this should not be news to you as medical students,
for many, the perception that abortion only removes a &quot;blob
of tissue&quot; persists.  At least one feminist has said that
the reason pro-choicers cling to that belief is because it makes
abortion more comfortable, more justifiable, if it can be grounded
in the denial that the fetus is really a baby.

<p>

Regardless of what people choose to think, though, abortion does
indeed take the lives of unborn children.  It was a realization
like this one, in fact, which gave Norma McCorvey, the &quot;Roe&quot;
of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, pause to begin reconsidering her position
on abortion.  As Ms. McCorvey tells it, she looked at a whole
row of empty park swings one day and asked herself, &quot;Where
are all the children?&quot;  She suddenly thought, &quot;Oh no!
They've all been aborted!&quot;  This was the beginning of Ms.
McCorvey's journey towards a pro-life perspective.  Today, Ms.
McCorvey has not only disavowed her pro-choice stance, but she
has also become 100 percent pro-life.  She believes that life
should be protected at all stages, from conception until natural
death.

<p>

The second reason why pro-lifers do what we do is because abortion
hurts women.  As the previous example of Norma McCorvey shows,
many women are haunted by abortion, a condition now known as post-abortion
grief or trauma.

<p>

Another person who could tell you about post-abortion grief is
someone you would not expect.  Naomi Wolf, a self-proclaimed pro-choice
feminist wrote a brutally candid article in <I>The New Republic</I>
entitled, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls.&quot;  In it, she writes
about a Cornell-educated cardiologist who said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I had an abortion when I was a single mother and my daughter
was 2 years old.  I would do it again.  But you know how in the
Greek myths when you kill a relative you are pursued by furies?
For months, it was as if baby furies were pursuing me.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This being pursued by &quot;baby furies&quot; is a common symptom
of post-abortion grief, as counselors from Project Rachel will
tell you.  Project Rachel, a post-abortion healing ministry, helps
both men and women find healing and forgiveness from their feelings
of loss and guilt.

<p>

The numbers of women who are experiencing this grief and who are
now willing to talk about it is reaching a critical mass.  That
is not altogether surprising considering the fact that 1.5 million
abortions take place in the United States every year.  (That's
more than 4,100 abortions every day.)  That amounts to a lot of
women who are hurting and grieving not only for the child they
have lost, but also over the weight of their own guilt.  Counselors
at crisis pregnancy centers are overwhelmed at the numbers of
women who come to them for post-abortion counseling.  These counselors
do their best to provide comfort to post-abortive mothers in their
grief, helping them find healing rather than internalizing their
guilt.

<p>

Men also suffer from post-abortion grief. <I>The Washington Post</I>
recently published an extraordinary first-person article by one
of its regular staff writers entitled, &quot;Remembering Thomas.&quot;
Phil McCombs writes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>When the abortion was performed, I was out of town on business
too.  I made sure of that.  Whatever physical, emotional and spiritual
agony the woman suffered, I was not by her side to support her.
I turned my face away.  My behavior was in all respects craven,
immoral.

<p>

For some instinctual reason, or just imaginatively, I've come
to believe that it was a boy, a son whom I wanted killed because,
at the time, his existence would have inconvenienced me. I'd
had my fun.  He didn't fit into my plans.

<p>

His name, which is carved on my heart, was Thomas.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The writer continues:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I feel like a murderer -- which isn't to say that I blame anyone
else, or think anyone else is a murderer.

<p>

It's just the way I feel, and all the rationalizations in the
world haven't changed this.  I still grieve for little Thomas.
It is an ocean of grief.  From somewhere in the distant past
I remember the phrase from Shakespeare, &quot;the multitudinous
seas incarnadine.&quot;

<p>

When I go up to the river on vacation this summer, he won't
be going boating with me on the lovely old wooden runabout that
I can't really afford to put in the water but can't bring myself
to discard, either.

<p>

He won't be lying on the grass by the tent at night, looking
at the starry sky and saying, &quot;What's that one called, Dad?&quot;

<p>

Because there was no room on the Earth for Thomas.

<p>

He's dead.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Phil McCombs found solace from his grief through Eileen C. Marx,
formerly communications director for Cardinal James A. Hickey
of Washington and now a columnist for Catholic publications.
He was able to undergo a &quot;healing process of recognition,
grieving and ultimately forgiveness.&quot;

<p>

Another way in which abortion hurts women is that it separates
men from their pregnant wives or girlfriends during the critical
time when many women most need their support.  Abortion has contributed
to the sense that women are alone in their decision-making.  This
is what happened to Thomas' mother.  Feeling a sense of abandonment,
many women choose abortion because they feel that they have no
other choice but abortion.   Indeed, the law states that abortion
is purely a decision between a woman and her 
doctor -- no spousal consent, no parental consent (in many cases).
As a result, though the father of that child is just as responsible
for helping to create the growing life in her womb, he is forbidden
from taking measures to save his child's life if the mother chooses
abortion.  On the flip side, he's also removed from bearing responsibility
for his child should she decide to keep the child.  He can very
easily say that if he gets a woman pregnant, it is of no consequence
to him.  Why should he feel any obligation to marry her or to
support that child if it is born?  After all, she could have gotten
an abortion.

<p>

Third, abortion is detrimental to society.  Abortion has changed
our perception about unborn life, hardening both men and women
to view a pregnancy first through the selfish lenses which ask
the question, &quot;How does this pregnancy help or harm <I>me</I>,
<I>my</I> future, <I>my</I> life?&quot;  Again, I will quote from
Naomi Wolf's piece, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; in <I>The
New Republic</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The pro-life warning about the potential of widespread abortion
to degrade reverence for life does have a nugget of truth:  a
free-market rhetoric about abortion can, indeed, contribute to
the eerie situation we are now facing, wherein the culture seems
increasingly to see babies not as creatures to whom parents devote
their lives but as accoutrements to enhance parental quality of
life.  Day by day, babies seem to have less value in themselves,
in a matrix of the sacred, than they do as products with a value
dictated by a market economy.

<p>

Stories surface regularly about &quot;worthless&quot; babies
left naked on gratings or casually dropped out of windows, while
&quot;valuable&quot; genetically correct babies are created at
vast expense and with intricate medical assistance for infertile
couples.  If we fail to treat abortion with grief and reverence,
we risk forgetting that, when it comes to the children we choose
to bear, we are here to serve them -- whomever they are:  they
are not here to serve us.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Although a direct causal link cannot be made between the increase
in child abuse and abortion, there certainly is an association
between the two.  Since abortion became legal, the incidence of
child abuse has dramatically increased and the degree of abuse
has steadily worsened.  Perhaps it is because the two do share
a common philosophy that children exist for the parents' convenience
rather than as wards in need of parental protection and nurturance.

<p>

Each of these three broadly-defined reasons -- abortion kills
unborn human beings, abortion hurts women, and abortion is detrimental
to civilized society -- continues to resonate within the hearts
of most of us, even though like many of you, I have never known
a world without legalized abortion.

<p>

As an aside, Generation Xers seem to be even more troubled by
abortion than their immediate elders, the Baby Boomers.  But regardless
of age, public opinion polls show that the American population
at large is deeply troubled by abortion.

<p>

A September 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent agreed that
abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;

<p>

Similarly, a January 1995 CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found
that 60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not
be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  The view
that abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; is shared
by only 38 percent of the population.

<p>

The dichotomy of &quot;pro-life&quot; vs. &quot;pro-choice&quot;
doesn't adequately reflect the sentiments of the American people
about abortion.  Both terms have become highly charged and badly
stereotyped.  The more accurate reflection of how the American
public feels about abortion is noted in their moral opposition
to abortion.  In other words, the debate does not hinge on the
legality of abortion, but on the morality of abortion.

<p>

This now leads me to address a couple of legislative initiatives,
because what Congress or the President does directly impacts the
American people as a whole -- the same American people of whom
a majority morally oppose abortion.

<p>

By far, the most widely-talked about initiative during this 104th
Congress was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.  Through this legislation,
pro-lifers sought to educate the American public first about abortion
itself and then about the specific partial-birth abortion procedure.
A majority of Americans had not been aware that abortion was
legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any or no reason.
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban sought to show people that not
only was it legal for an abortion to occur throughout all nine
months of pregnancy, but also that a procedure as horrific as
a partial-birth abortion could be and was being used without sanction
or restriction.

<p>

For those who do not know what a partial-birth abortion is, it
involves aborting partially-delivered babies from four and a half
months into the pregnancy up to even the ninth month.  The procedure
consists of partially delivering the live baby feet first so that
all but the head is outside the mother's womb.  The head remains
in the uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing
surgical scissors into the base of its head, then suctioning out
the brain by a small tube, and then completing delivery of the
now-dead baby.

<p>

Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so that
he could see the baby.  On the ultrasound screen, I could see
the heart beating.  I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that,
&quot;Yes, that is the heartbeat.&quot;  As Dr. Haskell watched
the baby on the ultrasound screen, he went in with forceps and
grabbed the baby's legs and brought them down into the birth canal.
Then he delivered the body and the arms, all the way up to the
neck.  At this point, only the baby's head was still inside.
The baby's body was moving.  His little fingers were clasping
together.  He was kicking his feet.  All the while his little
head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors
and inserted them into the back of the baby's head.  Then he opened
the scissors up.  Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube
into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out.  I almost threw
up as I watched him do these things....

<p>

I never realized how perfect these babies really are at this
point.  When you hear the word &quot;fetus,&quot; I think a lot
of people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass
or something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban would make it a crime to perform
this procedure except to save the mother's life.  It is but a
modest first step in preventing the horror of late-term abortions.

<p>

According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late-term&quot;
abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between the
two of them.

<p>

As you know, President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban even though it passed both Houses of Congress, garnering support
from many avowed pro-choice advocates, including Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Susan Molinari, and others.
Indeed, New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that he
would vote to override the President's veto because, he said,
the procedure is &quot;too close to infanticide.&quot;

<p>

The second legislative amendment that I'd like to discuss received
very little press this year, but was nonetheless extremely important.
It was the Coats amendment to stop discrimination in the provision
of federal funds to those medical schools which choose not to
mandate abortion training.  Last year, the
23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that
all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology
be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents
expressing moral or religious objections would be able to opt
out of the abortion training.  However, medical institutions opposed
to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals, would still be required
-- in order to maintain their accredited status -- to provide
their students with abortion training by arranging for their students
to receive such training at another location.

<p>

Programs which fail to comply with the new
regulations risk losing their accreditation.  Accreditation status
qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement
for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover,
doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs
to get certified as competent in their specialties.

<p>

ACGME's mandate would have substantively changed
the way in which most medical schools currently operate. The new
policy would mandate that 100 percent of medical schools provided
abortion training to their ob/gyn residents.  However, in 1991,
only 12.4 percent of medical schools provided first-trimester
abortion training on a routine basis; 56.4 percent of schools
offered it on an optional basis.  In terms of second-trimester
abortion training, only 6.7 percent of schools routinely offered
second-trimester abortion training; 58.7 percent provided optional
training.

<p>

Furthermore, about one-third of medical schools
currently refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or
legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals --
which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals -- do not
perform elective abortions because of religious and moral beliefs.
Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed Truman Medical
Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from performing abortions
because laws in several states -- including Missouri -- bar the
use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.

<p>

It is a well-known fact that few physicians
are willing to perform abortions.  A Columbia University survey
found that nearly half of the ob/gyn chief residents graduating
each year have never performed a first-trimester abortion.

<p>

Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Richard Schmidt, a former
president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(1977-1978) and residency review committee member, said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet&quot; not to perform abortions.

<p>

On behalf of those physicians who &quot;voted with their feet&quot;
and those medical institutions with moral objections to abortion,
pro-lifers succeeded in urging Congress to pass -- and the President
to sign -- a bill which would provide permanent protection for
medical schools that decline to provide abortion training.  This
law, first introduced by Senator Dan Coats, protects medical schools
from a loss of federal funds that would have occurred under the
ACGME's untenable directive.

<p>

In addition, pro-lifers have also worked to advance many other
legislative initiatives such as limiting federal funding for abortion
through the Hyde Amendment, promoting adoption as a pro-life alternative,
and halting human embryo experimentation, among many others. 
While I won't go into detail about these latter legislative items,
I hope that the discussion of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban and
the ACGME abortion training mandate has sufficiently served to
demonstrate how the pro-life community has been involved on the
policy level to promote a pro-life message.

<p>

In closing, I ask that each of you, as future physicians and health
policy experts, consider the case for life.  Examine closely the
role which you will play, for it may not be too far in the future
when you personally stand face-to-face with a decision regarding
abortion, or physician-assisted suicide, or fetal tissue transplantation,
or human embryo research.  Now, more than ever, technological
advances in medicine require physicians to give thought to ethical
considerations.  Thus, it is vitally important for each of you
to possess a moral grounding, an underlying philosophy for what
you choose to do.  I hope that I have given you some insight not
only into <I>what</I> the pro-life community advocates, but <I>why</I>
we so strongly believe as we do.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst, Family Research Council<br>

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you are well aware, the Family Research
Council (FRC) has long been an advocate of premarital sexual abstinence
and of saving sex for its proper context within marriage.  We
also strongly encourage adoption as a superior alternative to
abortion.

<p>

In the past, the Family Research Council has also supported the
Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Act, or Title XX of the Public Health
Service Act, because it has historically been a solid abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting program.  Indeed, the AFL legislation was
crafted in order to sponsor programs and research projects which
promote society's traditional sexual ethic of abstinence until
marriage.  The AFL Act articulates a compelling moral framework
for reversing the tide of adolescent promiscuity, out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and abortion, for it recognizes the fact that sex is
not simply a physical act, but that it also has moral, emotional,
and social consequences.

<p>

The two primary purposes of AFL are:

<p>

(1) To find effective means, within the context of the family,
of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in
order to maximize the guidance and support available to them from
parents and other family members, and to promote self-discipline
and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital
sexual relations, including pregnancy; and

<p>

(2) To promote adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents
(Sec. 2001 (b), (1) and (2) of the Public Health Service Act).

<p>

For years, AFL has stood alone in a sea of contraceptive funding,
promoting prevention rather than simply risk reduction.  Even
with its limited annual budget of about $7 million, AFL has succeeded
in helping young people choose the healthiest lifestyle of premarital
sexual abstinence.  Some AFL program successes include <I>Teen-Aid</I>,
<I>Choosing the Best</I>, <I>The Art of Loving Well</I>, and <I>Reasonable
Reasons to Wait</I>.

<p>

However, while the stated mission of AFL has remained unchanged,
in recent years, the policies undergirding AFL's mission have
been under attack by the Clinton administration, and thus, the
program's laudable characteristics have been compromised.

<p>

For example, this administration placed Felicia Hance Stewart,
a former Planned Parenthood abortionist and long-time advocate
of contraception, in charge of the Office of Population Affairs,
which oversees not only Title X, the federal family planning program,
but also AFL, the abstinence program.  Clearly, Dr. Stewart and
the Clinton administration do not subscribe to an abstinence-centered
philosophy, and their efforts to undercut and even defund AFL
are well-established.

<p>

As you will recall, the Clinton administration sought to completely
defund AFL for fiscal year 1995 and replace it with a new Office
of Adolescent Health, which would be dedicated to more &quot;comprehensive&quot;
health education and contraceptive information and services to
teens.  That this administration would consider eliminating the
only source of federal funding for teen abstinence and adoption
programs in favor of more contraceptive programs (which already
receive some $450 million every year through Title X, Medicaid,
and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, among others funding
streams) clearly demonstrates not only the administration's lack
of support for abstinence programs, but also its outright hostility
towards their existence.

<p>

Although the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt
to defund the AFL program, it has since engaged in other tactics
which undermine the program's promotion of a true abstinence-centered
message.

<p>

For example, under President Clinton, the Health and Human Services
Department modified the policy regulations regarding AFL grant
applications.  Printed in the Federal Register, this administration's
policy guidelines omit all references to parents' central role
and, indeed, even subvert AFL's core purpose of promoting abstinence-centered
programs by soliciting grant applications from contraceptive-based
projects.

<p>

Please allow me to delineate this point further.  During the Bush
administration, the Federal Register announcing AFL grant applications
stated the following:

<p>

&quot;Applications requesting support for prevention projects
should propose innovative, value-based, family-centered approaches
to promoting adolescent premarital abstinence.  Applicants should
promote parents as the primary sex educators of their children
and emphasize the provision of support by other family members,
voluntary associations, religious and charitable organizations
and other groups in the private sector in order to help adolescents
and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital
sexual relations.&quot;  (Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 19, January
29, 1992)

<p>

Under President Clinton, however, the policy guidelines regulating
the AFL program differed dramatically.  The December 22, 1994
Federal Register stated the following:

<p>

&quot;The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications
which propose to do the following:....(4) include medically accurate
information on sexuality, contraception, sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to
parents to assist them in communicating with their children about
sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS...&quot;

<p>

Mr. Chairman, as you can see from this example, the Clinton Administration
believes that parents are not the primary sex educators of their
children, but that the educational establishment must help parents
teach their children about sex.  This administration also believes
that AFL should not be a true abstinence program, but a contraceptive-based
program.  This double message about sex not only contradicts the
AFL program's stated mission, it also harms children in the process.

<p>

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, if the AFL program is to continue, with
or without increased funding, it is vitally important that the
language of the legislation be altered to reflect a true abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting message.  We must prevent the current and
future administrations from wrongly interpreting the AFL statute.

<p>

The Family Research Council proposes that this committee take
into consideration the Faircloth-Talent abstinence language passed
within H.R. 4, the recent welfare bill that was vetoed by the
President. Under such explicit language, only true abstinence-centered
programs would be able to receive funding.  We believe that this
legislative step is necessary in order to remedy the executive
branch's tampering with the program.  Unless such a step is taken,
however, FRC cannot endorse the expansion of a program that is
so vulnerable to be used for harmful purposes.

<p>

Finally, I'd like to comment on the Family Research Council's
viewpoint regarding the government's role in funding social programs
which seek to promote any form of sexual behavior.  FRC strongly
believes that the responsibility for sex education belongs to
the parents of children.  We also believe that the federal government
does not have a legitimate role in federally subsidizing contraceptive
programs, or even abstinence programs.  Indeed, we have only advocated
for the existence of AFL in order to counter the federal government's
aggressive role in promoting contraceptive-based programs.  Therefore,
if the government is to play a role at all, it should at a minimum
sustain and promote self-restraint and marital commitment rather
than subverting them.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, we ask that you would take FRC's recommendations
under consideration.  Thank you very much.

<BLOCKQUOTE>C. S. Lewis is perhaps the most widely known and read Christian
intellectual of the 20th century. His various works continue to sell more
than a millioin copies each year. He is best known for his theological and
fictional writings, but Lewis also was an articulate defender of representative
democracy, limited government, property rights, and the moral principles
upon which free societies are based. As Americans today seek to apply their
religion beliefs in the public arena in a constructive manner, there is
much they might be able to learn from Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, the purpose of Discovery Institute's project about Lewis and
politics is to use Lewis's writings to help American's better understand
the connections between faith and public life. The project includes public
conferences, books, scholarly colloquium, and published writings by Discovery
Fellows.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM">&quot;When light strikes the retina, a photon is absorbed by a
molecule<BR>
called cis-retinal, which causes it to change to trans-retinal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Such scientific jargon was unfamiliar terrain for a Washington, D.C., think<BR>
tank, and the audience grew hushed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The change in retinal forces a corresponding change in the protein<BR>
rhodopsin, which allows it to interact with another protein called<BR>
transducin.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Glances shot around the room, as members of the audience furtively sought
out<BR>
others who were equally mystified.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transducin dissociates from a small molecule called GDP and binds<BR>
to a different molecule called GTP, and this complex binds to a<BR>
protein called phosphodiesterase. . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For several minutes the polysyllabic mysteries piled up, until finally<BR>
embarrassed laughter broke out. But <A HREF="behe.html">Michael Behe</A>
had made his point: Speaking<BR>
to a group of educated non scientists, he had walked them through the complex<BR>
molecular interactions required for vision in way they will never forget.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's book <I>Darwin's Black Box</I> does the same thing for readers, painting
a<BR>
vivid picture of the cell's complexity. But his purpose is not simply to
give a<BR>
charming exposition of popular science, it is to challenge the Darwinist<BR>
hegemony in biology. Behe's thesis is that life depends on a host of molecular<BR>
systems that are irreducibly complex, a phrase he coins to mean that such<BR>
systems consist of several interlocking parts that must be in place before
they<BR>
can function. And since Darwinian processes kick in only _after_ there is<BR>
minimal function, the origin of an irreducibly complex system is out of
reach of<BR>
standard Darwinian explanations.<BR>
<BR>
As an analogy, Behe invokes the humble mousetrap: You can not start with
a<BR>
wooden platform and catch a few mice, add a spring and catch a few more
mice,<BR>
add a hammer, and so on, with gradual improvement of function. To function
at<BR>
all, a mousetrap requires a minimum number of interacting parts assembled
from<BR>
the outset. By the same token, an irreducibly complex organic system like<BR>
vision must come together all at once. It cannot appear gradually, piece
by<BR>
piece.<BR>
<BR>
But the heart of Darwinism is precisely such a gradualist scenario. Darwin<BR>
obligingly offered a way to falsify his own theory, writing: &quot;If it
could be<BR>
demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have
been<BR>
formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely<BR>
break down.&quot; Behe's point is that the cell is chock full of molecular
systems<BR>
that could not possibly have formed by successive, slight modifications.
Ergo,<BR>
Darwinism has broken down.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair to Darwin, he proposed his theory when scientists knew next to<BR>
nothing about biochemistry. Living things were &quot;black boxes,&quot;
their inside<BR>
workings a mystery. The cell itself was thought to be nothing more than
a blob<BR>
of jelly like protoplasm. It was easy to draw large scale scenarios about
fins<BR>
gradually turning into legs, or legs into wings, since no one had a clue
how<BR>
limbs and organs work from the inside. As Behe writes, it's as though someone<BR>
asked how a stereo system is made and we answered, &quot;by plugging a set
of<BR>
speakers into an amplifier and adding a CD player, radio receiver, and tape<BR>
deck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Today that kind of answer won't cut it, Behe insists. The &quot;black box&quot;
of the<BR>
cell has been opened and biologists are intimately familiar with its inside<BR>
workings--its nuts and bolts. Any successful explanation of the origin of<BR>
living things must deal with molecular systems.<BR>
<BR>
Consider the origin of vision, a problem Darwin said made him shudder. Richard<BR>
Dawkins, a contemporary Darwinist, brushes it off as no problem whatsoever:
We<BR>
merely begin with a light sensitive spot, Dawkins writes, move to a group
of<BR>
cells cupped to focus light better, and continue through a graded series
of<BR>
infinitesimal improvements to a true lens.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence is quite persuasive on the surface. But what about _under_
the<BR>
surface? To function, Behe argues, even Dawkins's initial light sensitive
spot<BR>
requires a cascade of factors, starting with cis-retinal and rhodopsin.
About<BR>
these complex molecular systems Dawkins is silent. As for those cupped cells,<BR>
dozens of proteins are involved in controlling shape and structure. About
these<BR>
complex proteins Dawkins says nary a word. It's the old strategy of telling
us<BR>
that stereos are made by plugging in speakers and a CD player.<BR>
<BR>
What we really want to know is whether Darwinism can explain how the speakers<BR>
and CD players themselves were assembled. Behe argues that it cannot, and<BR>
offers two types of arguments. On one hand, Behe has combed the scientific<BR>
literature and announces that there are virtually no professional papers<BR>
proposing detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of complex molecular<BR>
structures. Explanations simply do not exist.<BR>
<BR>
And the reason they are non-existent, Behe says, delivering his second punch,
is<BR>
that a Darwinian explanation of an irreducibly complex system is logically<BR>
impossible. At the heart of the book are five chapters that drive the point<BR>
home by describing different types of irreducible complexity. Some systems<BR>
consist of interdependent parts that must be assembled all at once, like
a<BR>
mousetrap. An example is the hair-like cilium, which functions like an oar
and<BR>
requires the interplay of more than 200 different proteins. Other systems
are<BR>
sequential, like a Rube Goldberg machine. An example is the blood-clotting<BR>
mechanism, in which numerous steps are exquisitely timed by a series of<BR>
catalysts to ensure that blood clots at the site of a wound and at no other<BR>
place or time. Still other systems depend on delicate recognition signals.<BR>
Certain molecules in the cell act as transport vessels that must recognize
the<BR>
right &quot;pick-up&quot; and &quot;drop-off&quot; zones, as well as the
right materials to carry.<BR>
<BR>
These examples are described in lively prose, sprinkled with vivid<BR>
illustrations. Any reader who follows Behe's descriptions will find it<BR>
difficult not to agree that the complexity of these molecular systems is
indeed<BR>
irreducible--that they could not arise by any step-by-step, Darwinian process.<BR>
<BR>
What alternative does Behe offer? Intelligent design theory. Structures
that<BR>
consist of interacting, co-adapted parts, he argues, are evidence of a<BR>
purposeful, intelligent agent. At this point, many readers may balk, objecting<BR>
that science is not equipped to deal with anything outside nature. To which<BR>
Behe replies: Catch up with the late-twentieth century. It was sixty years
ago<BR>
that the Big Bang theory was proposed, and cosmologists had to confront
the idea<BR>
of an ultimate origin of the universe--no matter how philosophically &quot;repugnant&quot;<BR>
(Eddington's word) they found that idea because of its implication of a
personal<BR>
creator. Now it is biology's turn to recognize that its data may likewise
have<BR>
discomfiting implications.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe is careful to limit his own discussion to the data itself. Thus
he<BR>
denies that from design we can infer the existence of the Christian God.
All we<BR>
can say is that a natural object exhibits the characteristics of intelligent<BR>
manufacture. In Behe's words, &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have<BR>
a candidate for the role of designer.&quot; We might select a candidate
based on<BR>
philosophical or theological grounds but not on scientific grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's tight focus on scientific data means he treats historical and<BR>
philosophical issues only gingerly. Except for brief (though illuminating)<BR>
discussions of Paley and Socrates, we hear little about the history of the<BR>
concept of design. Apart from a quotation from St. George Mivart, we learn
next<BR>
to nothing about the history of the Darwinian controversy. No mention is
made<BR>
of Georges Cuvier, who in the nineteenth century developed a similar notion
of<BR>
irreducible complexity (calling it &quot;the correlation of parts&quot;).
Nor is any<BR>
acknowledgement made of contemporary proponents of design theory, such as<BR>
Michael Denton (_Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_) or Thaxton, Bradley, and
Olsen<BR>
(_The Mystery of Life's Origin_).<BR>
<BR>
This narrow lens may be frustrating to some readers, but adopting it was<BR>
probably good strategy. Behe is an associate professor of biochemistry at<BR>
Lehigh University, and he stays squarely within his own field of expertise.
He<BR>
crafts one basic argument, and crafts it well.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, a few points may leave readers puzzled. Is Behe acreationist?
He<BR>
explicitly eschews the term. Though a Roman Catholic, he accepted Darwinism
for<BR>
many years without sensing any contradiction with his faith, and still accepts<BR>
common descent. The conclusion of design is drawn from the data itself,
he<BR>
insists, and &quot;not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs.&quot; It
is significant<BR>
that his book came out from a major New York publisher, not a religious<BR>
publishing house.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe may protest a bit too much. He rejects the label creationist only
by<BR>
narrowly restricting the term to those who accept a young earth and flood<BR>
geology--disqualifying a host of people who describe themselves as creationists<BR>
but do not hold to those geological theories. Similarly, Behe accepts common<BR>
descent only by giving _that_ term a highly atypical definition. His idea
is<BR>
that an original one-celled organism contained the information for all<BR>
subsequent biological development, which advanced through multiple, coordinated<BR>
changes in sudden, large leaps (akin to Goldschmidt's &quot;hopeful monster&quot;
theory<BR>
except that the monsters appear not by luck but through the unfolding of
an<BR>
implicit design).<BR>
<BR>
It might have been better if Behe had simply said, Sure, I accept creation,
and<BR>
it's time to stretch that category to acknowledge that creationists come
in many<BR>
stripes. Be that as it may, Behe's book is a powerful contribution to the<BR>
literature on the Darwin controversy. The black box has been opened.<BR>
Biologists had better get ready to face the implications of what they find<BR>
there.

<FONT SIZE=2>Biological origins can be one of the most captivating subjects
in the curriculum. As a biology teacher, you have probably already seen
how the topic excites your students. The allure of dinosaurs, trilobites,
fossilized plants, and ancient human remains is virtually irresistable to
many students. Indeed, many prominent scientists owe their interest in science
to an early exposure to this topic.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The subject of origins, however, is not only captivating. It's
also controversial. Because it touches on questions of enduring significance,
this topic has long been a focal point for vigorous debate &shyp;&shyp;legal
and political, as well as intellectual. Teachers often find themselves walking
a tightrope, trying to teach good science, while avoiding the censure of
parents or administrators.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To complicate things, the cultural conflict has been compounded
by controversies within the scientific community itself. Since the 1970s,
for example, scientific criticisms of the long&shyp;dominant neo&shyp;Darwinian
theory of evolution (which combines classical Darwinism with Mendelian genetics),
have surfaced with increasing regularity.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
fact, the situation is such that paleontologist Niles Eldredge was driven
to remark:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually
marks periods of healthy growth in science, then evolutionary biology is
flourishing today as it seldom has in the past. For biologists are collectively
less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a
scant decade ago.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, many scientists have advocated fundamental revisions
of orthodox evolutionary theory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, the standard models explaining chemical evolution&shyp;&shyp;the
origin of the first living cell&shyp;&shyp;have taken severe scientific
criticism. These criticisms have sparked calls for a radically different
approach to explaining the origin of life on earth.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Though many defenders of the orthodox theories remain, some
observers now describe these theories as having entered paradigm breakdown&shyp;&shyp;a
state where a once&shyp;dominant theory can no longer explain many important
data. Science historians Earthy and Collingwood, for example, have described
neo&shyp;Darwinism as a paradigm that's lost its capacity to solve important
scientific problems. They note that both defenders and critics find it hard
to agree even about what data are relevant to deciding scientific disagreements.
Putting it more bluntly, in 1980 Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould
pronounced the &quot;neo&shyp;Darwinian synthesis&quot; to be &quot;effectively
dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach
biological origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists
disagree about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for
not knowing which ones to teach. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>An Opportunity<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Controversy is not all bad, however. For it gives teachers
the opportunity to engage their students at a deeper level. Instead of filling
young minds with discrete facts and vocabulary lists, teachers can show
their students the rough&shyp;and&shyp;tumble of genuine scientific debate.
In this way, students begin to understand how science really works. When
they see scientists of equal stature disagreeing over the interpretation
of the same data, the students learn something about the human dimension
of science. They also learn about the distinction between fact and inference&shyp;&shyp;and
how background assumptions influence scientific judgement.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity that
the publisher offers this supplementary text, <I>Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins</I>. The purpose of this text is
to expose your students to the captivating and the controversial in the
origins debate &shyp;&shyp; to take them beyond the pat scenarios offered
in most basal texts and encourage them to grapple with ideas in a scientific
manner.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>does this in two ways. First,
if offers a clear, cogent discussion of the latest data relevant to biological
origins. In the process, it rectifies many serious errors found in several
basal biology texts.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, <I>Pandas</I> offers a different interpretation of
current biological evidence. As opposed to most textbooks, which present
the more&shyp;or&shyp;less orthodox neo-Darwinian accounts of how life originated
and diversified, <I>Pandas</I> also presents a clear alternative, which
the authors call &quot;intelligent design.&quot; Throughout, the text evaluates
how well these different views can accommodate anomalous data within their
respective interpretive frameworks. <I>Pandas</I> also makes the task of
organizing your lessons and researching the scientific issues much easier.
Pandas provides the scientific information you need, and provides it in
a way that coordinates well with your basal text.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the spirit of good, honest science, <I>Pandas</I> makes
no bones about being a text with a point of view. Because it was intended
to be a supplemental text, the authors saw no value in simply rehashing
the orthodox accounts covered by basal textbooks. Rather, its presentation
of a non&shyp;Darwinian perspective, in addition to the standard view, is
intended to stimulate discussion and encourage students to evaluate the
explanatory power of different theories &shyp;&shyp; which, after all, is
what science is all about.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By using this text in conjunction with your standard basal
text, you will help your students learn to grapple with multiple competing
hypotheses &shyp;&shyp; and to maintain an open but critical posture toward
scientific knowledge. As students learn to grapple with competing views,
and become active participants in the clash of ideas, you may be surprised
at the level of motivation and achievement displayed by your students.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Status of Evolution as a Fact</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the great value of presenting opposing viewpoints,
the popular debate over origins has fostered several misconceptions about
evolution, design, and science itself. To get the most benefit from this
supplement, teachers should understand these misconceptions and be prepared
to face them in an open and fair&shyp;minded manner when they arise.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>One misconception concerns the status of evolution as a fact.
In the origins debate, it is common to hear the assertion that evolution
is not merely a theory, but an indisputable fact. Educators who take this
view argue that it is futile and misleading to present non&shyp;Darwinian
views as serious alternatives to Darwinian evolution.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The factual status of evolution, however, depends critically
on what the word &quot;evolution&quot; means. Yale biologist Keith Stewart
Thomson points out that scientists have used the term in at least three
different ways.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first meaning he identifies is &quot;change over time.&quot;
In this sense, to say that evolution has taken place is to say that change
has occurred and that things are different now than they were in the past.
The fossil evidence, for example, reveals different organisms from one geological
period to the next.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the word is used in this sense, it is hard to disagree
that &quot;evolution&quot; is a fact. The authors of this volume certainly
have no dispute with that notion. <I>Pandas </I>clearly teaches that life
has a history and that the kinds of organisms present on earth have changed
over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second meaning that Thomson identifies is descent with
modification &shyp;&shyp; the idea that all organisms are &quot;related
by common ancestry.&quot; Evolution in this sense is a theory about the
history of life. In Darwin's view, that history can best be depicted as
a single branching tree &shyp;&shyp; a geneaological tree &shyp;&shyp; in
which life diversifies over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Many people assert that evolution in this second sense is a
fact, just as gravity is a fact. But the two situations are hardly analogous.
The fact of gravity can be verified simply by dropping a pencil &shyp;&shyp;
an experiment anyone can perform. The &quot;fact&quot; of common anscestry,
however, is on an entirely different level. We can no more &quot;see&quot;
evolution in the fossil record than paleontologists of Darwin's day could
&quot;see&quot; creation events. The best we can do is infer what might
have happened by piecing together circumstantial evidence from many different
fields.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin, for example, sought to establish common descent by
examining evidence from several different areas: paleontology, biogeography,
comparative anatomy, and embryology. Others have relied, in addition, on
evidence from genetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The problem with this kind of historical detective work, however,
is that it seldom produces a conclusion that forecloses other alternatives.
As philosopher of biology Elliot Sober points out, there may be any number
of plausible explanations&shyp;&shyp;or &quot;past histories&quot;&shyp;&shyp;that
can account for the same evidence. Sober's observation recalls the insightful
warning of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Circumstantial evidence
is a very tricky thing,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may seem to point very
straight to one thing, but if you shift your point of view a little, you
may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something different.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To use another analogy, consider the picture in Figure X. What
do you see? A tired old woman or an attractive young lady? Depending on
what you're looking for, you can probably see either one. The drawing hasn't
changed. The only thing that's different is the way you look at it.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The point is, unless we can eliminate plausible competing explanations,
it's presumptuous to call descent with modification a fact. As most people
understand the term, a fact &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">is supposed
to be distinguished from transient theories as something definite, permanent,
and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
By this definition, descent with modification simply doesn't warrant the
status of a fact. Far from compelling a single conclusion, the evidence
may legitimately be interpreted different ways, leading to several possible
conclusions. None of those conclusions warrant the status of a &quot;fact.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>As zoologist Thomas Kemp warns:<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[A]ll attempts to understand the diversity of organisms rely
upon empirically untestable assumptions either about evolution or about
natural patterns. There is nothing wrong with making assumptions or seeking
to justify them of course. It is the very stuff of science. What is unforgivable
is to forget that they are assumptions and behave as if they were known
certainties when they are no such things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, calling descent with modification a fact only closes
off debate and blurs the distinction between fact and inference. That, in
turn, makes us particularly vulnerable to the illusion that we know more
than we really do. In the preface to his best selling volume, <I>The Discoverers</I>,
historian Daniel Boorstin tells the reader:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The obstacles to discovery&shyp;&shyp;the illusions of knowledge&shyp;&shyp;are
also part of our story. Only against the forgotten backdrop of the received
common sense and myths of their time can we begin to sense the courage,
the rashness, the heroic and imaginative thrusts of the great discoverers.
They had to battle against the current &quot;facts&quot; and dogmas of the
learned.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is precisely why a book that questions the Darwinian notion
of common descent is so necessary. By presenting a reasonable alternative
to evolution in this second sense, <I>Pandas</I> helps students learn to
work with multiple perspectives, to distinguish those perspectives from
facts, and to guard themselves against the illusion of knowledge.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The final meaning of evolution that Thomson identifies concerns
the mechanism of biological change &shyp;&shyp; the particular explanation
of how evolution in the first two senses occurred. Here the term &quot;evolution&quot;
refers to random variation and natural selection. In Thomson's words:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although many biologists act as though [the mechanism] were
the whole meaning of evolution, it obviously is not. The first and second
meanings could be explained by several different theories, and both had
a serious intellectual history before 1859, while the third meaning is currently
confined to a particular explanatory hypothesis, Darwinism.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Evolution in this third sense asserts that the cause or mechanism
of biological change is purposeless, non&shyp;intelligent, and completely
naturalistic. Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins defended this view in his
best selling book, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I>. Like Darwin himself, Dawkins
acknowledges that biological organisms appear to exhibit remarkable design.
Yet both men claim that this appearance is an illusion, produced entirely
by random variation and natural selection. Blind nature mimics intelligent
design.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; thesis is often touted as
a fact, but it is not. For one thing, Darwinists have never demonstrated
empirically that natural processes can create the complex structures that
characterize living organisms. Like common descent, the blind watchmaker
thesis is based on indirect evidence. It accounts for hypothetical transformations
by extrapolating small observed changes over immense periods of time. Thus,
the blind watchmaker thesis is not a fact, but an inference. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, the blind watchmaker thesis &shyp;&shyp; at least
in its neo&shyp;Darwinian form &shyp;&shyp; may not even be a warranted
inference. As we mentioned at the beginning of this essay, neo&shyp;Darwinism
has come under increasing attack from scientists and philosophers alike.
Scientists have increasingly questioned the ability of mutation and natural
selection to generate new organs, limbs, or body plans. A host of other
problems have led biologists Mae-Wan Ho and Peter Saunders to say:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until only a few years ago, the 'synthetic' or 'neo&shyp;Darwinist'
theory of evolution stood virtually unchallenged as the basis of our understanding
of the organic world....</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the picture is entirely different. More and
more workers are showing signs of dissatisfaction with the synthetic theory.
Some are attacking its philosophical foundations....Others have deliberately
set out to work in just those areas in which neo&shyp;Darwinism is least
comfortable, like the problem of gaps in the fossil record or the mechanisms
of non&shyp;Mendelian inheritance....Perhaps most significantly of all,
there is now appearing a stream of articles and books defending the synthetic
theory. It is not so long ago that hardly anyone thought this was necessary.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> gives students a much&shyp;needed
opportunity to explore the evidence and arguments that have caused some
scientists to doubt contemporary Darwinism. It examines evidence from such
fields as biochemistry, genetics and paleontology--evidence that casts doubt
on the sufficiency of purposeless processes to explain the appearance of
new biological forms.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going a step further, <I>Pandas</I> helps students understand
the positive case for intelligent design. Following a growing number of
scientists and philosophers, the authors argue that life not only <I>appears</I>
to have been intelligently designed, but that it actually was. Drawing on
recent developments in molecular biology, the authors show that even simple
organisms bear all the earmarks of designed systems.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The authors will also discuss what theorists have learned by
applying mathematics and information science to biology. Those insights
suggest that there are ways to distinguish natural systems from intelligently
designed ones--and have led some scientists to conclude that the &quot;coded
genetic information&quot; (or sequence specificity) of DNA, proteins, and
the like, reflects the activity of a pre-existent intelligence. While that
conclusion is still controversial, a growing minority of scientists see
it as a plausible alternative to the blind watchmaker thesis. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By presenting the case for intelligent design the authors demonstrate
that there are alternatives to the blind watchmaker thesis--and that evolution
as a purposeless process is neither an indisputable fact, nor the only inference
supported by biological data.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, then, only in the most trivial sense&shyp;&shyp;change
over time&shyp;&shyp;can evolution be considered a fact. Far from being
a legitimate reason for avoiding alternative views, the alleged &quot;fact
of evolution&quot; underscores precisely why a book like <I>Pandas </I>is
so necessary. If students are to achieve true scientific literacy, they
must learn to distinguish fact from supposition. A curriculum that blurs
this distinction serves neither the students nor society.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Science and the Laws of Nature</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second misconception revolves around the question of what
makes a concept or explanation &quot;scientific.&quot; In particular, some
scientists and philosophers assert that the concept of intelligent design
is inherently non-scientific. According to this view, science must explain
things by using natural laws&shyp;&shyp;not by invoking an the special action
of an intelligent agent. Thus, we no longer explain the orbit of a planet
by saying that an angel pushes it through the heavens. We explain it with
Newton's law of universal gravitation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the same way, design is ruled out&shyp;of&shyp;court because
it invokes an intelligent agent, rather than natural laws. Philosopher of
science Michael Ruse, for example, has said:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Science attempts to understand this empirical world. What is
the basis for this understanding? Surveying science and the history of science
today, one thing stands out: Science involves the search for order. More
specifically, science looks for unbroken, blind, natural regularities (<I>laws</I>).
Things in the world do not happen in just any old way. They follow set paths,
and science tries to capture this fact. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are serious problems with this view, however. One problem
is that it ignores areas of scientific investigation where intelligent design
is a necessary explanatory concept. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) is one example. At the time of this writing, radio telescopes are
scanning the heavens, looking for artificial radio signals that differ from
the random signals generated by natural objects in space. If we were to
limit science to the search for &quot;unbroken, blind, natural regularities
(laws)&quot; we would have to say that SETI is unscientific&shyp;&shyp;by
definition.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Archaeology would meet the same fate. Archaeologists routinely
distinguish manufactured objects (e.g. arrowheads, potsherds) from natural
ones (e.g. stones), even when the differences between them are very subtle.
These manufactured objects then become important clues in reconstructing
past ways of life. But if we arbitrarily assert that science explains solely
by reference to natural laws, if archaeologists are prohibited from invoking
an intelligent manufacturer, the whole archaeological enterprise comes to
a grinding halt.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second problem with limiting science to blind, natural regularities
is that it confuses <I>laws </I>with <I>explanations</I>&shyp;&shyp;an error
that philosopher of science William Alston calls &quot;a 'category mistake'
of the most flagrant sort.&quot; Laws and explanations are often two different
things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Scientific explanations often invoke not only laws, but causal
events and actions. For example, consider the field of modern cosmology.
Most cosmologists explain the features of our universe not only by reference
to the laws of physics, but by reference to a single event: the Big Bang.
The Big Bang, for example, helps explain why galaxies throughout the universe
seem to be receding from each other. It also explains the presence of low
level radiation that seems to permeate space. These phenomena cannot be
explained solely by reference to physical laws, or natural regularities.
Rather, the critical explanatory feature is a one-time event that established
the conditions responsible for the phenomena that we now witness.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Taking this idea a bit farther, sometimes it seems that scientific
laws are hardly relevant to our explanations at all &shyp;&shyp; such as
when we try to explain why things turned out one way rather than another.
For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation may tell us why the
earth has a Newtonian orbit rather than a non&shyp;Newtonian one. But it
doesn't explain why the earth follows it's present orbit, instead of some
other orbit that's equally compatible with Newton's law. That kind of explanation
requires something else &shyp;&shyp; namely, information about how the earth
attained its present position and velocity.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar example can be drawn from the field of historical
geology. If a historical geologist wanted to explain the unusual height
of the Himalayas, invoking natural laws would be of little use. Natural
laws alone cannot tell us why the Himalayas are higher than, say, the Rocky
Mountains. That would require discovering antecedent factors that were present
in building the Himilayas, but not in other mountain&shyp;building episodes.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, scientific explanation not only involves laws, but may
also involve past causal events. If scientists could never invoke past events
and causes, they could not explain many important phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why is this important? Because ignoring the role of causal
events in scientific explanation has created a false dichotomy between agency
&shyp;&shyp; or intelligent design &shyp;&shyp; and the laws of nature.
The fact that scientific explanations may invoke laws doesn't mean that
agency is somehow ruled out. Rather, intelligent agents can alter causal
events and other contributing factors. Although intervention may alter the
course of subsequent events &shyp;&shyp; sometimes in novel and unexpected
ways &shyp;&shyp; it does not violate natural laws.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, the actions of intelligent agents are themselves causal
events. Therefore, citing the action of agents may be necessary to explain
many present phenomena. Imagine trying to explain Mt. Rushmore without reference
to sculptors. Law-like explanations involving only natural processes would
completely miss this critical explanatory factor. That is why archaeologists,
forensic scientists and historians often find it impossible to avoid postulating
intelligent agency.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The notion that science explains solely by reference to natural
law suffers from yet a third problem. In addition to confusing laws with
explanations, it assumes a cookie&shyp;cutter view of science, in which
all disciplines ask similar questions and use the same &quot;scientific
method.&quot; This belies the rich diversity of methods that scientists
use to understand the natural world.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Several philosophers, for instance, have argued that a clear
distinction exists between the &quot;inductive sciences&quot; and the &quot;historical
sciences.&quot; These two broad categories ask different kinds of questions,
and use different kinds of methods. The inductive (or nomological) sciences,
on the one hand, ask questions about how the natural world operates. Hence,
a virologist may try to discover how a particular enzyme helps a virus infect
its host. Or a crystalographer may try to determine the effects of weightlessness
on crystal growth. In each case, scientists seek to uncover the regularities
that characterize natural phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The historical sciences, on the other hand, ask different kinds
of questions. Rather than trying to understand how the natural world operates,
the historical sciences seek to understand how things came to be. One example,
of course, would be the historical geologist who was seeking to explain
the unusual elevation of the Himalayas. Another would be an evolutionary
biologist seeking to explain the origin of giraffes. Still another would
be the archaeologist seeking to reconstruct an ancient culture. Note that
in each case, the goal is not to find new laws or regularities, but to reconstruct
past conditions and events.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of this distinction to our present discussion
is that although postulating intelligent intervention is completely inappropriate
in the inductive sciences, the same is not true in the historical sciences.
In the inductive sciences, the whole point is to discover how the natural
world normally operates on it's own, i.e., <I>in the absence of intelligent
intervention</I>. Postulating an intelligent agent would thus be contrary
to the stated goal of research.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the historical sciences, however, the goal is to reconstruct
past events and conditions. Thus, there is no need to impose such restrictions.
Quite the reverse. As we have seen, the explanation of certain artifacts
or features may require reference to intelligence. Intelligent agents may
have left traces of their activity in the natural world. The historical
scientist need not turn a blind eye to them.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hence, when investigating the origin of the living world, it
is perfectly acceptable to hypothesize an intelligent designer if the evidence
warrants.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Observability</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third misunderstanding concerns the scientific status of
unobservable objects and events. Some philosophers and scientists claim
that intelligent design is not scientific because it invokes an unobservable
intelligent designer. To be scientific, they claim, a concept or idea must
be testable. Because an intelligent designer is unobservable it is not testable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence not scientific.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is by no means clear, however, that something is untestable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence unscientific&shyp;&shyp;simply because it is unobservable. If this
were the case, many accepted theories and concepts would have to be declared
unscientific as well. Chemist J.C. Walton observes:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The postulation of...external intervention [into nature by
a designer] indoubtedly restores order, harmony and simplification to the
data of physics and biology. [Yet] at present there is no unambiguous evidence...for
the existence of the external entity, but this should not be regarded as
a drawback. Many key scientific postulates such as atomic theory, kinetic
theory of the applicability of wave functions to describing molecular properties
were, and still are, equally conjectural. Their acceptance depended, and
still depends, on the comparison of their predictions with observables.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also falling in this category are almost all theories in the
historical sciences&shyp;&shyp;theories that postulate conditions and events
that occured in the unobservable past. The Big Bang is one such theory.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another, ironically, is Neo&shyp;Darwinism. Although Neo&shyp;Darwinism
explains many observable features of the living world, it postulates unobservable
objects and events. For example, the mutational events that allegedly produced
reptiles, birds, mammals, and even humans, have never been observed &shyp;&shyp;
nor will they ever be observed. Similarly, the transitional life forms that
occupy the branching&shyp;points on Darwin's tree of life are also unobservable.
Transitional forms exist now only as theoretical entities that make possible
a coherent Darwinian account of how present&shyp;day species originated.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unobservable character of Darwinism becomes especially
plain when proponents try to reconcile the fossil evidence with their theory.
As paleontologists now admit, the fossil evidence looks a good deal less
&quot;Darwinian&quot; than they had previously acknowledged. Indeed, as
Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould points out, the two outstanding features
of the fossil record are &quot;sudden appearance&quot; and &quot;stasis.&quot;
At any given location, species tend to appear &quot;suddenly,&quot; fully
formed, and exhibit no directional change during their stay on earth.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The standard neo&shyp;Darwinian explanation for these features
is the imperfection of the fossil record: Because fossilization occurs only
under special circumstances, fossils give us only a rough sketch of evolutionary
history. More recently, some have proposed that evolutionary change occurs
rapidly, and in small, isolated populations of organisms. Both explanations,
however, invoke unobserved circumstances (how can one observe a non&shyp;fossilization
event that happened 100 million years ago?) to explain unobserved fossil
organisms.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin himself realized that much of the evidence for his theory
was indirect. Indeed, he spent long hours defending his practice of inferring
the unobservable from the observable.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend
to adduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that
I believe that this view in the main is correct because so many phenomena
can be thus grouped and explained.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If we accepted the principle that unobservable entities are
inadmissable in science, we would have to reject not only Darwin's theory,
but his entire approach to scientific investigation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To be fair, some opponents of intelligent design would argue
that the real problem is not unobervability, but flexibility. The concept
of an intelligent designer is simply too much of a &quot;wild card&quot;:
it can explain anything. Put another way, the concept of an intelligent
designer cannot be falsified.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the contrary, however, intelligent design is not so flexible
that it cannot be falsified. The concept of intelligent design entails a
strong prediction that is readily falsifiable. In particular, the concept
of intelligent design predicts that complex information, like that encoded
in a functioning genome, never arises from purely chemical or physical antecedents.
Experience will show that only intelligent agency gives rise to functional
information. All that is necessary to falsify the hypothesis of intelligent
design is to show confirmed instances of purely physical or chemical antecedents
producing such information.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, intelligent design is not unique in its flexibility.
We have already seen how Darwinists handle the problem of the fossil record
(i.e. in the way they account for unobserved fossil forms by invoking unobserved
geological processes). Indeed, the history of science shows that scientists
have often offered <I>ad hoc</I> explanations to save a cherished theory.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the historical sciences, where
investigators must draw conclusions from incomplete or sketchy evidence.
If flexibility is an issue, therefore, it should be an issue for every scientific
theory, not just intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religion and Intelligent Design</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A final misconception you may confront is that intelligent
design is simply sectarian religion. According to this view, intelligent
design is merely fundamentalism with a new twist &shyp;&shyp; and teaching
it in public schools violates the separation of church and state.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This view is wide of the mark. The idea that life had an intelligent
source is hardly unique to Christian fundamentalism. Advocates of design
have included not only Christians and other religious theists, but pantheists,
Greek and Enlightenment philosophers, and now include many modern scientists
who describe themselves as religiously agnostic. Moreover, the concept of
design implies absolutely nothing about beliefs normally associated with
Christian fundamentalism: such as a young earth, a global flood, or even
the existence of the Christian God. All it implies is that life had an intelligent
source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, sectarianism is more a matter of form than content.
It is marked by a certain narrowness and exclusivity that entertains no
debate and tolerates no opposing viewpoints. Given the broad appeal of intelligent
design (even Richard Dawkins, a staunch Darwinist and author of <I>The Blind
Watchmaker</I>, acknowledges &quot;the appearance of design&quot; in the
living world), it is perhaps more accurate to conclude that the real sectarians
are those who villify design as &quot;fundamentalist religion.&quot; Such
name&shyp;calling is merely another way to avoid debate and keep the real
issues off the intellectual field of play.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even if the design hypothesis were religious, however, criticizing
it on that basis begs the question of whether it's scientifically warranted.
In science, the origin of an idea is supposed to be irrelevant to its validity.
What matters is not the source, but the whether the idea is logically consistent
and empirically supportable. If it is, what justification is there for excluding
it from the classroom?</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its landmark ruling on the Louisiana Balanced Treatment
Act, the United States Supreme Court did not try to shield the classroom
from dissenting viewpoints. Indeed, it affirmed that teachers already had
the flexibility to teach non&shyp;evolutionary views and present scientific
evidence bearing on the question of origins:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Act does not grant teachers a flexibility that they did
not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the
presentation of theories besides evolution, about the origin of life. Indeed,
the Court of Appeals found that no law prohibited Louisiana public schoolteachers
from teaching any scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Neither did the Supreme Court choose to limit that flexibility:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[T]eaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins
of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular
intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is not only consistent with good science, it's consistent
with the highest ideals of a democratic society. As John Scopes, who was
tried 1920s for teaching evolution, said at his own trial, &quot;Education,
you know, means broadening, advancing, and if you limit a teacher to only
one side of anything the whole country will eventually have only one thought,
be one individual. I believe in teaching every aspect of every problem or
theory.&quot;<BR>

When we finally find some evolutionary change, however slight it may seem,
the &quot;typostrophic&quot; sort of affair the <I>Phacops rana</I> lineage
seems to show in the Midwest poses a choice between two unappetizing alternatives:
either you stick to conventional theory despite the rather poor fit of the
fossils, or you focus on the empirics and say that saltation looks like
a reasonable model of the evolutionary process--in which case you must embrace
a set of rather dubious biological propositions. Paleontologists are rather

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>For these purposes, it has little to do with greed. Or wanting to buy
too much at the mall to boost your self-esteem. <BR>
<BR>
Materialism is the modern day philosophy that holds that matter is all there
is. It's the philosophy that says &quot;If you can't touch it, smell it,
taste it or explain it through the hard sciences, it doesn't exist.&quot;
Men are merely complex machines and not spiritual beings. <BR>
<BR>
And it's approved by most intellectuals around the world. <BR>
<BR>
One other thing: we're out to topple it. <BR>

<H4>Darwinism is the belief that we evolved not only from the apes, but
that we started from nothing other than purposeless mass. As late Harvard
evolutionary biologist George Gaylord Simpson said, &quot;<I>Man is the
result of a</I> <I>purposeless and natural process that did not have him
in mind. He was not planned</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin is to Materialism like Karl Marx is to Communism. Like Adam
Smith is to Capitalism. This is not to say that Darwin himself is responsible
for the full course of Darwinism since his death. But he opened the door.

<H4>Materialism is a powerful philosophy of life today because it sets the
boundaries for what is right and wrong in society. It explains the &quot;rules&quot;
that govern our civilization. It goes to the very intellectual roots of
society, the very foundation that our social and cultural institutions are
built upon. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if materialism is right &shyp; as most intellectuals propose &shyp;
then &quot;God&quot; is merely a figment of our imagination. Therefore,
God didn't create man; man created God. Doestoyevsky once said that &quot;
<I>if God is dead</I> <I>then all things are lawful</I>.&quot; Might makes
right. The State is the ultimate enforcer of rules. <BR>
<BR>
Let's look at how materialism has infected the legal system, welfare and
popular culture.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><BR>
Materialism teaches us that God is dead. It follows that divine revelation
cannot be the basis of human law. <BR>
<BR>
Human law can only be based on upon the current opinion of the people who
have the power to make and interpret laws. In our society, that power rests
in the hands of an elite class of judges, lawmakers and other experts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot; We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&quot;
quickly loses much validity if our &quot;Creator&quot; does not exist. Result:
a culture of irresponsibility and victimhood. <BR>
<BR>
The present culture took decades to develop. Look at a 1930s text in criminal
law that upholds the materialist foundation: <BR>
<BR>
<I>&quot;Man is no more responsible for becoming willful and committing
a crime than a flower for becoming red and fragrant. In both instances,
the end products are predetermined by nature.&quot; <BR>

<H4>Dating back to the 1960s, those who conceived the war on poverty believed
that poverty could be eradicated because they believed its root causes were
material: poverty, educational deprivation, crime, etc Thirty five years
later, we realize that throwing material resources at the problem has made
it worse, not better. <BR>

By ignoring the moral and spiritual dimensions of poverty, we have ignored
the real problems of poverty: family breakdown, illegitimacy and government-fostered
dependency. </H4>

<H4>If morals are relative and nothing is absolute, anything goes. It requires
no deep intellectual digging to see how materialism has assaulted popular
culture. <BR>
<BR>
Popular culture seldom portrays religion favorably yet often with disdain.
Those characters who seem to hold traditional or conservative values will
surely be mocked, seen as &quot;square&quot; and even &quot;oppressors&quot;
of some sort of unalienable right bestowed upon humankind from Hollywood.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Much depends on how you define &quot;evolution.&quot; Some people think
evolution describes how things change over a period of time ( i.e. a finch's
beak length, a moth's color etc). Others think that slow and <BR>
gradual change to one organism can be translated directly into how life
itself was created. <BR>
<BR>
At a very basic level, we think evolution might explain the survival of
the fittest, not the <I>arrival </I>of the fittest and that it can explain
some form of development, but not original development. <BR>

The idea behind the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF)</CENTER>
</H1>
The idea for creating a legal analog to the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF)</A> occured to Peter Harter while writing
an essay criticising Senator Exon's &quot;Communications Decency Act of
1995&quot; (S.314). <A HREF="harter.html">Click here</A> to see this unpublished
essay.) The following is a brief idea outline for the Internet Law Task
Force , written prior to the launch of the task force in October of 1995
at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95. This idea was the genesis
for what has become The Forum for Internet Law and Policy with further revisions
coming from mebers and interested parties across the Interent community
and around the world.<BR>

<P><B>The Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) Project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea for an Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) came from a solution proposed
by Peter F. Harter in an essay he wrote and submitted to The New York Times
for publication in their Op-Ed page. Although this submission is, as of
the date of this presentation, still under consideration and despite the
youth of this ILTF idea (less than two weeks old), it has gained support.
The idea for an ILTF was unveiled publicly on 12 April 1995 at the Internet
Society Summit, in San Diego, California. In addition to the initial sponsors
listed in this memorandum, additional supporters have agreed to work together
as part of an ad hoc &quot;ILTF formation and steering committee&quot;:
Prof. Hank Perritt of the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy;
David Johnson, Chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bob Collett and
Ron Plesser of the Commercial Internet Xchange; Jeffrey Ritter, Executive
Director of OARNet and founder of the Electronic Commerce, Law, and Information
Policy Strategies project; Jerry Berman, Executive Director, The Center
for Democracy and Technology; Lance Rose, Esq.; Jan Constantine, VP and
General Counsel, Delphi Internet Services; David Maher, Esq., and Co-Chair
of the Internet Task Force of the International Trademarks Association;
Prof. David Post. In addition, David Johnson has agreed to co-chair the
steering committee with Peter Harter in order to determine what shape ILTF
should take.

Q. Can interoperable designs negate need for outside regulation? <BR>
<BR>
A. Yes, if an ILTF exists. <BR>
<BR>
____________________________________________________________________ <BR>
<BR>
<B>I. Introduction.</B> <BR>
<BR>
An Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) can be the legal policy and norms forum
for the Internet. An ILTF must be a large, open, international body consisting
of practicing lawyers, in-house corporate counsel, legislative professionals,
academics, business professionals, technologists, researches, network operators,
publishers, system administrators, and other interested parties. All involved
should be concerned with the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global
electronic community that balances terrestrially bound and geographically
defined interests with the decentralized and transborder nature of internetworked
computer communications that is the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The ILTF shall be an analog to the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force)
so that constituents of the Internet and its related industries and communities
can remain self-regulating by determining and promoting legal policies that
reduce risk and liability. If effective, an ILTF can reduce the need for
governmental entities to regulate the use and operation of the Internet.
Like the IETF, the ILTF can succeed by attracting the active and regular
participation of professionals from around the world and by reaching out
to as many cultures and nations in the world as possible in order to avert
conflicts of law and to attain comity amongst disparate electronic communities
and various computer networks rooted in different and distant countries.
<BR>
<BR>
An ILTF can be begun formally and publicly at the Internet Society's upcoming
Summit in San Diego, California, on April 12, during and or after the legal
panel presentation. At that time an acting advisory committee may be formed
so that an ILTF can be properly constructed. This memorandum is only a sketch
-- a starting point from which the idea for an ILTF can be launched. <BR>
<BR>
The National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) wishes to work with other
organizations and individuals to promote and further develop self-regulation
and accountability within the collection of users and operators of the Internet.
The Internet Society has agreed to help launch this idea with NPTN and has
offered to form a secretariat and to seek funding. Ameritech Advanced Data
Services and America Online have agreed to be the initial sponsors of the
concept of an ILTF. Other organizations are invited to become initial sponsors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II. Why Create an ILTF?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Due to increasing scrutiny by mass media and by legislators and government
officials in the U.S., Canada, and other countries, as well as in states,
provinces, and other terrestrially based jurisdictions, the Internet is
at risk of being Balkanized by inconsistent and ill-thought attempts at
rule making and control. Recently, a Bill introduced in the U.S. Senate
known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S.314) and now likely to
gain passage in that legislative chamber, threatens to impose liability
on those least able to control indecent communications; it ignores the fact
that users are held accountable for their actions already in varying formats
by their system administrators and or network service providers. Users self-regulate
their electronic communities and work with network operators to sustain
the vitality of their networks. S.314 is also embarrassing: It blindly attempts
to regulate a medium that is inherently international in design and destiny.
For S.314 to try and control communications on the Internet assumes that
the U.S. can impose its values on others from around the world and strips
citizens of electronic communities of their right by contract to define
what the acceptable uses of their communities shall be. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are possible alternatives to S.314. On April 7, 1995,
Senator Leahy introduced the &quot;Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill&quot; (S. 714). Leahy's
Bill directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), to conduct a study to address technical means for empowering users
to control information they receive over interactive communications systems
such as the Internet, commercial online services, independent BBSs, and
future interactive media. <BR>
<BR>
S.314, however, is not the first nor will be the last attempt at regulating
the Internet; however, it drove one Internet lawyer to start pamphleteering
about the issue. In an essay submitted on 29 March 1995 to The New York
Times for publication in their Op-Ed page, Peter Harter of NPTN reasoned
that if standardization and regulation of the Internet is to occur, it should
come from the bottom-up -- just as the technical standards for the Internet
evolve via the IETF. After some online consultation with Tony Rutkowski
of the Internet Society, it was agreed that an ILTF was an idea worth considering
-- a concept whose time has come. <BR>
<BR>
It is the desire of the creator and founding members of an ILTF that it
form not to impose rules as a super-legislature. Instead, an ILTF must endeavor
to educate elected officials and governmental entities so that they may
better understand the technical and cultural nature and diversity of the
networks that make up the Internet. ILTF must serve as a coordinator to
and communicator between existing Internet law and policy efforts; ILTF
must not aim to duplicate or displace such existing efforts. In doing so
the ILTF can look to the IETF for structure and lessons as the IETF has
had over thirty productive and substantive working meetings since 1986.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III. Modeling the ILTF After the IETF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>A. Meetings.</B> The ILTF should meet at least twice a year initially
and perhaps more frequently (i.e., the IETF meets three times a year). It
is proposed that the first public meeting of the ILTF be held, perhaps,
on or near Bastille Day, and outside the U.S., so that the inaugural meeting
may be inspired by the relevant symbolism and history as well as the international
component that is integral to building an effective ILTF. By holding regular
meetings the ILTF shall provide an open arena for working groups (see below)
to coordinate development of legal and policy findings and, recommendations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B. Mission.</B> The ILTF mission includes but is not limited to: <BR>
<BR>
* Identifying and proposing solutions and or alternatives to legislative
initiatives arising from any terrestrially based and or electronic governing
body; <BR>
<BR>
* Specifying the development of alternative forms of rules that electronic
communities can opt to use in order to diffuse any conflicts; <BR>
<BR>
* Facilitating the exchange of information between professionals in different
countries so that there may be a better informed and more active legal and
policy community; <BR>
<BR>
* Providing a forum for the exchange of relevant information within the
Internet community between system administrators, users, network operators,
publishers, intellectual property holders, government agencies, businesses,
academics, educators, and concerned citizens; and, <BR>
<BR>
* Publishing online tools and information resources to be used by citizens
of electronic communities, governmental agencies, businesses, and other
interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C. Working Groups.</B> Leading up to the first meeting and in the time
between meetings thereafter, the actual substantive work of the ILTF shall
be done by working groups. Like the working groups that sustain the efforts
of the IETF, workings groups for the ILTF shall be organized by topic into
several areas. The following areas are suggested and additions and modifications
are requested: <BR>
<BR>
Suggested Area Suggested Contact Person(s) <BR>
<BR>
1. Content a. Copyright Lance Rose, Esq. b. Warning Labels David Johnson,
EFF; Howard Shapiro, Playboy Enterprises <BR>
<BR>
2. Trademarks &amp; Domain Names David Maher, Esq. <BR>

12. Mediation &amp; Arbitration Hank Perritt, VCILP <BR>

13. Encryption ? <BR>
<BR>
14. Technical Matters IETF Representatives <BR>
<BR>
[Nota Bene: The foregoing list of lawyers is subject to change and non-exhaustive.
No contact has been made to any of the above with the exception of Ellen
Kirsh and George Clapp. It is recommended that the acting advisory committee
ask individuals to join the initial slate of working groups.] <BR>
<BR>
Each working group area would have a director that would be a member of
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG) (see below). Under each director
would be a collection of one or more working groups breaking out to tear
through various issues that make up the larger area. As necessary, each
working group within an area could have its own director who would be a
part of an area directorate which reports its findings to the area director
which are then to be communicated to the ILSG. While a very large pyramid
of people can be created here, it is important to have small and focused
efforts in order to cut through issues and not get bogged down in larger
and somewhat alienating meetings. Rough consensus and not strict voting
shall be the proactive rule. <BR>
<BR>
Also, it would be wise to have liaisons set up between ILTF and the IETF,
W3, the U.N. Internet Project, and other organizations and programs as deemed
necessary so that the ILTF may maintain open and interactive communications
links between other organizations to which the ILTF should work in concert
with either intermittently and or regularly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>D. Management.</B> Management of the ILTF shall be handled by individuals
who volunteer to lead a particular topic area and or who represent a particular
region or interest group at large. Together, these volunteers shall form
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG). The acting advisory committee to
be formed at the Internet Society Summit in San Diego after the unveiling
of the ILTF concept shall act as the ILSG until a proper ILSG can be formed.
This is likely to occur after the first successful meeting of the ILTF.
The operational management of the ILTF may be handled by the ILSG under
the auspices of NPTN and the Internet Society. In addition, the ILTF may
decide, at future time, to create an Internet Law Arbitration Board (ILAB)
for the specific purpose of having an independent body to adjudicate disputes
in the working processes of the ILTF. <BR>
<BR>
<B>IV. Policy Development </B>&amp; <B>Dissemination.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Neither the ILTF, nor any voluntary, international body can or should have
the right to somehow claim that its de facto rules can be imposed upon other
bodies. However, the ILTF can draft and adopt high quality policies and
then let the marketplace decide if they want to join in and support them
as norms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>V. International Outreach &amp; Character of ILTF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
To be successful the ILTF must focus on attracting active international
participants and directions. Those volunteers involved in the early stages
of the effort to build an ILTF must not be limited in their thinking; while
the &quot;likely suspects&quot; shall be integral, new and unusual members
must be sought out and asked to adopt the concept of an ILTF as their own
and become an ILTF evangelist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VI. Path Forward.</B> <BR>
<BR>
First, a broad and internationally diverse endorsement of ILTF must be sought.
Second, a plan of action must be drawn up for those leading ILTF. Third,
input must be solicited and integrated. Fourth, a revised memorandum or
formal proposal green paper should be produced and released for comment
and revision. Fifth, plans for a first meeting should b made. Sixth, a formal
white paper should be produced and disseminated for consideration and if
possible adoption and endorsement. Seventh, the processes involved in the
Sixth stage should occur at a live meeting held some time in the summer
of 1995, perhaps around the time of Bastille Day. Eighth, a host for a second
meeting should be sought out in advance and be announced at the conclusion
of the first meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. Appendix A: &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The following is an unordered, unpreferential, unrevised listing of those
individuals and organizations that should be contacted and asked to be involved
in the creation of an ILTF. They are in no particular order. This list is
not exhaustive. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law Task Force Organizing to Achieve Consensus on Internet
Legal Issues</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>OCTOBER 31, 1995</B> -- <B>Seattle,WA</B> -- The first international
conference on the law of the Internet served as the platform for the announcement
of an effort to establish the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) to facilitate
the progressive development of law and public policy in the global information
age.<BR>
<BR>
The ILTF will provide an international forum for issues related to the use
and growth of the Internet including: evolution of the business practices
and legal instruments to assure the validity and acceptance of digital transactions;
property rights; privacy; and the elimination of legal barriers to Internet
commerce and electronic transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to accelerate at the global level the development of solutions
borne of consensus,&quot; stated Peter Harter, former executive director
and general counsel of <A HREF="http://www.nptn.org/">National Public Telecomputing
Network</A>, and now public policy counsel of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications</A>, who first advanced the ILTF concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Developing standards and practices to protect digital information
and promote the integrity of electronic markets is essential for extending
the Internet to developing countries and nations in transition,&quot; said
Jeffrey Ritter, a legal advisor to the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">United
Nations</A> on the automation of international trade. &quot;Quite simply,
without an established framework, the Internet faces a confusing, and potentially
disabling, assortment of national laws seeking to govern a global environment,&quot;
Ritter added.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle-based <A HREF="index.html">Discovery Institute</A>, will provide
organizatinal support for the ILTF. The organizing committee will be jointly
chaired by Albert Gidari, a partner with the Seattle-based law firm Perkins
Coie and senior fellow of Discover Institute; Harter; and Ritter, program
director for <A HREF="/Eclips/eclips.html">ECLIPS</A>, a research program
of the Ohio Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to mature the ILTF into an operating non-governmental
organization as soon as practicable, but ILTF must be a collaborative operation.
We look forward to seeking and obtaining broad-based support for moving
ahead.&quot; the organizers said.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet Law Symposium '95, hosted by the Discovery Institute, was the
first conference devoted to analyzing the legal aspects of an evolving global
space. Bruce Chapman, President of Discovery Institute, announced that most
of those attending added their names to the global listserv--an electronic
discussion group--established for continuing dialogue on the structure and
direction of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
The concept has attracted widespread interest from industry, which has grown
increasingly concerned by the growing efforts of governments to attempt
to regulate the Internet. According to Harter, since the early dialogue
on the need for an ILTF, over one hundred interested organizations and professionals
from four continents have urged establishment of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For commerce to succeed in cyberspace greater certainty, not inconsistent
regulatory regimes around the globe, is needed,&quot; Gidari said.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>According to a recent study, people who are now in their
twenties believe they are more likely to see a UFO than Social Security
benefits. <BR>
<BR>
</B>THE FACTS ARE CLEAR. When the baby boomers hit retirement, Social Security
will run out of money, and the timetable for reform requires meaningful
change by the end of the century. Based on over three years of extensive
research and consultation with S.S.I. experts and authorities, <I>Restoring
Hope in America</I> presents a bold plan to save <B>your</B> Social Security
benefits and guarantee financial security in <B>your</B> retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Social Secuirty reform must happen within the next five years or America
will face economic disaster in the next century, and unacceptable social
consequences in the pitting of young against old. Resotring Hope In America
is a call to action -- action based on accountability and reason in establishing
a new &quot;Declaration of Financial Independence&quot; for the modern workforce
and instituting guidelines for pension management by the government.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>State's growing tourism industry offers employment promise</CENTER>
</H1>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="twonation.html">[Go to Cascadia Tourism Conference -- June
6-7, 1996]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
These are heady times for entrepreneurs, high tech whizzes and international
traders. But many people are left out of the boom, including bank tellers
and telephone operators, middle managers and others whose jobs are being
rendered obsolete by new technologies, corporate down-sizing and international
competition. They can get jobs in this economy, but often not at levels
commensurate with their backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
In the short term, there is no easy answer to such people's underemployment,
but there is one field that offers substantial opportunity for workers of
all kinds, from the minimally skilled to the highly educated. That field
is tourism. Paying an average of 10 percent more than other employment,
today's tourism industry is a source of good jobs as well as more jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Tourism matters to Washington State because the region is an increasingly
popular visitor destination, but also because Seattle is headquarters for
such top travel companies as Westin Hotels, Alaska Airlines, Holland America
cruise lines and, of course, Boeing. Unfortunately, state and local governments
have put relatively little emphasis on exploiting this strength. At 15.2
percent, Seattle has the second highest hotel room tax in the country--surpassed
only by Columbus, Ohio, hardly a tourist magnet. Yet, Washington State ranks
47th among states investing such dollars in development of the tourism industry.<BR>
<BR>
What's our problem? Perhaps we still think of tourism as a frill, or as
an industry with a real future only in sunnier climes. Or we fret that the
tourists who visit from Japan or Scandinavia will go home, quit their jobs
and move in on us. Neither statistics nor experience back up those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
How underrated is tourism? Well, how many of us realize that it is now the
number one industry in the world? The stunning fact is that tourism business
generated $3.4 trillion last year, even surpassing conventional manufacturing
categories like steel or autos. Seattle and King County stand to gain greatly
from this global development; our own annual tourism business has grown
from $900 million to $2.7 billion in the past decade. The number of foreign
visitors--480,000 last year--also has doubled in that period, not even counting
two million Canadians. But we can do much better.<BR>
<BR>
The foreign market, indeed, is one of the most promising. This is especially
so in Asia, where the middle class is doubling its massive size in this
generation--from 200 million to 400 million in India, for example. Worldwide,
women are becoming a bigger share of travelers now--already up to 33 percent.
Another trend: leisure visitors, rather than business travelers, will soon
account for 80 percent of air travelers.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have found that these new international tourists are very cost
conscious--just at the point in history when the United States finally has
become more affordable. Moreover, 75 percent of current foreign visitors
to the US have been here before, so there is fresh curiosity about destinations
other than standard gateway cities like New York and Los Angeles. Seattle,
for instance: close to Asia, up-to-date, well-priced, and also friendly
and safe. <BR>
<BR>
Juergen Bartels, the new chairman and CEO of Westin Hotels, a company that
began in Seattle 65 years ago and today is a leading hotelier in 80 locations
around the world, was asked recently why Westin decided to remain here.
His response was that &quot;Seattle is not in the middle of the country,
but it is in the middle of the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lest that sound like mere boosterism, the German-born Bartels is quick to
point out that the &quot;world&quot; Westin has identified as leading the
travel boom is the Pacific Rim, and especially Asia. Seattle is a good location
from which to launch an ambitious hotel expansion scheme like Westin's,
which aims to open 60 new hotels in the next five years, an average of one
a month.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle's position in international travel is improved further by our new
status as U.S. home to APEC (the Asian Pacific Economic Council) and the
prestige of the Henry M. Jackson School at the University of Washington,
whose international program is particularly strong in Asian studies. The
Port of Seattle's new International Conference Center that opens next summer
and the coming expansion of the Washington State Convention Center will
help establish Seattle as an especially well-endowed meeting location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing so far, however, is a well-orchestrated, high priority effort
to build on this area's international tourism potential. We cannot and should
not count on the federal government to lead; its whole tourism budget is
only about the size of Luxembourg's, and nothing like, say, Canada's. In
Olympia, Governor Lowry and a couple of state legislators intend next month
to propose a doubling of the state budget for tourism--but that still will
amount to only $4.6 million, far less than the programs of neighboring states,
let alone, British Columbia. It's time for state and local governments to
see the full scope of the opportunity and to collaborate in meeting it.<BR>
<BR>
The best strategy is, first, to increase spending in tourism development
by tapping into the huge tax revenue provided by the tourist industry itself
in the form of the hotel tax. Judicious use of that source should not alarm
the general taxpayer and will return its investment manifold. When a modest
public and private promotional budget was deployed by the Seattle area in
Great Britain recently, it resulted in a doubling of British tourist visits
here. <BR>
<BR>
Pooling existing funds of government and private sector alike, as in the
British promotional case, should be the second emphasis of an international
tourism strategy. A common promotional campaign will go much farther than
many divergent ones. Indeed, we should solidify the tentative efforts now
underway to link the overseas tourism programs of the Northwest states with
the more advanced foreign visitors campaign of British Columbia and build
up the international appeal of the whole Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, isn't it time that we stopped looking the gift horse of tourism
in the mouth?

    <TITLE>Curbin America's Appetite for Lawsuits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>From the Friday, December 8, 1995, <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</I></B>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
It's time to curb America's appetite for lawsuits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="katz.html">[Read Roberta Katz's remarks on reform of the adversarial
legal system]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>A woman at McDonald's spills hot coffee in her lap and a jury awards
her $2.7 million. Another jury awards a man $4 million from BMW because
he wasn't told that his new car had received a minor paint touch-up before
he bought it. Yet another man is awarded $12.3 million, most of it in &quot;punitive&quot;
damages,&quot; because he fractured his neck on a Slip 'n Slide lawn toy
whose wrapper, he charges, did not warn him adequately that adults could
get hurt playing with such a thing. (It just shows that we must keep toys
out of the hands of grown ups.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Winning the lawsuit sweepstakes in today's America is a lot easier than
winning the lottery, and while news of enormous legal awards arouse amazement
and anger in most of us, it evidently incites a drooling appetite to sue
in the rest. No wonder we now have 14 million lawsuits a year, one for every
17 Americans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The western district of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than all of Japan.
California as a whole is definitely a Golden State for trial lawyers; 99
of 100 auto accidents, including fender benders, result in lawsuits. Overall,
Americans' chance of being in a suit is now three times that of Canadians.
And it isn't just big businesses that gets hit, but also mom and pop stores,
charitable groups and local governments--anyone, however remotely connected
to a problem, with &quot;deep pockets&quot; that can be invaded when the
real source of a grievance is poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When lawsuits hit the jackpot, who do you think benefits almost as much
as the alleged victim (who gets an average of 43 percent of awards)? That's
right, the lawyers get about 33 percent, and the rest goes to administrative
and other costs. Top corporate lawyers in America do very well in life,
but the top trial lawyers eclipse them, some raking in $15-$90 million a
year, a recent review inForbes magazine shows. Especially well-rewarded
are those who figure out how to get a parade of new clients to sue the same
company for the same problem over and over and to get &quot;punitive damages&quot;
each time in order to &quot;send a message&quot;--a message that sometimes
reads &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; Juries are not allowed to learn about this
tactic, or they would rebel more often.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And who, in addition to the manufacturer or store owner, pays? Right again:
you do--in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices and lowered
stock values in your personal or pension portfolio. Even though some of
the most outrageous suits are later reduced by judges, the whole litigious
system in this country, according to a study by the management consulting
firm of Tillinghast/ Perrin Towers, is freighting our economy with a burden
$140 billion annually. That is money that otherwise could create new jobs,
raise pay and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the trial attorneys and the professional &quot;consumer advocates&quot;
they so often support race to their word processors to protest my bias (or
maybe start a class action suit!) let it readily be acknowledged that businesses
and ordinary citizens do sometimes commit terrible blunders that harm others,
and that &quot;tort law&quot; is an entirely proper corrective. Lawsuits
often have forced negligent companies, doctors and other entities and individuals
to accept proper financial responsibilities and to improve safety standards.
Even the &quot;contingency fee&quot; arrangement that assures a plaintiff
that he will not pay the lawyer unless he wins the case can be defended
on the basis that it allows poor people access to justice in a system that
favors wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, however, is that the system has slowly gone nearly out of control
and has become counterproductive. Trial attorneys' jaundiced eyes and wily
ways may have motivated some otherwise indifferent firms to act more responsibly,
but at least as often the fear of legal action reaches a point where companies
are driven out of business by ruthless legal speculators. Doctors stop entering
certain fields that have become overly attractive to lawsuits. In some states,
people who might otherwise be good Samaritans when confronted by a person
in distress, instead refuse to help because of a wholly rational fear of
being sued. Another example of the chilling effect of over-litigation is
the growing trend among employers to avoid giving objective references for
former employee because they know that certain trial attorneys' latest speculative
field is &quot;wrongful termination&quot; (cases doubled between 1991 and
1994). The result is that many employers are wary of new hiring altogether.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognition of these consequences of over-litigation has finally created
a backlash. This year alone some 20 states have passed tort reforms. A study
by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows considerable stimulus
of economic growth in those states where tort reforms have been enacted,
and a drag on the economies of states where lawsuits hobble enterprise,
and that kind of study will fuel still more reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, trial attorneys are used to calling the shots in Washington,
D.C. , perhaps because they are generous campaign contributors, last year,
for example, donating $14 million. But they are conspicuously apprehensive
that Congress might pass serious tort reform legislation in this session;
indeed, in the next few weeks. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives,
led by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, passed a fairly broad bill, including
caps on punitive damages and much-needed malpractice limitations. But the
Senate, where floor-leader Slade Gorton of Washington feared that too narrow
a victory would invite a Presidential veto, came up with a much more limited
reform bill that mainly covers product liability. (Another bill to limit
frivolous class action suits by supposedly aggrieved stockholders disappointed
at the failure of managers to anticipate stock price fluctuations seems
to be coasting to a surprisingly easy victory and Presidential signature.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, while the trial attorney lobby believed that House-Senate differences
were too great to allow any bill to pass this year, the two houses' &quot;Conference
Committee&quot; suddenly appears close to a resolution. Reform-minded senators
now think that their present veto-proof majority might be willing to accept
certain obviously reasonable aspects of the House bill--for example, a financial
limit on civil actions that don't involve physical injury or suffering,
and a limit on actions taken against non-profit organizations and local
governments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If Congress passes any tort reform bill this session, the cause of major
reform will not be drained of energy, as some reformers fear, but reinvigorated.
A public appetite for suing one another took us down the present path, and
an appetite for restoration of a more civil society can now be stimulated
through the steady introduction of successive and successful steps toward
the thorough overhaul our system really needs. Legal utopianism paradoxically
diminishes the very justice it claims to seek. We have another, better tradition,
and that is common sense. It has a much better record of achieving justice
in this all too imperfect world.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Happy Conservative Pit-Bull Turns Ten <BR>
by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
Polls show that the public primarily blame Republicans in Congress, rather
than President Clinton, for the recent (and future?) government shutdown.
Those who blame both sides equally think that the battle is merely &quot;political&quot;
in the worst sense. At the state level, Referendum 48, the property rights
initiative, was soundly defeated earlier this month by a margin of 60-40.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is the conservative revolution running out of steam? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No--not to hear John Carlson tell it on his KVI radio afternoon talk show.
Indeed, the jovial Carlson, who infuriates liberals, is even more gleeful
than usual these days as he urges Seattle area listeners to deluge the President
with ball point pens to encourage him to sign a balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, there are good reasons for conservatives to smile. Though politically
at sea for years, they finally can smell dry land. History, their onetime
foe, seems to be on their side now. Significantly, while conservatives are
keeping their promises, the opposition is accepting their premises. The
issue in Washington, D.C., for example, no longer is whether to seek a balanced
budget, but how to achieve it, and how soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get the issues defined your way, it is possible to stop fighting
rear-guard actions and go for a clear cut victory. When you really reduce
spending growth to below the rate of inflation and commit in fact, not fancy,
to a balanced budget, you can expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates. In anticipation of that, markets already have rallied. If you go
on to reduce taxes on families and capital gains, economic expansion becomes
sturdier, and philanthropic giving grows. If you genuinely constrain government
over-regulation and decentralize government functions, personal liberty
is enlarged. Seeing that all this really is possible, the voters want more.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, conservatives may lose some day-to-day propaganda struggles, but the
long term &quot;fundamentals&quot; of their position (as economists might
say) are sound. In about two more elections they may emerge not only as
the normal governing majority in politics, but also the major force in intellectual
life--the status that liberals have occupied since the Depression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The liberals' ideas came out of academia, starting with the first self-conscious
&quot;political scientists&quot; at Princeton and Johns Hopkins at the turn
of the century. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created
the huge federal civil service, and it, too, generated ideas. The media,
which was mostly conservative or neutral until 40 years ago, swung to the
left in the 1950s, with a few notable exceptions, and gave liberalism an
aura of moral superiority and political inevitability. Even big business
was leery of wandering outside of the supposed liberal &quot;consensus.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of conservative renaissance, however, were planted during the
very heyday of the liberal intellectuals by a philosopher named Russell
Kirk and a small magazine edited by young Bill Buckley, <I>National Review</I>.
But it has prospered thanks largely to an institution created in the present
generation: the think tank. Some think tanks--or public policy institutes--are
liberal, but most are not, and as you look at the pages of national and
local magazines and newspapers, or listen to TV discussions and radio talk-shows,
you are bombarded by the news and views of &quot;fellows&quot; in &quot;institutes.&quot;
That's new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In national affairs, it happened first in Washington, D.C. with creation
of the American Enterprise Institute (eclectic conservative), the Heritage
Foundation (&quot;movement&quot; conservative, with a $28 million budget),
and Cato Institute (libertarian), among others. But then a second phase
occurred--explosively--at the state level, and, at last count, there are
now some 60 think tanks around the country specializing in local and regional
issues. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Portland, there is the Cascade Institute and in Olympia, the Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, led by former state legislator Bob Williams. But the
oldest public policy group in the Northwest is the Washington Institute,
founded by John Carlson, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am prejudiced, I admit it. I have enjoyed John's company ever since he
was a delightfully irreverent college student at the University of Washington,
assaulting the choleric dogmas of The UW Daily . He is still irreverent,
and whether you find that delightful or not probably depends on your politics.
He's also smart and constructive. By founding the Washington Institute in
1985 and helping it to survive this long, he has given state and local government
a whole new source of political ideas and initiative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John has now graduated to a perch as institute &quot;chairman&quot; so that
he can devote more of his time to harrying the left from his talk show,
a weekly column and regular appearances on two TV discussion programs. Stomping
around on the grapes of liberal wrath, he still lands hard on the toes of
antagonists, but his writing and wit have matured like a vintage Merlot.
Visiting dignitaries pay him court, and one of these days he is going to
wake up and find that he is part of the Establishment. But, happily, not
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, an energetic former insurance executive, Bill Baldwin, runs the
institute's show out of donated offices in a West Seattle building with
the biggest American flag you ever saw. From there issue papers decrying
state regulatory and budgetary excesses, calls for stronger defense of property
rights and a tough line on crime. A couple of years ago the institute helped
conceptualize the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; legislation that
now wins nods even from The White House. Institute arguments were used by
state legislators who rolled back Gov. Lowry's health care plan. At the
moment, high priority is attached to increasing privatization of many state
government functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of this policy agenda, Washington Institute also publishes
Counterpoint, a newsletter that assigns itself the role of watchdog on the
watchdogs of the media, usually biting at their heels, but also making &quot;good
dog&quot; awards. Overall, critiquing the press is not exactly a winning
strategy for assuring coverage of your other programs, but it does keep
many readers amused and gratified, and maybe it does some good in reminding
members of the Fourth Estate that they, too, are human. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For all of this, the state's watchdogs of the right are grinning as they
nip away. Every dog must have its day, and, after 10 years, the sun does
not seem at all ready to set on the Washington Institute. <BR>

    <TITLE>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday November 3, 1995 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism is Not Unique to Quebec </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by <BR>
Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>What do you follow in politics, economics or your heart? The moral discipline
of the market or the lure of memory? Your future as an individual or the
passions of your group? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Quebec was asked such questions this week, it split almost neatly in
two. And so might many of us. Indeed, what Canada faced, and will face,
is not dissimilar to what America faces and much of the world faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By a victory margin of only one percent, the decent, muddle-through confederation
of Canada--engaging affection not because of its pride, but because of its
humility--managed to hold on to just enough of the French-speaking community
to give it a reprieve from permanent division. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We now see, moreover, that what was averted may have been worse than even
the loss of a major province; namely, a complete breakup. When it seemed
that the &quot;sovereignist&quot; side might prevail in Quebec, large crowds
nationwide rallied 'round the Maple Leaf; and in that sense, Canada at last
found its patriotic voice. But at the same time, some commentators began
to re-investigate old arguments for an independent British Columbia, Alberta
or Ontario. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Gibson of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, whose <I>Thirty Million
Musketeers: One Canada for All Canadians</I> , has just been published,
warned that a &quot;majority-plus-one 'yes' vote&quot; in Quebec very quickly
might result in several nation-states emerging across the broad pink map
that now represents Canada. But Quebec, voting a majority-plus-one percent
&quot;no,&quot; did not secede, for the moment, though another attempt will
be made in a few years. In the long run, however, economics, the moral discipline
of the market and individualism--rather than ethnic nationalism--will prevail.
And, they should prevail. Je me souviens (&quot;I remember&quot;) is a bitter-sweet
ethnic sentiment, not a principle for just governance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the battered federalist victors in Monday's vote have another
chance to revise political Canada. One way to try to prevent dissolution
is devolution. Not just heavily subsidized Quebec, but also the relatively
well-off provinces of Ontario, B.C. and Alberta, want more power to make
policies on pensions, labor training and economic development. Driven by
the brutal demands of Canada's federal debt--roughly $400 billion U.S. dollars--and
huge provincial debts, too, the governing Liberal Party in Ottawa may well
agree. Otherwise, as Gordon Gibson notes, the twin to the danger of losing
Quebec will be losing Canada's sovereignty to foreign credit markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the way, as federal power is devolved to the provinces, the level
of federal funding will be cut. Taxes probably will not go up, however,
and eventually must come down, for political as well as economic reasons;
Canadians are punished by high taxation and are showing interest in the
supply-side economics of the relatively new Reform Party. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If cutting spending and devolution sound like an echo of the policies of
the Republican Congress elected last year in the United States, that is
because these trends are, in fact, widespread. Pruning back years of government
growth, privatizing and decentralizing are logical responses to increasing
global economic competition. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The frugality medicine is hard enough to swallow in the United States, but
Canada is likely to gag on it. But, one of the reasons for the strong separatist
vote in Quebec is the poor state of the Canadian economy, and the main reason
for the poor economy--high unemployment, high interest rates, sagging dollar--is
government's refusal until now to take the medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The moral discipline of the market does lead to economic--and social--health,
that is the good news. You can see the results in the recent improvements
in such far-flung countries as Chile, New Zealand, the Czech Republic and
Estonia. The government of President Meri of Estonia, who visited Seattle
this week, cut taxes and eliminated tariffs and reports a sustained six
percent growth rate, in contrast to dawdling, centralist Russia, next door.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estonians also have the second highest per capita Internet use in Eastern
Europe (after Finland). High technology, indeed, is another force for decentralization
and greater economic freedom world wide. The Internet is almost an emblem
of what is happening to communication and commerce today. It ignores national
borders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But does this free and open world, with its economy driven by high technology,
sound a bit frightening? If you feel that way, you have company in more
places than Quebec. In Eastern Europe, for example, the collapse of communism
caused even more fear than pain and often stimulated an escape to the seemingly
warm hearth of ethnic nationalism. Chechnya, Bosnia and the peaceful but
foolish secession of Slovakia from its Czech partner show the devastating
consequences of that illusion. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our own country, we only have to get over two generations' growth of
the welfare state, not totalitarian socialism. But the appeal of ethnic
nationalism is strong here, too, as witness the black separatist ambitions
(though now ambiguous) of Louis Farrakhan. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you are, if you are hurting and fearful, it is tempting to nourish
your resentments and to imagine that you are stronger in a group-- racial,
ethnic, religious, geographic, gender, or whatever. The group, you find,
derives its justification in grievances against some other group. If only
you can remember past wrongs to the group and elevate the group identity
to your all-purpose answer, you can forget the moral discipline of the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders and the classical liberal economists had a different
vision: of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The Canadians have
their own version of the same understanding. Because it respects all individuals
as equal before God and the law, this vision benefits society as a whole.
It tries, at least, to see you for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For people have souls as well as hearts, and souls do not go to heaven in
groups, but one by one.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>For Canada breaking up is hard <BR>
-- and wrong -- thing to do</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Canada is a country where something terrible is always just about to happen,
but never does. The terrible thing is usually the secession of Quebec. The
mere possibility of a province seceding reminds a citizen of the United
States of what stability was bequeathed to our country by the Civil War.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other respects, Canada's political scene is usually so calm that Americans
pay it no attention. We tend to see our northern neighbor as simply that
big happy vacation land that produces great comedians and Hollywood movie
locations that look more like American cities than our own do. &quot;Politics
in Canada&quot; sounds like the title of a boring book.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But hardly anything disturbs the political calm like breaking up one's country.
And in Canada that seems to be a constant and real threat. For nearly three
decades Canada, like Sisyphus, has been condemned to roll the rock of Quebec
up the hill of federalism, only to have it roll back down again, over and
over. Worse, federalist forces have to win every election held on on the
issue of separation, while secessionists need only win once. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably. In Canada, elections often settle even less than they do here,
especially since Canadians are masters of the art of Awkward Compromise
that leaves everybody somewhat satisfied, but also a little grumpy. If Quebeckers
next Monday vote for &quot;sovereignty&quot; and empowerment of provincial
leaders to negotiate a new relationship with the rest of Canada, it is still
unclear what that will mean in concrete terms. Prime Minister Jean Chretien
says it means separation, clear and simple. No more Canadian passports.
A division of the national debt, and no special favors. On the other side,
the Bloc Quebecois, led by Lucien Bouchard, argues that Quebec will be an
independent &quot;nation&quot; if the &quot;yes&quot; vote prevails, but
nationhood in this instance apparebtly is conceived as something between
the existence of a strong province and a truly foreign state. Both sides
claim the other is insincere and unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going into the final week of the campaign, the &quot;yes&quot; vote on sovereignty
was pulling ahead. If the final returns run along those lines, there will
be a political earthquake of long duration in Canada. Already, in dreadful
anticipation, the Canadian dollar and stock prices have been falling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best hope for federalism, acording to a former Liberal Party cabinet
minister, Gordon Gibson, who is now a fellow of the free-market Fraser Institute
in Vancouver, is &quot;ballot box chill.&quot; As seems to have happened
in 1980, Quebec voters may celebrate independence over the weekend, then
soberly vote their economic interests--which surely lie with federalism--the
next day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, Quebec sovereignty is a deep cultural aspiration for many of the
francophone citizens of la belle province, and to the extent that economic
motives operate beyond that aspiration, popular disatisfaction over the
currently stagnant economy seems to make &quot;change&quot; the ally of
separation rather than of continued federalism. Sadly, Quebec is no different
than the rest of Canada in its bad fiscal management in recent years. Government
deficits at both national and provincial levels are so high that America's
appear mild in comparison and elsewhere even the dominant Liberal Party
has been forced to economy measures, many Quebeckers have not got the word.
Though they are, on balance, subsidized by the federal government, they
think their economic difficulties come from unfair treatment at the hands
of &quot;TROC&quot;--the rest of Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That makes TROC as angry as reserved Canadians allow themselves to get.
Annoyance is especially strong in the West, and nobably across our border
in British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That raises the obvious question, how would a &quot;yes&quot; vote in Quebec
affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Americans, especially those living close to the border, the obvious
question is, how will this affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is complex. However annoyed English (or better, non-French) Canada
may be with Quebec, the prospect of disunion would be a real blow to national
morale. Worldwide, Canadian prestige would be hurt. Despite the high cost
of keeping Quebec in the style to which &quot;le Belle Province&quot; is
accustomed, the loss of Quebec and the literal division of the country,
would damage Canada economically. Even more than the US, Canada needs budgetary
belt-tightening combined with sound growth if it is to avoid economic decline.
Yet, as the breakup of the USSR has shown, it is difficult to reform oneself
economically while the whole map is being redrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Canada in not a basket case like some of the former Soviet states.
Unfortunately, Americans tend to think of Canada mainly as a place that
produces great comedians, shares our baseball games (where we fly their
flag upside down and get their national anthem wrong), and looks more &quot;American&quot;
in Hollywood movie productions than many locations in the United States.
It's our little brother that we alternately ignore or enjoy teasing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, in reality, Canada is a big, independent, powerful country. If it seems
less sometimes that is only because Canada is next door to, well, us. It
wins awards as the most &quot;livable&quot; country in the world. It is
democratic. In their quiet way, Canadians are passionate about freedom.
When times are tough, as when our diplomats were taken hostage by Iran,
or on any number of ocassions at the UN, when a confidential friend or honest
broker has been needed, Canada has taken on the job. In trouble spots around
the world or in a natural disaster, Canada is almost always at our side,
or there before us. Canada is our NATO ally. And our biggest trading partner.
Canada's well-being and its self-confidence matters--to us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, a vote for disunion may, once more, be avoided. Quebec's voters
may have their separatist victory party Saturday night and then sober up
the next day and again vote &quot;non.&quot; Alternatively, disunion for
a diminished Canada, if it happens could prove endurable, or even beneficial
for Canada. Like the Czech Republic without Slovakia or Slovenia without
the rest of Yugoslavia, a smaller Canada might actually prosper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, meanwhile, we in the Pacific Northwest have especially strong reasons
to be concerned about the Quebec vote. Our commercial and cultural ties
with British Columbia are growing stronger all the time. Regardless of the
Quebec vote, we have cause to persevere with our concept of &quot;Cascadia&quot;
as a cooperative region of US states--particularly Washington and Oregon--with
Western Canada--particularly B.C. We have great opportunities to promote
both sides of the border in this distinct and fortunate geographic region,
whether the collaboration is expressed in expanding tourism from overseas,
conducting ocassional joint trade missions, reducing border delays, improving
bi-national transportation, forming education partnerships among our universities,
boosting regional sports teams and arts activities, and just learning from
one another. Cross-border Cascadians have much in common, including a bright
future. Let us also make it plain that we have never wanted political union,
just friendship and cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The genuine crisis a Quebec separatist vote would cause Canada, and the
chronic frustration the issue will continue to cause in Canadian politics
even if the federalists prevail by a narrow margin, can evoke only one legitimate
response down here. Regret. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing we can do after Sunday's vote is to emphasize how much we
in the Northwest value the close ties we have with our provincial neighbors
in &quot;Cascadia,&quot; as well as with the rest of Canada.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What Laws Should Govern the Internet? </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><CENTER>Individuals, not governments, should shape Internet's future</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bruce Chapman </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The two traits that have always distinguished the American character are
a fierce insistence on personal liberty and &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;
Both live on brightly in the Internet, the winning future of communications
and commerce. Forget Al Gore's industrial era image of &quot;the information
superhighway,&quot; conjuring up visions of interactive televisions and
a big regulatory job for government. The concept isn't big enough or open
enough for what the Internet already is becoming. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet began as an obscure Defense Department communications project
a quarter of a century ago, but for the past twenty years it has been changing
in form and content. It is no longer a government network tying computer
users together, but a worldwide network of many networks, free and open
to all, and increasingly easy to access. There is no monopoly potential
to it, so government's excuse to regulate it is almost nil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More than 40 million people presently use the &quot;Net&quot;, some just
for electronic mail. However, 22 million of them also use it for research,
education, buying and selling, video-conferencing, publishing, or simply
seeking information in text and motion pictures from around the world. With
the number of &quot;domains&quot;--Net locations you can contact--growing
about seven thousand a month, and with numbers of users doubling annually,
the Internet is a whole new communications revolution. Further, its low
cost general offerings are greatly enriched by various for-profit services
and software products that, in turn, help America's economy to expand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But (good news for lawyers, alas) there are legal problems on the Net. If
the Internet it to continue to flourish, these problems must be met head
on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When businessmen, attorneys, techies, academics and government officials
meet in Seattle for the first International Internet Law Symposium later
this month, they will be responding to a sense that Internet service providers
and users need to find answers to certain legal issues before the government
does. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A government-run Internet is no more in the public interest than a monopoly-run
Internet. But neither is a lawless Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, this column belongs to the Seattle Post-Intelligencernow and,
per agreement, to me later. In a few days I'll put it on the Internet &quot;home
page&quot; of my think tank and make it available to readers all over the
world (I can dream, can't I?). But what if someone plagiarizes it? Or simply
reprints it and sells it commercially? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, if it were not a column, but,
say, a book--say, your book--you might care a lot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, copyright law has to apply somehow to the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so do other property rights, including the right to protect one's reputation.
Who, for example, owns e-mail within a company? What are standards of libel
in cyberspace? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or take the issue of gambling, which is now illegal in most states, with
certain exceptions. A huge battle is building over a proposal to provide
Bingo and other gambling on the Internet, organized through a Native American
company, Multimedia Games, Inc., in Oklahoma, and operated through outlets
on reservations nation-wide. How can gambling be controlled when state and
eveninternational borders mean nothing? Among other things, how can it be
taxed? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like most legal disputes, these involve both important principles and practical
trade-offs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pornography is another example. When both models and customers may be children--including
children receiving unsolicited filth through the Internet--the principle
of offended &quot;community standards&quot; normally would be invoked. But
what is the &quot;community&quot; in this case: Seattle? The world? The
&quot;community&quot; of Internet users? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the related problem of persons inventing false identities
and deploying the Internet to attract gullible minors to real life sexual
encounters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any added legal sanctions, of course, must be understood as complimenting,
not contradicting, other important values, such as privacy and free speech.
Fortunately, law enforcement is getting into the field in both a vigorous
and reasonable way. Which raises the question, do we need new laws in this
area, or just common sense extensions of the ones we have? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trend towards digitized cash is yet another story. Banking is heavily
regulated now and while many of us are intrigued by the trend toward commercial
transactions conducted over the Internet, unless people have good assurances
of security, such innovations won't succeed. Unfortunately, federal law
presently prevents U.S. businesses from encrypting their transactions internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case, transfers of money electronically, as ATM's have shown in a
modest way, do not have to be fail-safe. They just need to be as safe as
transactions that use cash or checks. In a few years, cash in your wallet
may be almost as rare as a silver dollar. Money will move internationally
the way it moves around town now. Ah, but when all that happens, what becomes
of the IRS? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of these questions are fascinating to discuss and deliberate. But first,
one major medium for discussing them, the Internet iteself, needs to be
better understood. At the moment, while the telecommunications bills before
Congress move in the direction of a freedom model, they still ignore the
Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ordinary people should shape the exciting future of the Internet. Government's
job is simply to be sure that the laws that keep normal commerce reliable
and free also protect the Internet. But, even that job is going to require
careful foresight. <BR>

<P>Ross Perot may have walked into a trap of his own devising. By deciding
to set up an official political party instead of merely running for President
as an independent candidate, Perot will be subject to all the legal difficulties
that beset the two major parties. It will be harder now for him to play
the reformist outsider. And the state versions of his new party are almost
sure to cause problems. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What will he have gained? Practically nothing. Organizing a new political
party in these times is like starting a typewriter company; you're investing
in a declining market. Political parties historically had four main roles:
control of nominations, financing candidates, filling patronage jobs and
creating a cohesive caucus in the Congress and state legislatures. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All but the last role have been reduced in the past thirty years, thanks
to one &quot;reform&quot; after another. Primary voters, not party regulars,
pick most nominees; candidates' organizations, not parties, raise most campaign
funds; and patronage--after a century of civil service reform--is down to
token numbers, and those few are hired by office-holders without much consultation
with their party. And the last role--forming legislative caucuses--is not
one that will benefit Perot's Independence Party, since it is unlikely to
elect many local candidates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we assume that Perot will be able to get his party legally recognized
in all 50 states, and that is a big assumption, there still are enormous
obstacles to operating the party successfully. Laws governing parties differ
widely from state to state. For example, the latitude for a party to give
financial support to particular candidates is far greater in a state like
Ohio than it is in a state like California. Separate legal teams, and legal
procedures, will be needed for each state. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With 50 new state Independence parties will come a certain amount of &quot;independence&quot;
for those parties internally. The publisher of the daily political Hotline
in Washington, D.C., Douglas Bailey, predicts that &quot;Once Perot creates
all these state parties, there is nothing to stop them from running local
candidates with their own ideas and their own personal baggage. Then Perot
loses control.&quot; New York's Independence Party, which suggested to Perot
that he use its name, already plans to slate up to a thousand candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot also may lose some of his self-styled reformer image. In the past,
he has wanted us to believe that the two major parties get into trouble
so often because their candidates are morally weak and lack his wonderous
&quot;common sense.&quot; Only Perot, standing above the fray, was pure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In reality, most election scandals are the result of some petty infraction
or wrong assumption about the nation's increasingly dense weave of campaign
laws. Never before, including the Progressive Era, have so many ethics laws
been put on the books. Even with relatively experienced personnel, the Republicans
and Democrats cannot help making the kind of petty bookkeeping and judgment
errors that, taken out of context and exaggerated by a hostile opponent
or the media, can be made to look serious and intentional. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot's United We Stand, America is legally a mere non-profit organization
and, for example, does not have to follow financial disclosure laws. But
Perot's new and official party will be held to the same strict standards
as the Republicans and Democrats. His organization will find the reporting
of contributions alone to be a tricky challenge. Then will come the scrutiny
by the media and political foes. Did anyone contribute more than the permitted
$1000 per person? Was any of the money from a source that someone, somewhere
deems disreputable? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, when something goes wrong, the blame will tend to fall directly
on Perot himself, for his party will still be identified as more of a one-man
show than any since 1968, when the American Independence Party was organized
by and for Alabama Governor George Wallace. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if Perot is the Independence Party presidential candidate, one of
the &quot;reforms&quot; most likely to develop wide public interest in 1996
will be ending the advantage allowed for rich individuals like him to buy
advertising and organizing talent that other parties must obtain through
broad solicitations. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Perot may persuade Colin Powell to run at the head of the new
party, which surely would increase the flow of individual contributions
and expand the party's showing at the polls. What opinion surveys indicate
so far is that the Independence Party would do its best with Powell as its
nominee. But the ticket still would not win. In contrast, the surveys suggest
that Powell as a Republican would win. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This raises another question. Other than Perot's o'ervaulting ambition,
what substantive reason is there for the Independence Party? Is there some
novel insight it brings to a deficient political system--as the new Republican
Party did with its clear anti-slavery message in the 1850s, which helped
it replace the badly divided Whigs? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No. Except for his anti-free trade position, Perot's main themes, including
budget cutting, echo the Republicans. The difference is that they are in
office, and he is not. They take the heat; he carps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the head of a national party, that stand-offish role will change. Ross
Perot running as an outsider, as in 1992, might make enough of an impression
on the electorate to defeat the Republicans' presidential nominee again,
and help re-elect President Clinton. But as the head of an official political
party? <BR>
<I><BR>
Wal, I don't have to tell you people, that great sucking sound is jest Ross
sinking down to the level of the rest of 'em! <BR>

    <TITLE>Public needn't fear budgetary train wreck</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER>Public needn't fear budgetary 'train wreck' rhetoric </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
The noise you hear coming from Washington, D.C. is not the screeching prelude
to a budgetary &quot;train wreck.&quot; It's only the noise of a rhetoric
wreck. There is nothing at all unusual about the failure of Congress and
the President to reach agreement on a budget by the formal deadline, October
1 (this Sunday). And the &quot;crisis&quot; over the debt ceiling that is
slated to follow later on this fall is only slightly more worrisome. We
have gone through such &quot;crises&quot; many times since the 1970's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On one occasion, when Budget Director Jim Miller warned Ronald Reagan that
refusal to reach a compromise with the Democratic Congress could bring government
operations to a halt, the President replied, &quot;Jim, Jim, settle down.
Let's close the place down and see if anybody notices.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody did. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In similar stalemates now Congress almost routinely adopts a &quot;continuing
resolution&quot; that allows spending on essential services (such as defense)
and entitlements (such as Social Security) to carry on, and for other programs
to operate at a maintenance level. Such a resolution is available this weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The situation will not be much different around mid-November if Congress,
on another issue, tries to force financial discipline on the Administration
by refusing to raise the federal debt limit. Mr. Clinton and his allies
already are warning that Republican &quot;blackmail&quot; will spook the
markets. Air traffic will be grounded. Federal contractors will be stiffed.
Children will starve. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps these horror tales are meant to frighten us out of that national
&quot;funk&quot; that concerns the President. Or perhaps the Democrats are
just getting an early start on Halloween. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, all the whoops of distress have but one purpose, which is to deflect
the majority in Congress from doing what they promised: to cut the budget
now in order to balance it by 2002. The people whose careers are built on
an ever-expanding government sector--people who believe that downsizing
is only for the private sector--are going to try to make you believe that
the world is coming to an end. But it's only their political assumptions
that are ending. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get me wrong. Many proposed budget cuts are difficult to accept. Some
reductions don't make sense when considered by themselves. And almost all
of us are for government spending when it favors a cause close to our own
hearts. I can see the desirability of eliminating the national service program,
&quot;Americorps,&quot; but a student benefiting from its payments probably
does not. Consumers in Seattle and New York might cheer the overdue effort
to end farm subsidies, but it's a hard sell in Louisiana cotton country
or Wisconsin dairlyand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the truth is that relatively little of the budget savings needed
will be achieved just by cutting &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; or
even by tackling special interest spending. At some point, you have to go
into broadly popular programs. That Republicans are doing so, though gingerly,
and that these reductions are being presented before television cameras
as the mad slashing of mean-spirited conservatives, accounts for the sagging
public approval ratings of Congress. Yet, with a national debt equal to
$71,860 per family of four, we just can't afford all the good things government
intends to do for us. Spending growth needs to slacken. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, taxes do need to go down. The reason is not to make the rich richer,
but to raise our savings rate, spark the investments that create jobs and
to help working families make ends meet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question for voters is, do you really want to stay on the track to long
term economic growth, or do you want to derail the train at the first signs
of difficulty? For the Republican majority in Congress, the question is
almost identical. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most Democrats, as in the '80's, have already given their
answer: Real cuts are for budgetary &quot;outyears,&quot; Washington, D.C.'s
equivalent of the sweet-by-and-by. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 80's, when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats
controlled Congress, the tactical advantage is now with the GOP. If Congress
wants to spend, a President has few ways to prevent it. If--as now--Congress
does not want to spend, the President has even fewer ways to force it to
do so. In a contest of wills, Congress probably can stand the pressure better
than the President. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That means they also may not be deterred by short term drops in the polls.
Perhaps the left has forgotten a pertinent lesson from the past, but it
has not been forgotten by the GOP elephant. In 1990, when President George
Bush tried to force budgetary restraint on a Democratic Congress, the artificial
heat generated in the ensuing &quot;crisis&quot; was especially intense.
Bush finally cracked and backed down. In return for limited future spending
controls, he agreed to break his pledge on taxes (Remember &quot;Read my
lips&quot;?). He was a hero to the media at the time, a real statesman.
And the voters didn't seem to care much--until they trounced him soundly
in the next election. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 the Republicans ran on a Contract with America. They told the voters
exactly what they wanted to do: cut spending, cut taxes and revive America's
economic growth. And they won a history-making victory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
They are now trying to do what they promised. Boogeymen are being thrown
up to scare them off track, including Mr. Clinton's holograph of a government
&quot;train wreck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the ghost of George Bush scares them a lot more. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tithing tax break offers better reform <BR>
than block-grant push </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Wailing critics in Washington, D.C. would like you to believe that America's
poor are about to be devastated by plans to block grant welfare funds and
send them to the states. The House of Representative's desire to add specific
mandates to that approach simply raises the wailing to a higher pitch. <BR>
<BR>
But the truth is that 70 of the 80 major federal and state welfare-related
programs are not affected by the reform bills, while those that are affected
will go through a slower rate of growth, not real reductions. Adopting &quot;workfare&quot;
or allowing the states to experiment with other structural changes does
not automatically assure more innovative use of the money, let alone savings.
<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of whether the Senate bill or the House bill emerges from the
conference committee set up to reconcile their differences, and regardless
of the President's relative enthusiasm,&quot;welfare as we know it&quot;
is not really going to end. But, maybe it should. <BR>
<BR>
Why must we always turn to government--at whatever level--for welfare solutions?
Since the 1960's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; spending on cash and in-kind
transfers (cash, food, housing, energy, medical aid, etc.) has increased
640 percent in real, inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet most social problems--such
as out-of-wedlock birth rates--are far worse today. Perhaps welfare reformers
are not being &quot;radical&quot; enough. &quot;Radical,&quot; after all,
means getting at the roots, and when it comes to helping the poor, we need
to recognize that the private sectors of society--including churches and
other non-profit organizations, as well as the job-creating profit sector--tend
to do a better job than government. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to find ways to enable the non-government sectors gradually
to take on greater responsibility, while government's role is reduced. The
idea is not to leave the poor without friends, but to find them truer friends.
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana proposes to stimulate private giving with an
increase in the tax deductibility of charitable donations, from 100 to 120
percent. Reps. Joe Knollenberg of Michigan and Jim Kolbe of Arizona would
give a $100 tax credit for gifts to community groups that work with the
poor. Sen. Coats of Indiana would increase that to $500. <BR>
<BR>
In Seattle, philanthropist and former businessman Mark Bloome asserts that
society would be spiritually improved overall and the poor allowed to advance
more surely, if the old Judeo-Christian ideal of the &quot;tithe&quot; could
be reinvigorated. He does not necessarily connect his idea with welfare
reform, but welfare reform certainly would benefit from being connected
with his idea. Tithing, the gift of 10 percent of one's income to the church
or other charity, is rare today, a victim mainly of high taxes. The answer,
Bloome believes, is to provide a federal tax credit for those charitable
contributions a person makes beyond five percent of his income (which are
tax deductible) and up to ten percent (the tithe). In contrast to a mere
deduction, the tithe would encourage people to give beyond the five percent
threshold, which is already a sacrifice, while the ten percent ceiling would
prevent tax-credited benevolence from bankrupting the federal treasury.
<BR>
<BR>
Tax reform advocates, as well as welfare reformers, would do well to consider
the wisdom of ideas like Bloome's. Experience in the 80's--when marginal
tax rates were lower and charitable giving was higher--and the 90's--when
tax rates went up and charitable giving stagnated--supports the common sense
expectation that people will give more when they have more to give. Thus,
lower and flatter tax rates probably will increase charitable giving even
as they boost the overall economy and personal income growth. <BR>
<BR>
What tax reformers tend to overlook is the political, if the not the moral,
desirability of linking a more productive tax system to one that assuredly
serves the poor directly. The tithing idea would do it. <BR>
<BR>
Private charity is intrinsic to the American character. It is more personal
and voluntary, and hence more moral, than government distributed tax funds.
And it tends to be more effective. Perhaps private charity cannot supplant
all government welfare, but it can redress the present imbalance. It offers
citizens of many political persuasions a potentially better choice than
either the present welfare mess or any of the conventional political proposals
for reform. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to get radical.

<HR><BR>
<BR>
In the recent dog days of summer, over a hundred people showed up at Seattle's
Washington Institute to meet one of the superficially more improbable candidates
for President in 1996, the articulate black Republican, Alan Keyes. <BR>
<BR>
A former Reagan Administration official, Keyes believes that the decline
of the family is the central problem in society, around which almost all
other problems revolve. His message went over well. He said he'll be back
soon. <BR>
<BR>
For so many citizens to appear at such events a full year before the 1996
national nominating conventions and fifteen months before the final election
might seem remarkable. But, decision time for activists is not next spring;
it's now. <BR>
<BR>
Presidential campaigns are being organized and financed earlier than ever
before. Competition to attract attention from candidates and the media has
encouraged states to set their primaries earlier and earlier on the calendar.
As a result, the first primaries next year will come in February. Only seven
weeks later, in April, over 80 percent of all public votes for delegates
will be over. <BR>
<BR>
If candidates waited to enter the race until the primary season was nearly
underway, as Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952, they would be too late to qualify
legally, let alone to assemble a team. (Attention, Gen. Colin Powell.) A
strategy like President Franklin Roosevelt's in 1940--when he did not declare
his candidacy until the eve of the Democratic convention--is unimaginable
in our time. <BR>
<BR>
Since Washington State recently moved its own presidential primary forward
to March 26, we, too, are suddenly part of the scramble. That and fundraising
opportunities are the reasons that candidates already are showing up. Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have all flown in.
Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, who still thinks a coherent foreign policy is
important, apparently has decided that Washington could be a breakthrough
state for his candidacy and is planning several visits. Malcom S. (&quot;Steve&quot;)
Forbes, Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine (&quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;),
may visit Seattle soon after a likely declaration of candidacy this month.
Now that our primary falls on the same date as nearby California's, even
the frontrunning Sen. Bob Dole is increasing his interest in Washington
State, according to his national political consultant, Don Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Washington is a must-win state for the Democrats in the final
election, so don't be surprised to see lots of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore. <BR>
<BR>
In the month of March in past presidential election years, we were all watching
the first primary. But next March, Washington State will be taking part
in one of the last of the important ones. Thereafter, the identity of the
two presidential nominees may well be known--and then we will fall into
the rut of a six month long final election drive. Spring's excitement will
be brief, the frustrations that follow interminable. <BR>
<BR>
If you believe that democracy benefits from some relatively quiet time between
spasms of political extravagance, this is not the way to organize our national
elections. Neither a sitting president nor his opponent is likely to behave
like a statesman when a campaign atmosphere dominates. Leadership suffers
when a presidency is preoccupied with the next election for a full two years
out of a four year term of office. <BR>
<BR>
When you consider that the first six months or so of a president's term
are absorbed in putting an administration together--another process elongated
in recent times--the normal tasks of governing actually are getting only
about a year and a half of our Chief Executive's undivided attention. And
the same is true for most of his would-be opponents. <BR>
<BR>
Americans don't hate these politicians. They just get very tired of them.
But, no immediate change is possible. Party rules and presidential primary
dates are already locked into place for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
The only cure for the coming epidemic of politics-fatigue is for citizens
in this election cycle to demand that the two major parties and Congress
push the primaries back to something like their old schedule for the year
2000. Parties, for example, should pass rules precluding the seating of
convention delegates that are chosen before, say, April of an election year.
And Congress should refuse to provide candidates with federal matching funds
until roughly the same period. <BR>
<BR>
In an era of instantaneous and ubiquitous communications, why should our
political system require five times as long to choose a president as it
did in the days of Grover Cleveland?

Forward Thrust or Bust? </CENTER>

<P>The danger in next month's capital improvements election--with the Seattle
Commons, neighborhood ball parks and a big outdoor ballpark for the Mariners
on the ballot--is not that voters of Seattle and King County will lack the
facts upon which to make a sound judgment. There will be plenty of healthy
debate. The real danger, especially for young voters and newcomers, is that
the choices may take place in an historical vacuum. <BR>
<BR>
The best argument for the bond issues is that, unlike so many federal, state
and even government promises, voters in this case can be fairly sure of
what they are getting for their money. They will be able to see the results.
But if they are skeptical, they might want to review what happened with
some other great decisions in Seattle history, including most recently,
&quot;Forward Thrust.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even people who experienced it may have forgotten what that former citizens'
crusade did to make Seattle a better place to live. Indeed, our area today
is at a crucial point not unlike that of 27 years ago. The economic boom
back then had left many people worried, for the first time, that the area's
&quot;livability&quot; was threatened. Yet, voters may have been more optimistic
then, if only because family income was growing faster than it is now. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, that optimism was somewhat unwarranted. Within a couple
of years after the first and determinative Forward Thrust election of 1968,
Seattle suffered the famous &quot;Boeing recession.&quot; In the subsequent,
less hopeful atmosphere of 1970, the remaining Forward Thrust proposals
that were put on that year's ballot were defeated. <BR>
<BR>
But then a wonderful thing happened--several wonderful things, really. The
Forward Thrust projects that King County residents had approved in the palmy
days of 1968 began development in the early 70's at just the right time
to help revive the economy. A spectacular series of civic improvements ensued,
including new parks, recreation and professional sports facilities, sanitation,
fire stations, a youth service center, and community centers. It was largely
due to the major Forward Thrust projects, and the many smaller projects
inspired by them, that Seattle started winning &quot;Most Livable City&quot;
awards over the following decade. A successful 1972 vote for a metropolitican
bus system (the often-forgotten third ballot vote of the Forward Thrust
series), and the state legislature's adoption of Forward Thrust measures
to modernize SeaTac Airport and our seaport added to the momentum. <BR>
<BR>
I was newly on the City Council then and delighted with the opportunities
Forward Thrust offered Seattle. Many of them were serendipitous and unanticipated.
For example, historic preservation had not been considered when the Forward
Thrust parks proposal was planned, but by 1972 we were able to use historic
preservation techniques to find new uses for old Seattle landmarks and to
save money on building some of the &quot;new&quot; facilities Forward Thrust
had promised. <BR>
<BR>
As for the parks themselves, Forward Thrust allowed Seattle area governments
to pick up properties for what we can now see were bargain prices. For example,
the land for Mercer Island's Luther Burbank Park, presently valued at $70
million, was acquired for all of $l.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
Though capital funds were relatively plentiful in the '70's, thanks to Forward
Thrust, maintenance funds were not. But Forward Thrust inspired City Hall
to find creative ways to close much of the gap. One way was to combine projects
in order to reduce overhead expenses. Merging the new aquarium with the
Waterfront Park is an example. <BR>
<BR>
We also found we could get some of the new parks actually to generate revenue
to offset their maintenance costs, as was the case again at Waterfront Park.
Re-using the existing old piers as part of the park design was entirely
in keeping with the park's theme, and it also permitted us to expand visitor
interest with shops and restaurants. And, ever since, these private concessions
have provided the city with rent and sales tax revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the inspiration of the father of the Forward Thrust movement, Jim
Ellis, the city and county also learned how to leverage bond moneys to attract
public grants, private investments and gifts. These ranged from highway
funds and a new private building that helped make Freeway Park possible
to private flower garden donations for the park's operations. Thus, the
citizens of Seattle and King County actually got far more than they voted
for. How often does that happen with government? <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the total bond moneys of $330 million were nearly doubled by federal
and state public grants, along with private investments and gifts ($240
million), plus interest on the bonds ($55 million). Throw in the increased
property values of recent decades, and Forward Thrust turns out to have
been the best bargain for Seattleites since we built the City Light hydroelectric
dams at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
People over 40 often ask what happened to the kind of enlightened and inventive
civic leadership that gave us Forward Thrust. Part of the answer is that
while contemporary Americans demand leadership, we denigrate leaders. We
are particularly cynical about motives now, even with citizen volunteers.
And then there is the problem of time. Back in the '60's, Jim Ellis expected
to spend less than two years on Forward Thrust and wound up devoting seven.
Today's extensive approval processes and other hurdles make public projects
exhausting for citizen leaders. <BR>
<BR>
But the rest of the answer to the leadership question is more heartening.
The truth is that both the Seattle Commons idea and the proposal to build
a new outdoor stadium initially arose from outside of government and have
elicited almost exactly the same quality of citizen spirit that gave us
Forward Thrust-or, earlier, the Century 21 World's Fair that left us the
Seattle Center. <BR>
<BR>
Over several years more than 2500 citizens from all walks of life have donated
personal time, financial contributions and talent to the Commons idea. At
first, there was not even any great interest from the organized business
community or from government. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hidden agenda. The uncommon Commons vision is persuasive because
it has just the right mix of boldness and prudence, like Forward Thrust.
The vision is to create 18,000 good new jobs, anchor a good share of the
city's new, multi-income housing growth at the south end of Lake Union,
with a landmark central park that everyone can use, and in the process help
reduce urban sprawl and traffic congestion. It will be a model of a more
sensible urban envirornment. <BR>
<BR>
As with Forward Thrust, the citizens who have thrown themselves into the
Commons effort have figured out how to blend many aims to produce a package
with wide appeal. The neighborhood ballparks are needed, though they are
not urgent. But the plan to use the Commons project as a means to solve
the near-legendary Mercer Street traffic mess is an excellent case of sound
multi-purpose planning. <BR>
<BR>
The Commons, if adopted, probably will excel Forward Thrust in attracting
private investments and and already has done so with philanthropic gifts
and loans. The Commons group also has figured out how to attract money from
outside the area. As an immediate consequence of approval of the Commons'
bonds, $18 million of bond funds will be used to secure matching state and
federal highway grants to widen the Mercer corridor and put it underground.
<BR>
<BR>
When you think of it, the Forward Thrust spirit is also alive in the unfairly-maligned
plan to build a Mariners ballpark. It, too, will be multi-purpose, not just
the place for a baseball fan to enjoy a soft summer night, but a place for
any of us, and our children, to enjoy a wide range of civic events and celebrations.
And thanks to an ingenious retractable roof, it will work regardless of
the weather. <BR>
<BR>
The ballpark proposal bespeaks the all too-unusual civic dedication of the
wealthy individuals who risked their own money--starting with the Japanese
owner of Nintendo who effectively gifted us with $50 million--to save the
local professional baseball team. That is what we now have on the line.
<BR>
<BR>
You don't put your money into a baseball team in Seattle to get rich (or
richer) these days, whatever you may tell your spouse. And you don't go
to endless Commons meetings to advance your career. Maybe you step forward
because you are nostalgic for your youth, or for the dreams you had of the
city you'd like to see, or maybe you are that old fashioned type of person
who believes in the concept of civic virtue. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its source, we can't buy that kind of civic spirit at any price.
Like the citizens of the ancient Roman republic--or Seattle at the high
points of its history--we can only try to call it forth. <BR>
<BR>
This town has lots of other needs and opportunities beyond those on the
current ballot. But that is not a reason for discouragement. We also have
better prospects than we have ever enjoyed. Surely we would like to see
more of the newly wealthy Seattleites step up to the challenge of philanthropy
and to endow our next genereation with new civic advantages--in schools,
city beautification, housing, camps, museums, public gardens, transportation
amenities, music, medical care, and job opportunities. But, how do we entice
our new millionaires to play this role unless we honor those who do? <BR>
<BR>
This town, as part of its heritage, also probably has more than its fair
share of talented potential citizen leaders, regardless of financial resources,
good people of a new generation whose imagination, know-how and drive we
would like to enlist for our community's benefit. They will do the volunteer
chores others shirk. But what do we have to entice those individuals--other
than the respect we pay them by taking their efforts seriously? <BR>
<BR>
Is ours going to be the era of Forward Bust? Or are we headed for another
Forward Thrust, with all the good it can bring us? The September ballot
will not finally answer that question. But it can become an important sign
that civic confidence--and the calling forth of public service--is once
again ignited. It can light our way. <BR>
<BR>
If you doubt what such measures can do for a city, drive around. Many of
the best features of contemporary Seattle sprang from the public spirited
efforts of earlier citizens, including the Progressive Era generation at
the turn of the century who built our first comprehensive boulevard and
parks systems, the ship canals and locks, our exemplary water reservoirs
and power dams and the Denny Regrade. Those folks are all gone. <BR>
<BR>
But the Forward Thrust generation, most of them, are still here. From our
clean water to a vibrant cultural life, you also can see their works. The
point is that Seattle did not become the envy of the nation by accident.
Seattle citizens--with remarkable frequency--have made wise choices at the
right time. <BR>
<BR>
Just look around you.

</H2>
<BR>
Good morning, and Happy Leap Year, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I am honored to be asked my opinion about the 2000 Census.<BR>
Leap Year, indeed, is a good time to review the Census Bureau's plans, because
a great statistical leap into the 21st century is what the Bureau is proposing.
The Congress may wish to look very hard before you take this leap, however,
because it is a leap into the unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly concerned about the plan to use sampling to adjust the
hard count for the 2000 Census. Looked at through a green eye shade, it
may seem prudent. Obviously, it is financially burdensome to obtain the
last 10 percent or so of Census names, so sampling looks like a winning
solution. Undoubtedly that thought must have weighed heavily in the recommendations
of several bodies that are advocating adjustment. But if money is what matters
most, you could save even more by relying on still more sampling. The Census
is, indeed, expensive. But consider what you get with it. It holds up the
whole statistical system of the Unite States. Having said that, I do acknowledge
the legitimacy of the cost issue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The statistical accuracy argument must also be acknowledged. It is embarrassing
to have an undercount after every decennial Census. However, it is an embarrassment
the republic has managed to survive each decade for two centuries. I am
not sure how well we would survive its alternative. The problem with sampling
and adjustment does not lie only with accuracy, which statisticians can
debate, but with its admitted core of artificiality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My argument with adjustment, thus, is not primarily a matter of statistical
methodology. That's not my background, in any case. If anybody could pull
off an adjustment in a conscientious manner it is the U.S. Census Bureau.
My experiences at the Bureau left me with the greatest respect for the honesty,
ability and public spirit of the people who work there, right up to and
including the outstanding current director, Dr. Martha Riche. Moreover,
many of the statistical and management innovations the Bureau has proposed
for the 2000 Census, including new &quot;matching&quot; software to spot
double-counting, the digital &quot;capture&quot; of data on forms, more
user-friendly forms and the added mail contacts with each address, all have
excellent prospects, in my view. The 2000 Census, as with past censuses,
will see improvements, regardless of adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should an official adjustment take place, however, and you have one national
number, the Census will still not have counted everyone, even in theory.
For example, the present plan will have done nothing to count the literally
hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not employed by the government
and who are temporarily living overseas. (Overseas government employees
now are counted, of course.) The people I'm talking about are U.S. citizens;
some of them own homes and other property here; some are on the voter roles
and motor vehicle license lists. I certainly agree with the proposal to
explore the use of many other administrative records, such as Social Security
and welfare rolls, to seek names of people who may have been missed in the
Census head count. I also understand why the Bureau must count illegal immigrants,
even though they may lack reliable addresses and their stay in this country
may be very temporary, indeed. But shouldn't we also be trying to identify
citizens of the U.S. who happen to be out of the country around the Census
time, but whose names can be found in public records and who count the United
States as home? Isn't their stake in the country important enough to be
reflected in the numbers that are used, for example, to apportion Congress?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer given by the Census Bureau, with OMB no doubt looking over its
shoulder, is that such a search would be costly. Well, if so, why isn't
it proposed to sample and adjust for the overseas Americans, too? But, meanwhile,
the controversy of this very subject returns us again to the central problem
in the 2000 Census plan, and that is the moral or philosophical concept
of an official, adjusted enumeration. Sampling is a proven and accepted
form of measurement, but there usually has to be some hard, broadly accepted
data base from which the sample is drawn. More importantly, I can't think
of a statistical sample that is so closely tied to a civic act as is the
Census enumeration, any more than I can think of an election survey that
has the moral authority of an actual election.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census enumeration is a participatory function of government hallowed
by Constitutional mandate. There are not too many comparable civic acts;
voting is one, serving on juries is another. Perhaps participation in the
Census falls between those two--it is neither as voluntary as voting, nor
as demanding as jury service. In any case, the Census is one of the fundamental
democratic institutions of our society, and I believe, it is a noble one.
It gives us the numbers that make other numbers meaningful. It must not
only be trustworthy, but palpably trustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The current Census director herself has spoken of the three legs of the
Census stool that must dictate the process: cost, accuracy and public perception.
The first two legs are important, as I have acknowledged, but if the latter
breaks, the whole construction comes down. The term &quot;public perception&quot;
could also be described as trustworthiness. In a time when public mistrust
of government is rife, I question a change that would introduce the invention
of statistical persons into the Census--robots constructed of sampled data
and intellectual abstractions--to stand in the place of real human beings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census has long represented an honest attempt to count every person
in the United States--every real person, not every &quot;virtual&quot; person,
not every &quot;statistical analog&quot; for a person, not every &quot;full
time equivalent&quot; of a person, but every real person. Once citizens
realize that the Census number is partly an invention--however brilliant
an invention it is--they will begin to question many things. Suspicions
will be aroused. How, some will ask, do we know that the creation of statistical
persons does not have some partisan or factional or geographic regional
basis? How does this corrupted Census count infect other numbers and political
institutions?<BR>
Let me stress again my own full confidence in the integrity of the individuals
who serve at the U.S. Census Bureau. It is largely because I don't want
to see that integrity even put up to question that I raise this problem
of perception--of evident trustworthiness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's next consider legal problems with the Census; do you think you have
them now? In fact, the costly lawsuits challenging the Census invariably
are won by the government. Common sense tells a judge that a good faith
effort to count every person cannot be faulted for occasional human mistakes,
especially when plaintiffs can seldom if ever produce evidence of actual
individuals who have not been counted. But under an adjusted Census it will
not be difficult at all to produce evidence that the Census erred, and erred
intentionally, by imputing fictitious people into neighborhoods where the
real neighbors can readily prove that the interlopers do not, in plain truth,
exist. In some cases, the fictional, imputed people are going to amount
to a difference between drawing a redistricting line one place rather than
another, and maybe even change the apportionment of states. (After all,
isn't that part of the whole idea?) In such cases, I suggest, common sense
will now become the government's enemy, because you will need to give all
the judges and ordinary citizens an extensive course in statistics to persuade
them that it is just and fair to invent people for something as supposedly
straightforward as a U.S. Census. How especially do we explain including
invented people in determining such matters as apportioning Congress when,
as I noted before, we do not count real American citizens living abroad?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the American public will accept all this with total unconcern or even
satisfaction. But maybe, instead, this will be seen as one more way the
government is trying to pull a fast one on the people. Won't any resulting
public cynicism make the hard count even more difficult to obtain in the
first place? If it contributes to further falloff of response, won't that
and the ever-present financial incentives, lead to still more sampling in
subsequent Censuses, in a downward spiral? And won't it seem perfectly acceptable
soon to conduct the whole Census through sampling? And won't there be an
irrestible temptation to try, Census by Census, to improve the content of
what constitutes the invented persons created through the sample, and hence
the meaning of such invented persons?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am here to urge
you to look at the Census as one of the most venerable civic institutions
of the United States, and to do all you can to protect it. Once trust in
it is undermined, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to restore. <BR>

Today the craft  of film-making is awe inspiring, but the sensibility is often pernicious.  Take three leading contenders for Oscars, The English Patient, The People  vs. Larry Flynt and Evita. All three films display adroit writing, acting  and editing. And all three use the bedazzling tricks of Hollywood to gain  audience sympathy for scoundrels.</P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The English Patient presents us with a handsome count in North Africa who,  as World War II approaches, seduces a friend's wife (and much of the theater  audience). When they are nearly killed by her jealous husband, the count  leaves her wounded in the desert to get help. He is arrested mistakenly  by the British, kills an innocent guard and then, to get a plane to return  him to his lover, offers precious maps of the desert to the Germans, helping  to doom thousands of British soldiers. The person after whom the story  is modeled, Count Almasy, was in fact a spy for the Nazis and later the  Soviets. Yet there were many wet eyes at the end of the film about this  irresponsible relativist. After all, who are we to judge such a romantic  figure?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  A hero's mantle from the costume racks also magically transforms Hustler  magazine publisher, Larry Flynt. No pander was ever half so endearing as  actor Woody Harrelson portrays Flynt. Gloria Steinhem for once has it right:  The real-life Flynt earns his millions by degrading women, in some cases  celebrating violence done to them. In an apparently successful effort to  disarm viewers, the film almost admits as much, but we are supposed to  be charmed.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Businessman Flynt uses the First Amendment strictly to protect his production  of salable sex, but the film offers him up as a rustic champion of a robust  Constitution, just a little left of Tom Paine. Could manipulated theatergoers,  like the woman seated behind me, who exclaimed loudly that the film was  the &quot;best movie I have ever seen,&quot; be made to feel the same about  a film toasting pedophilia or bestiality?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Very possibly so, because the point of the Flynt film is that the First  Amendment is absolute and that those who constantly extend the plumbing  of its depths deserve not just legal toleration and fat bank accounts,  but also the public's thanks. Understandably, the real Larry Flynt, however  rich, is used to being a social pariah. But a few days ago he was invited  onto a national TV talk show and was delighted--and amazed-- by the immense  ovation that greeted him. Hollywood has lionized another skunk.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Then there is Evita. This is the film with a screenplay co-authored by  Oliver Stone, who has done so much for bogus history in JFK and Nixon.  It arguably is the worst film of the three exactly because its lying is  the most persuasive. Stuffed with rolls of cinematic gauze, the satirical  bite of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original stage musical is reduced to gumming.  In the lyrics of Tim Rice an echo of sarcasm remains, but it is lost in  the visual schmaltz. Imagery and music easily drown out words in a film  whose makers have fallen in love with the villains.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Oh, people are shown getting beaten up by the Peronistas and there is a  sly allusion (but only that) to Juan Peron's similarities to Benito Mussolini.  But you would have to guess that the Perons themselves were responsible  for the beatings and murders, and you would hardly imagine that the Italians  who pelted Eva with eggs during her visit to Rome did so because Juan Peron  had been an outspoken admirer of Il Duce and Der Fuehrer. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  In the film there is no disclosure that the Perons were anti-Semitic or  that they welcomed up to 15,000 escaping Nazis at the close of World War  II, raking in untold millions in gold from them. The Perons' economic policies--in  the film, an amusing redistribution of wealth from the stuffy privileged  classes--resulted in long term financial desolation for all classes. At  one time living standards in Argentina rivaled Canada's. Thanks largely  to the Perons, Argentina sank to third world status.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  But in today's Hollywood, Eva Peron's sins are washed away and restored  as 90's virtues. Her sexual power-seeking warrants admiring chuckles; what  pluck! On screen, she is a Latin feminist, seizing authority from hidebound  men who don't realize that glamour has a right to rule. Her propaganda  lines and staged humility (&quot;I only bring the people to the heart of  Peron!&quot;) no longer ring hollow, as in Andrew Lloyd Webber's play.  They chime cheerily to a generation of movie-goers who know little of fascism.  The film's violence is just an exotic backdrop for Webber's operatic themes  and Madonna's fashion parade.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, Madonna is the perfect vehicle for Oliver Stone's mock-populist  revisionism. Perhaps we can see her next as poor, misunderstood Lady Mac  Beth, and after that the noted &quot;Renaissance woman,&quot; Lucretia  Borgia. Then she can rehabilitate that suffering citizen of revolutionary  France, Madame Lafarge.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There are so many historical and fictional rascals left, each of whose  appearance needs to be uplifted by Hollywood's celluloid implants.<BR>  <BR>  </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery  Institute.

At least one early morning  a week, you will find George Benson, 78, down on the waterfront picking  up trash along the tracks or over at the car barn shining glass lenses  on the headlamps of the city's vintage streetcars. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why such devotion? &quot;It's my baby!&quot; George  exclaims. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, it is. Back in 1974 Councilman Benson had the idea that Seattle  should retrieve part of its abandoned transportation heritage, streetcars.  Not &quot;trolleys&quot; that run on wires, mind you, but real streetcars  that run on tracks. Like other American cities, Seattle once had an intricate  web of them, including an &quot;Interurban&quot; that could take you to  Everett or Tacoma in about the time you can make it now in an auto at rush  hour. The automotive lobby long ago seduced Seattle and most other cities  into abandoning streetcars, and only in recent years have modern variations  on the old theme begun to return to fashionability. But rare are the lucky  burgs with old fashioned, strap-hanging, bell-clanging streetcars. New  Orleans. Philadelphia. San Francisco, of course.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  And, thanks to George Benson, Seattle. On one short line from the Myrtle  Edwards Park at the north end of the waterfront, along Alaska Way to Pioneer  Square and on to the International District, Metro operates five beautifully  restored vehicles that together carry nearly 500,000 passengers a year.  Many passengers take advantage of Seattle's general policy of free transit  within downtown (a policy also dating to the '70's). But another large  group--177,971, to be exact--are paying customers, most of them tourists  taking in the sights.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There were other municipal advocates of a new/old streetcar route back  in 1974. But it was George Benson, the enthusiast, who persevered with  such detailed attention that all obstacles (lack of local car stock, the  need for businesses to support a local improvement district, safety concerns,  and on and on) gradually were overcome--after only eight and a half years  of effort.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was one of George's colleagues on the Council, and now I am an occasional  customer of his streetcars, which I find ideal for showing visitors our  town. So when we talked at a recent dinner for former and present Council  members, I told Geroge I had a dream that I bet he shared: to extend the  current one-way, back and forth route into a loop. With a loop line, passengers  could expand the current trip to the waterfront, Pioneer Square, the Kingdome  and the International District into a grander tour of downtown, adding  the Municipal and County buildings, the financial district, the art museum,  the forthcoming symphony hall, hotels, and shopping opportunities around  Westlake Mall and the Convention Center, followed by a jaunt across the  newly trendy Denny Regrade to Seattle Center before heading back to the  waterfront for another loop.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was right. George lit up like a streetcar beacon. A loop route is his  secret passion. We have been talking precise routes ever since. It's a  game anyone can play, so readers are invited to share their concepts, too.  But in this game there are a couple of rules. For one, these streetcars  cannot go down a steep incline, so east-west routes in the center of our  hilly downtown won't work. For another, many motorists are made nervous  by the strangeness of a streetcar next to them, so a new route should not  cram streetcars and autos too closely together. Beyond all, safety must  prevail. People are used to dodging cars, but not streetcars--despite the  ringing bells.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It isn't hard to find fault with the idea. Because so many passengers travel  free, the present route doesn't pay for itself directly. (Of course, neither  do buses downtown.) A loop route might attract still more passengers, but  it is hard to see it breaking even under present pricing arrangements.  Also, the Engineering Department, which must guide any new development,  is anxious about congestion that may eventuate as new tracks head back  through busy north/south avenues.<BR>  A little imagination and Bensonian grit in the current city leadership  might help at this point. Perhaps the streetcar route could go through  the bus tunnel under Third Avenue. Perhaps a little longer trip at the  north end of a loop, along Denny Way past the Pacific Science Center to  Bay Street, would provide a sufficiently gradual grade to assure streetcar  traction. Perhaps the relatively high ridership of the system would allow  its integration into the new regional and intermodal transit plan and help  cover startup costs.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Certainly a streetcar loop would be popular with visitors, and, in fact,  maybe all of us who use it should--on this one downtown run--pay the going  cost. To have the pleasure of getting from one attractive destination to  another on an easy-to-comprehend streetcar loop would make Seattle's downtown  even more appealing, especially in the rain--for locals as well as tourists.  Starting, of course, with George Benson.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  <B>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery Institute.

When such a law is passed,  Congressmen will be arresting each other literally right and left, until  there's no one around to run the country. Rather, the sane solution heads  in the opposite direction: admit that scandal-mongering has become a degenerative  disease of democracy and rewrite our over-regulatory laws to give politicians  some slack. Allow more room for conflicting interpretations of political  &quot;truth&quot; and reduce penalties to a point that a legislator is  not threatened with ruin for a minor failing. Towering cases of real corruption  might be more visible in our system if we did not permit puny underbrush  to obstruct the view. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Representative government accepts that people with different philosophies  and different stakes are going to see things differently. Politics is supposed  to make a virtue of these disagreements so that voters can make up their  own minds at election time. However, what the current ethics laws and regulations  do is change politics from a game where the point is to impress public  opinion at election time to one whose purpose is to destroy the opposition  personally in a legal setting. The problem goes back a generation or more,  but it is getting worse. As we are seeing, even the House Ethics Committee,  which has standing only under House rules and is not a court, can become  so preoccupied with legal-sounding procedural issues that members from  the two parties can hardly speak to each other any more, let alone work  together. Cooperation on any subject is now endangered.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It needs saying that citizens as well as politicians bring their biases  to these matters. For all of us, there are three mental and moral exercises  that might help bring such bias to the surface and put issues into proper  perspective. The first is to imagine a reversal of identities in the parties  to a given conflict and see if, in that case, one would feel the same way.  For example, if a Democrat, instead of Newt Gingrich, had raised money  for a non-profit organization to finance a college course with what some  people could interpret as a partisan point of view, would that have been  seen as seriously reprehensible? If a Republican member of Congress had  distributed a tape of a cellular phone call to friendly news media, as  Rep. Jim McDermott is accused of doing, would that be have been seen as  materially different?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Secondly, one can ask in these ethics cases how a particular standard applied  to politicians would look if it were applied to critics in the media. It  supposedly is terrible if a politician &quot;misleads&quot; his collegues.  But media commentators mislead the public quite often, for roughly similar  reasons: ignorance, prejudice, stress, time pressure, recklessness. You  could hardly hold a Sunday TV talk show anymore if the shouting heads were  held legally responsible for their veracity. Why, to use another example,  is it reprehensible that Jim McDermott passed along an illicit phone tape  to the New York Times (if indeed he did), while there is no discussion  at all about the propriety of the Times' publishing a transcript of it?  Do we only care about violations of privacy by private citizens and politicians,  never by the media? </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Third, one might explore the practical circumstances and conequences, not  just the formal cause, of the alleged ethical misbehavior. Circumstances  and consequences count. Did someone abuse his office for personal gain,  or was it a mainly political maneuver? Who was really hurt, how much and  in what way? Gingrich's course wound up being non-partisan, in fact, and  was never used for the Speaker's financial advantage. His &quot;misleading&quot;  paperwork submitted to the Ethics Committee, though wrong, related to a  non-crime. Likewise, McDermott's supposed delivery of a telephone tape  to The New York Times was a political blunder more than a crime, an ethics  weapon that backfired.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  If all sides in Congress could declare a temporary truce, they might spend  some time trying to reform the ethics laws and regulations so that petty  infractions are given only proportionate punishment. Under more realistic  rules, the legal payoff for exaggerating scandals necessarily would diminish  (for media as well as politicians) and today's gladiators-to-the-death  would become merely happy warriors, their conflicts ritualized in more  traditional parliamentary forms. The business of government could proceed  on its more or less dignified course. Politics as usual. It actually would  be a relief.<BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

The report, &quot;The Shakespeare File:  What  English Majors are Really Studying,&quot; produced by the National Alumni  Forum, provides an insight into declining academic standards overall and  the growing failure even to acknowledge standards.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At Georgetown University, for example, you can still  take a course on Shakespeare, but despite a university administration effort  to cloud the issue, you can graduate as an &quot;English major&quot; without  doing so.  The emphasis now is on &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;a wide range  of literary and non-literary genres such as mass media.&quot;  Within such  &quot;genres&quot; are courses in &quot;Gangster Films&quot; and &quot;Detective  Fiction as Social Critique.&quot;  In the latter course the student learns  what detective novels tell us about &quot;the nuclear family, traditional  masculine values, and capitalist ideology.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You can understand why a 19 year old would rather take  some temporarily trendy course on gangster films than something he knows  little about, like Shakespeare, but whose worth and universal significance  have been proven over centuries.  But what parent forking over $30,000  a year to Georgetown wants the English major debased by such topical triflings?   Where is the foundation--the &quot;canon,&quot; in academic terms--upon  which a life of reading and reflection is erected?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the National Alumni Forum's report, the  trend not only is widespread, but dominant.  Out of 70 of the nation's  top colleges and universities (including those listed in the annual report  of U.S. News and World Report), &quot;only 23 now require English majors  to take a course in Shakespeare.  At Duke, Shakespeare yields to &quot;Melodrama  and Soap Opera,&quot; at Oberlin &quot;The Uses of Deviance.&quot;  Other  schools offer English--yes, English--classes in sports, textile trade,  theme parks, third world liberation struggles, mail-order brides, computer  games, advertising imagery and world fairs.  A high sounding course at  Cornell on the &quot;Languages of Community&quot; really involves study  of &quot;innovative cultural texts such as alternative 'zines, Nuyorican  performance poetry, and Internet News groups.&quot; (Note:  &quot;'zines&quot;  means magazines and &quot;Nuyorican&quot; means New Yorker.  Big deal.)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Alumni Forum report comments on the strange &quot;combination  of low culture with high theory (in many courses), as if enough theoretical  jargon made any subject worth study.&quot;  At Bowdoin College, &quot;An  Introduction to Literary Theory through Popular Culture&quot; provides  a &quot;structuralist, deconstructive, feminist, psychoanalytic, new historicist,  African-American, and lesbian and gay theory&quot; on such matters as &quot;best-selling  novels, music videos, Hollywood films, and soap opera.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why?  It cannot be that Shakespeare no longer is worthy  of an audience or is irrelevant to our age.  The audience is still there.   There have never been so many new films of Shakespeare's plays and adaptations  of them.  Imaginative new versions of Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are just  now opening, for example.  Sneak Previews' critic Michael Medved says that  Shakespeare &quot;is the hottest thing going in film right now.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Shakespeare may be irrelevant, indeed, to the careers  of English professors who obtained degrees in the riotous 60's.  They seem  unable to identify with an artist who was not at war with his times, whose  genius it was to perfectly express the society of his period even while  brilliantly transcending it.  They prefer the post-modern sensibility that  conceives of the artist's job as confronting and shocking society, even  though the confrontation is a pose and the shocks quickly wear thin.  They  regard the continuing high reputation of Shakespeare outside the university  as the rueful Cassius did Caesar:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Like a Colossus, and we petty men</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Walk under his legs and peep about</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	They also may believe that teaching of a long tradition  in literature does nothing to enhance their own stature among their academic  peers.  You don't attract attention by teaching Shakespeare, Chaucer and  Milton these days; you attract it by inventing new forms of literary criticism  that only other colleagues read.  Maybe that's their idea of the business  they are in.  But, again, why would any parent want to pay for such self-dramatizing  mediocrity?  Do we really want to reward Professor Glutz for his marvelous  insights into soap operas, or to teach Macbeth and Midsummer Night's Dream?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Of course, knocking the bust of Shakespeare off its pedestal  is only an indication of the tyranny of levelling in our culture.  A whole  range of great and tested authors, not just Shakespeare, endures the academy's  neglect.  Forget for a moment the divisions of liberal and conservative,  rich and poor.  Some of the worst damage to our cohesion as a people now  comes from supposed experts in education who denigrate lasting achievements  and celebrate the notional.  It is giving us two societies:  a small, remnant  strata that enjoys and benefits from the inspiration of our civilization's  long traditions, and the consumerist, throw-away culture that screams its  adoration of pop idols before discarding them for something still newer.   At peril is the Thomas Jefferson vision of a democratic culture that elevates  all.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is not new that a majority of citizens don't know  much of Shakespeare--or of the great figures of history, economics, philosophy  or science.  What is new is that university graduates--sometimes supposed  specialists, as in English departments--don't know about them either and,  most importantly, are not expected to.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This latest news about falling academic standards in  English, in particular, has serious implications for the next generation  of teachers of high school, who can hardly introduce children to the glories  of King Lear or Henry IV if they are barely acquainted with them themselves.   It is a sad loss for our culture, where next to the Bible (which terrifies  many colleges as well as common schools), Shakespeare is the well from  which writers of all kinds have drawn deepest inspiration for four centuries--writers  who shared their allusions with the whole reading public.  It's more bad  news for newspapers, for the theater (especially the various Shakespeare  festivals) and eventually even films. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is terrible news for the regents and trustees of our  colleges and universities.  The National Alumni Forum makes it clear that  most university English departments are so lost in political correctness  and intellectual consumerism that they cannot be reformed from within.   They will have to be rescued by the people who have ultimate legal responsibility,  college and university trustees.  Most trustees would rather duck the responsibility,  but ethically they cannot.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If English departments will not stress the generally  recognized best in English and American literature, Dr. Jerry Martin of  the Alumni Forum says, it plainly is up to trustees to call together a  distinguished national panel of professors to critique such departments  for the trustees' benefit and recommend changes (as the Forum itself did).   But perhaps another panel also could give advice:  Bring in the leading  practitioners of good writing in our society, the men and women who have  won fiction and non-fiction prizes, and the newspaper and magazine editors  and book editors of greatest distinction.  Ask them about these trends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Conservatives who despair that the problem of lowering  standards in the academy is a disease recognized only by themselves might  be surprised by the broad support--left as well as right--the Shakespeare  report has elicited out in the real world.  Martin Peretz of the liberal  New Republic magazine, for example, praised the Alumni Forum report, as  did Robert Brustein of the American Repertory Theater.  Roger Shattuck,  University Professor, Boston University, stated, &quot;The (current) situation  constitutes a breech of contract.  In fact, parents should sue for breech  of contract.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some English department chairs probably will assert that  their preferences merely reflect new scholarly understandings, perhaps  accessible only to academics; and under their breath they will rail against  efforts to resurrect &quot;dead white males&quot; like Shakespeare.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let them read Maya Angelou, the African American poet  who appeared at President Clinton's first inaugural.  Chided for reading  Shakespeare as a youth, Angelou recounts (in <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird  Sings</I>), &quot;...(Y)ears later, when I physically and psychologically  left that country, that condition, which is Stamps Arkansas...I found myself  and still find myself, whenever I like, stepping back into Shakespeare.   Whenever I like I pull him to me.  He wrote it for me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I all alone beweep my outcast state</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And look upon myself and curse my fate,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	With what I most enjoy contented least...'</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Of course he wrote it for me,&quot; Angelou continues;  &quot;that is the condition of the black woman.  Of course, he was a black  woman.  I understand that.  Nobody else understands it; but I know that  William Shakespeare was a black woman.  That is the role of art.&quot;</FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Maya Angelou understands.  The National Alumni Forum    understands.  What is it that keeps over half of the English departments    in America's higher educational institutions from understanding?</FONT></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute and writes a column on this page each Friday.</FONT></I></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><H1><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image51.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="59" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

Instead of coming up with  a list of New Year's Resolutions for 1997, it appears that our public leaders  are putting together a list of New Year's Irresolutions. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  At the top of the list is Social Security reform. The advisory council  on Social Security recommends that the private investment market be used  to shore up the nation's endangered old age insurance system. Failure to  do so offers the prospect of higher payroll taxes and benefit reductions  in the years ahead, while prompt action to link Social Security to the  private sector and the &quot;miracle of compound interest&quot; offers  nothing less than capitalistic ownership of the means of production by  the entire workforce and a better retirement for everyone. Seldom has there  been a subject where the choices are so clear and where so many are affected  so deeply. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Yet the initial reaction of politicians to the latest call for action is--irresolution.  The typical official response is &quot;cautious,&quot; which in government  lingo means, &quot;Let's punt.&quot; In private, Republicans embrace the  idea and such Democrats as the influential Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New  York acknowledge that it needs to be addressed. Some other Democrats, including  the President, are thought to be supportive of reform. However, excepting  Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, they are not about to say so. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Social Security reform is only one of the 600  pound policy gorillas officialdom is determined to ignore in hopes that  maybe they will go away. The solvency of Medicare is still more pressing,  so it will take the full concentration of our leaders to pretend that they  are doing something about that problem while doing nothing.<BR>  The same goes for tax reform, upon which the government also has resolved  to be irresolute. The distilled opinion coming out of the election campaign  was that tax cuts could stimulate growth and stabilize the economy. Dole's  proposed 15% rate reduction across the board may never have caught fire,  and neither did Clinton's parade of &quot;targeted&quot; cuts, but everyone  professed to believe that something could and should be done. Now that  talk apparently can be filed under &quot;Campaign Rhetoric.&quot; </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maybe in the information age it doesn't matter  whether the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation, the tax code punishes  marriage and raising children and discourages investment. Maybe we have  repealed economic cycles and are fated to plug along with low, but satisfactory  growth. Maybe. But nothing in economics is as seductive--and wrong--as  the impression that present trends can be extended indefinitely into the  future. The statesman knows that and looks ahead. So where are the statesmen?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Next on the list of New Years Irresolutions comes the long range foreign  policy of this country. You would think that we had made the world safe  and serene forever and that violence in the Middle East or the Balkans  are simply curiosities on the evening news. Are think tanks and recently  retired generals warning us about reduced fighting readiness in the US  military and demoralization in the ranks over gender issues? Defense can  wait until we discover a breakdown in the course of an emergency. Put it  all on the New Year's Irresolutions List. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  How about the environmental reforms that both liberals and conservatives  supposedly agree need addressing? Liberal environmentalists professedly  realize that the current, mainly proscriptive laws read great, but are  not really protecting the environment. Conservatives continue to complain  that the same laws handicap the economy and actually make sensible conservation  more difficult. It is time to find a pathway to reform--of the Environmental  Protection Agency, for example, and of the Endangered Species Act, for  another--that aims more at consequences than procedural purity. Any takers?  Or do we put the environment also on the Irresolutions list?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Telecommunications mistakes found in the 1996 act? Live with them. Impending  disaster with Amtrak? Hold off hearings until everyone agrees--in the sweet  bye and bye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The great thing about such a long list of New Year's Irresolutions is that  it frees the body politic to attend to matters that are much more amusing,  if infinitely less important: petty scandals. We already are into the middle  of January and the topic that Congress and the media find most engrossing  is whether Newt Gingrich used non-profit money to organize a partisan college  course, or used political funds to organize a non-partisan college course.  Now, if you don't find that sexy, look to the Paula Jones scandal spread  over the latest issue of Newsweek. What's the future of Social Security,  the solvency of Medicare and the state of America's defenses in comparison  to a soap opera like that?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><BR><B><I>Bruce Chapman, president of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute,writes on this page each Friday.</I></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><B><I></I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But that assumption goes almost  wholly uninspected. Few people know what actually was taught in the course,&quot;Renewing  American Civilization.&quot; Media accounts have utterly failed to give  details on it. That is entirely unnecessary, for the classes were video  taped and the tapes have been for sale for three years through a &quot;1-800&quot;  number (none of which profits Gingrich personally).</P>  <P>	Seeing the charge of alleged ethics violations start to develop last  fall I decided to get a full set of the tapes. &quot;Oh, joy,&quot; my  wife said dryly when they arrived in a big box, &quot;twenty hours of Newt  Gingrich!&quot; With a somewhat heavy heart myself, I sat down at the VCR.  But, fortunately, Gingrich at length is far more nuanced and interesting  than the sound bite Gingrich on the TV news.</P>  <P>	At heart, as he told the Ethics Committee, Gingrich is a professor.  Years ago, when he first entered Congress, I visited his office several  times, and before I could get to my business I had to hear all about the  latest four or five books he had read. Then he would wait expectantly for  me to write down the titles. I'm told he still does it.  Sen. Pat Moynihan  of New York, another former academic, will make you listen at length to  his interpretations of history, but at least he doesn't expect you to take  notes. </P>  <P>	Gingrich on camera in front of a class is just the same, only now he  has assembled  his ideas into a public policy tour of grand ambition. The  title, &quot;Renewing American Civilization,&quot; sounds grandiose, but  the product turns out to be well-organized and coherent. It is something  he almost alone in Congress (again excepting Moynihan) could have accomplished.  </P>  <P>	Gingrich argues for American exceptionalism, describing from history  the decisve effects inventors and entrepreneurs have had upon our economic  rise and the moral as well as self-interested grounds  for an internationalist  foreign policy and free trade. His grasp of technology's role in shaping  a better future is masterful. At the same time, he recounts with specificity  the unintended effects of sixty years of welfare state policies onAmerican  culture, leaving us with two societies--the educated and uneducated, the  successful and the unsuccessful. His examination of inner city problems  is one of serious concern. Finally, he analyzes the economic and social  strategies that various individuals have proposed to restore to all citizens'  control over their own destinies.</P>  <P>	 Having once taken the famous college course on American Intellectual  History taught by Professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a politically active  Democrat, I found the Gingrich class comparably engaging. There is this  distinction, however: Gingrich's course is less partisan. It displays a  Gingrich conversant with a wide array of knowledge and able to synthesize  it. He is fair-minded and positive. He frequently presents noted Democrats  and other liberals in a favorable light.</P>  <P>	 Many Republicans cannot be thrilled, for example, that Gingrich dotes   on Alvin and Heidi Toffler, authors of &quot;The Third Wave.&quot;  Once  the noted literary couple get off the  familiar theme of the hunter-farming  society yielding to the Industrial Revolution, which  yields in turn to  the Information Revolution, they are given to expressing alarmist environmental  and social concerns that make conservatives gnash their teeth. On the night  before the recent presidential election, Gingrich's class on the role of  volunteers in American public life, carried nationally on Mind Extention  University cable tv, included generous tributes to former President Jimmy  Carter and to handicapped activist Max Cleland, even though Cleland was  on the ballot the next day as a Democratic candidate for the US Senate  in Georgia (he won).</P>  <P>	Maury Kennedy, a businessman who took the Gingrich course a couple  of years ago and now markets the tapes, complains of the ethics charges,  &quot;I manage this course every day of the week and I fail to see what  partisan political benefit he (Gingrich) or anyone else gets out of it.&quot;  The course is not a political recruiting device. About 7500 people subscribe  to a newsletter that follows the course themes.</P>  <P>	This confirms what I suspected all along. Gingrich is accused of using  this non-profit course and the colleges where he taught it on behalf of  his partisan objectives, specifically those of his action organization,  GOPAC. The reality is closer to the reverse: he initially  used GOPAC and  his political connections to start an academic course that refines his  philosophical and academic interests. But there is nothing morally wrong  with that. </P>  <P>	It often is on the side of their virtues rather than their vices that  politicians fail to guard themselves, which is how they fall into the kind  of procedural mistakes with which Gingrich's political opponents would  like to ensnare him now. Particularly when you are dealing with a politician  who also is an intellectual, it often is impossible to separate the man  of action from the man of ideas. From the standpoint of public interest,  it is an error to try too hard to do so. </P>  <P>	There is some danger that Gingrich's college course will be used as  an excuse to further restrict use of tax exempt educational moneys, a move  with potential to throttle, rather than improve, public discourse. It would  be wiser to broaden tax deductibility to include legitimate educational  research  conducted by parties and elected officials. Why should Republicans  and Democrats be denied the advantages enjoyed by the Chamber of Commerce  Foundation or the Sierra Club? Why this cute game where you can call something  &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; and it's okay with the  professional ethicists, but calling it &quot;Repubican&quot; or &quot;Democrat&quot;  makes it unacceptable?</P>  <P>	Newt Gingrich may have been careless as he moved his intellectual pursuits  from the political to the educational realm, and he was right to apologize  for that.  But his was the kind of minor failure you must tolerate in a  leader or sacrifice the First Amendment--which, above all, protects political  speech--and the capacity of representative government to function effectively.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Bruce Chapman, a former Secretary of State in Washington  State and a Reagan Administration official, is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

<H3><CENTER>Microsoft suddenly sees itself beset by broadband rebels and
its own middle age</CENTER>
</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
GOLIATH IN THE VALE of Elah roared his contempt at the weapons and zeal
of David: &quot;Do you think me a dog that you contest me with sticks and
stones?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, the Goliath of software, sees himself simi-larly beset by zealous
rivals with risible weapons. Entering his modest second-floor office on
the edge of the Microsoft campus on a twilight evening in late November,
I find him irked and addled by what he sees as a siege of slingshots from
irrational media and capital markets in his industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft entered November on an autumnal blaze of upside news-earnings
up 53%, sales up 63%, a double gi-gabuck quarter. But now, amazingly, people
were speaking of a &quot;crisis&quot; at Microsoft. &quot;That's an emotional
word,&quot; says Gates, twisting uncomfortably in his chair. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH when Netscape came on with 9,000 lines of code for a World
Wide Web browser that took six weeks to build and that was given away free,
and people began talking of his company's downfall. Gates had pulled that
trick himself in 1976, with a few thousand lines of code for the Basic programming
language for the PC and then again in 1980 with MS-DOS. But to do it to
Goliath seemed l&eacute;se-majest&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then comes Sun Microsystems with a new program-ming language called Java,
and people like me, who by Mi-crosoft standards don't know anything about
programming, who have never written a single line of code, presumed to tell
him about its virtues. It's safe, secure, interpreted, plat-form independent;
it collects your garbage (automatic garbage collection). It compiles as
if by incantation. It builds market cap as by magic. Give poor Bill a break.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Gates. &quot;I have to wonder who screwed
your head around....&quot; Oh, he knows, he knows. &quot;The In-ternet&quot;
makes everything different. You can make any claim you want, however bizarre
or ludicrous, that would ordi-narily be laughed off the stage, and if you
add the mantra &quot;on the Internet&quot; at the end you can morph yourself
from a typical media clown into a visionary, a prophet, a guru. &quot;Nobody
pauses to say, 'Huh?' &quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the analysts will nod and the market will bow. It's &quot;on the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One day in November, three days before my visit, Rick Sherlund, the Goldman
Sachs analyst who helped bring Microsoft public in 1986 and had touted the
stock for a decade, downgraded Microsoft's shares from buy to &quot;mod-erately
outperform&quot; on the basis of Internet incantations from Sun and Netscape.
Sherlund also replaced Microsoft with Netscape on his recommended list.
Indeed, Goliath's net worth was shrinking by the minute as Microsoft's mar-ket
cap sank by $9 billion, and Sun's and Netscape's surged by $9 billion in
a matter of weeks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does Bill Gates know Rick Sherlund, by any chance? Sure, Gates answers,
&quot;extremely well.&quot; &quot;He's your man, he's great,&quot; says
Gates, &quot;if you want to run a spreadsheet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this world of manias and emotions, &quot;I have to make rational decisions,&quot;
Gates says, glaring at me. &quot;Somebody who thinks that because of a browser
that anyone can clone, because of a language that is magic, they [Netscape
and Sun, the unmentionables] can overthrow the world-that person can't even
think two chess moves ahead. You're not even in the game I'm playing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, thinking forward a couple of moves, what is the big thing bearing
down on Microsoft on that road ahead? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's middle age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, in Redmond, they have another name for it. Throughout the company, wherever
you go-from hum-mus on pita bread at the cafeteria with a glib former Holly-wood
agent hired to handle publicity, to a Starbucks latte at the Microsoft model
&quot;home&quot; with software sage Rick Rashid incandescent on a couch,
or off to Rover's Restau-rant where Nathan Myhrvold spiels refulgently at
a cor-ner table through 12 courses of rococo &quot;fatware&quot; and my
two missed flights-the word is middleband. From the top down, Microsoft
is becoming a middleband company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates, Myhrvold, James Allchin, Craig Mundie- nearly anyone in Redmond will
step you through it. The future is not broadband, not narrow-band; it is
some middle way. It takes Excel and Word and Pow-erPoint presentation graphics
and multimedia CD-ROMs and the new Video ROMs-indeed all the front and back
Office suites that are the core of the company, all the teeming tow-ers
of legacy code-and attaches that to the Internet. It's Encarta and Baseball
and digital TV all tied to the Web over middle-band circuits. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates explains: &quot;We will translate Encarta into many lan-guages and
make it a front end to the Internet, so that when-ever you look up a topic
in the encyclopedia, we can link you into what there is in the Inter-net
on that topic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the Internet is not fast enough when you just want to go pure
Internet, so every year you can buy the CD that holds the bulk of the material.&quot;
It will be a middleband world. I see the millennium at hand: People are
all queu-ing up at Egghead for their Encarta update CDs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From Gates on down, however, Microsoft leaders do grasp the essence of the
change. Myhrvold trenchantly points out that communications standards no
longer rise from the center out, from the LAN to the WAN. They be-gin on
the Net and move inward to the LAN and transform it. &quot;The LAN is dead,&quot;
as Myhrvold says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these same Microsoft leaders seem to believe that the transforming power
of the Net stops short of the PC and operating system. Sun will set, but
Windows will open wide on the World Wide Web (up to ISDN speeds). After
all, as Allchin puts it, &quot;We see the Internet as an extension of the
operating system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask Gates how we can have a middleband world in the face of a rising tide
of bandwidth. Gates in the past has spo-ken of virtually &quot;infinite
bandwidth.&quot; But he does not see it today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty years from now we will have broadband in homes, he explains, but
until then middleband is the best you can expect. Indeed, in his presentation
to the press the week after my visit, on December 7, he strangely declared
&quot;broad-band is the holy grail, [but] it's much further away than ever
before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask about cable modems. But to Gates, cable modems are mere middleband:
&quot;Don't get me wrong-you can do a lot in middleband. But cable is a
shared medium. Cable modems are middleband. You get 10 megabits per second
and share it with 500 homes and you are back to ISDN speeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, I protest, Netscape has a different view. It has joined with @Home
(the Kleiner Perkins-TCI joint venture) to supply browsers and servers for
a new scalably broadband Internet based on cable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates's voice reaches a new pitch. &quot;I assure you Netscape has no relationship
with @Home that Microsoft does not have. I didn't spend three years talking
with John Malone for nothing three years with Bruce Ravenel [Tele-Communications
Technology Ventures' senior vice-president and chief operating officer].
In the first place, browsers are trivial. We will have cable browsers. And
we will have cable servers. We will do anything with @Home that Netscape
does.&quot; After all, TCI Technology Ventures invested $125 million in
MSN (Microsoft Network). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it went in the Redmond gloaming. I deeply admire Gates. The guts to leave
Harvard at the end of his junior year and launch a new industry; the tenacity
to build it into a planetary utility; the audacity and ingenuity of the
original deal with IBM; the entrepreneurial confidence to cut loose from
OS/2. The vision to be the only major software company to embrace Macintosh
and save Apple by en-dowing the Mac with the leading GUI spreadsheet and
word processor, Excel and Word, while at the same time gaining the graphics
skills to create Windows. The bold challenge to Unix through Windows NT.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that Gates has been the exemplary business leader of our
era. Compared with the leaders of IBM, heavy with &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here)
and degrees in business administration and finance, who could not even grasp
the concept of sunk costs or the rule of self-cannibalization well enough
to burke OS/2, who could not even see the huge opportunity to embrace the
Mac OS, Gates is indeed a giant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A week later, in an announcement emblazoned in Com-puterworld as &quot;Capitulation,&quot;
Gates showed his superiority to the NIH syndrome at IBM. He declared that
he was licensing Sun's Java Internet animation language, in which he seemed
suddenly to have discovered new virtues, and was essentially abandoning
Microsoft Network as a proprietary paid service. It would serve as an attractive
Inter-net entry point, open to all, with content and advertising prepared
with anyone's available software. Beyond that, Microsoft announced an array
of impressive-sounding new Internet products: Blackbird publication tools
for the Net; Gibraltar Internet server products four times as fast as Netscape's;
Visual Basic as a scripting language for the Net already far easier and
more familiar than Java; upgrades of current Word versions that allow direct
creation of HTML documents; and an array of other announcements. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But all the brave talk, the bestselling book, the stilted TV appearances,
the an-nouncement of a news channel with NBC, the stream of new products,
the bold embrace of an In-ternet strategy, the spread of Windows 95, could
not disguise the rising confu-sion in Redmond. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden, Gates seemed to have lost his bearings. The man who elbowed
aside an on-air Connie Chung as if she were a bothersome gnat and shunned
NBC as a nuisance, now was clutch-ing the old network, of all things, as
a source of news and investing in it, as if it had a future. It was as if
old NBC with its Max Headrooms of smiling anchor faces and two-minute splashes
of &quot;news&quot; could morph into an in-formation resource simply by
invoking the mantra &quot;on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in his long romance with Warren Buffett, Gates seemed to be reaching
out to old money, power and pres-tige to bolster his company as it whirled
in the vortex that he had described as the &quot;Internet tidal wave.&quot;
It was as if he no longer trusted the PC to sustain his growth as an $8
billion revenue company, as if he needed sustenance from mass media. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Netscape, Sun, @Home and other firms, Silicon Valley is in the ascendant
again. But the software colossus is still losing ground on the road ahead,
so Gates pivots on his peerless pinnacle simultaneously at the summit of
the New York Times bestseller list and the Forbes 400 and looks back with
a Macaulay Culkin smile from the cover of a book that is mostly news of
yesterday. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I N T E L   O U T S I D E ? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, back in Silicon Valley from the Vale of Elah, I visit Goliath's
prime mover, Andrew Grove of Intel. With revenues more than twice as large
as Micro-soft's and a price/earnings ratio less than half as high, and commanding
the world's most awesome manufactur-ing facilities for the world's most
complex and portentous product, Intel seems to stand on firmer foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove opens the meeting with jokes about the &quot;tunnel of death&quot;
that perpetually menaces his industry in the pages of the media. Ensconced
in a small open cubicle on the fifth floor of the Robert Noyce headquarters
in Santa Clara at the heart of Silicon Valley, with &quot;Intel Inside&quot;
inscribed on the roof to enlighten the planes from nearby San Jose In-ternational
Airport, Grove effervesces wit and irony and bonhomie where Gates seethed
sarcasm and defensiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Grove, there is no longing for canonization by old money, no sell-sign
craving for the sickly glamour of Hol-lywood and TV, no fashionable yearning
for business in &quot;content.&quot; Grove grasps that the PC is the ascendant
force in the global culture of capitalism and that the Internet consummates
the PC. Nonetheless, asked about the possibility of the teleputer-the $500
Internet PC-freed from the coils of Wintel, he echoes Gates in a cele-bration
of current PC culture that somehow misses the point. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove associates the teleputer with dumb or static appliances, from set-top
boxes to PDAs, in the catalog of PC sub-species that emerged in hype as
substitute PCs. Most of them sold a few hundred thousand units, and then
expired. &quot;The new device will be produced and it too will sell a few
hundred thousand units. But not 10 million units,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Forbes ASAP editor Rich Karlgaard and I prepare to leave his office,
he asks us to guess the cycle rate of the up-coming '96 basic home-based
PC. I suggest 100 megahertz. Grove shakes his head. He confides that he
is headed for a meeting to decide whether the 1996 PC will bear a 120- megahertz
or a 133-megahertz Pentium. &quot;Everyone un-derestimates the progress
of PCs,&quot; he says with satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could fix on a special-purpose device today, to satisfy Larry
Ellison's mother [who wants a simpler PC], but by the time it came out,
the PC will have moved on, powered by incomparably more potent microprocessors,
leaving the new machine trivialized and obsolete in its wake.&quot; In other
words, evolutionary products will suffice in this revolutionary time of
exponentially expanding Nets and peripheral CPUs. Nonetheless, moving a
few miles north on California's Route 101, out of the hypergravita-tional
fields of Philistea, one can still feel a radical shift-ing in the spheres
of possibility. &quot;And David took his staff in his hand and chose him
five smooth stones.&quot; I Samuel 17:40 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR THE NEW ORDER, the ultrawideband wireless Sand Hill slingshot-the capitalist
conjurer of the forces causing new sleeplessness in Seattle-is John Doerr
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Shunning Herb Allen's summits of
schmooze, where the entrepreneurial big-time is an &quot;au-dacious&quot;
investment in Coke or NBC, Doerr epitomizes the venture capitalist as industrial
demiurge. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As technology investor Roger McNamee puts it: &quot;While other venture
capitalists say, 'Let's start a company,' John says, 'Let's start an industry.'
&quot; So far, beginning at Intel in the early years, he has played a key
role in launching in-dustries in electronic design automation, RISC workstations,
personal computers, financial software, multimedia and wire-less pen appliances
(well, let that last one pass). His current new industry will be the biggest
yet. It is broadband Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From the vertiginous launch of Sun, Lotus and Compaq in the early 1980s
to a fund gush-ing Go at pens, his career has seen several peaks and valleys.
Doerr has even dallied with middle age. He once weighed a mid-life retreat
from the madding bustle of Silicon Val-ley to contemplate the Tantra or
the Tao: &quot;I sometimes think,&quot; Doerr told the New York Times in
1987, &quot;I would like to become a Buddhist monk.&quot; Sure, John. But,
tell me, what yoga discipline was he brewing two years ago in Palo Alto,
at breakfast at Il Fornaio head-to-head with Jim Clark? What karmic rites
was he conjuring with Clark and Bill Joy in the winter of 1994 on a three-hour
conference call among wildernesses of Marriott on the road? What karass
was he kenning in December 1994 among the tacky booths and bins, the barkers
and indoor bikinis at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim? What tables were
tipping in January 1995 in his Woodside home, among pizzas and pastas with
his wife, Anne, and Marc Andreessen, Bill Joy, Andy Bech-tolsheim, Jim Gosling
and Rick Schell (Netscape's VP of engineering)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why, in early 1995, was he lurking around the NASA Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif.? Is he seeking evidence of alien
IPOs, or just some hard-core Unix Christian libertarian netbender from outer
space to levitate a new industry in Palo Alto? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T venturer Thomas Judge told Forbes ASAP's Nancy Rutter in 1993:
&quot;You have to be on the fringes to make money in [Doerr's] business,
and that's where he is.&quot; Follow Doerr, however, from day to day, call
to call, from Sun to Oracle to America Online to Netscape to Macro-mind,
and you will find yourself at the fringes just as they invert into the Zen
center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A lean figure, with blondish hair, a cowlick and horn-rims, Doerr at 44
is as bashfully all-business and freneti-cally bitwise as Gates whom he
resembles, but he is still flouting the gravity of middle age. On a crisp
Sunday in mid-December, I catch up with him at Buck's restaurant, near his
home in Woodside in Silicon Valley. Wearing a dark suit from church, he
checks for messages on his Skytel pager, greets fellow venturer Bill Davidow
passing by and then opens a black briefcase full of technotoys. From across
the restaurant, this venture colossus looks to be a frowsy salesman perhaps
a little desperate to present his wares. He removes a Mac Power-Book 5300
and Sony speakers and lays them out on the table. Amid empty latte glasses
and plates of ravioli pesto and his own half-eaten hamburger, Doerr is ready
to give a demo of the new industry-a fore-cast for next year's Netscape-style
IPO. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a minute or so to boot up the Mac, checking through the 32 megabytes
of RAM (teleputers, Doerr says, will boot up instantly from flash ROM).
But from there on out, it is all immediate grati-fication. Click to ignite
a Java Web page with streaming stockmarket data, a c/net talking- head newscaster
and a vocano video from Venezuela. &quot;Wow, look at that new PowerBook
go,&quot; exults a jolly woman observing from the next table. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Doerr is on a rush through a world of his own. Click again and you have
the Sunnyvale Sun, efflorescent with vivid speech, sports clips and classified
personals. Newspapers will be hot on the broadband Internet. Click on the
classifieds and you can presumably meet their makers in living color. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a glimpse of @Home, a mere demo of Doerr's new broadband Internet
company. As the service develops you will soon be able to download movies
and other pro-grams on demand. Over 28.8 modems or even 128-kilobit-per-
second ISDN lines, all such dynamic fare would be ag-onizingly slow to access.
By contrast, Doerr says, in @Home everything is instant, full motion and
always on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How can this be, you ask, on an essentially middleband Internet? &quot;That's
the genius of Milo Medin, @Home's net-work chief,&quot; he explains, &quot;linked
to the genius of Marc An-dreessen of Netscape.&quot; NASA Ames's network
king, Medin is now building a scalable, extensible architecture for a cable-based
World Wide Web. With some help, I might add, from John Doerr and his five
smooth stones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B R E A K I N G   W I N D O W S   A N D   B O T T L E N E C K S <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, four of the five companies-Sun, Netscape, Macromind and Intuit-Doerr
estimates, &quot;have added more than $10 billion to their market cap in
the last six months because of their Internet initiatives,&quot; this new
model of computing based on the Web, while Microsoft lost a similar total
by briefly resisting it. Now @Home is on target to generate another multibillion
market cap by exploding the current bandwidth bottlenecks of the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At Intel, Doerr worked at a desk down a corridor from Bruce Ravenel. Then
an architect of the 8086 and the 8087, Ravenel is now TCI Technology Ventures'
influential chief of technology. Igniting the fuse for @Home were words
between Doerr and Ravenel as the two old grads from &quot;Noyce-Moore U&quot;
wove their way through the Western Cable Show in the first week of December
1994. &quot;I dare not call it an epiphany,&quot; Doerr says, &quot;but
Bruce and I were at the Motorola booth where they were showing off a sleek
little $300 box the size of a modem that would enable telephone calls over
a cable line. 'What would it cost,' I asked, 'to add an Ethernet port to
the device, so you could link a computer to the Internet through it at up
to 10 megabits per sec-ond? ' When the Motorola guy guessed, 'Maybe $30,'
our eyes got as big as saucers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Doerr sees a hole in the line, he hits it hard and fast. Two weeks
later, four days before Christmas 1994, he was in John Malone's office in
Denver presenting a plan for a Silicon Valley startup to bring broadband
Internet over cable. Likely IPO market value in two years? $3 billion. Malone
also hits hard and fast. After a three-hour meeting, the TCI chief signed
off on the venture with-out a qualm. Doerr's chief job was to &quot;line
up some unique Silicon Valley technical genius to make it work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tapping Internet experts at Sun and around the Valley, Doerr found only
one name popping up on every list. It was that hard-core Unix Christian
libertarian netbender from outer space, Milo Medin. A 32-year-old wunderkind
manager of the multiple networks converging at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Medin had spent the last 12 years making increasingly
crucial contributions to the Internet's growth. But uh-oh. For a week or
more, Medin refused to answer any calls from Kleiner Perkins. He says, &quot;I
thought they were a bunch of lawyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DOERR WAS ATTACKING the key problem of the Internet. With the number of
host computers doubling every year since 1970 and the power of the computers
doubling every 18 months, the Internet had mastered every challenge of capacity
by multiplying cheap local routers and servers. The Net has already overtaken
the U.S. Postal Service as a carrier of mail (by one estimate, a trillion
e-mail messages compared with 180 billion postal deliveries). And the Net
similarly has pushed the number of digital data bits ahead of the total
of voice bits on the phone system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last two years, however, the traffic has taken a turn toward GIFs
and graphics, doubling the number of bits every few months. As the Internet
careens toward its destined collisions with television and telephony as
the prime sources of information, entertainment and commu-nication for the
public, the prime obstacle is bandwidth. Many in the industry have begun
to blink and bluster in the bright light of optical media and other broadband
pipes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Led by Bill Gates, they believe in middleband and ISDN. They dabble defen-sively
in TV. As a shared medium, even cable, so Gates contends, will dwin-dle
to ISDN rates as the number of customers on the system rises. But at 128-kilobit-per-sec-ond
or even at 1.54- megabit-per-second T1 rates, ISDN means picture quality
inferior to NTSC television. A shared medium linked to slow routers means
bottlenecks throughout the system if cable modems yield a thou-sandfold
increase in bit traffic beyond existing modems (up from 28.8 kilobits to
close to 30 megabits per second). On-line services will bog down in slow
access, sticky searches, jerky movement, blurred faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such a middleband net will not be able to maintain its current momentum
of growth and power. It will not be able to challenge television and telephony.
Yet the valuations of Internet companies depend on a continued exponential
ascent. Thus many people believe the Net is overhyped, overvalued, starved
for &quot;content.&quot; They believe Doerr's broadband revolution will
fail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Milo Medin is Doerr's weapon to break the bottleneck. He has spent most
of his adult life overcoming crises on the Net. Medin's fast rise began
in 1987 when he led the creation of NASA's Internet and almost came to an
end in 1993, when the swarthy Serb with the spruce mustache and the piping
voice and broadband gush had barged into Washington to persuade the entire
government to em-brace the Internet protocols (TCP/IP). Fueled by this uni-versal
language, the Net had grown exponentially up a wall of worry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problems did not reach critical mass until 1994, however, when its traffic
began doubling every couple of months. Andreessen's Mosaic browser had spurred
the World Wide Web into a multiterabyte cyclone of growth and expansion,
concentrated in California. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the entire Internet converged in one room in one building at Ames.
On one side of the room were the Cisco 7000 routers and Digital gigaswitches
and Northern Telecom add-drop multiplexers of the FIX (the Federal In-ternet
Exchange), the government peering-and-exchange point, managed mostly by
Medin. On the other side was MAE West, the Internet access exchange point
for most of the private Internet, including the pullulating college and
university Nets, the regnant Internet service providers such as ANS and
Sprint, and the budding local fiefdoms of Netcom and The Well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in April 1994, the government ended its $25 million in annual Internet
subsidies and arranged for a private takeover. Among the winning bidders
were Pac-Bell and Ameritech, assigned to run two key network ac-cess points
(NAPs). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long expecting the withdrawal of government subsi-dies to throw the Net
into chaos, many observers would welcome the ensuing crash. The private
sector would flub the job. There would be a tragedy of the commons. As in
feudal Britain, when the commonly owned lands were overgrazed and ruined,
the commonly owned Internet would suffer a glut of graphics &quot;GIFraff&quot;
and traffic jams. Sure enough it was happening. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PacBell's ATM switches from Newbridge Networks, with skimpy buffers designed
like a PBX for voice-traffic pat-terns, choked. California, the source of
two-fifths of In-ternet traffic, was down. The Western NAP jammed, and Ameritech's
Chicago NAP was also largely out of commis-sion. Bay Area e-mail from a
student on Netcom to a small business on BBN's BARNet had to steer clear
of the Ames hub and pinball through routers all the way across the country
to Sprint's NAPs in Pennsauken, N.J., or Reston, Va., and then all the way
back again. As a result, the Eastern Inter-net hubs also began to tilt.
An obvious solution seemed to be to have FIX West, the government hub at
Ames, take over the traf-fic that was fleeing the Pacific Bell NAP. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Savvy residents of Silicon Valley, the Ames management was sympathetic.
Then Medin gained the blessing of NSF networking chief Steve Wolff and enlisted
Jack Waters at MCI, a crucial Internet backbone supplier that no longer
used its PacBell connection. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Within two weeks, Medin created a system comparable in capacity and reliability
to the original FIX, with expanded Net management capabilities, power supplies,
communications ports and routing facilities. The result was a broadband
national peer-ing- and-exchange point, with a cumulative capacity of some
10 gigabits per second. It combined traffic from all the major commercial
Internet suppliers with the bitstreams from government laboratories and
agencies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, throughout this period of crisis and turbu-lence, no ordinary
Internet customer experienced any un-toward deterioration of service. Although
Medin's contri-bution was only part of a major national effort, he became
the talk of the Net. Doerr had to sign him up. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AS DOERR SUMS IT UP, &quot;Milo was running the largest IP net in the federal
government. When they decided to set up a White House.gov Web site, they
asked where to put it. They put it on Milo's server. Milo helped run the
fiber ring around Moscow. Internet connections for Australia and Antarctica
and for deep space probes ran through Milo. He was supplying IP connectivity
for the entire Scandinavian subcontinent. He had some 200 remote nodes.
And he ran it all with some 99.98% uptime.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
@Home CEO Will Hearst of Kleiner Perkins likes to tell a story that gives
some clues as to how this young Net nerd from NASA became a legend in his
own time: &quot;In 1988, a Finn-call him Lars-hacks his way into Milo's
comput-ers. Ticks Milo off. He does a trace route and finds his way back
to the administrator of the domain in Finland. It's an academic site. Milo
already knows Lars's IP address. You can't hide from Milo. He says to the
administrator, 'We have a problem. Please have a conversation with Lars.'
That upset the Finns, who say, 'We are not going to do that! We respect
civil liberties here! You can post a complaint if you like, but we can't
tell the guy what to do.' So Milo goes into a slow boil. Says, 'I'll give
you about 30 minutes to get that guy's files off our machine.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing happens. So Milo issues an order: 'Take down Scandinavia.'
The switch is pulled. Three countries go dark. They don't notice it immediately,
but pretty soon e-mail messages are not getting returned. At last, three
senior administrators go to Lars, so the story goes, and they say: 'We don't
care if you hack into the CIA; we don't care if you bring down NSA; and
we don't mind if you abscond with all the financial bits in the Federal
Reserve. But don't mess with Milo at NASA.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Finns called back Milo, said the situation had been taken care
of. Milo said fine and put the service back up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOW DOERR and Medin are again confronting the perennial doomsday adven-tists
who gather on mountaintops of slightly older money and disparage the future
of the Net, talking crisis, over-load, overhype, overvaluation. Tragedy
of the Commons. The experts are chiming in. From Howard Anderson of the
Yankee Group to Andrew Seybold and Bob Metcalfe, lead-ing analysts are prophesying
a crash in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin has been there before. The answer to traffic jams on a narrowband
Net is creation of a broadband Net. Don't tell him it is not technically
possible. Who are you kidding? This is the age of the telecosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, though, thinks it is the age of middleband. It is obvious beyond
cavil to Gates that his regime, ruling 80% of the world's computers, is
destined to prevail. He commands a market share so overwhelming that Wash-ington's
antitrusters see it as a monopoly in need of gov-ernment dissolution. For
Gates, among the most ludicrous claims to be validated by the mantra &quot;on
the Internet,&quot; is the idea that Windows machines are an inferior minority
system difficult to digest in the prevailing habitat of Unix and TCP/IP.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Medin, however, it is a matter of simple fact that Win-dows and NT are
awkward systems, hard to incorporate in his domains except as mere terminals.
To Medin, Unix is the heart of the Internet, the matrix of creativity in
net-working, the bearer of thousands of programs and services and tools
and scripts and languages that together comprise the pullulating fabric
of the rampantly growing Web. So far, Medin has a strong case. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sixty percent of the managers of Internet host comput-ers use Macintoshes
as their preferred personal machine. On the Internet, as a platform for
servers, whether for the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher or
NeWS, Microsoft's favored NT now ranks seventh, with a 4% share, behind
Sun, which commands a 56% share, Apple, Silicon Graphics, IBM, Digital Equip-ment
and Windows 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Around the time that Gates was assuring me of Microsoft's impregnable position
with @Home, Medin was reviewing the Seattle company's software concepts
for his new network. The @Home people wanted to adopt Microsoft's Explorer
browser if they could (TCI fa-vored its interactive TV ally), but it was
simply impossible. Explorer ran on neither Unix nor Macs, and could not
handle mul-ticasting. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's browser already worked with all the existing systems, including
the various Windows. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of Marc Andreessen, who had learned net-working in the
broadband 45- megabit-per-second environment of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Netscape had long ago left behind all
the comforts of middleband. Andreessen was eager for broadband con-nections.
Gates was not even in the game that Medin and Andreessen were playing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All right, suppose that &quot;browsers are a trivial tech-nology,&quot;
as Gates told me dismissively. It was servers that Microsoft really wanted
to sell to @Home. Their Gibral-tar system was running Microsoft's somewhat
balky inter-nal Internet at a pace some four times faster than Netscape's
server might. Here, Microsoft benefited from its homogeneous cam-pus environment.
Netscape had to employ the &quot;union&quot; code-using the lowest-common-denominator
instructions to coordinate several varieties of Unix, Mac and Windows NT.
Meanwhile, Microsoft could optimize Gibraltar for all the most powerful
instructions in Windows NT, so it was much faster. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the @Home people were perplexed. How could they use Windows NT, an alien
system on the Internet, unfa-miliar to their employees or to the Internet
service-provider personnel who would work the @Home headends and oth-er
nodes? Microsoft was behaving in the Internet environ-ment as if the company
were still safe in the imperial realms of Windows desktops. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So @Home, which promises to be the most important force in the next phase
of Internet evolution, and Medin, the intellectual firebrand at the heart
of @Home, seem un-likely to embrace Microsoft's offerings. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MILO'S DARK SHADOW OVER MICROSOFT <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As for TCI, its enthusiasm was dented a bit by the collapse of the MSN project,
in which Malone invested $125 mil-lion. But TCI has recouped its loss. Jim
Clark was persuaded to offer TCI a small share of the Netscape IPO. After
the initial public offering and the subsequent boom in Net-scape shares,
TCI's holding was worth $125 million, leav-ing TCI quite comfortable with
its new allies in Moun-tain View. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A deeper look at Medin's plans casts darker shadows in the path of Microsoft.
Asked about the notion of an Internet computer being free of Windows and
other Mi-crosoft levies, Gates stops rocking on his chair and gets to his
feet. He turns and paces urgently back and forth across his office. He gestic-ulates,
summons the history of past challenges, refers repeatedly to dumb termi-nals
and other unappetizing machines, and hurls forth rhetorical questions: &quot;Do
you want to go onto the Internet when you are doing word pro-cessing, do
you want to go on the Internet when you are using PowerPoint or Excel?&quot;
In other words, do you want to forgo all the wonderful new OLE interactions
among Microsoft programs and all the new Microsoft hot links and other forthcoming
tools when you go on the Net? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the pressure of Gates's energy and conviction and hypotheticals, I
answer, &quot;Of course not.&quot; But the real answer is, &quot;Sure, if
in exchange I can have a computer that outperforms a current Wintel machine
on the Net and con-tains linking capabilities comparable to OLE for one-third
the price.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates himself sketched out the answer in his famous In-ternet Tidal Wave
memo, issued in May to galvanize his company in the face of the new threat.
He pointed out that not only could he access far more information on the
In-ternet, he could also find, search and browse it more read-ily on the
Net than on a LAN or, for that matter, he might have pointed out, Gates's
own hard drive or CD-ROM. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The error of all the critics of the $500 teleputer is their assumption that
it will be inferior to current PCs. It will be, they claim, a PC minus a
fast CPU, short a high-reso-lution monitor, without a fast memory or large
drive. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This assumption misses the compounding impact of mi-crocosm and telecosm.
The advance of chip technology through Moore's Law, together with the advance
of net-work bandwidth, will endow a machine not inferior but hugely more
powerful, than the most supercharged Pentium workstation on a local-area
network linked to the Internet at ISDN speeds. The Law of the Microcosm
ordains that one-chip sys-tems will be better, not worse, than intersecting
boards strewn with devices linked by wires and buses. As Wilf Cor-rigan,
chief of LSI Logic, observes, &quot;From calculators to cellular phones,
every time a system has moved onto a sin-gle chip, it has wreaked havoc
with the existing industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IN PREPARING THE WAY for one-chip teleputers, Medin con-cedes that the current
Inter-net will not support broadband services. &quot;You link a broad-band
modem to the existing Internet and what you get is an impedance mismatch&quot;-a
bunch of fire hoses attached to a network of garden hoses. In order to accommodate
the fire hoses of @Home, Medin will have to enlarge the band-width of the
Net, from the humblest service provider to the NAPs at the top of the net-work
hierarchy, where the leading service providers join to &quot;peer and exchange&quot;
data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leasing capacity from the telephone companies, @Home will create a new broadband
network linking to the existing NAPs at MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
at the Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, N.J., and at MAE West in Mountain View.
This will expand the capacity of the so-called Internet back-bone (in fact,
an ever-shifting array of virtual vertebrae), which currently works with
maximum pipes running at 45 megabits per second. Over the next two years,
Medin plans to upgrade his backbone to 622 megabits a second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important and revolutionary, though, are Medin's plans for the local
loops and service providers of the Net. Contrary to the claims of many critics
that the Internet PC implies a return to the now-discredited model of the
main-frame and dumb terminals, @Home resolutely distributes intelligence
and memory through the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the @Home system is ingenious hierar-chical memory management
and caching to conceal the mazes of slow routers, sluggish switches and
narrowband wires that lurk treacherously among the higher reaches of the
Internet. Indeed, when Doerr finally got through to Medin and, with Will
Hearst, first proposed cable modems to him, he said they wouldn't work.
There would be &quot;im-pedance mismatches&quot; with the hardware and software
in the rest of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of blew the air out of their tires,&quot; says Medin. &quot;But
then I told them how the system could work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to think of it as a distributed computer sys-tem. In such
systems, every processor cannot access memory at once. You build caches
and shared-memory pro-tocols and you mirror and replicate a lot of the data
so that it's always available locally. That's what you're going to have
to do on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the Internet is a computer on a plan-et. Like a computer
on a chip, its raw bandwidth cannot handle the necessary throughput. Thus
its communica-tions depend on ingenious hierarchical memory manage-ment,
with registers, buffers, latches, caches and direct-memory access controllers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Studies of Internet use show that some 80% of the traffic is still local.
If a particular Web page is popular in a particular locality, you have to
have that page in the hard drive or even in RAM on a local server. You have
to use the multicast ca-pabilities of cable to broadcast popular information
to all ad-dresses. Above all, you have to make the system scalable. You
have to phase in bandwidth, moving fiber links and nodes deeper into neighborhoods
as demand rises. All this is per-fectly possible technically, Medin assured
Doerr. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After I was through, they decided they had to hire me. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still thought we would have to build all the software ourselves.
I didn't know Netscape was thinking the same way. But I went down to Netscape
and got together with Marc Andreessen, who is a friend, and we had a real
mind-meld on all this stuff. They were doing the software already. Netscape
became our main software partner. It turned out that their browser is de-signed
for multicast. And their proxy server is great for caching information and
delivering it to users on demand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin thinks that a key to making the system work is to distribute lots
of cache through all the local points of presence. With this kind of network,
the teleputer might become not only far cheaper but also far superior to
today's PC. A now famous Gartner Group study shows that the average office
PC costs $40,000 over five years when you factor in software and network
maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 75% of cumulative PC costs now come from staff support. @Home will
supply tech support, mainte-nance and storage more efficiently, whether
centrally by phone or at local headends. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a glimpse of the future, visit Boston College, where cable modems supplied
by Continental Cablevision are already becoming &quot;addictive&quot; to
many students and professors. On the basis of this experience, Forrester
Re-search is now predicting sales of some 7 million cable modems by the
turn of the century. Medin thinks this es-timate is conservative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With cable modems you will come to demand wireless connectivity throughout
your home or small office, so that your teleputers can link to the Net wherever
they are with-out plugging them in to a connector or dialing up a connection.
Only cable can accomodate such demands. &quot;Internet PCs fit with @Home
like ice cream and hot fudge,&quot; sums up Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the big question: Is it possible to build such a machine? &quot;Sure
it is,&quot; says Medin. &quot;Just take a Sony PlayStation, essentially
based on a one-chip ASIC, and re-place the CD-ROM connec-tor with an Ethernet
adapter. You'll get 3D graphics, Dol-by III sound, a 30-megahertz CPU controller,
a memory-access controller, and a 10-megabit-per-second 10BaseT link to
your cable headend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C O N S T E R N A T I O N    I N S I D E    I N T E L <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the new paradigm be-gins to threaten the cause and complacency not
only of Bill Gates but also of the other master of Wintel, Andy Grove. When
I ask him about such an ASIC so-lution to the problem of the $500 PC, consternation
breaks briefly through the surface of his bonhomie. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He snaps: &quot;I won't comment on the fantasies of Brian Halla,&quot; the
former Intel manager now executive vice-president of product marketing at
LSI Logic. Yet LSI Logic offers precisely Medin's PlayStation so-lution
to the problem of cheap teleputers, free of Wintel code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LSI Logic is the supplier of the workhorse chip for the PlayStation. Using
some 2 million transistors, this integrated chip combines a 30- megahertz
Silicon Graphics MIPS processor, a 60-MIPS geometry transfer engine, a direct-mem-ory
access unit, and Sony's proprietary MDEC device (for hybrid MPEG and JPEG
decompression) for full-screen video playback. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a Netstation, the MDEC would be replaced with the appropriate decompression
engines, and added to those would be Reed-Solomon and Viterbi error correction
to-gether with a cable modem module that receives 64-QAM signals and sends
QPSK. Based on its experience with the PlayStation chip, which LSI Logic
will be producing in volume on the world's first commercial 0.25-micron
fab-rication lines, LSI Logic estimates that it could sell a tele-puter
on a chip for around $50 in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This machine is the consummation of a long LSI Logic strategy. In the mid-1980s,
the company suffered a serious crisis as NEC, Fujitsu and Toshiba all opened
fast-turnaround design centers in the U.S. to deliver high-speed, high-density
gate arrays. At the same time, LSI launched a spinoff, Headland Tech-nology,
to make chipsets for PCs in competition with Chips &amp; Technologies and
VLSI Technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Supporting Headland,&quot; says Halla, &quot;was like walk-ing around
with an open artery. Intel remorselessly sucks out all the margins in PC
hardware.&quot; Chastened by the Japanese in gate ar-rays, LSI learned from
Grove not to take on Intel in PC markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To a company special-izing in gate arrays and chipsets, these lessons were
not inspiring. Then Wilf Corrigan, LSI's salty founder and CEO-a Silicon
Valley legend from Liverpool who previously played key roles at Fairchild
and Motorola-underwent a triple bypass. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People talked of retiring him, giving him a title with a new consortium,
U.S. Memories, where he might have learned not to compete with the Koreans
in DRAMs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after surgery, however, Corrigan returned to work at LSI and developed
a new strategy that would transcend the strategies of both Intel and the
Japanese. Under the new plan, LSI built state-of-the-art fabrication facilities
and design tools that could enable creation of a software library of &quot;Core-Ware.&quot;
CoreWare programs would generate a large variety of key functions, from
CPU kernels to signal processors and graphics engines, that could be deployed
in weeks on single special-purpose chips tailored to high-volume applications
mostly outside the Wintel ambit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By 1995, this strategy was bearing rich fruit. The com-pany announced it
had developed a fab process that could place some 49 million transistors
on a single sliver of silicon some 200 millimeters square. LSI released
a series of bellwether high-volume devices that moved the company beyond
the path of the PC, out into the network and into the consumer appliance.
The Sony PlayStation chip ran 1995's most successful CD game machine. LSI's
MPEG-2 decoder will go in the next version of RCA-Thomson's hugely successful
direct-broadcast satellite receiver. LSI also sup-plied the first ATM segmentation
and reassembly chip for several key equipment companies, and the first 100-megabit
switched-Ethernet solution for a fast Ethernet pioneer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking beyond Intel, this experience led Corrigan and Halla to conclude
that their company commanded all the crucial CoreWare ready to deploy a
teleputer on a single device manufacturable in volume for about $50. Attesting
that Halla's view is not fantasy is the success of the Sony PlayStation,
now on sale for $299, leaving room to buy a monitor and still stay under
$500. LSI also has several as-yet-unannounced design wins for cable modem
chips aimed at the markets to be opened by @Home. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel's response to such capabilities is its currently embattled program
for native signal processing. NSP allows software implementation of real-time
functions performed in special-purpose hardware under the &quot;CoreWare&quot;
model. As Grove points out, DSPs and com-pression chips may be getting cheaper
all the time, but from Indeo video to Proshare teleconferencing to Intel's
new Vertical Blanking Interval webware, NSP comes free of charge-if you
are already buying a Pentium (and you prob-ably are). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But no sooner will the CPU suck in another real-time role than a new virtual
temptation will glimmer on the hori-zon. For reaching the ever-receding
real-time goals-from continuous speech recognition to 3D rendering-the Core-Ware
approach will prevail, at least until the arrival of the new super broadband
mediaprocessors from MicroUnity and other Silicon Valley firms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS on these far frontiers of tech-nology, John Doerr
will launch his five smooth stones as the foundation for a new industry.
With Intuit leading the move to Internet financial services, Netscape pioneering
Internet software, Macromind supplying the authoring tools for multimedia,
@Home providing the bandwidth and Sun offering Java and UltraSPARC, the
entente is on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps Doerr's most important stone is Sun. Asked to name the key influences
in TCI's shift toward the Net, John Malone mentions Doerr first, hesitates
and then stress-es the role of Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.
Relentlessly, year after year, McNealy would travel to Denver and give his
pitch to Malone: Buy sets of Sun servers and link them to your headends
in order to supply data services. At first Malone resisted. &quot;Two-way
data,&quot; he used to say, &quot;is not a business that I want to be in.&quot;
But as the Internet grew, McNealy's argument gained new force. In late 1994,
it triumphed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Malone now believes that two-way broadband com-munications is the heart
of his business. For a total in-vestment of less than $188 million, Doerr
claims @Home can launch a business yielding at least $500 million in cu-mulative
revenues by the year 2000. Later this year, the Sunnyvale system will be
up and running. Weeks later, depending on cooperation from other cable companies,
the entire state of Con-necticut will move onto broadband two-way cable.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that point, all the other cable companies will accelerate their dri-ve
to upgrade their facilities to ac-commodate the gold rush. By the turn of
the century, @Home hopes to extend service to all the major urban and suburban
centers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Sprint, TCI leads a cable group that is paying $2 billion for wireless
personal communications service (PCS) spectrum across the country. Through
New York-based Teleport Communications and other bypass providers, TCI and
other cable firms already command fiber-optic rings through most major metropolitan
areas. With cable providing broadband backhaul for PCS, @Home's founders
think the company will emerge as the backbone for a full-service digital
communications network, including high-resolution teleconferencing, on-demand
films and other pay-per-view video, local news and school listings, classi-fied
advertisements, World Wide Web resources, and mul-timedia programming. TCI
itself is furiously upgrading and streamlining all its billing systems to
accommodate this rich transactional environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Z E R O   M A R G I N A L    M A G I C <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, as Nathan Myhrvold ex-plains, is the extension of
the computer model of flat-rate pricing into the field of communications.
When you buy a PC, you purchase its MIPS and bits essentially at a flat
rate. The average cost per MIP or bit of memory you use is de-termined by
how much you use the machine. The marginal cost is zero. As a result, people
have a powerful incentive to use computers as intensively and creatively
as possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This flat-rate pricing effect-where incremental costs are essentially zero-largely
explains the huge success of the general-purpose PC and the companies supplying
it with software and peripherals. Faced with a zero marginal cost of incremental
use, PC owners channel as much of their information processing, education
and entertainment as possible through the PC. Flat-rate pricing makes the
PC a dire threat to all contiguous industries and related functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, on the Internet model, you will pay a flat rate for bandwidth.
Again marginal costs will be zero. Average cost will respond to the extent
of usage rather than to a Public Utilities Commission tariff or some per-minute
charge. As Myhrvold points out, this approach will give you a tremendous
incentive to exploit bandwidth as fully as you can, channeling as much communication
as possible away from systems that charge incrementally and toward flat-rate
systems. In the end, nearly all communications will gravitate toward the
Internet model, and companies will prosper to the extent that they can ally
themselves with this tremendous force of creativity and economy.<BR>

Myhrvold now says that bandwidth is growing at the same pace as Moore's
Law. Gates, too, though long alert to the effects of exponentials in semiconductors,
is strange-ly blind to the faster trajec-tory of communications. He finds
the Internet a big sur-prise: &quot;Who predicted it?&quot; he asks. &quot;Let's
find the guy and make him king.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But by any measure- nodes, total bandwidth, traf-fic- the Internet has been
dou-bling every year since 1970, and many people have pre-dicted that it
would come to dominate communications. I prophesied in 1989 that it would
usurp television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I believe the band-width tidal wave will sweep away the notions of
Gates and Myhrvold of a smooth middleband transition for Microsoft and its
boob-tube collaborators. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Increasingly released from regulatory restrictions, band-width is now expanding
far faster than MIPS and bits (see <I>Forbes ASAP</I>, &quot;The Bandwidth
Tidal Wave,&quot; Dec. 5, 1994). Over the next five years, for example,
@Home will increase the bandwidth to home- and small-business computers
by a factor of thousands. While Moore's Law doubles com-puter power every
18 months, the law of the telecosm, by the most conservative possible measure,
doubles total band-width every 12 months. This adds up. Over the next decade,
computers will im-prove a hundredfold while bandwidth will expand a thou-sandfold.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this year, the computer and software industries have drafted behind
Moore's Law, while hiding behind what Roger McNamee has dubbed &quot;Moron's
Law&quot;-the telecom regulations that stifle bandwidth expansion. The industry
thus has thrived by employing MIPS and bits as a replacement for bandwidth
by using compression, de-compression, switching speed, and logic circuitry
to make up for the constrained bandwidth of public networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove capped off this tradition in early October, in a memorable keynote
address, following South African pres-ident Nelson Mandela to the podium,
at the Telecom 95 quadrennial exposition in Geneva. Grove wowed the large
audience of telco potentates with an on-stage real-time demonstration of
Intel's Proshare teleconferencing tech-nology. And yet, what chiefly struck
the viewer was the mediocrity of the partial-screen facial images. They
were far lower in resolution than ordinary television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as the pictures are inferior to TV images, PC teleconferencing will
remain chiefly a niche or a stunt. As bandwidth expands powerful-ly over
the next decade, it will seem increasingly perverse to substitute processing
for band-width, and more and more inviting to substitute band-width for
processing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The logic of MIPS and bandwidth works both ways. Not only can processing
make up for bandwidth, but bandwidth, as Claude Shan-non pointed out in
1948, can serve as a substitute for switching and other comput-er functions.
With bandwidth now expanding faster than processing speeds, new ar-chitectures
will prevail by substituting bandwidth for MIPS and bits. Today, the bulk
of bandwidth to homes is coaxial cable laid over the last 25 years by the
cable tele-vision industry. Exploiting that bandwidth for the Inter-net
is the single greatest opportunity in the history of in-formation technology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HAVING ASCERTAINED that Doerr had been meeting reg-ularly with all the pioneers
of the new paradigm that Andreessen was &quot;mind-melding&quot; with Medin,
and that Mal-one had been consulting with Doerr and McNealy, I ask McNealy
whether he has talked to Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he answers, &quot;I have not talked with Medin at all ...
since lunch on Wednesday. But back then he and I had sore necks from basically
agreeing with what the other was saying. We're fighting like crazy to become
the standard platform for Medin's environment. Our companies are in-credibly
well aligned. We have a list of about 12 engineering efforts that we are
undertaking and driving at Medin's request. The power of a network comes
from the number of nodes times the bandwidth. By this measure, the @Home
opportunity is as big as there is.&quot; McNealy revealed that the day before
in his office at Sun, he saw the demo of &quot;a diskless, CD-less, floppyless,
OS-less computer, and it was great. It had just about every bus, serial
and parallel and S-bus, and every kind of interface you can imagine. With
connectors on all four sides, it was a model for what I call a zero-administration
client. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Consider: If you give a user a disk drive, a CD, a floppy, an OS and
16 megabytes of memory, you have made him, whether he wants it or not, a
system administrator. He has so many resources to manage. What they showed
me yesterday was a virtual machine written in Java, and it booted up instantly
off flash ROM and ran like crazy be-cause the virtual machine rides so close
on the hardware.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Echoing Medin and Corrigan, McNealy evoked the future of the teleputer:
&quot;Put a touch screen on it and make it a kiosk, put a large screen on
it and make it a worksta-tion, put in an infrared detector and make it a
set-top box, put a joystick on it and make a game machine, put a cable modem
or an ISDN port on it and make it a PC or a digital phone. You never run
out of disk space; you never have to back it up; it's mirrored so you never
lose your files. You have an uninterruptible power supply. Your phone or
cable line is much more reliable than your hard drive on your PC. You get
used to the security of the system with no disks to corrupt and with Java
programs that execute only in a virtual machine and cannot invade your system.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
McNealy might have added, in ecumenical concern for Larry Ellison's mother,
&quot;Put in some Oracle code and you have a terrific, cheap database client
in an emerging world of far-flung databases.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the participants in the new regime agree. Combined with a broadband
network, the teleputer will be more flex-ible and powerful than existing
PCs. Rolling out both the network and the teleputer will be the central
activity in the industry over the next two years. Responding to it will
be the principal challenge to Gates and Grove, and possibly a route of redemption
for their companies. All the leading figures in this Silicon Valley renaissance
have endured recent periods of trial and failure. Malone suf-fered the collapse
of his Bell Atlantic merger in 1994 and the long stagnation of his stock.
Corrigan suffered physical collapse and the slump of his company. McNealy
endured a long tunnel of shrinking market share as his SuperSPARC processor
proved too complex to keep pace with rivals. Clark of Netscape lost influence
at Silicon Graphics, the company he had founded, and finally had to leave
in order to retain his self-respect. Even Doerr lost his touch for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Bill Gates, however, business life has been an al-most unrelenting ascent
toward riches untold for one so young. In the end, his success has made
him seem a bionic business leader leached of his humanity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His company has appeared to government and to competitors alike as a monopoly
threat, targeting existing rivals and systematically suppressing them, rather
than creating new products and industries. Much the same is said of Intel.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps this is the time for the Wintel team to face a domestic challenge.
From it they may well emerge stronger. Without them, it is clear, the Internet
will be weaker. Only from the crucible of competition between paradigms
can emerge a robust and redemptive new economy of information. <BR>

<H3>In 1995, Internet stories trumped even O.J. The Net will have a far
happier ending. </H3>

<BR>
Well, it had to happen. As the Internet emerges as the central nervous system
of global capitalism, the Luddite left is bursting into &quot;flames&quot;
against the microcosm and telecosm, against interlinked computers and the
global radiance of electromagnetic communications. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This rising resistance resonates with the press coverage that has long lavished
attention on the excesses of the Net. Richard Shaffer of the Computer Letter
counts 39,158 Internet stories during the first three quarters of 1995,
beating O.J. by some 15,000 citations. Much of the coverage has been lurid.
For psychedelic visions of virtual reality, the media have exalted Jaron
Lanier in dreadlocks and bankruptcy above Bob Metcalfe, creator of Ethernet,
or Gordon Moore, inventor of IC processing, or Charles Kao, father of fiber
optics, all of whom reshaped the boundaries of human possibility. Computer
viruses and Net porn win headlines and magazine covers that elude the creators
of vast new computer powers, such as RSA encryption or the World Wide Web
or new tools of chip fabrication at the quarter-micron level. Last August,
Windows 95, a modest advance in operating systems, exploded across the press
and the airwaves as if the entire media had been preempted for a Microsoft
infomercial. No wonder befuddled academics, politicians and book publishers
gain a grotesquely distorted view of the industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Tom Peters's first Forbes ASAP interview (March 29, 1993), he predicted
that the '90s would see a fabulous unfolding of new technology, accompanied
with increasing outbreaks of technophobia, Ludditism and Marxism. Alvin
Toffler greeted the initial readers of Wired with a similar dual prophecy
of networked marvels, foiled by a multifront war against the Third Wave.
Once again, Peters and Toffler may well be right, as from Hollywood to Harvard,
America's brainlords rebel against computer technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his pungent new book War of the Worlds, Mark Slouka joins the rising
chorus of resistance. Slouka finds it all a &quot;kind of lie.&quot; Like
a &quot;speech of Ronald Reagan&quot; or a spiritual vision from the &quot;religious
right,&quot; the virtual world is increasingly usurping reality and identity
itself. &quot;Rather than doing away with the couch potato, the telecomputer
has actually created a new, more tenacious variety of tuber: the individual
who swivels from the television screen to computer monitor without missing
a beat . . . .&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, Sandra Bullock writhes in anguish in the sinister clutches of The
Net, with a blond, predatory, arachnoid Bill Gates (using &quot;Gateway&quot;
software) masterminding the Web. Similar chimeras recur in antitech crusades.
Bathed in the ultraviolet frequencies of sunlight, humans throughout the
history of the species have raced through a planetary magnetic field of
half a gauss in power on a terrestrial sphere charged by worldwide lightning
strikes a hundred times a second to a capacitive level of 100 volts per
meter of height. Yet Paul Brodeur and other electrophobes panic at power
lines, power plants, cathode-ray tubes, microprocessors, cellular antennas
and other high-tech oscillators with an impact on humans measurable only
in millionths of a gauss. They defy the fact that around the world use of
electricity correlates almost perfectly with greater longevity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, despite the higher longevity and the globally spreading jobs
and riches springing from high technology, pseudoeconomists prattle endlessly
about the growing gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; Publishers sign up other disgruntled nerds to write hymns to
noble savagery and gardening. And from the fever swamps, a Marxist enrage
posts bombs through the mail and addled editors detonate them in the pages
of the Washington Post. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such fears and fantasies have always afflicted the course of human innovation
and progress. With life expectancies rising eight years in the developed
countries and 22 years in the Third World since 1950, people have more time
to lash out at industrial benefactors who gain wealth and create it from
sources hard to comprehend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Misconceptions about the Internet, however, also abound in more savvy circles.
From Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference to the Internet Society, serious
critics are emerging to predict that the network itself will bog down and
degrade, jammed by traffic and trivia. Often unconsciously, these critics
feed upon a spurious vision of capitalist ecology. Constantly recycling
Garrett Hardin's &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; as a theory of the
Internet, writers such as Clifford Stoll in Silicon Snake Oil, and others
from publications such as the New York Times to the National Review and
the Atlantic, predict that the Web, as a public good, will be overgrazed,
like the commonly owned fields of feudal Britain. Each herdsman or entrepreneur
gains from adding to his herd or bandwidth, beating rivals to the remaining
grass or spectrum, until congestion ruins the common space. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the epitome of a capitalist commons, the Internet, according to the critics'
predictions, will collapse under the impact of this law, clogged with traffic
and polluted with porn and violence. As a precursor, the same writers cite
citizens band radio, an earlier fad that rose meteorically and collapsed
ignominiously when, as they see it, millions of middle- and lower-class
hoi polloi rushed in and polluted the bandwidth without renewing it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the resistance converges many streams of reaction. In general,
the &quot;humanist&quot; opponents mistake the Internet for a continuation
of television technology. Thus they ascribe to the Internet the very flaws
that they find in TV -- crudeness, violence, porn, entertainment for &quot;diverting
ourselves to death&quot; -- and extend to the computer the old and mostly
valid arguments of Neil Postman and Jerry Mander against the idiot box.
Some of the other critics of the Internet benefit from TV and fear the Web
will replace their familiar tube. The executives of media companies are
mostly baffled by the new technology. Paralyzed by market research, as Jim
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape puts it, &quot;They are trying to build bridges
by counting the swimmers.&quot; A Washington lobbyist for a long-distance
carrier wonders poignantly if &quot;America is ready for all this bandwidth.&quot;
Baby Bells spurn the Internet to fund Hollywood films and TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blinded by the robber-baron image assigned in U.S. history courses to the
heroic builders of American capitalism, many critics see Bill Gates as a
menacing monopolist. They mistake for greed the gargantuan tenacity of Microsoft
as it struggles to assure the compatibility of its standard with tens of
thousands of applications and peripherals over generations of dynamically
changing technology (avoiding the dialectical babel of the more open Unix,
for example). They see the Internet as another arena likely to be dominated
by Microsoft and a few giant media companies, increasing the wealth of Wall
Street at the expense of the stultified masses of consumers and opening
an ever-greater gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Focused on the summits of the industry -- CEO s&eacute;ances among media
conglomerates and software kings -- all the critics can foster the impression
that the Internet is a questionable, unpromising venue, vulnerable to monopoly
and trash, thereby vindicating the Luddites and the Cassandras. From the
beginning of its civilian eruption, however (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The
Issaquah Miracle,&quot; June 7, 1993), the Net has risen from the bottom
up rather than from the top down; by nature, it is a heterarchy rather than
a hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To get a view of the future of the Net, let us turn aside from Herb Allen's
golfing groves and Bill Gates's mansion and Louis Gerstner's &quot;net-centric&quot;
revelation, and visit some of the fertile bottomlands where the Web is growing
fastest. Here no robber barons or monopolists come into view and there are
no signs at all of an impending slide toward tragedy and decline. Here the
negative externalities of the degraded commons fall before the huge positive
externalities of Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law, the microcosm and the telecosm,
where smaller transistors yield exponentially more efficient machines and
the value of networks rises by the square of the power of all the computers
attached to them. Governing the positive externalities of the Internet is
the convergence of these forces, compounded by the creativity of entrepreneurs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps such a combinatorial explosion explains the mind of Avi Freedman
of Net Access. Among the vanguard of the armies of the Internet, Freedman
is a classic American entrepreneur, entirely alien to the megalithic visions
of the critics. As an Internet service provider (ISP), Freedman supplies
the Philadelphia area with access to the goods and services of this global
ganglion of networks at a flat rate of between $12.50 and $20 per month,
depending on the services chosen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access still operates chiefly out of his cellar in a marginally middle-class
suburb of Wyndmoor. The street bristles with wires, transformer nodes, terminal
boxes and power lines, many of them converging on the duplex red-brick bungalow
where Freedman lives with his wife in an apartment above a basement crammed
floor-to-ceiling with multiplying racks of electromagnetic conversion and
processing gear for computers and telecom. These technologies are all oscillating
and radiating like crazy in the spirit of their hyperkinetic owner, who
is multiplexing Internet insights between his cellular phone and an attentive
audience of aspiring ISPs from western Pennsylvania and geek students visiting
from the University of Pennsylvania, gathered at his door next to the power-line
link. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this an entrepreneurial dream, or a carcinogenic nightmare out of the
muddled pages of Paul Brodeur? Avi is too busy to give the issue much thought.
Extending business service to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago,
overflowing his basement, he is now moving his operations to a collocation
cage at the Philadelphia central office of MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
where he has just turned up a T-3 fiber circuit (45 megabits per second)
direct to MAE East, the major East Coast Internet exchange point. From Seattle
to San Jose, top companies are besieging him with multimillion-dollar buyout
offers, but looking to the future and its promise, Freedman calculates that
he can't afford to sell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 4,000 customers, however, Net Access hardly seems to pose a threat
to such local colossi as Bell Atlantic and Comcast, now searching the world
for &quot;content&quot; opportunities and looming ever larger on Rodeo Drive.
Yet Ray Smith and Brian Roberts should pay attention to what is going on
in Freedman's teeming mind and basement. Millions of PC owners may well
become part-time Internet service providers in the future -- as their home
and small-business PCs supply content for others, perhaps beginning with
teleconferencing and telecommuting activities that will soon dwarf Hollywood
in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the students hanging on Freedman's words, for example, is Meng-Weng
Wong, whose personal Web page at Penn attracts some 35,000 hits a week with
its restaurant reviews, film criticisms, Philadelphia maps, technology insights
and other delectations. Drawing wide media attention, from Forbes ASAP to
Scandinavian TV (a crew is visiting this very day from the Netherlands),
Wong has now established a server at Net Access, pobox.com, which supplies
his clients with a permanent Internet address wherever they may go, and
he is developing a Web-page design business. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the onrush of innovative customers like Wong, the configuration
of Freedman's bottom-up operations offers clues to the future shape of the
industry. A portly, perspiring, blond, balding geek-genius bursting with
monologic humor and street smarts -- hardly full-duplex (scant signs of
upstream flow) -- Freedman has just hustled past his 26th birthday. He has
been deep in computers since age eight, when a prescient uncle gave him
a book on the Basic programming language at a Seder. Within months he was
entrenched among the information rich, opening an unbridgeable gap in computer
savvy between himself and nearly all of the other five billion inhabitants
of the planet. If you think you are going to catch up, forget it. By the
age of 12, in 1982, he was an active user of e-mail and Usenet news and
familiar with the abstruse command codes of the Unix operating system that
ran on his father's DEC PDP-11. Freedman senior, a pulmonary physician,
inherited the machine indirectly from Bell Labs, where it had been employed
as a Usenet news hub until displaced by a VAX. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986, still a teenager, Freedman began exploring the uses of Unix machines
for commercial databases and discovered to his surprise that serious businessmen
would give him gouts of money to get help with their computers. Eventually,
he was earning &quot;lawyers' rates&quot; (his mother is a Philadelphia
tax attorney) for work he found &quot;amazingly routine&quot; and &quot;even
fun.&quot; Nonetheless, after high school, his parents sent him off to college
in Massachusetts, where his computer skills were underappreciated. He returned
after a few weeks to get a job at the National Software Testing Labs in
the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken before enlisting at nearby Temple
University, which he chose because it offered more freedom for computer
experiments and consulting work than the more prestigious Penn a few miles
away. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After arriving, he discovered that Temple's computer lab also commanded
a superb resource: bandwidth, in the form of a nearly empty T-1 line linking
to the Internet at 1.544 megabits per second. Already computer rich, he
was becoming communications rich as well. In Avi Freedman, Temple's department
of computer science got rather more than it bargained for. Realizing that
the available PCs were network hostile and the lab's MicroVAXes ran VMS
rather than Unix, Freedman used his savings to buy five secondhand Sun 3
workstations for $600 apiece. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short order, Freedman began his career as an Internet service provider
and &quot;professional geek,&quot; albeit unpaid. Soon he had some 100 students
as users, mostly cavorting through games of Multiuser Dungeons (MUD). Temple's
address, supplied by Freedman -- bigboy.cis.temple.edu -- became known far
and wide as a hive of MUD activity. Temple's computer science professors
began to rebel at this untoward distinction, particularly when they found
that lost in the crypts and catacombs of the Net, their charges were virtually
unreachable for assignments in higher-level languages. Freedman was forced
to close down local access to the game portions of the server during daytime
hours. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman has given some thought to the problem of &quot;how to civilize
young, intelligent teenage males.&quot; He concludes, &quot;You have got
to get them interested.&quot; He says the students playing MUD at least
were learning Unix commands, &quot;a better way to get a job than mastering
the Pascal programming language,&quot; which was then being taught in the
regular classes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a student, working with Prof. Yuan Shi and other Temple professors, Freedman
developed a toolkit for distributed processing on Suns and presented a paper
in London in 1989 at a conference on computer-aided software engineering.
As his time at Temple drew to a close, he began contemplating graduate school.
&quot;Everyone was very surprised that anyone who could do anything on the
outside was going to graduate school,&quot; he says, &quot;but Stony Brook
on Long Island offered me a nice job as a research assistant in the lab
and I went up there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After graduating from Temple, Freedman also encountered the harsh facts
of life in the world beyond college computer laboratories. With their local-area
networks and T-1 links to the Internet, universities offered a revel for
budding cybernauts. Marc Andreessen of Netscape discovered a similar disjunction
between college lab and residential communications. At LAN's end was a communications
cliff and a bandwidth scandal. Most homes and offices connected to the world
only through twisted-pair, four-kilohertz, copper telephone wires. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In October of 1992, Freedman became an ISP chiefly to continue his college
revels by chasing bandwidth. Twenty-three at the time and engaged, he could
still recall his days in high school and remembered how much he had learned
from the Internet through his father's PDP-11. He began to fill up his basement
with second-hand Sun machines, mostly at prices well below new Pentium levels,
all using Berkeley Unix, equipped by Bill Joy with fast TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with 40 customers from local bulletin board systems, Freedman
provided access through the serial ports of a single SPARCstation IPC with
a 200-megabyte hard drive and 12 megabytes of memory that he purchased secondhand
for $1,500. The serial ports ran up to 38.4 kilobits per second, linked
to 14.4-kilobit-per-second Zoom and Supra modems connected to POTS (plain
old telephone service) outside lines running from the phone company's central
office. Costing a total of some $4,000, the system worked well enough until
his clientele began to multiply and the modems balked at continual resetting.
In April 1992, he bought a 16-port Iolan terminal server that answered the
phones and connected subscribers to the Sun servers, which supplied e-mail,
Usenet news, Gopher searches, Telnet and file-transfer services in a Unix
environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In June of 1992 emerged the menace of competition. A local entrepreneur
launched Voicenet by simply linking a 386 PC with a modem to each phone
line through a terminal server. Charging fees several times higher than
Net Access's, Voicenet thrived through the device of hiring two full-time
people to scan in pictures from porno magazines for what Freedman describes
as the &quot;sticky keyboard set.&quot; Eventually the &quot;adult&quot;
bulletin board service enlisted some 5,000 members paying $4 per hour to
peruse images. Nonetheless, Voicenet protested what it called Net Access's
predatory low pricing, a $12.50 to $20 flat rate per month with no full-time
employees to pay. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the early years of the Net's development, the late '80s, the Internet
business outside campuses and corporations was a small-time and sometimes
tacky trade. In 1992, the entire Net comprised a million linked computers,
many of them in university and government labs. It wasn't until November
1993 that Net Access acquired a dedicated 56-kilobit line for direct connection
to an official network access point. Costing $400 per month, it multiplexed
22 dial-up modems among 250 users. With the Mosaic World Wide Web browser
yet to catch on outside the universities, Net Access did not even have to
supply SLIP (serial line interface protocol) or PPP (point-to-point protocol)
accounts, which shield the user from the details of Unix. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman, however, saw the need for new technology to link people to the
full resources of the Net without having to know abstruse Unix commands.
&quot;As a professional geek, writing code is my true calling,&quot; he
says, adding that he threw himself into this work. Although the program
was eclipsed by Mosaic, Lynx and other approaches, he still believes that
his software provided easier access to the Internet, complete with the ability
to trace routes and &quot;ping&quot; remote machines. Enabling users to
log in to the program in 1992, he put Net Access on the technological forefront
of ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The largest challenge for an ISP, then and now, is managing the floods of
bits engulfing a Usenet news server at a rate of some 500 megabytes per
day, five news articles per second, each with a unique identification that
has to be scanned to assure that the news is fresh and not duplicated. The
heart of the Internet until the arrival of the World Wide Web -- and still
cherished more than the Web by many Internet veterans -- Usenet is the huge
collection of textual bulletin boards and other information troves and exchanges
from which the communities of the Net exfoliate. As Steve Willens of Livingston
Enterprises puts it: &quot;This is the real source of the Internet as we
know it and the challenge that forced the development of technology specialized
for the Net&quot; -- notably Livingston communications servers that linked
modems to the Net through fast comports functioning with compression at
115.2 kilobits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Freedman recognized he had a major business on his hands. He decided
to lease a T-1 line from PREP-NET (Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network), which required a prepayment of $1,000 per month. With 50 phone
lines and modems and 500 users, he broke all ties with Stony Brook and began
hiring people to handle a rising tide of traffic and a surging demand for
technical support. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That summer, he had three full-time people: &quot;Myself, my wife, Gail,
and my 20-year-old brother, Noam. Working with him made me realize why people
pay me so much money as a consultant [up to $150 an hour]. He served as
a kind of Avi echo, intuitively knowing what I wanted and when.&quot; A
student in computer science at the University of Chicago, Noam is in the
process of extending the business to that city, while Avi has established
points of presence in New York and Washington, D.C. He has hired five Net
Access customers, none with college degrees, to provide technical support
full time as the number of users has climbed at a pace of some 15% per month
since the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For links to other cities, Freedman relied on advice from telecommunications
consultant Gordon Jacobson, a Penn alumnus who maintains close links to
the Penn school of engineering, where his father graduated. With Jacobson's
help, Freedman is ending 1995 with a fiber circuit connecting him to MAE
East at 45 megabits a second, a 10-megabit-per-second link to Sprint's network-access
point, and more than half a dozen point-to-point T-1 lines, all for well
under half of the normally tariffed prices for these services. With increasing
broadband connectivity, Net Access commands more than half as much bandwidth
at the nerve centers of the Net as Netcom, which has 50 times more customers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though indispensable, technology alone cannot sustain a successful ISP.
It is people that make the vital difference. If Freedman had originally
hired people to perform the work that he did himself part-time -- &quot;keeping
the machines running, maintaining software, recovering from disasters, installing
and tuning equipment and circuits&quot; -- he would have incurred expenses
of some $100,000 per year and his financial model would have collapsed.
The reason many corporations are so slow to develop Internet programs is
not the lack of equipment but the dearth of personnel. The large companies
pursuing Net Access did not care about Freedman's rooms full of gear. They
were after Freedman himself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's entrepreneurship and technology ride on a tide of other enterprise
by the suppliers of Internet gear. These, too, are not huge telephone company
equipment manufacturers or rising software monopolists but mostly small
or medium-size companies, led by young entrepreneurs, fighting to survive
in the most intensely competitive arena of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An Internet service provider must begin by supplying modems through which
the outside world can connect to his offerings. With millions of home customers
who dwarf the ISP modem volumes, U.S. Robotics is currently ascendant in
most ISPs, but Freedman spurns them for cheaper devices from Multi-Tech.
These modems connect to a Xylogics terminal server that authenticates the
name and password combination entered by the user and validates the caller
as legitimate. Then the customer enters Net Access's local-area network
linking a set of Sun Microsystems servers that supply World Wide Web, Gopher,
Usenet, e-mail, file transfer, Telnet and other Internet services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access is unusual for an ISP, since few use Xylogics equipment. Recently
bought out by Bay Networks, Xylogics supplied nearly all the terminal servers
for the university market, and it still shies away from the tumultuous world
of ISPs. These customers mostly use Livingston products that run a security
protocol named Radius (remote authentication dial-in user services). Channeling
the bits around the ISP's internal net and on to other networks are banks
of routers, also often built by Cisco or Livingston (although Freedman originally
chose Morningstar because it was cheaper). Linking a particular ISP to other
ISPs and network access points are T-1 cables running at 1.544 megabits
per second through multiplexing and demultiplexing and conditioning equipment.
These functions are performed by DSU-CSUs (data service units-channel service
units) made by such companies as TxPort, Adtran, General DataComm and ADC
Kentrox. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman insists on the Law of the Microcosm in choosing all his equipment
and in making all his projects for expansion. Since his study of distributed
computing at Temple, he has everywhere cherished duplication and redundancy
and cheap components over centralization and scale economies. He at first
bought a nine-gigabyte drive from Micropolis. Now he regrets the decision
and is replacing it with five two-gigabyte drives (more I/O [input/output],
redundancy and reliability). &quot;The more spindles the better,&quot; he
says. He buys lots of cheap secondhand Suns rather than one powerful server.
He criticizes some of the larger ISPs, such as Netcom, for centralizing
their servers and technical support. It causes bottlenecks and delays, he
says, and opens the system to crashes if any of the communication lines
go down. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's rule is to provide service as locally as possible. He believes
ISPs with fully equipped local network sites, rather than mere communications
nodes like Netcom's, will prevail. Like most small ISPs, Freedman is wedded
to flat-rate pricing, though his accounts of altercations with customers
who want to resell or overgraze his commons may undermine confidence that
this pricing regime can survive into the future. But managing flat-rate
prices is a core competence of the ISPs. Believing that bits will flee toward
flat rates, Freedman says MCI will fail in its plans to transform Internet
pricing models by adding some as yet unannounced scale of measured usage
based on time, packets or both. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is Freedman's model scalable, or is it doomed as he grows? Could Freedman
be displaced by MCI or Sprint-Comcast or Bell Atlantic or Microsoft-UUNet
or AT&T in a siege of merger-monopolization? He believes that up until a
threshold of some 25,000 to 50,000 customers, meaning revenues of between
$5 million and $10 million net of more lucrative business clients, his economic
and technical model can trump all comers. At that point, he will face the
usual entrepreneurial crisis of transition: Freedman will need business
partners, routinized technology management schemes and expensive accounting
to maintain operations as Net Access spreads across the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But he does not fear competition. His problems, he says, are servicing the
flood of new customers and anticipating the depredations of &quot;Congresscritters&quot;
who want to make him liable for any vagrant flasher who strays onto one
of his hard drives. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still a small force in the global matrix of telecommunications, Freedman
now dreams of exploiting available resources of fiber, dark and lit, to
acquire major new bandwidth, linking cities up and down the East Coast and
across the U.S. Helping Freedman move this project toward reality is his
telecom guru Jacobson, an entrepreneurial dervish from Portman Communications.
With financiers on the line to supply some $5 million in startup capital,
Jacobson is planning to launch a national IRamp network. The service will
ultimately open fully staffed Internet access facilities in 30 cities nationwide,
linked everywhere by fiber, at a cost of some $1 million per site. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such investment looms large compared to the rock-bottom base of Freedman's
operation, and easily eclipses a national ISP's point-of-presence facility
that can cost upwards of $70,000. But David Farber, gigabit-testbed guru,
recently told a New York audience at the Penn Club that, spurred by business
needs, the marketplace is seeking higher-end, stable-broadband ISP services
that can handle millions of hits a day at a Web site with no access delays
or congestion and that provide local access and custom software configuration.
For these high-end customers, the SPARC 20 servers and T-1 and 56-kilobit
links of the many small ISPs will no longer suffice. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering the kind of broadband channels that will eventually become ubiquitous
on the Net, IRamp's planned facilities will command OC-3 fiber (155 megabits
per second) links to a national network of both dark and lit fiber, available
from utilities, pipelines and other unusual sources. Such bypass strategies
will become increasingly common in coming years. The 10 million miles of
fiber currently installed in the U.S., after all, is exploited to approximately
one-millionth of its potential capacity -- and much of it is unused &quot;dark
fiber.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For key ISP server and security functions, Jacobson plans to use fully fault-tolerant
Tandem S4000 servers running the new ServerNet multibus scheme. It was conceived
by venerable Tandem designer Robert Horst as a new-generation architecture
explicitly optimized to substitute bandwidth for switching speeds. Fully
scalable, ServerNet was licensed in October by Compaq, yet it commands a
theoretical throughput limit of an unprecedented petabit per second (a million
billion bits). For graphics-intensive applications, Jacobson envisages Silicon
Graphics WebForce Challenge S servers using Irix software. Even with as
few as 5,000 subscribers per site paying a competitive nonusage-based rate,
Jacobson projects a high rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, at Netcom, the nation's largest ISP, David Garrison, the CEO,
is undergoing the stresses that Freedman foresees for himself as he expands
his business. During his previous stint at the helm of the meteoric paging
company, SkyTel, Garrison, a rangy dark-haired entrepreneur with a slight
uneasiness in his ready smile of prosperity, thought he had approached the
ultimate in entrepreneurial excitement. But nothing in his career in the
wireless industry prepared him for his first nine months as head of Netcom.
Here is a company that during the last three quarters grew from 400 to 1,200
employees, from 58 to 201 points of presence, from 72,000 to more than 200,000
customers, and from revenues of $12.4 million in 1994 to a $50 million run
rate in 1995 and to a market cap of some $400 million, while the traffic
in bits grows at an even faster pace -- impelled by the graphic demands
of the World Wide Web, itself expanding at the rate of more than 1,000 new
servers per week. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netcom pares down its points of presence to simple communications nodes
and handles all the technical support and Internet services for them at
the company's headquarters. This operation fills up a high-rise in San Jose.
Some floors teem with desks manned by earnest engineers in jeans, many of
them Asian, working the phones. Other floors are replete with row upon row
of racks filled wall-to-wall with Cisco routers, Sun servers, Livingston
PortMasters, Ascend ISDN pipelines, Cascade edge switches and U.S. Robotics
modems. Walking through these ever-expanding mazes of machinery, Garrison's
entrepreneurial smile at times moves from the ready to the giddy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this environment of riotous growth, the telcos move their slow thighs
like trolls under the bridges and routers of the Internet. Currently commanding
perhaps 2% of the traffic, AT&amp;T, for example, has declared its ambition
to capture 60% of the Internet business over the next two years. But Garrison
demurs: &quot;From the Olympian perspective of a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant,
AT&amp;T could take over any business. They have one of the greatest brand
names in the world, they've got more money than God, a billing relationship
with some 40 million people, a global network and alliances and consortia,
Internet pioneer Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman in their fold, and they have
perhaps the world's largest internal World Wide Web on their own Unix servers
among their 300,000 employees.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But like most of the telcos, AT&amp;T lacks focus. As Netcom marketing chief
John Zeisler explains: &quot;Phone companies have their 700 numbers, 800
numbers, corporate customers, their Hollywood links, their leased lines,
their frame relay, their ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), their
cable aspirations, their huge wireless opportunities, their bureaucracy,
their regulatory tariffs, their pricing confusions. Should voice be priced
as data or should data be priced as voice? They are great at laying fiber
and wire, connecting it to switches and bringing signals to the central
office and to the curb. But the Internet is a second thought, just another
business to them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in the PC industry, focus and agility are crucial. In an arena where
the technologies ride a remorseless onrush of exponential changes, no prolonged
bureaucratic process can succeed. Even the maps and schematics of rapid
convergence among media industries miss the point. Dominating this arena
is the computer industry -- with its millions of piranha processors and
entrepreneurs -- and it doesn't converge with anything; it eats everything
in its path. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ascendant is the Internet computer industry. Most of these new companies,
from Livingston to Netscape, focus on the Internet. Using personal computer
components to reduce the price of ISP infrastructure far below the price
of telco installations, these companies endow the ISPs with a further advantage
in a dynamic industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Livingston Enterprises epitomizes the success of the new companies creating
this new industry. Secreted in Pleasanton, Calif., and financed by corporate
cash flow, Livingston has grown up with the Internet at a pace not far in
the wake of its more illustrious rival, Cisco Systems. Livingston PortMasters
crowd Netcom's headquarters, as they do most of the other ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched in 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sillens, then a manager
of multiprocessors at Sun Microsystems, Livingston's networking drive began
by creating a cheap router and communications server based on a new operating
system, ComOS, specifically developed to help ISPs meet their Usenet burdens.
Livingston quickly became a dominant force in Internet terminal servers
and routers, and grew at a pace of more than 50% per year until engulfed
by an explosion of demand in 1995. In August of this year, Livingston launched
cheap low-end routers to serve both ends of an Internet connection: a $1,395
two-port PortMaster to link small offices to the Net at up to 230.4 kilobits
per second and a sleek space-saving $3,495 PortMaster with 24 ports for
ISPs. In October, Livingston announced a series of ISDN remote-access machines
that will compete with the currently dominant Ascend ISDN pipeline system,
if ISDN becomes the preferred mode of Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, everywhere in the Internet industry companies are resigning themselves
to ISDN as the next &quot;modem&quot; (though, in fact it just brings into
home and office the 64Kbps digital channels long used by the telcos between
central offices). The scandal of U.S. telecom, however, is that the telcos
could just as easily be bringing video capable T-1 service (1.544 megabits
per second of bandwidth, equivalent to CD-ROMs) to homes if regulations
permitted a reasonable tariff structure. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, new access technologies are emerging, such as cable modems and
AT&amp;T's new SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber loop). Available this
year and under test by Bell Atlantic, SDSL modems promise to bring T-1-Line
capability to homes on twisted-pair copper wires for about $10 a month.
SDSL follows many such copper prosthetics announced over the years (notably
HDSL) [high bit rate digital subscriber line] from Level One, PairGain,
Brooktree and others), all largely spurned by the telcos on pricing grounds,
but capable of transforming the entire world of Internet access before ISDN's
niggardly pipes catch on with the public. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While Internet hardware rushes ahead, Netscape, Sun and other providers
of Internet software make the ISP a fast and elusively moving target for
the telcos that wish to compete. With eight million browsers in the field,
all upgradeable to the new 2.0 system--with the Java interpreter and Java
multimedia programming language and toolkit--Netscape expects to attract
some 100,000 software developers to its platform over the next year. There
are already some 400 Java applications available, including word processors,
spreadsheets and games that can play on any machine with a browser running
a Java interpreter, regardless of operating system or microprocessor instruction
set. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's expected army of 100,000 developers compares with some 10,000
developers for Apple's Macintosh and perhaps 3,000 for Microsoft's network,
MSN. Emerging from a company that did not even exist two years ago, such
a juggernaut will further empower the ISPs in their competition with the
large invaders of the territory--not only the telcos but also the on-line
services such as American Online and MSN. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ISPs, however, are not usually in direct competition with the large
phone companies. ISPs bring them new customers and new business users, and
the ISPs also depend on them for home connections and for potential fiber-trunking
services. The American telcos are currently laying some 1,300 miles of fiber-optic
line every day. Moreover, beginning with TCI's and Kleiner Perkins' @home
system, which functions with cable modems and new software from Netscape,
the ISPs also may end up using cable plant. As cable modems become available,
cable companies will likely turn to the ISPs to supply Internet services,
local content, technical support and point-of-presence technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of these whitewater torrents of change, the some 4,000 ISPs
and their increasing armies of supporters represent a serious threat to
many of the established empires of telecom. Not only can they move much
faster and more resourcefully, but they also have the key advantage of having
bet exclusively on the PC and the Internet as the platforms of the future.
However smart and powerful, Ray Smith, Mike Ovits of Disney, Gerland Levin
and Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone and other aspiring Kings of the Road still
entertain crippling visions of set-top boxes and interactive TV sets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove of Intel had the last word for these efforts when he told Forbes
ASAP last year: &quot;By the time the set-top people reach the price points
and form factors of consumer electronics and penetrate 30% of homes, the
personal computer will be everywhere, controlling the TV like a minor peripheral.&quot;
Bill Joy elaborated on this point in the October issue of Red Herring: &quot;By
the time [they] bring digital TV to the home, you will be able to take your
Super Netscape version 4.0 Web browser with Super-Ultra-HotJava-Burners,
and that will be your animated user interface. [The TV people tried, but[
it's like the Internet happened in the meantime. Right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Distracting most of the large companies (seen by the Internet's critics
as impending monopolists), the pursuit of the set-top not only misses the
point and begs the question but it also blows the key new hardware opportunity
of the epoch. Although the PC will not be dislodged for most office applications,
there is a real and rare chance today to create a new home architecture
and software optimized for the bandwidth rather than for installed base.
Together with the Java language, the Web browser breakthrough allows creation
of new network PC and software architectures at price points that take advantage
of the &quot;hollowing out of the computer&quot; caused by the impact of
the Internet. Sun, Apple, Oracle and Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's BeBox are
all focusing on this target today. All are trying to take advantage of the
elusive opportunity of creating cheap machines optimized for bandwidth and
graphics rather than for legacy software baggage (the storage can be supplied
on the Net). That opportunity follows the PC and Internet model--the microcosm
and the telecosm--into the cornucopian digital future of the information
age, with the old analog TV and telephone left far behind. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>AMID ALL THESE TORRENTS</B> of futuristic technology and prophecies of
a tragic denouement in a wasted commons, it is comforting to return to the
man who began it all, Vinton Cerf of MIC. Coinventor of the Internet protocol
TCP/IP, developer of the once-pioneering and a philosopher of the Net, he
is now in charge of MCI's data network, which includes MCI's Internet backbone
network. A rare combination of technical grit and visionary enthusiasm,
he faces resistance from forces within the company that still lust for the
glamour of Hollywood and see the Internet as the CB radio of the 1990s.
Nonetheless, Cerf at 52 is leading MCI toward a new Internet-centric strategy
that is more likely than the MCI lobbyists to save the company from the
grave perils of long-distance deregulation. The company is already creating
a new backbone for the National Science Foundation part of the Internet,
connecting supercomputer centers and other high-bandwidth applications at
speeds of up to 622 megabits per second. MCI also is a major supplier of
Internet bandwidth. Its network connects to all six NAPs (national access
points) through which the ISPs link to one another. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cerf observes that the national phone network grew at a similar pace through
much of its history and regularly met ever challenge. The telcos, for instance,
surmounted the predicted crisis of the NAPs early this year, when--following
the withdrawal of government funds--the network was expected to collapse
under galloping increase sin traffic. But the NAPs, despite unsuccessful
struggles with the remaining instabilities of ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode), ultimately rose to the challenge, saving the Net by using fiber optics
and digitization, as well as transparent silicon and opaque silicon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, new entrepreneurs are rising up to shape the future of broadband
networks and possibly seize the market from the incumbent backbone suppliers.
Silicon, both see-through ad solid, remains at the heart of the solution.
One of the ways MCI is meeting the challenge of the future is by purchasing
eight &quot;gigarouters&quot; from NetStar, a startup in Minneapolis that
is exploiting Moore's Law to bring IP (Internet Protocol) switching and
router technology into the microcosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched five years ago by a group of veterans of the Minneapolis supercomputer
scene--Lee Data, Cray and other companies--NetStar went public this fall
at a $83 million valuation. It is pioneering an elegant routing architecture
that gets eight times the throughput of a Cisco 7500 at a 20% lower price.
While existing routers run bits down shared backplane buses, NetStar's IP
router reserves a full one gigabit per each of up to 16 media cards attached
to a single-chip TriQuint 16 gigabit-cross-bar switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ubiquitous on the Internet, Cisco remains an imperial force. But as the
microcosm advances, it too faces threats. Not only can it not compete with
NetStar at the top of the line but it also faces Livingston, Ascend and
possibly even Compaq at the bottom. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the Internet have long predicted that as ever-more-turbulent
floods of broadband data and Web images crowd the commons, the Net will
no longer be able to bear the load. The routers in the NAPs and other critical
paths will jam up and crash. But the microcosm enables a constant stream
of exponentially more powerful new architectures as functions that were
once spread out across entire boards collapse into single chips and multichip
modules. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For 1995 and beyond, MCI has bent on NetStar's feats of microchip integration
to countervail every population explosion across the network commons. Following
the laws of the telecosm rather than the megalithic visions of the critics,
the fast new networks are becoming constantly dumber and more entrepreneurial.
Ciena Corp., a small, venture-funded vendor of optical networks, is now
supplying the next generation of back-bone gear, a system that can carry
16 separate bitstreams on every fiber thread. The first application of the
new all-optical technology in public networks, is now Ciena's innovation
is a precursor of the terabit (trillion-bit throughput) networks that will
be filled with video teleconferencing, video on demand, virtual reality,
and other bit-thronging and polygon-shuffling applications of the future.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Only one competitor, Northern Telecom, might challenge NetStar and the others
providing the new superswitches dumb enough to prevail at the top of the
line. In early October, Northern's BNR lab exhibited a terabit-switch architecture
at the Telecom 95 show in Geneva. This machine, once again, illustrates
the triumph of dumb networks. The dumb terminals of the past, whether POTS
phones or mainframe 3270 panels, required smart networks, with central-office
switches from Northern and AT&amp;T containing no fewer than 26 million
lines of software code. But the new Northern terabit uses passive optical
components and virtually no software at all. It points to the evolution
of a fibershpere for broadband wire traffic that will function like the
atmosphere for wireless traffic. (See Forbes ASPA, &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot;
December 7, 1992). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the critics of the new technology fix on the foibles of television
and the monolithic aggregations of old media, the Internet is emerging as
an entrepreneurial efflorescence. Comparing the Net to the decline of CB
radio and the tragedy of the commons misses the providential convergence
of the laws espoused by Moore and Metcalfe, with thousands of entrepreneurs
in tow, exponentially expanding the commons with streams of new invention
in a creative spiral of growth and opportunity. In seeing the technology
as a killer of jobs and family life and a polarizer of opportunities between
rich and poor, they miss the most radically egalitarian force in the history
of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics seem oblivious to the most basic realities of the U.S. job miracle.
While the U.S. deployed three times as much as computer power per capita
as any other industrial region, this country created some 45 million jobs
in 25 years at rising, real incomes. Not only was the U.S. a world leader
in the proportion of its working-age population with jobs, but it also created
employment for some 12 million immigrants, while its corporations endowed
new work for people around the globe. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, a billion people, mostly Third World Asians, used the
technology to leap into Third Wave riches without ever having to endure
a heavy industrial phase. Gaps between the rich and the poor collapsed everywhere
that the networks reached, as former peasants around the world--from Bangalore
to Los Angeles--gained new freedom and opportunity from the information
economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet creates jobs by making workers more productive, and thus more
employable, regardless of where they live. By engendering more investable
wealth, it endows new work, providing the key remedy for the job displacement
entailed by all human progress. By aggregating distant markets, the Internet
enables more specialization, and more productivity and excellence. It will
help all people, but most particularly the poor, who always comprise the
largest untapped market for enterprise. And the Internet will continue to
grow, transforming the global economy with its power and building a new
industry even larger than the PC's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>FUELING THE TRANSFORMATION</B> are the laws of the telecosm. They begin
with Metcalfe's Law: The power of computers on a network rises with the
square of the total power of computers attached to it. Every new computer,
therefore, both use the Net as a resource and adds resources to the Net
in a spiral of increasing value and choice. This means that any limited,
exclusive or proprietary network will tend to lose business to a more open,
accessible and widely connected network. Metcalfe's Law dooms all the dreams
of the Time Warners of the world to create exclusive and proprietary combinations
of content and conduit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a further rule, networks prevail to the extent that they feed on the
invention and creativity of their users, since the power of the computers
on the edge of the network will increasingly dwarf the intelligence of the
network fabric itself. For example, a 5ESS central-office switch from AT&amp;T,
commanding some 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and linking
some 110,000 lines, once represented the most powerful computer in a local
phone network. Today those 10 MIPS are infinitesimal compared to the collective
computer power of the tens of thousands of personal computers, each commanding
20 to 100 MIPS, linked by modems to the switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lacking an entrepreneurial environment of inventive users, the government-run
PTTs (Post Telegraph and Telephone) of Europe have been rapidly losing ground
to the U.S.'s more rivalrous RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies) and
long-distance carriers, and all have been losing ground to the explosion
of interconnected private nets. The U.S. has some 700,000 private networks
compared to just 14,000 in Europe and some 75,000 in Japan. Private nets
that feed on the creativity of their users will always tend to prevail over
public nets, such as France's Minitel or American's interactive TV projects,
that try to supply their entire system from a central office. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt of Sun offers a true parable of the Net. Back when the Internet
was the Arpanet, two routers were added to the system, but the routers'
hopping ratio (the number of hops to any destination) got struck at zero.
Because traffic always seeks out the optimal path, most of the traffic on
the Net rushed to these two machines, since they promised instant transmission.
Until the settings were corrected, the system was swamped. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the Net, traffic will always gravitate to the most efficient broadband
channels. If the telcos and software monopolists attempt to gouge customers
in a badly designed and costly &quot;top-down&quot; network, traffic will
migrate rapidly toward the freedom and bandwidth of a bottom-up solution.
In the engineering global Internet, these channels could emerge among bypass
suppliers using dark fiber; among low-earth-orbit satellite systems, such
as Teledesic and GlobalStar; among cable companies and renegade long-distance
suppliers; or among companies as yet unknown. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guided by the valuations of the market, capital follows a similar rule:
It is routed rapidly to the channels where it can be used more productively.
At present, afflicted by perverse regulations that bar phone and cable companies
from collaborating in the same region, valuations of these companies are
low. Meanwhile, analysis complain of the excessive valuations for ISPs,
such as Netcom, and their suppliers, such as Cisco, 3Com and Netscape. Not
only traffic but also investment flows to the least regulated and most enterpreneurial
arena. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A further law of the telecosm ordains that, in an age of dumb terminals
and phones, traffic flows to smart networks full of intricate software.
In an age of ever-multiplying computer power, impelled b Metcalfe's Law,
traffic flows to the dumbest networks that gain their intelligence from
the variety of powerful machines attached to them. A corollary is that,
along with traffic, capital flows to the dumbest and most broadband nets
with the most computer intelligence on their edges. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important of all is the cultural law of the telecosm. Networks
promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality. Television
is culturally erosive because its small range of offerings requires a broad,
lowest-common-denominator appeal. Linking to millions of cultural sources,
global networks provide a cornucopia of choices, like a Library of Congress
at your fingertips. On the Net, as at a giant bookstore, you always get
your first choice rather than a lowest-common-denominator choice. A culture
of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics of the Internet are mostly skeptical about the value of choice.
But choice validates freedom and substantiates individuality. Choice accords
with the inexorable genetic diversity of humans. It makes possible individual
aspiration and creativity. It is the lowest-common-denominator offerings
of mass-broadcast media that lower humans to the animal level, eclipsing
the differences that make us human, cutting off the higher aspirations and
inspirations that elevate us beyond our appetites, reducing us to an impressionable
crowd, zapping through the channels looking for a splash of blood or flash
of nudity or demagogic spiel of hate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In prophesying centralization and tyranny, the Cassandras miss the centrifugal
forces of the Law of the Microcosm, overthrowing all monopolies, hierarchies,
pyramids and power grids of established industrial society and endowing
individuals with the power to be transcendent and free. <BR>

It is a portion of George Gilder's book, Telecosm,which will be published in 1996 as a sequel to Microcosm, published in 1989and Life After Television published by Norton in 1992/1994.

Take George Gilder's Aug. 28 ForbesASAP piece, &quot;The Coming Software Shift.&quot; Lucky Forbes readersgot their copies in mid-August, smack between the year's two biggest technologyevents--Netscape's record-hot IPO and the release of Windows 95. Gilderused the timing to explain why creative energy and profits in desk-top softwarewould soon migrate from Microsoft to the Internet and toward companies likeNetscape. Needless to say, Gilder's point is controversial, drawing fireand praise from a host of computerdom's biggest names </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Nathan Myhrvold, Group Vice-President, Applications and Content Group,Microsoft </H3><BR><BR>As usual, George Gilder's diagnosis is dead-on. The software industry functionsby turning its fuel-cheap processing power, as described by Moore's Law--intovalue for consumers. In turn, software soon soaks up CPU power, fuelingmarket demand, which sustains Moore's Law. The software-hardware twosomeis about to become a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, with the addition ofcommunications. The three-way cycle will drive growth and value creationin each area at an even faster rate than we've seen so far. I begin to differwhen George frames the computer industry in lurid terms of battle. In reality,computer industry shifts are quite dull affairs. The multidecade declineof the mainframe has been a lot like watching a glacier melt. A leadingcompany fails to invest in new technology and ultimately finds its productobsolete. New entrants might capitalize on this, but most--including Netscapeand HotJava--blaze new trails instead. When an established leader does fall,the proximate cause is almost always slow suicide or atrophy through internalmismanagement; not the wounds of combat. The Internet means opportunityfor all software developers--new and old. Mosaic and its commercial descendantsare currently at the center of the cyclones, but their day in the sun willpass just as surely as it did for previous Internet standards like Gopheror FTP. The instant rise of Mosaic and Netscape foreshadows what Georgemight dub another Law of the Telecosm: In a world with easy electronic distribution,it is very hard to hang onto your position--easy come, easy go. A particularweakness of HTML is that it is a data format no different in spirit fromthe protocols of 1970s-vintage mainframe terminals. Next-generation Internetsoftware will use programmability at both ends of the pipe. Java is noteworthyand may play a role, but its hype falls into a very old trap. Every newprogramming language is heralded as a breakthrough. Fortran was going tocomputerize science and engineering, Cobol would revolutionalize business,and Lisp (and later, Prolog) would deliver us to the promised land of AI.The reality is quite different--new languages offer some modest benefits,but all of the real value resides in the programs created with them. Finally,I must comment on the obsession with finding the next Gates. Bill has beenmy friend and colleague for nearly 10 years, so the topic is familiar. Writinggreat software and founding a company is a first step, but that only matchesBill Gates circa 1976. The secret that made the Bill Gates of 1995 is tohave the technical and business skills to develop new product lines repeatedly.Microsoft is unique in this accomplishment. Our competition is invariablysingle-product companies, or ex post facto assemblages of them. I don'tdoubt that the next Gates will eventually appear, and the Internet may fuelher rise, but it's one hell of a tough act to follow. Scott Mcnealy, ChiefExecutive Officer, Sun Microsystems I'd like to compliment George Gilderfor so eloquently articulating Sun's nearly decade-old credo: &quot;Thenetwork is the computer.&quot; I believe in Gilder's thesis that we are,indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed, disposable software.Desktop operating systems, utilities and applications will soon be relegatedto peripheral status. The network will be the operating system, and, asGilder points out, this change is being brought about the almost incomprehensiblemomentum of the Internet. The ultimate change agent, Gilder suggests, mayin fact be Java, yet another technology that Sun has offered to the industryin an open and barrier-free way. Java is a programming language that createsthe first true network operating system for the globe, because it is safe,secure, robust, fault tolerant and, among many other attributes, platform-independent.Here's how we see it playing out. three computer science students from Berkeleyhacking code late at night will create a Java word processing program. Let'scall it &quot;NetWord.&quot; They put it on their Web server at http://www.netword.com.It will be free because these kids want fame first, knowing that will leadto fortune as with their hero, Marc Andreessen. It will be 100,000 linesof code versus 1.5 million for WordPerfect, because NetWord isn't boggeddown with all the APIs [applications programming interfaces] and other extraneousbaggage of typical applications that must interoperate with a specific operatingsystem, or have become overfeatured. So you're shopping for a new word processingprogram. You've seen the ads offering Word on sale for $249. Of course,you know that means you get the privilege of upgrading in a year for another$89. Your buddy sends an e-mail and says check out NetWord. You take a testdrive. It works! Cool! You are not alone. A few million others have heardabout NetWord. Now the makers have a following and in a few months theystart a company and offer NetWord 2.0 for a mere $2 per copy. You and 10million other avid followers have no qualms about paying the nominal fee.It sure beats the competition. In fact, at that price, you'll be checkingthe NetWord home page monthly to download the latest copy. As of the threecollege kids, they are now millionaires. Suddenly the OS that controls theCPU on your desktop is a legally of an old paradigm, relegated to a secondarytier in the software food chain. This means that Microsoft is now a severelyoverpriced personal productivity tools applications vendor with an OS businessthat is no longer able to &quot;captivate&quot; the end user by being theonly platform to run desired applications. Keeping API's secret won't workanymore. Controlling the interfaces won't work anymore. The wall is downand there's no turning back. So where will that leave Microsoft? Scramblingto explain to investors why the company's market cap is 10 times revenues,scrambling to explain how they can survive in the world of disposable, run-anywhereInternet software. Of course, the marketing muscle up in the Northwest willtry to figure out a way to play in this space. But playing now means playingon a level field. The rules are the same for everyone. They're spelled TCP/IP,Mosaic, WWW, HTTP, HTML and now Java--all the open protocols and languagesthat make up the Internet. It's barrier-free computing. It's consumer choice.It's a free-market economy in the information age, finally. From there,just about anything is possible. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Tesler, Vice President and Chief Scientist, Apple Computer </H3><BR><BR>To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring percipience,perspiration and perspective. Gilder has done it. He has combed throughthe attics of computing and assembled for the family a gripping album ofthe events and circumstances that created the phenomenon we call the Web.If the past is buried in clutter, however, the future is still more difficultto perceive, especially before the dazzle of Netscape and Java. In my view,the Web is a catalyst, but it is not all that matters about the Internet.The browser is to the Internet what the spreadsheet was to the desktop computer.Mosaic is the new VisiCalc, Netscape Navigator the new Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoftwould like to make Explorer the new Excel. Wall Street is as enamored withNetscape today as it was with Lotus when that company went public. Netscapeis a winner, but is the winner? With the aid of its ally, the Sun King,will it inherit the throne? Not necessarily. Where is the proprietary operatingsystem that runs not merely the equivalent of spreadsheets, but thousandsof applications? Where is the PI that some megalomaniac weaves into, well,a web, to attract, ensnare and ultimately consume hapless applications developersand most of the profits they worked so hard to earn? I hope that the namelessidealists who create the Internet on a daily basis succeed in their resistanceto central control more successfully than did their computer club counterpartsa decade ago. If they do, there may be no single successor to Bill Gates.If they don't then it's anyone's guess who will maneuver into that role.The drama promises to remain gripping. <BR><HR><H3>Howard Anderson, Founder, Yankee Group </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George - what took you so long? What is so surprising isthat you were so surprised that the Netscape revolution may supersede theMicrosoft revolution. Think back! Fifteen years ago, the office automationhype was about word processing, but the real revolution was electronic mail.Today 36 million Americans get their mail electronically and no one reallygives a damn about new word processing packages. Your beatification of MarcAndreessen is a little premature, don't you think? There are many visionaries,but few company builders. We in the venture community intuitively know thatthere is little likelihood that the visionaries will turn into the operatingmanagers new industries need. Other than Gates, who? What you have proposed(correctly) is that the peripheral becomes the major focus. Five years ago,the thought that IBM and the clone industry would become &quot;value-addedresellers&quot; for Intel and Microsoft would have been heresy. Now youare suggesting that the Internet will become the major focus--and Inteland Microsoft will be relegated to that &quot;value-added&quot; focus. Youare right. Nonetheless, quite frankly, the Internet needs three years tobe ready for prime time. Meanwhile, we will go through a sine curve of hype,backlash, then reality. Just when the naysayers sound and seem logical,the Internet will begin to fulfill its destiny, and that destiny is to becomethe most potent force in technology. And George, invite your mother to dinnerfor me. Of your technobabble family, she seems the most interesting! <BR><HR><H3>John Perry Barlow, Rancher, Writer, Web Guru, <BR>Grateful Dead Lyricist </H3><BR><BR><BR>I am enormously encouraged by George Gilder's discovery of the World WideWeb. I'm tempted to stoop to catty remarks about how long it took him. Lately,he's seemed almost alone among intelligent commentators in continuing tocredit the myth of the information superhighway--a belief that you can sustainonly if you don't know about the Web or if your perceptions have been profoundlyaltered by the reality-distortion fields generated within large contentconglomerates, telcos or cable companies, or the vast cluelessness thatis Washington, D.C. In fact, anyone using the phrase information superhighwayis almost certainly in the thrall of some large and doomed institution,or is a complete nimrod who knows only what he hears on television. Whichis, for obvious reasons, filled with people who believe in it. They're notgoing to be roadkill on it, by golly. They're going to find that on-ramp. . . hey, they're going to be the on-ramp! No way, San Jose! The futureof the Industrial Era media megaliths, whether Disney, Time Warner or, moreto the point, Microsoft, will arrive over the Web, not the mythical infobahn.The Web will be the end of them. We are up against a discontinuous leapas we hit the next layer of interactive complexity, both in software andin thought. It has now reached a point where about the only way to developall the scripts, scraps and code objects from which the next World WideOperating System (WWOS) will assemble itself is to grow them in the distributed,massively parallel amalgam of minds and processes that make up the Net.The Web is alive, and filled with life, nearly as mysterious, complex and,well, natural as a primordial swamp. Microsoft is a factory. You can't manufacturelife in a factory. You have to grow it in nature. This ___________ so new,really. _______________'s proprietary claims notwithstanding, I take thefirst WWOS, Unix, as proof that if enough graduate students type into enoughterminals long enough, they will eventually produce an operating system.And given enough graduate students, you can be sure that somewhere amongthem will be a Bill Joy or a Marc Andreessen. In accordance with Joy's Law,they won't be working at Microsoft. Furthermore, the Web and most browsersgive them a way to crib from one another, lavishly and easily. All that'snecessary to see the code that generated what's on your screen is to click:&quot;View source.&quot; All that's necessary to get your page employingsome of the same innovations is to copy and paste. This creates an environmentof dense autocollaboration. To see how productive it's already been in lessthan two years of existence, get on the Web now. This will make the micromputerrevolution look like a good start. Gilder's article is a fine thing. I'vebeen talking about the End of Microsoft for a couple of years and have feltlike a madman parading a ragged sign. When it starts coming from such impeccableseersuckers as George Gilder, it may be time to short a little of that Microsoftstock. <BR><HR><H3>Bert C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman &amp; CEO MCI Communications </H3><BR><BR>Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will becomesubordinate to the network; that the network will, in effect, become subordinateto the network; that the network will, in effect, become everything andthe only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution and impact of theInternet and the resultant focus on content. Gilder's allusions to Gatesand Microsoft, however, yield a very real question: Can they deal with thecoming transformation? Doing so will require a new vision of the futureand a new understanding of merging industries, evolving ways of computing,and some hard new facts. Here's a key one: Companies that don't addressand act on the need for collaborative work from a widening universe willfall hard--and fast. Confronting any rival with the market dominance ofMicrosoft will be very difficulty. But trying to run in place could be evenharder. The challenge is not only to understand, as Gilder writes, &quot;thatyour computer will never be the same&quot;--but also that it's your companythat will never be the same. Dan Lynch, Founder, Interop Chairman, CybercashGilder has got it figured out. His article is dead-on about how the Internetis the architecture of the future for information dissemination. Want proof?Pouring huge resources into its Microsoft Network and Microsoft Navigatorofferings, Microsoft admits that it does not really know the business modelfor how to make money in this new arena, but it is determined to get onthe playing field in a big way. Meanwhile, Sun is too hooked on hardwareprofits to make a new fortune on this round. No doubt that Java is the righttechnology for making the Net be the center of the universe. Sun shouldsimply spin that group out as a new company unfettered by dragging alonghardware. The only fault I find with Gilder's article is his picking MarcAndreessen as the next Bill Gates. Marc only has a few percent of Netscapestock; Bill has tons of Microsoft stock. Marc will make a lot of othersmuch richer and he surely won't suffer, but he will not become a feared/lovedmogul because of Netscape. Maybe he and Bill Joy should bolt and start theirown company? Marc is still younger than Gates was when Microsoft got itsplum from IBM. I asked Marc one question when I met him during his briefstint at EIT in Menlo Park. What was the central design assumption for Mosaic?He said 45 megabits per second! I asked why. He said that it makes it easyto program because you do not have to develop hairy mechanisms to mask outthe slowness of the network. Then commercial reality set in when he andJim Clark got together and they recentered their Netscape Navigator forthe 14.4 kilobit world, thus giving us the MS-DOS of the Internet. It isa good start, but Marc was right about 45 megabits--only it is not justto make the programmer's life easy, it is to make the consumer's life joyful.<BR><HR><H3>Nicholas Negroponte, Director, MIT media Lab Author, Being Digital </H3><BR><BR>Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past and futureof the Net is on the digital dime and, as best I hear from my colleaguesat the MIT Media Lab, Java is really hot. We're betting our house on it.The Net, however, is no place for kings. It is a collective intelligencethat will work in spite of government and any attempts to control it. NoCarnegies, Rockefellers or Harrimans this time. The white envelope, George,is empty. When Larry Roberts invented the Internet in 1969, his decentralistapproach made the idea interesting for the military, because it was fail-safe.More than 25 years later, after the Vietnam and Cold wars, the Net is alsosafe from dominance of any kind. Supercomputer &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Unixhackers and Media Lab alumni have moved it forward (not Windows or Mac users),because they are made of the right stuff. This is serious media and computerscience, not the world of Windows applications. Here is where George iswrong. The next Bill Gates is not Marc Andreessen. Yes, Marc will do verywell. However, if you were a sucker to pay $75 per share for Netscape atthe opening on Aug. 9, keep it to yourself (if I hadn't been traveling betweenRio and Buenos Aires that day, I would have sold short and made 25 pointsin a few minutes). There will be many browsers, hundreds of them. Today,I'll bet on Niki Grauso's, which will come out in 37 languages. Browsersare the surface of a much deeper phenomenon. Sun Microsystems has it right:Java. Why? Because Java is a language and many smart people will expressthemselves and invent new applications in that language. Netscape is butone awning on the Virtual Boulevard of Digital Cafes. Java is the coffee.<BR><HR><H3>Andy Grove, President and CEO, Intel </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George--you haven't met a new technology you didn't like,and conversely you haven't met an older one that you don't think is readyto be toppled by the new. Do you remember when you wrote that &quot;specializedcomputers-to-a-chip will become the prevailing product category&quot;? Well,it didn't happen. Not that silicon compilers were back, not that ASICs areinsignificant, but the general-purpose computer that you pooh-poohed hasbecome the prevailing paradigm of the subsequent six years since the publicationof Microsm. Now you predict that the PC will become a peripheral attachedto an all-knowing, all-powerful Internet. I don't think so, George. Notthat the Internet won't be important; I look at it as one of the most importantapplications that will be used on my PC in the future. And that is the differencebetween us. What matters to me is my computer. I use my computer. I am usinga word processor to write this response; I use e-mail to communicate withhundreds of coworkers from my desk and from my home; I use CompuServe toget updated industry news; I use ProShare conferencing to do business withpartners across the world in real time. And I use Netscape to check outa new home page that I have hears about. A couple of years from now, I mayspend more time in the Net-based applications than in some of the others,just as today I spend my time differently among my applications than I didfive years ago. My computer will evolve and adapt (as PCs have been so goodat doing) to the ever-changing mix of applications with which I work. Youare wrong in another area. Implicit in so much of your writing is a fantasy:the notion of high-bandwidth communications reaching every PC. Today mycomputer is connected with ISDN to other computers; it is also connectedto LANs and to an ordinary phone line. Five years from now, my computerwill still be connected to an ordinary phone line and to ISDN, but alsoto broadband networks via a cable modem and to an ATM network to reach otherluck computer users; and probably to do some kind of wireless connection.Ten years from now, it will be another set of communications transport media.But it will never be a single superconnection, because goodness doesn'tarrive in a sing step. It comes a little at a time. To be sure, if God erasedall computers and networks and forced us to start from scratch, we wouldcertainly come a lot closer to your utopian view of broadband to the computer,with intelligence cleverly distributed between network and computers. Butthen, if God erased New York City, it would not be rebuilt the way it istoday. In real life, both cities and computer networks evolve, incrementby valuable increment. The bottom line is this: The magic of the PC businessis that there is a computer that I can look at, put my hands on and say,&quot;This computer is mine, and it opens the universe of tens of millionsof computers to me through its screen and keyboard--and whatever connectionscheme is available to me.&quot; Don't bury this magic; cherish it. <BR><HR><H3>Andy Kessler, Partner, Unterberg Harris </H3><BR><BR>Once again, my colleague and trendtender, George Gilder, has eloquentlyset forth the next wave of innovation. But in the process, the PC or clientdevice will not be hollowed out. Rather than living with fast servers andPCs acting as relatively dumb terminals, which is the architecture of Mosaicand the Web and even Java so far, the endgame is instead a network whereevery device is a server, even your own lousy PC. This means terribly intelligentand &quot;fat&quot; clients, enabling rather than just hanging off the network.Moreover, it is much too early to be handing out crowns to the new kingsof the network. George's trends are dead-on, but the kings are coronatedby natural selection, not by just showing up and claiming the throne. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen Manes, Columnist, New York Times, Author of Gates</H3><BR><BR><BR>Slow down, George! Sake's alive! Ma missed signs four and five! What sprangto mind upon reading Gilder's latest panegyric was not the rosey technologyfuture, but a Burma Shave ditty from my youth. I don't know Colombian beansabout Java, but I've been watching this industry too long not to reach formy methane detector when somebody announces in the language of corporatepropaganda that &quot;your computer will never be the same.&quot; This particularlocution almost always signifies too much time spent amid the rarefied gasesthat hove around chairmen and CEOs. A particularly toxic dose is to be suspectedwhen the proclaimed agent in change is an interpreted language. Interpretedlanguages have a long line of champions, not the least of whom is that greatBasic patron, William Henry Gates III (who seems less &quot;Archimdean&quot;than Charles Foster Kancan). But their magic has its limits, as Gates himselffound out when Microsoft developed its Multiplan spreadsheet on the interpretedruns-on-everything (but kinda slow) model and watched the compiled runs-on-DOS-only(but really fast) Lotus 1-2-3 force some massive recalculations at Microsoftheadquarters. Wasn't it only a few months ago that the press went gaga overGeneral Magic's interpreted Telescript, which now reportedly has, uh, someproblems? The runs-everywhere promise of interpreted languages generallymanages to get broken when it hits some Least Common Denominator--say, anotherLCD, the liquid crystal display. If you want to run Gilder's helicoptermodel on your crappy little Personal Digital Assistant, you may not haveto worry about having AutoCAD on your hard drive, but you probably willhave to worry about having a hard drive, not to mention a screen with enoughdetail and contrast to make the thing look vaguely like the original. TheIBM PC version of Multiplan was no prize, but it looked and felt great comparedwith the on that ran on the toy Commodore 64. Software is never truly independentof the hardware it runs on, interpreting programs tend to run with all thespeed of a tricycle, and bandwidth is still a long, long way from beingfree. <BR><HR><H3>Jesse Berst, Editor, Windows Watcher </H3><BR><BR>Mr. Gilder's article on the coming software shift is 10% fact and 90% wishfulthinking. Fact: Windows's dominance will come to an end when it is renderedirrelevant by a new platform. Wishful thinking: hoping the new platformwill be owned by somebody other than Microsoft. Gilder's fantasy of a Microsoft-freecomputer industry might come to pass if Bill Gates spent his time in hisvault counting his money. he doesn't He obsessively watches the horizonfor threats to his hegemony. When he spots a danger, he works feverishlyto use his current monopolies to leverage his way into the new arena. Hespotted the Internet danger about two years ago and has already spent morethan $100 million to make sure that Microsoft isn't left out. Yes, George,we will all eventually emigrate from the Windows desktop empire. But whenwe get to the new promised land, we're likely to find that Bill Gates hasalready acquired the prime real estate. Scott Cook, Chairman, Intuit Gilderchronicles invention like no other. He finds the history in the most recentevents. He finds the significance in invention before that significanceis real or realized. But Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future tellshow the innovations that reshape our lives follow their enabling inventionsby years or decades. Gutenberg invented movable type. It took another 40years for an entrepreneur named Aldus to assemble what created book publishingas we known it. Marconi invented radio exactly 100 years ago. It took another25 years for entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh and New York to create broadcasting.It was through broadcasting that radio reshaped our lives. None of us expectit will taken 25 years for this chapter of the Internet story. But I hopeGilder will tackle the next question: How will these inventions change ourlives? Gordon Bell, Research Fellow, Microsoft, Inventor of Digital VAXcomputer Telecosm, like microcosm, is another interesting Gilder story.Like transistors that follow Moore's Law, bandwidth increases at 60% peryear. The Gilder Fallacy is that transistors and bandwidth will also becheap. This may be true in the very long run, and I hope to live long enoughto see it. Meanwhile, the memory cartel has kept prices constant at $50per megabyte and the telephone cartel has metered out bits in 64 kilobitPOTS [plain old telephone service] = chunks for decades. For example, fullISDN lines (two voice lines) cost at least twice POTS. ISDN is also veryinelegant since it makes poor use of the precious last mile, and is notadequate or scaleable. Only modems, created by a new datacom industry, havegotten faster. My version of the Internet story is at http://www.uvc.com.It is called &quot;Internet 1.0 (Arpanet), 2.0 (today), and 3.0 (what weneed),&quot; subtitled: &quot;It's bandwidth and Symmetry, Stupid.&quot;In 1987, I chaired the cross-agency federal task force that proposed NREN[National Research and Education Network], aka NII [National InformationInfrastructure], aka GII [Global Information Infrastructure]. Our recommendationwas &quot;that an advanced network be designed and developed to interconnectacademic, industrial and government research facilities in the U.S.,&quot;with the plan for a factor of a ten thousandfold increase in bandwidth by2002. Things have gone according to our &quot;vision&quot; to maintain constantdoubling for the last 25 years. Thank goodness Berners-Lee created the http://wwwnetwork, aka the Web, so that Andreessen could build Mosaic and its viewers;that's the serendipity part. Public funding of research (this time at Illinois'National Center for Supercomputing Applications) &quot;saved&quot; us again.Intermixed in Gilder's piece is another story about a new Sun programminglanguage, Java, which when combined with the Web, will render Microsoftineffective. If that's the case, then Sun needn't support the anti-Microsoftlegal consortium and should concentrate on toppling it with their products.However, as a newly hired Microsoft researcher, anxious to work his waydown the corporate hierarchy to programmer, I hope that he's wrong aboutour undoing. Microsoft is its own greatest enemy if it fails to make everyproduct embrace the Internet. In an organization that has to keep with chaotichardware platform evolution, having an external standard and threat is thebest thing that could happen. Of the 50-plus million Word and PowerPointusers, however, perhaps 10,000 will see Java as an Internet developmenttool. More likely it's a tool for developing Internet tools. Word alreadyproduced HTML pages and PowerPoint should have the goal of being the mostused Internet content editor. I'll bet that Windows NT (created by DaveCutler, who also happens to be the world's greatest programmer) will becomethe &quot;standard&quot; server platform, just as the Wintel platform, likethe Gilders use, runs nearly all the viewers. As for staying in the centerof the sphere---Gilder's right: Andreessen's there, but I wouldn't countGates out . . . yet. <BR><HR><H3>Charles Mann, Contributing Editor, Atlantic Monthly </H3><BR><BR>The vision Mr. Gilder proposes is wonderfully attractive--who could notlike the idea of a future in which nobody has to struggle with the maddeninglimitations and incompatibilities of the PC? But the idea of plugging everyoneinto the Net for their work and play poses problems of its own, pride ofplace perhaps going to security. The number of Internet crackers and wannabecrackers is rising; worse, the very speed and ubiquity of the Net meansthat each new break-in technique becomes instantly available to all of them,as the spread of Root Kit an its analogues attests. Putting the whole worldonline will increase the opportunity for mischief enormously. At present,we have two basic means for fending off these guys--firewalls and encryption.Put crudely, firewalls are small computers that stand between you and theNet, scanning for unwanted incoming bits. (CheckPoint Software Technologiesin Israel, makes one of the more interesting examples). In one way or another,firewalls intercept and read parts of every Internet packet that comes yourway. If everyone's software is based somewhere &quot;out there&quot; onthe web, the computing power and bandwidth required to filter every screendump and rewrite through the firewall is interesting to contemplate. A worseproblem comes when the information is encrypted--how is the firewall toread it without decoding it? And if it does decode it, aren't you decodinginformation outside the intended recipient network? It's a problem. Forthis reason, most Net aficionados argue that some form of public-key encryptionis the answer. Leaving aside the extraordinary reserves of computing powerthat will be required to encrypt every bit of info going in and out of everysystem in the world--and the even more vexing question of who will pay forit, a subject on which I am not nearly as sanguine as Mr. Gilder--one hasto worry about the possibilities of breakthroughs such as those reportedrecently in Science, where researchers took advantage of the vagaries ofquantum mechanics to reduce the time required to factor large numbers enormously.Because encryption in its present form depends on the huge amount of timeit now takes to factor such numbers, these advances have dismaying implications.We could face a future in which advances in encryption and decoding raceeach other, Red Queen-style--hardly a situation favoring the confident useof a global network. Until these problems are resolved, they will be a bigdamper on the kind of bustling, productive, interconnected future that Mr.Gilder and I both hope is just around the corner. <BR><HR><H3>Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet Inventor and 3Corm Founder, <BR>InfoWorld Columnist </H3><BR><BR>To refind Gilder's model for how Gates gets dethroned, I'll briefly explainhow Gates made his billions. Gates came of age just as Grosch's Law aboutthe scale economies of bigger computers was giving way to Moore's Law aboutthe volume economies of smaller computers. Gates saw early and clearly theprofit potential in controlling standards, like the horizontal protocolstandards for communicating back and forth among computers, and like thevertical interface standards for communicating up and down between applicationssoftware and underlying computer operating systems software. I went withhorizontal protocol standards, namely Ethernet, which I advanced by givingit away to all other comers. Gates went with vertical interface standards,namely IBM's PC-DOS, which he advanced more shrewdly by giving it away toIBM but selling it to all comers. To build the value of PC-DOS, Gates gathereda huge flock of application software developers and got them committed tohis interface standards. Then by controlling changes to DOS's interfaces,upgrading them step-by-step all the way up to Windows 95, Gates was alsoable to sell them over and over again in upgraded forms. With that money,he could exploit inside knowledge of his own interface changes to pick offone after another of the larger application developers, like those in wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentations and, now, electronic mail and databases.His only major failure to date has been in networking, where he's failedso far to kill Novell. That failure involved control of Novell's protocolstandards rather than interface standards where Microsoft is king. Gildersays that Moore's Law is giving way to Metcalfe's Law, which projects therunaway value of numerous internetworked computers. According to Gilder'spoint of view, this exponential effect shifts importance from the verticalprogramming interface standards upon which the Redmond Rockefeller's fortuneis built to horizontal communication protocol standards which the likesof Marc Andreessen might be expected to dethrone Gates, perhaps becomingthe Microsoft of the Internet. But Gates, of course, aims to be the Microsoftof the Internet. And he need only broaden his tried-and-true interface strategyto include the protocols from the World Wide Web, now threatening his standardsdominance. Gates has the advantage of his current Windows monopoly, whichhe is now trying to leverage into control of the Web--let's hope our antitrustsheepdogs eventually arrive on the scene. Andreessen and company have thedisadvantage of coming from the virtuously open but fractious Unix world.Unless they can keep their Web standards act together, they will lose theWeb to the Windows Microsoft Network in the same way they lost Unix to DOS.MSN and Netscape will likely shape up to be the major opponents in the comingWeb Wars. MSN is making its play to replace Berners-Lee's Web standardswith its own under Blackbird. Microsoft is now giving away MSN browserslike Netscape and can be expected at some point to sell MSN servers andtools directly opposite Netscape's servers. Netscape, on the other hand,with its very busy Web pages is looking more and more like an on-line servicein competition with MSN, advertising and all. I must say that this battleis one that my InfoWorld readers will enjoy, as the fierce competition willdrive the Web toward its full potential. Gates doesn't need it, and certainlydoesn't expect it from me, but I do have to defend him. Andreessen and companyhave not yet made their billions, and they now look innocently charming,gregarious and eager, attractive compared with the shrewd and intense Mr.Gates. But, I've seen close up what even $1 million can do to people, andfrankly Gates handles his billions about as well as it is reasonable toexpect. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen S. Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. </H3><BR><BR>Gilder's gushing hype has finally come full circle. He has come to the keyrecognition that there's more to the information age than the alluring powerof Moore's Law. This time-worn mantra of a vendor-driven rhetoric extolsthe miracles of performance of payback--the productivity paradox wherebystartling advances in computational speed fail to deliver the value-addedsolutions that truly matter for society as a whole. But now Gilder heraldsa new &quot;killer app&quot; in user-friendly browsers and new &quot;minimalist&quot;programming languages such as Java. But don't count on it--at least notyet. In the fast-track 1990s, technology must still come to grips with aprofound upheaval in American lifestyles. For the first time ever, white-collarworkers--fully two-thirds of the U.S. workforce--are being asked to up theante of their own productivity contributions through longer and harder work,squeezing family and leisure time as never before in the last 50 years.Surfing the Net in a quest for the &quot;best&quot; application--and learninghow to use each of the new tools--takes considerable time. And that's therub: Time-intensive surfing is in direct conflict with the harsh realitiesof a time-constrained era. In the end, it all boils down to return. Theaverage U.S. worker who has toiled under the burden of stagnant real wagesfor more than a decade will insist on measurable improvements in personalproductivity before squandering ever-greater amounts of leisure and familytime on an open-ended journey on the telecosm. However alluring the latestbreakthroughs in electronic shopping, banking, and video selection may seemto be, my guess is that they don't meet the hurdle rate for the averageAmerican. That's the crux of the dilemma that Gilder still doesn't get:The promises of the telecosm will ring hollow until new means of incomegeneration and wealth creation for society as a whole are created. At best,a flexible software paradigm is merely another means to automate existingtasks. The big steps come with applications that truly change the functionsof work and leisure. And they have yet to be taken. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Ellison, Founder, CEO and Chairman, Oracle Systems Corp. </H3><BR><BR>I believe George has it half right. The center of gravity is indeed shiftingaway from the personal computer and toward the network--specifically towardthe Internet's World Wide Web. Despite the Clinton administration's mostdetermined regulatory efforts, networks are getting faster and cheaper.Various telecommunication bills pending in Congress will decrease regulation,increase competition and accelerate this trend. Cost and ease-of-use improvements,plus video capability, will make the World Wide Web as popular as the familiarTV and telephone networks for communication and commerce, as well as forinformation and entertainment. Bandwidth will expand exponentially and sowill the quality and quantity of information on the Net. The informationage will move from dawn to full daylight. And our world will be changed.But probably not by Netscape: Wall Street and Mr. Gilder are greatly charmedby he most exciting startup since 3DO, but it is important to remember thatNetscape's improbably $2.4 billion valuation comes without earnings or anyquick hope thereof. In the absence of any commercial competition, Netscapewas able to achieve a 70% =&quot;market share&quot; by distributing itsbrowser for free via the Internet. When a clearly superior Browser becomesavailable, people will replace their Netscape browser just the way theygot it--with the touch of a button. The most important new feature announcedfor a future version of the Netscape browser in Sun's hot new Java programminglanguage, which Sun is trying to make an open standard. We're all for it,but you don't get to be the next Microsoft by distributing Sun softwareand helping create open standards. You get to be Microsoft by creating yourown proprietary standard, while convincing everybody it's actually an openstandard. Fortunately, this trick usually works only once, so there willbe no new Microsoft. One is quite enough, thank you. Marc Andreessen isnot Bill Gates. It's probably possible to be great without being Bill. Butit takes a lot of work. Gates is the chairman of Microsoft, the CEO, itsfounder and the man who makes every key hiring decision. Andreessen is neitherchairman (that's Jim Clark), nor CEO (that's Jim Barksdale), but a hiredgun. Hired, in fact, by Jim Clark. History generally shows us only one Rockefellerper industry--the first one tends to get rid of future rivals. If a cosmicshift causes King Bill to lose his throne, it will not be filled by Andreessenor anybody else. There is no next Bill Gates--in software--at least. <BR><HR><H3>Steve Case, President and CEO, America Online </H3><BR><BR>I have a simple request: Let's not forget about the customer. A &quot;realitygap&quot; exists between technologists (breathlessly enchanted with thelatest and greatest revolutionary developments) and the mass consumer market(inevitably preferring evolutionary incrementalism). Invariably, developershave powerful workstations, superfast networks, and a certain affinity forcomplexity. Meanwhile, tens of millions of people out there struggle withmemory-deprived 386s, painfully slow modems (in the real world 14.4 kbpsis considered pretty fast, and 28.8 kbps is the promised land), and a tremendousthirst for simplicity. Yes, telephone companies are getting more aggressivewith ISDN pricing and marketing, and developers are reaching for plug-and-playsolutions, but it's still too hard and still too expensive. Yes, cable companiesare testing cable modems, but the tests are going slowly and broad deploymentis likely to take many years. Switching gears to software, Gilder embracesthe commonly held notion that Netscape's browser is the standard, commandinga dominant (&quot;70%&quot;) market share. But all of the commercial on-lineservices now provide Web access, and they have overnight become the dominantforce in the consumer Web. Neither of the two largest existing players (AOLand CompuServe), nor the most significant entrant (Microsoft), are Netscape'slicensees, so Netscape's market share is therefore zero in this emergingsegment. The already fragmented Web market is likely to get even more fragmented,creating havoc for publishers and confusion for consumers. Ultimately, theservices with the largest audiences will drive standardization. So whenI read about the &quot;dynamically portable&quot; Java, linked with theNetscape browser &quot;standard&quot; and coupled with a &quot;bandwidthtidal wave,&quot; leading a &quot;telecosmic advance&quot; towards a worldchock-full of custom applets filled with tasty morsels of &quot;executablecontent,&quot; Exciting, but I wonder how -- and when -- it will all cometogether into a mass market for interactive services. People don't buy browsers.They don't buy objects. They don't buy bandwidth. They buy services. Theywant access to a broad range of content, packaged and presented in a friendly,useful, engaging manner, priced simply and affordably, with a strong underlyingsense of community. At AOL, our aim is to reach tens of millions of peopleand help shape this new medium. We will continue to leverage technologyto do -- but we'll also remind ourselves that although technologists believethe journey is the reward, for everybody else, the destination is what reallycounts. <BR><HR><H2><CENTER>George Gilder Replies: </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>When the responses to an article exceed the original in pith and pertinence,the writer may be tempted merely to step back, point and applaud. However,at the risk of revealing Forbes ASAP trade secrets, I will correct the impressionthat I am some kind of sappy seersucker who gets his information from dotingCEOs, perhaps in the telephone and TV industries. In fact, much to the irritationof the PR firms surrounding large companies, I invariably rely mostly onengineers, programmers and other technologists and consult the imperialsuits chiefly en route to the illuminati in the nether reaches of theircompanies. <BR><BR><BR>As Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has noticed with some impatience, I alsogive short shrift to the kind of macrovisions, strategies and statisticsthat float up to the top of economic models. These data are too light onthe technical details in which reside the angels and devils of industrialdestiny. For example, Roach remains perplexed by the &quot;productivityparadox,&quot; the lack of evident payoff of information tools, the failuresof the industry to surmount the hurdle rates of humbler households, allin the face of some 60 million worldwide prospective PC sales in 1995, exceedingTV unit sales in the U.S., with e-mail passing the U.S. Postal Service inmessage units. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are capturing some 50% of all theprofits of the industrial world and maintaining market share between 60%and 90% in most leading-edge products, while deploying three times as muchcomputer power per capita as either Europe or Japan. <BR><BR><BR>Roach trusts government productivity data and wage levels more than thedemonstrable achievements of U.S. companies and calls the conflict a portentousparadox. I say that both the wage and productivity data are largely bunkum,based on silly deflators that mostly fail to capture the plummeting pricesin the industry, while U.S. leadership in PCs, peripherals, networks andsoftware is the real payoff. PC companies alone have generated some $250billion in market caps over the last decade; Internet companies will generatetrillions. These bonanzas answer all the questions on hurdle rates and socialyields (though if you want to see some real high-speed hurdling in homes,wait until cable modems proliferate next year). The payoff of informationtechnology is the global leadership of the U.S. economy despite appallingpolicy mistakes from the Bush and Clinton administrations. <BR><BR><BR>Like me, Andy Grove likes to wrangle and I hesitate to deny him his pugilisticjollies. Among the new technologies I did not like from the outset are HDTV,interactive TV, TV shopping, game machines, Japanese fifth-generation computers,NMOS, videophones, flash memories, serial Crays, Thinking Machines, 3DOand pencentric PDAs. But perhaps we can make a deal. I will concede to himand Andy Kessler that the use of the term &quot;hollowing out of the computer,&quot;borrowed from the estimable Eric Schmidt of Sun, is hyperbolic, even misleadingin an absolute sense. But they should acknowledge that in relative terms,the balance between desktop and network is shifting sharply. After all,in five out of the six PC uses Grove cites, most of the value originateson the network. Nonetheless, I do cherish the PC; indeed, using the Internet,I believe it will displace both the telephone and television over the nextfive years or so.<BR><HR><BR><H4><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="177"HEIGHT="54" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>

would be fundamental . . . like being at the center of a sphere, where there
were opportunities--and problems, of course!--in all directions.&quot; <BR>

<HR>What will it take to launch a new Bill Gates--an Archimedean man who
sharply shifts the center of the sphere, alters the axes of technology and
economy, and builds a new business empire on new foundations? Who can inherit
the imperial throne in the microcosm and telecosm currently held by the
Redmond Rockefeller? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will open the envelope in a minute. But first I want to tell you about
a new software program called Netscape Navigator Personal Edition. I brought
it back from Silicon Valley in late June and put the package next to my
PC. The PC was proudly running a beta version of Windows 95. I had presented
Windows 95 with great fanfare to my 11-year-old son Richard as his route
to the most thrilling new frontiers of the computer world. Multitasking,
32-bit operation, flat memory! Object linking and embedding! &quot;Information
at your fingertips!&quot; But, all in all, he preferred his Mac Quadra 840AV
or even Windows 3.1. They don't crash so often, he explained. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live out in the boondocks of western Massachusetts where there are no
convenient full-service connections to the Internet. So I was much less
excited about Netscape than I was about Windows 95. I hoped Windows 95 would
put me on line through the Microsoft Network system. Some 10 minutes later,
though, Richard wanted to know my credit car number so I could choose an
Internet service provider. A couple of minutes after that, linked through
internetMCI's 800 number, Richard was on the World Wide Web, using the InfoSeek
service to examine my chapters from Telecosm on line, searching the secrets
of Sim City 2000 at Maxis, exchanging messages with Microsoft Flight Simulator
buffs, and exploring Disney. As far as I know, he is still there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, my brother Walter came by. He worked for a computer
company, New World Technologies in Ashland, Mass., that builds customized
Pentium machines and delivers them to value-added resellers within 48 hours.
Walter wanted the Netscape program. He took it back to my parents' farm
down the road and booted it up on a four-megabyte 386SX Dynatech previously
used to map the pedigrees of a flock of Romney sheep. Soon he was on the
Web scouting out the competition from Dell and Micron and showing off the
Gilder Web page. This intrigued my 77-year-old mother, who had scarcely
even noticed a computer before. I don't know how it happened, but before
the night was out, she too was on the Web, exploring catalogs of British
colleges for her namesake granddaughter who was soon to leave for London.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let me tell you about my introduction to Java, a new programming language
that menaces Microsoft's software supremacy. I encountered Java in early
June at a Sun Microsystems conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
downtown San Francisco. For a speech I was to give, I had planned to use
a multimedia presentation, complete with Macro-Mind Director images and
QuickTime video that I had contrived with an expensive professional some
months earlier. The complexities of Director prompted me to convert the
program to Astound. However, it required an external disk drive and ran
erratically with the eight megabytes of RAM on my PowerBook. I decided to
speak nakedly from notes on the coming technologies of sand and glass and
air. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following me immediately to the stage was Sun's amiable chief scientist,
John Gage. He decided to illustrate his speech entirely from the World Wide
Web. He began with a handsome page, contrived minutes before, giving an
account of my speech, headlined: &quot;Gilder Addresses Sun, Tells of Technologies
of Opaque Silicon and Transparent Silicon.&quot; Then he moved to the Gilder
Telecosm archives run by Gordon Jacobson of Portman Communications at a
Web site of the University of Pennsylvania's engineering school. Gage illustrated
his talk with real-time reports on traffic conditions in San Diego (where
I was about to go), weather conditions in Florida as a hurricane loomed,
and developments on Wall Street as IBM bid for Lotus. He showed the Nasdaq
ticker running across the screen. He showed animations of relevant charts,
cute little Java gymnasts cartwheeling across the screen, three-dimensional
interactive molecular models and an overflowing coffee cup, entitled &quot;HotJava.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
None of his information and images used a desktop presentation program,
whether from MacroMind or from Microsoft. None of them used a database engine,
whether SQL or Oracular. Indeed, except for the Gilder speech report, none
were created beforehand. Incurring no memory or disk drive problems, Gage
summoned all the illustrations to his PowerBook directly from the Internet.
The animations employed a new computer language, Java, written for the Web
by the venerable Sun programmer James Gosling. Java allows transmission
of executable programs to any computer connected to the Net to be interpreted
and played safely and securely in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clifford Stoll, calls it &quot;Silicon snake oil.&quot; But I call it a
fundamental break in the history of technology. It is the software complement
of the hollowing out of the computer described in Forbes ASAP (&quot;The
Bandwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December 5, 1994). Almost overnight, the CPU
and its software have become peripheral; the network, central. I had spent
working on a presentation on my desktop computer, using an array of presentation
software. But Gage improvised a more impressive and animated presentation
without using any desktop presentation programs at all. The World Wide Web
and the Java language were enough. Restricted to the files of my computer,
I struggled with storage problems and incompatible research formats, while
he used the storage capacity and information resources of more than five
million host computers on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly for my family, the limitations of my parents' barnyard four-megabyte
386SX didn't matter. The operating system also didn't matter. What was crucial
was the network gear and software. My brother Walter had installed a modem
that linked to the Web at an average of 24.6 kilobits per second. With the
Netscape Navigator, that was enough. Actually 14.4 would have been enough.
Enough to launch a new Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Admit it, the legacy version, once so luminous, is beginning to lose its
shine. You thrill no longer at his vaporware $50 million house, fenestrated
with $40 billion Windows, offering misty views of Daytona, Memphis, Cairo,
and other far-off places you no longer really care to go, even if--OLE--they
are swimming with GML 3D screensavers from London's National Gallery endlessly
hurdling the 640K barrier as if it were flat as a Mac. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the most essential level, Bill Joy of Sun illuminated Gates's dilemma
at Esther Dyson's PC Forum conference in 1990. Known as one of the great
minds in software, yet losing share inexorably to Microsoft, Joy seemed
to be moving into the role of conference crank. Year after year, he lamented
the prolix inelegance of the triumphant waves of Microsoft programs sweeping
through the industry: &quot;As we add more and more of these features to
older systems,&quot; he said, &quot;the complexity gets multiplicative.
I have 10 different packages that interact in 10-to-the-10th different ways.
I get all sorts of surprises, and yet because these things don't play together
well the power is only additive. I get this feature and that feature but
the combinations don't work. What I'd really like to see is a system where
the complexity goes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In software, complexity has long been rising exponentially, while power
has been rising additively. In response, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of
Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's
Laws for software: &quot;Software expands to fill the available memory,&quot;
and &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster.&quot;
Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their
previous releases. Compare Word 6.0 for the Mac, for example, with Word
5.0 or WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows with WordPerfect for DOS. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But none of this matters. Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly
exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the
Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every
18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.
The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on
the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates travels in the slipstream behind Moore's Law, following a key rule
of the microcosm: Waste transistors. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, &quot;Every
time Andy [Grove] makes a faster chip, Bill uses all of it.&quot; Wasting
transistors is the law of thrift in the microcosm, and Gates has been its
most brilliant and resourceful exponent. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, in the face of Gates's ascendancy, Bill Joy seemed to grow curls
and shed influence, as Sun played rope-a-dope with Hewlett-Packard and other
workstation rivals. In 1990, he retreated to a sylvan aerie in Aspen, Colo.,
to pursue &quot;advanced research&quot; for Sun. But his talk of small programs
and handheld consumer appliances seemed irrelevant to the company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, in early 1990, showing up late--in a Hawaiian shirt--to address
a formal dinner in Silicon Valley, Bill Joy had a great prophetic moment.
He cited the Moore's Law trends as grounds for granting the first five years
of the 1990s to Bill Gates. &quot;It's pretty much determined,&quot; he
said. Indeed, in the late 1980s, Joy had personally made a separate peace
with Microsoft by selling a large portion of his Sun holdings and buying
Microsoft shares, thus becoming the second richest of Sun's four founders.
(The richest, Andy Bechtolsheim, jumped even deeper into Microsoft.) But
then, around 1995, predicted Joy, everything would change. There would be
a &quot;break-through that we cannot imagine today.&quot; He even acknowledged
that the breakthrough would not come from Sun, but &quot;from people and
companies we cannot know today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to software innovation, he said, was smart programmers. Smart programmers
are hundreds of times more productive than ordinary programmers. And &quot;let's
be truthful,&quot; said the sage of Sun, propounding what has become known
as Joy's Law, &quot;most of the bright people don't work for you--no matter
who you are. You need a strategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere.&quot;
To the Justice Department, Microsoft's overwhelming OS market share and
its teeming armies of programmers seem a barrier to entry for other software
competitors. To Joy, Microsoft's size and dominance could become a barrier
to entry for Microsoft, blocking it from the key new markets of the late
1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is now clear that Joy was on target. The breakthrough is here in force,
invading and occupying all the commanding heights of the information economy,
from the media to the universities. It is the World Wide Web and its powerful
browsers, servers, languages and programming tools. Software on individual
machines still bogs down in the macrocosmic swamps of complexity. But in
the telecosm, yields rise exponentially almost without limit in proportion
to the number and power of the machines on the network. No matter how much
memory and other storage is created on the desktop, no matter what information
resources are assembled on CD-ROMs, no matter how powerful are the database
tools created for the LAN, the desktop imperium will pale and wither before
the telecosmic amplitudes of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, the number of machines on the network has been
rising between five and 10 times faster than the number of transistors on
a chip. With 1,300 miles of fiber-optic lines being laid every day in the
U.S., band-width is sure to rise even faster than the number of networked
computers (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The Bankwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December
5, 1994). This awesome transition presents a supreme chance for new leadership
in developing software focused less on wasting transistors than on wasting
bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A computer on every desktop and in every home? Information at your fingertips?
SQL Server 6.0? My son Richard yawns. Let's face it, Bill, that stuff is
yesterday. In the new era, Microsoft cant continue to feed on the microcosm.
But the leading-edge companies will move to the frontiers of the telecosm,
where collectively they will grow far faster than Microsoft. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, open the envelope. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's find a new Bill Gates. Start by adding 100 pounds of extra heft, half
a foot of height and two further years of schooling, then make him $12.9
billion hungrier. Give him a gargantuan appetite for pizza and Oreos, Bach,
newsprint, algorithms, ideas, John Barth, Nabokov, images, Unix code, bandwidth.
Give him a nearly unspellable Scandinavian name--Marc Andreessen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Put him to work for $6.85 per hour at Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) writing 3D visualization code on a Silicon Graphics
Indy for a Thinking Machine C-5 or a Cray YMP16. Surround him on all sides
by the most advanced computers and software in the world, under the leadership
of cybernetic visionary Larry Smarr. What will happen next? &quot;Boredom,&quot;
Andreessen replies. Supercomputers, already at the end of their tether,
turned out to be &quot;underwhelming Unix machines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then, for a further image of the end of the world, take him in the fall
of 1990 off to Austin, Tex., for two semesters at IBM. &quot;They were going
to take over the 3D graphics market, they were going to win the Malcolm
Baldridge Award, they were going to blow Silicon Graphics [the regnant Silicon
Valley 3D workstation company] off the map, all in six months.&quot; Andreessen
began by doing performance analysis and moved on to work on the operating
system kernel. In mid-1991, after constant delays, the company was finally
ready to ship a world-beating 3D engine. But the new IBM machine turned
out to be four times slower at seven times the price of the equivalent Silicon
Graphics hardware that IBM had bundled a year and a half earlier with its
RS6000 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) workstation. Austin IBM
returned to the drawing board and Andreessen returned to Illinois to get
his degree. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In both commercial and academic settings, Andreessen thus had the good fortune
of working at the very heard of the old order of computing in its climactic
phase. As Andreessen saw it, little of long-term interest was going on at
either establishment. But both did command one huge and felicitous resource,
vastly underused, and that was the Internet. &quot;Designed for all the
wrong reasons--to link some 2,000 scientists to a tiny number of supercomputers,&quot;
it had exploded into a global ganglion thronged by millions of people and
machines. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many people saw the Internet as throbbing with hype and seething with problems--Clifford
Stoll's book, Silicon Snake Oil, catalogs many: the lack of security, substance,
reliability, bandwidth, easy access; the presence of porn, fraud, frivolity
and freaks guarantees, so he says, that no serious business can depend on
it for critical functions. But to Andreessen the problems of the Internet
are only the other side of its incredible virtues. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;By usual standards,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;the Internet was
far from perfect. But the Internet finds its own perfection--in the millions
of people that are able to use it and the hundreds of thousands who can
provide services for it.&quot; To Andreessen, all the problems signaled
that he was at the center of the sphere, gazing in wild surmise at &quot;a
giant hole in the middle of the world&quot;--the supreme opportunity of
the age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen saw that, for all its potential, there was a monstrous incongruity
at the heart of the Internet. Its access software was at least 10 years
behind. &quot;PC Windows had penetrated all the desktops, the Mac was a
huge success, and point-and-click interfaces had become part of everyday
life. But to use the Net you still had to understand Unix. You had to type
FTP [file transfer protocol] commands by hand and you had to be able to
do addressmapping in your head between IP addresses and host names and you
had to know where all the FTP archives were' you had to understand IRC [Internet
relay chat] protocols, you had to know how to use this particular news reader
and that particular Unix shell prompt, and you pretty much had to know Unix
itself to get anything done. And the current users had little interest in
making it easier. In fact, there was a definite element of not wanting to
make it easier, of actually wanting to keep the riffraff out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The almost miraculous key to opening up the Internet was the concept of
hypertext, invented by Theodor Holm Nelson, the famously fractious prophet
of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; network, and son of Celeste Holm, the actress.
A hypnotic speaker, with a gaunt countenance and flowing golden hair, Nelson
seems an Old Testament Jeremiah from Central Casting as he rails against
the flaws and foibles of current-day computing. Hypertext is simply text
embedded with pointers to other text, instantly and full available by a
point and click. For the source of the concept, Nelson quotes an essay by
Vannevar Bush written in 1945 and read to him by his father as a boy: &quot;The
human mind . . . operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it
snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of
the brain.&quot; Projecting this idea from a single human brain to a global
ganglion, Nelson sowed the conceptual seeds of the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen can explain both the power of hypertext and its slow emergence
in commercial products: &quot;Xanadu was just a tremendous idea. But hypertext
depends on the network. If the network is there, hypertext is incredibly
useful. It is the key mechanism. But if the network is not there, hypertext
does not give you any of the richness.&quot; Hence, Apple's HyperCard and
similar schemes failed to ignite. The link is not hyper if it is restricted
to your hard drive or CD-ROM. Connected to millions of computers around
the globe, it becomes exponentially hyper. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The other thing about hypertext,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;is that,
even on networks, traditionally it had been developed by theoreticians and
people very deep in the computer science community, and they tended to worry
very deeply about problems like, 'Well, what happens if the information
moves?'&quot; As Gates put it in 1992: &quot;The idea of locating things
that move by their properties and dealing with the security and efficiency
issues, including using replication to do this stuff well, is a very tough
problem. That's what Windows's Cairo is all about. Three or four Ph.D. theses
talk about this, but a commercial system has never done it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen brings the issue down to earth: &quot;You've got a pointer at
a piece of information on the network, but Joe, who's running that information,
moves it somewhere else. Computer scientists would take a look at the problem
and say, 'Oh, the system doesn't work.' On the Internet, we look at that
problem and say, 'Oh well, here's another 20,000 pointers that do work.'
And may be we can send e-mail to Joe and he'll put his information back.&quot;
In other words, you don't wait for Cairo or Xanadu to try to solve every
problem. You go with the fabulous flow of opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's idea led to what Gary Wolf, a contributing writer of Wired, calls
&quot;one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century&quot;--a universal
library, a global information index and a computerized royalty system. But
Nelson's quest for perfection led to a 20-year adventure in futility. &quot;The
opinion of the Xanadu people to this day is that the Web and the Internet
are much too simple. They don't solve the problems. For instance, the links
aren't fully bidirectional. You don't know exactly who's pointing to your
page, and there's two ways to look at that. The way that Ted Nelson looks
at it is 'That's bad!' The way I look at it is 'That's great!' All of a
sudden anyone can point to your page without permission. The Net can grow
at its own rate. You get the network effect, you get Metcalfe's Law, it
spirals completely out of control. Isn't that fantastic?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1988, Xanadu found funding from John Walker, the charismatic recluse,
taxpatriate in Switzerland, and founder of Autodesk, the desktop computer-aided
design (CAD) company. As Walker prophetically declared in 1988: &quot;In
1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal
of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product.
And by 1995, it will begin to change the world.&quot; All truer than Walker
could have imagined, but it would not happen, alas, at Autodesk. Haunted
by dreams of perfection and hobbled by hyperventilation at the helm, Xanadu
misted over. Autodesk sustained the effort until it was mercifully terminated
by the new CEO, Carol Bartz, in 1993 at the very moment that a real Xanadu,
deemed hopelessly imperfect and inadequate by Nelson, was about to burst
forth efflorescently on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demiurgic step came from Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, creating
the World Wide Web based on a universal hypertext function. He launched
initial HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) governing transport on the Web.
He developed URLs (uniform resource locators) as a common addressing system
that joined most of the existing Internet search and linkage technologies.
He conceived the HTML (hypertext markup language), a kind of PostScript
for the Web. He made the system ignore failures (Joe's moving data could
not crash your machine). Thus, invoking a browser (i.e., a hypertext reader),
the user could point and click to information anywhere on the Net, unconscious
of whether it was in the form of a file transfer, an e-mail, a Gopher search
or a news posting, or whether it was in the next room or in Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Berners-Lee addressed a basic problem of the Internet from the point of
view of an academic researcher. But the real opportunity was to open the
Internet to the world and the world to the Internet, and that would require
more than a facility for cruising through textual materials. After all,
the bulk of human bandwidth is in a person's eyes and ears. For absorbing
text, as Robert Lucky, author of Silicon Dreams, has pointed out, the speed
limit is only some 55 bits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To burst open the Internet would require reaching out to the riffraff who
travel through pictures and sounds at megahertz speeds. To critics of a
more vulgar Net, such as Stoll, more riffraff sending a callipygian naked-lady
bitmaps and voluminous digital ululations from the Grateful Dead and QuickTime
first-step baby videos traipsing down the lines and wriggling through the
routers would soon cause a gigantic crash. Even some of Andreessen's main
allies at the NCSA shared some of these fears. At CERN, Berners-Lee opposed
images and video on these grounds. The technologists all held a narrowband
view of the world, imagining bandwidth as an essentially scarce resource
to be carefully husbanded by responsible citizens of the cybersphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Tim Berners-Lee alone could not burst open the Internet pi&ntilde;ata
and give it to the world. As Richard Wiggins, author of Internet for Everyone:
A Guide for Users and Providers, observes, &quot;During 1992 and early 1993,
graphical Gopher clients for the Macintosh and Windows evolved, and it appeared
that Gopher would outstrip the fledgling Web.&quot; It was the ultimate
broadband booster, Marc Andreessen, working with NCSA colleague Eric Bina,
who ignited the Web rocket. One late December night in 1992 at the Espresso
Royale cafe in Champaign-Urbana, Andreessen looked his friend Eric Bina
in the eye and said: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every Gates has to have his Paul Allen (or Jobs, his Steve Wozniak). Andreessen's
is Bina--short and wiry where Andreessen is ursine, cautious where he is
cosmic, focused where he is expansive, apprehensive where he is evangelical,
bitwise where he is prodigal with bandwidth, ready to stay home and write
the code where Andreessen is moving on to conquer the globe. Wildly contrasting
but completely trusting and complementary, these two--in an inspired siege
of marathon code-wreaking between January and March 1993--made Mosaic happen.
A rich image-based program for accessing the World Wide Web and other parts
of the Internet, Mosaic requires no more knowledge of its internal mechanics
than is needed by the user of the steering wheel of a car. With a mere 9,000
lines of code (compared to Windows 95's 11 million lines, including 3 million
lines of MSN code), Mosaic would become the most rapidly propagated software
program ever written. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen could defy all the fears of an Internet image crash because he
lived in a world of bandwidth abundance and fiber galore. He fully grasped
the law of the telecosm. Every new host computer added to the Net would
not only use the Net; it would also be a new resource for it, providing
a new route for the bits and new room to store them. Every new flood of
megabyte bitmaps would make the Net more interesting, useful and attractive,
and increase the pressure for backbones running at gigabits per second and
above. The Internet must be adapted to people with eyes and ears. They won't
abuse it, he assured Bina without a smile. After all, he knew he would have
to rely on Bina for much of the graphics coding. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was right,&quot; Bina says now. &quot;People abused it horribly.
People would scan in a page of PostScript text in a bitmap, taking over
a megabyte to display a page that would take maybe 1,000 bytes of text.
But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands
of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information
on the Web, and millions of people use it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working night and day at the NCSA, wrangling over issues, arts and letters,
music and Unix code at the Espresso Royale down the street, the two programmers
achieved a rare synergy. &quot;We each did the job that most appealed to
us,&quot; says Bina, &quot;so each of us thinks the other did the hard stuff.&quot;
Bina wrote most of the new code--in particular, the graphics, modifying
HTML to handle images, adding a GIF (graphics interchange format) decoder,
incorporating color management tools. Andreessen took the existing library
of communications code from CERN and tore it apart and rewrote it so it
would run more quickly and efficiently on the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As time passed, they brought in other young programmers from the NCSA--among
them Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Chris Houck and Aleks Totic--to port
the system to Windows and Mac machines. With help from them, they designed
dynamic forms with type-in fields, check boxes, toggle buttons and other
ordered ways of entering simple text for searches and other functions, beyond
simple hypertext pointing at a URL. For example, a dynamic form is now used
by Pizza Hut for ordering a pizza on line. Finally, because every change
in the browser required complementary changes in the servers at CERN--where
the physicists tended to be busy and glitz-averse--Bina and Andreessen decided
to do their own servers. The NCSA's Rob McCool took charge of this crucial
project. I<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
n the end, they had created an entirely new interface for the Internet and
new communications software to render it crisply accessible--a look and
feel that almost immediately struck everyone who used it as an amazing breakthrough.
In February 1995, Bob Metcalfe wrote a column in InfoWorld predicting that
Web browsers would become, in effect, the dominant operating system for
the next era. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browsers are now ubiquitous. Every major company and many minor ones are
building them. Some eight million people use them. IBM, AT&amp;T, Novell,
Microsoft, NetCom, Sun, Silicon Graphics, America Online, Net-Manage, Quarterdeck,
Quadralay, Apple, SPRY-CompuServe, Frontier Technologies, Delphi, MCI, Wollongong,
even the Spyglass spinoff from the NCSA--you name it--all these companies
are building, licensing, enhancing or bundling a browser. Many of these
ventures, led by Quarterdeck's smart hotlists and &quot;drag-and-drop&quot;
ease of use, have outpaced Mosaic and prompted a leapfrogging contest of
can-you-top-this. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what happens when an entrepreneur performs a truly revolutionary
act, supplies the smallest missing factor, as Peter Drucker puts it, that
can transform a jumble of elements into a working system--the minimal mutation
that provokes a new paradigm. In 1977, the relevant jumble was small computers,
microprocessors and assembly language programming. Bill Gates and Paul Allen
supplied the key increment: software tools and the Basic language for the
embryonic personal computer. In 1993, Andreessen and Bina set out to supply
the minimal increment to convert the entire Net, with its then one to two
million linked computers (today it's an estimated seven million computers)
and immense information resources, into a domain as readily accessible to
an 11-year-old as a hard drive or CD-ROM on a Mac or Windows PC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the same forces of exploding bandwidth, the same laws of the
telecosm that are wreaking revolution in hardware, hollowing out the computer--rendering
the CPU peripheral and the network central--are also transforming software.
All forms of desktop software--operating systems, applications and utilities--are
becoming similarly peripheral. The ever-growing gigapedal resources of the
Internet will always dwarf any powers and functions that can be distilled
on a desktop or mobilized on the backplane of a supercomputer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, for example, four researchers at MIT, Iowa State, Bellcore and
Oxford (U.K.) triumphantly claimed a $100 reward for solving a grand challenge
problem. They announced that they had broken an RSA encryption code of 129
digits that one of RSA's inventors, R.L. Rivest, when offering the $100
prize in 1977, calculated would take four quadrillion years for a supercomputer
to crack. They did not accomplish their feat on a single machine (none yet
exists that can perform these computations) but on a virtual machine consisting
of 1,600 mostly modest workstations scattered around the Internet. Similarly,
Gordon Bell in 1992 for the first time granted his achievement award for
price and performance in the application of supercomputers, not to a single
machine, but to a distributed Internet virtual system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Internet model even in these high-powered processing
applications portends and symbolizes a definitive reality, which gathers
increasing force as network bandwidth begins to exceed the internal bandwidth
on computer backplanes. From now on, the relevant computer is the network
and the ascendant software is Internet software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving the program away on the Net, Andreessen released Mosaic in binary
form, already compiled for any popular computer platform, and helped bring
more than a million newcomers to the Web in six months. In that time, such
an upheaval would even reach the notice of the management of the NCSA. At
the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C., a friend eagerly showed
Mosaic to Larry Smarr, who was visiting from Illinois. He was startled to
see that this new marvel was a creation of his own shop at the NCSA. Perhaps
he should look into it. Perhaps there was more to sell to Washington than
Fiber Channels between scientists and Crays. From that moment on, pushing
Mosaic became the chief &quot;grand challenge problem&quot; of the University
of Illinois Supercomputing Center. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After Andreessen's college graduation in December 1993, Joseph Hardin, head
of the NCSA, asked him to stay on at the center. But he added one condition,
namely, that the young programmer leave the Mosaic project. &quot;Some 40
people had a role in creating Mosaic,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't you think
it's time to give someone else a chance to share the glory?&quot; Reasoning
that they would have a still better chance in his absence, Andreessen left
for Silicon Valley. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After a few months doing Internet security functions at a company called
EIT, Andreessen attracted the attention of the legendary Jim Clark, founder
of Silicon Graphics Inc. and inventor of the Geometry Engine, capable of
3D graphics, that impelled SGI's growth. At loose ends, like most of the
industry's venturers, Clark was looking for opportunity in all the wrong
places--3D games, interactive TV, Hollywood. He found himself increasingly
entranced with the Mosaic browser. Hearing that the author of Mosaic had
arrived in Silicon Valley, he sent Andreessen an e-mail in early February
1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rest is history, in the accelerated from familiar in the Valley. Jim
Clark met with Andreessen and signed him up as the first employee of a new
company. &quot;What has happened to the other NCSA programmers?&quot; he
wanted to know. Hearing that Chris Wilson, who had helped port the system
to the PC, had left the center to join SPRY, Clark decided to act fast.
He invited Bina to come to Silicon Valley and meet with him on his yacht.
Avoiding temptation (Bina's wife was a tenured professor of database technology
at Champaign-Urbana and is wary of snake oil), Bina spurned the invitation.
Andreessen wrote him a glum e-mail: &quot;Sorry. It would have been nice
to have had you here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing Bina knew, Andreessen called him to announce that he and
Clark were flying to Champaign-Urbana and wanted to meet with Bina and the
rest of the key programmers the next day at the local University Inn. &quot;When
I got off the elevator at the hotel,&quot; Bina recalls, &quot;this blond
guy who reminded me of my dad stepped back, looked me slowly up and down,
and spoke: 'Marc said you could walk on water. I have never seen anyone
who could do that before.'&quot; Clark soon assured him he could stay in
Illinois. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to Bina, Clark spread a contagion of entrepreneurial excitement.
Then one by one he made seven of them offers. All signed up. By the first
week of April, Mosaic software was on the way and Jim Clark forgot about
interactive TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Greeting this bold new company, however, were rumblings about a possible
intellectual property suit from the NCSA. This surprise banished any idea
of using Mosaic in any form. That was fine with them. They knew Mosaic was
a quickly written hack designed for T1 and T3 lines running at up to 45
megabits a second at the NCSA. &quot;We knew that everyone had Mosaic,&quot;
says Bina. &quot;We were glad to start from scratch again.&quot; Moving
into a small office in Mountain View at a cost of less than $1 per square
foot, they set to work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the new company, then called Mosaic Communications, Andreessen ascended
to management. Bina, working in Illinois for all but one frenzied week a
month, immersed himself in creating the new code. They revised it to work
over a 14.4 modem. They focused on making it the only system that is fully
secure. They added new supports for more elegant layouts and richer documents.
Giving the program away on the Net, within a few months Netscape won 70%
of the Web browser market, which it still holds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important for the future of the company, they developed a stream of
new server products, which they sold to most of the existing and aspiring
on-line services and Internet service providers, from internetMCI and marketplaceMCI
to IBM's Prodigy and Murdoch's Delphi. Altogether, they had released a total
of 11 new products by midsummer of this year, from $50,000 secure server
applications to the $39 Netscape Navigator Personal Edition complete with
TCP/IP stack for full connection to the Internet in 10 minutes anywhere
in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street began pouring money on any rival company with an Internet
Product, the stock market became a Netscape imperative. This posed a problem
from Clark. There would be no difficulty attracting a frenzy of interest.
The question was, Where would they hide Andreessen during the road show?
Introducing him to John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and
other Silicon Valley clout, however, Clark instead resolved to teach the
young bear how to chew with his mouth closed, tie a tie and get to work
earlier than 8:30 . . . p.m. Then he prepared to place him in the nose cone
of an Initial Public Orbiting that would value the gang at hundreds of millions
of dollars, point Andreessen towards the Millenium and, with luck and the
right characterological chemistry, have a new Bill Gates for the late 1990s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is, well after 8 p.m., roaring down El Camino Real in his '94 red
Mustang, filled with pizza rinds, empty cans of Sprite, a mostly shredded
copy of the San Jose Mercury News and a bulging issue of MicroTimes smeared
in popcorn butter, talking with both hands to a writer from Forbes ASAP
hunched amid the clutter and stealthily searching for a seat belt. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly free of the NIH (not invented here) syndrome afflicting many of
his elders--his browser combines products from some 17 sources--Andreessen
was discoursing on the virtues of Java, a language he says portends a telecosmic
advance even more profound and enduring than the browser and related servers
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For creating innovative stuff on the Web, Andreessen explains, &quot;The
alternative languages are grim, Perl is limited to text strings. Telescript
from General Magic doesn't pass because it's proprietary. Tickle [Tcl] lacks
power and features. Scheme and LISP are dead. Visual Basic lacks expressiveness
and it is too much controlled by Microsoft. Dylan is still an Apple research
project. None of them are truly suited to the Web environment. Java is as
revolutionary as the Web itself.&quot; Tying Netscape to Java assures the
company a central role in a coming efflorescence of the Web more significant
in its implications than even the current manifestation. In the process,
it will invert the entire world of software in a way that may permanently
displace Microsoft from the center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Behind this development is not some 24-year-old geek from a supercomputer
center, but the industry's most venerable leader after Bill Gates, not only
Microsoft's most persistent critic and nemesis, but also its most eminent
defeated rival: Bill Joy of Sun. In engineering Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
streamlining the communications functions and putting it all on the Net,
Andreessen was following in the codesteps of Joy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy was not only a founder of Sun Microsystems, he was also the primary
champion of the Berkeley brand of Unix--BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
Unix--that he husbanded as a student at the university. BSD Unix was not
only Sun's essential software technology, but also the reference code for
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the basic protocol
stack of the Arpanet in its evolution toward the current Internet). <BR>

By upgrading the TCP/IP protocol to run on an ethernet rather than on only
50-kilobit-per-second Arpanet lines and then giving away the Code, Bill
Joy made the Internet possible. When Sun declared in 1988 that the network
is the computer, the network it had in mind was run by Bill Joy's Network
File System (NFS), and it incorporated TCP/IP. Says Eric Schmidt--Bill Joy's
Berkeley colleague, now chief technical officer at Sun and leading prophet
of the coming software inversion--&quot;Sun was selling the Internet before
the Internet was there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, because Sun computers running BSD Unix were the most robust vessels
for TCP/IP, the lion's share of all host computers on the Web are still
Sun's, and Sun is experiencing an unexpected surge of earnings in the wake
of the Web. Now the computer world is wielding Marc Andreessen's browser
to rush toward the Net, wrenching the sphere from its moorings in Redmond,
and allowing it to oscillate toward a new center in Silicon Valley. Even
Bill Gates, the last holdout against Joy's network standard, is now bundling
TCP/IP with Windows 95. Joy must feel that the industry is coming home at
last. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Gates ignited the person computer market by writing Basic for the
PC, Joy is launching a new era on the Net by supplying a suitable software
language, Java. Joy foreshadowed Java at the 1990 PC Forum conference when
he said, &quot;Large programs are embarrassing because they have a fixed
set of ideas and so much code that it's very difficult to change them. And
they all tend to reflect existing metaphors, not the new metaphors. Everybody's
using C++. That's a 'crufty' language. It's very hard to understand. &quot;I'm
starting a small group to try to do something small--Sun Aspen Smallworks.
I believe it's possible to do small systems of a few hundred thousand lines
of code that live in this world of persistent distributed objects with open
protocols [and] make an incredible difference--much more than an extra 100,000
lines on a 10-million-line system. So I'm looking for a few great hackers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The one he found was redoubtable Sun engineer James Gosling. Called by John
Doerr of Kleiner Perkins &quot;perhaps the world's greatest living programmer,&quot;
Gosling is a bearded man with shaggy blondish hair. He displays a subtly
wounded look that is possibly the effect of a career that, to that point,
had consisted mostly of brilliant failures. But, like Joy, Gosling was eager
to do something small to bring Sun into the world of consumer electronics
where a large program used no more than a few thousand lines. In 1992, the
company spun out a subsidiary named FirstPerson Inc. to pursue this market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to conceive a way to take news, images, animations and other
real-time functions in cell sites and base stations and download them to
handheld devices such as digital cellular phones. But with the Newton fiasco,
personal digital assistants began to fall from favor and Sun and the rest
of the lemmings decided to pursue the suddenly seductive siren of interactive
TV. Again, they would use the Java (at the time called &quot;Oak&quot;)
programming language, this time running not on cellular phones, but in set-top
boxes. Here, too, the programs would have to be elegant and compact to use
the sparse memories affordable for a consumer appliance. However, Like Jim
Clark--and everyone else--Sun would soon discover that interactivity merely
offers cosmetics for the corpse of a dying television industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At this point, the project was in turmoil and former Apple designer Wayne
Rosing, its first manager, was on his way out. In May of last year, Sun
technical chief Eric Schmidt entered the breach, collapsed the set-top project
into a joint venture with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had bought
RCA, and summoned Joy from Aspen. Joy returned and spent the entire summer
last year in Palo Alto working with Schmidt and Gosling to figure out a
strategy for Java. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the characteristics
of a language suitable for PDAs not only gratified Joy's Laws of software,
but also fit almost perfectly the needs of the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like many technology projects that seem to spring full-blown from the brow
of a genius, Java is in fact the fruit of a near-lifelong quest. Gosling's
career began at age 14 in Calgary when, during a high school tour, he memorized
the code to the locks on the doors of the computer center at the University
of Calgary. He then regularly admitted himself to read computer texts and
use DEC PDP-8s. He became so proficient that he was hired a year later by
Digital Equipment to write machine code to be used for analyses of data
on the aurora borealis from Isis satellites. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on to Carnegie Mellon University to study under the eminent Robert
Sproull and Raj Reddy, he wrote a text editor called EMACS, a Pascal compiler
and a thesis entailing the creation of a program to do drawings of levers
and strings in visual, interactive models. After graduation in 1981, he
joined an IBM lab in Pittsburgh, where he developed the Andrew Windows system.
The first major program that could control a window on a computer remotely
across a network, it never found a home. But it launched Gosling on a 15-year
struggle with the challenge of how to send programs across a network that
could be executed on other computers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling had a breakthrough in 1983 at a Sun Microsystems conference at the
Red Lion in San Jose. There, Joy observed Gosling's Andrew Windows system
dramatically outperforming a workstation running Sun View, and began a concerted
effort to recruit him. Soon after, Gosling came to Sun to develop a remote
windows system called NeWS (Networked Extensible Windows System). Initially
received with great critical acclaim in the industry, it was eventually
blocked by the X-Windows consortium despite performing far more efficiently
over a network. Long a student of object-oriented programming beginning
with the Simula language, Gosling followed his NeWS project with a compound
doc<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ument architecture, joining text and images. It, too, garnered much praise
and paltry use. Then came Sun's ill-fated pursuit of consumer electronic
products. Gosling set out to develop appropriate programs in C++. But it
soon became clear to him that this language failed on nearly all the crucial
criteria. In particular it was neither reliable nor secure, which, funnily
enough, turned out to be two sides of the same coin. &quot;The gun you shoot
the burglar with can also shoot you in the foot.&quot; That was C++. It
had pointer code that allowed rogue programs to invade and corrupt a target
operating system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Gosling began revising C++ code into something that has been termed &quot;C++
minus minus.&quot; Returning to the inspiration of Andrew and NeWS, he adapted
the language to enable real-time operations across a network. In order to
run a variety of different programs on a variety of linked devices, from
set-top boxes to palmtop remotes, he made it inherently platform-neutral
and nomadic. It would have to be a language at home on a network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The project ended with Java, an efficient programming language that is safe,
simple, reliable and real-time, yet familiar to anyone who has used C or
C++. Designed for PDAs on infrared networks, it turned out to be perfectly
adapted for the Internet. Many of Java's virtues are made possible by the
fact that it is interpreted rather than compiled--that means that it is
translated line by line in real time in the user's computer rather than
converted to machine language in batch mode by the software vendor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most languages are written in two stages. The first is source code, couched
at a level of abstraction that rarely reveals its purposes or algorithmic
procedures. Normally, source code is proprietary and not revealed to the
user. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second stage is compilation. The compiler translates the abstractions
of the source code into &quot;binaries&quot;--the machine language of a
particular computer, locked into the set of instructions that its central
processing unit can perform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java, by contrast, is compiled not to an instruction set peculiar to a particular
microprocessor but to a virtual machine or generic computer. Putting the
language into an intermediate binary form allows creation of programs that
are not locked into any particular hardware platform, but that can still
be adapted to run fast. The intermediate code is translated line by line
by a software program called an interpreter located in the target computer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java's interpreters take up a parsimonious 45 kilobytes of memory. Sun already
has Java interpreters in the works for Microsoft Windows 95, the Mac, Windows
MT and several flavors of Unix. Netscape will include the appropriate interpreter
in future versions of the Netscape browser. This means that any program
written in Java will be portable to any common computer platform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, this portability does not seem remarkable. All programs
written in C, C++ or other compiled languages can be ported to any target
platform simply by running the source code through the appropriate compiler,
just as Mosaic was compiled for various platforms at the NCSA. The difference
is that Java can be &quot;compiled&quot; line by line in real time. That
is, it is interpreted in byte-level code in the client machine. This makes
all the difference. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It means that programs no longer have to reside in the machine where they
are used, or be written for that machine in order to be executed by it.
Potentially, a Java program can reside anywhere on the entire Internet and
be executed by any computer attached to the Internet. The little interpreters--sure
to become cheap and ubiquitous as they are distributed by Netscape and by
other suppliers of browsers--make Java programs &quot;dynamically portable&quot;
in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamically portable programs are suitable for a nomadic existence on the
Net, rather than a mere settled life on the desktop. Java thus emancipates
software from computer architecture. It offers a software paradigm radically
different from the Microsoft model, which is based not only on static compilation,
but on often-concealed, proprietary source code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the entire world of new software is potentially available to every
computer owner. Rather than being restricted to the set of programs you
own, you can use any program on the Net, just as now you can tap any information
on the Net. You not only have data at your fingertips, you have programs
at your fingertips. This means &quot;executable content,&quot; as Joy describes
it and as John Gage demonstrated in his speech at the West St. Francis Hotel
this June. Whether a film, a graph, an animation, a real-time bit stream
on the Nasdaq ticker or the Reuters wire, a virtual reality visualization,
or a game, it can be downloaded to your machine with its program in tow.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Owning the operating system and associated tool libraries becomes irrelevant
to selling applications. Owning the application or channel becomes irrelevant
to selling the content. To the extent that Java or a similar language prevails,
software becomes truly open for the first time. The Microsoft desktop becomes
a commodity; the Intel microprocessor becomes peripheral--the key &quot;microprocessor&quot;
is the software code in the Java interpreter. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Interpreted or not, however, nomadic programs will not be permitted to range
the Net unless they are also secure programs. By several judicious alterations
of C++ procedures, Gosling made Java above all a secure language. Many viruses
depend on taking an integer in the program and using it to &quot;point&quot;
to a low address in the memory where operating code resides. Java removes
this pointer conversion function. In addition, incorporated into the Java
interpreter is a code verifier. As soon as an application shows up in a
machine, the interpreter does an instant virus scan. Finally, when Java
binary arrives at a machine, it will bear an RSA data signature that verifies
the source of the code and guarantees that it has not been altered or corrupted.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These security provisions make Java programs the first certifiable citizens
of the Net. As Java interpreters become ubiquitous, any application program
that is anchored on a particular platform and desktop will eventually become
a cripple, like a pro athlete who fears to fly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The computer hollows out, and you no longer are concerned with its idiosyncrasies,
its operating system, its instruction set, even its resident applications.
Instead, you can focus on content--on the world rather than on the desktop
architecture. If you want to run a helicopter model on your screen, you
don't have to worry about whether you have AutoCAD on your hard drive. You
can run a video of the helicopter without owning the right decoder, whether
Indeo (Intel's standard) or MPEG-4 (designed for portable appliances) or
dynamic JPEG. The helicopter flies over the Net with its own executable
code. The network is no longer a threatening place. If you want to use a
program from Finland, you don't have to worry that it will introduce a malignant
virus to your machine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your computer will never be the same. No longer will the features of the
desktop decide the features of the machine. No longer will the size of your
hard drive or the database in your LAN server determine the reach of your
information processing. No longer will the programs in your machine determine
the functions you can perform. The network is the computer. The computer
becomes a peripheral to the Internet and the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the release of Java and a demonstration Web browser called HotJava,
written in the language on the Sun home page, Gosling has experienced the
kind of sudden Internet celebrity undergone by Andreessen and Bina. Unlike
Andreessen, he seems somewhat baffled by it all. But in the long run, his
contribution may be greater. Browsers and servers may come and go, but successful
new languages are extremely rare. Java, or something like it, is the key
to a truly interactive Internet and a fully hollowed-out computer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Bill Joy made a presentation to the Sun board, outlining an upgrade
path for the future of the language. Joy is resolved that Java will not
go the way of Andrew and NeWS. Like Jim Clark, he has even turned to the
troubled supercomputer arena to find a treasure trove of new hackers. Sun
hired some 20 new programmers from the recently defunct but boldly pioneering
Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research. Presumably, they can learn
to think small. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling shakes his head at all the uproar. He now finds himself falling
thousands of messages behind in his e-mail. Linked to the Net by a mere
T1 line, even Sun's Java server broke down under the overload. But Gosling
himself seems to be holding up better. His speaking schedule has multiplied
to a rate of three talks a week. Scores of people tell him they are using
the language as a replacement for C, for IR (information resource) tools
and for other general-purpose applications. Giant Japanese companies such
as Sony and Sega besiege him. Finally, late in June, even Berners-Lee gave
Java his imprimature as &quot;one of the most exciting things happening
on the Web right now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A movie buff, Gosling sees Java, Netscape and similar programs changing
the image of the cypersphere from an alien and menacing dystopia, as depicted
famously in Blade Runner, into a realm resembling Star Trek, where computers
are trusted tools. Perhaps this transformation will favor the emergence
of the amiable and gregarious young Marc Andreessen as the paladin of cyberspace,
replacing the fiercely brilliant but widely feared Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Andreessen admits, a more likely outcome is a massive move by Microsoft
onto the Net where the two will enter battle with scores of contenders.
This month, Microsoft announced an array of Internet services, under the
rubric Blackbird, with many interesting features. But it works only with
Microsoft Network Services, which will not become truly widespread for another
year. Beginning with virtually no market share and a year or so behind,
Gates will become an under dog at last. Perhaps even the Justice Department
will notice. In the age of the hollowed-out computer, the king of the desktop
rules an emigrating empire. <BR>

<P>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska wants to know: With deregulation of telecommunications,
who will bring connections to Unalakleet, to Aleknagik and to Sleetmute?
Who will bring 500 channels up the Yukon with the salmon to the people in
Beaver? What will happen to the Yupik, the Inupiat and the Inuit? Will we
leave them stranded in the snow while the world zooms off to new riches
on an information superhighway?<BR>
<BR>
A senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Stevens is a key figure in the telecom deregulation debate on Capitol Hill.
As he contemplates the issues of restructuring communications law, he has
reason to be suspicious of the grand claims of an information age. He knows
that universal service--the magic of available dial tone in your own home--has
hardly reached rural Alaska at all. As George Calhoun points out in his
sort invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881 and now extended to some
95% of American households) are simply not feasible, either technically
or economically, in many remote regions.<BR>
<BR>
In Beaver, for example, there is one telephone in a hut linked to a nine-foot
satellite dish. Permafrost and cold economic reality make it impossible
to extend dial tone to the several hundred households of this town, even
though its average household income, mostly from salmon fishing, is some
$120,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ted Stevens is right to be concerned. Portentiously sharing his concern
are other powerful Republicans from rural states, including Larry Pressler
of South Dakota, the chairman of the subcommittee. Extended now from phone
service to broadband digital superhighways, their concerns could pose a
deadly obstacle to true deregulation of communications and thus to continued
American leadership in these central technologies of the age. At stake is
some $2 trillion of potential value to the U.S. economy (see Forbes ASAP,
April 10). The problems of universal service in Alaska disguise the more
profound paradox of telephone service in most of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the universality of telephones is crucial to their usefulness;
yet universal service using current technology is totally uneconomical and
impractical. Snow and ice are the least of it. The basic problem is the
architecture of the system, with a separate pair of lines, on average two
miles long, devoted exclusively to each user. It simply does not pay to
lay, entrench, string, protect, test and maintain miles of copper wire pairs,
each dedicated to one household that uses them on average some 15 or 20
minutes a day.<BR>
<BR>
Connections in cities are one thing. Urban access systems comprise a bramble
of millions of wire loops, each linking a home or business telephone to
a nearby central office switch. Under a half mile in length, these lines
still represent some 80% of the cost of the system. But because the lines
are short and often bundled together, city telephony benefits from economies
of scale and convenience. In rural areas, however, the copper lines cost
between 10 and 30 times as much per customer as they do in cities.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Calhoun reports that in general, phone companies cannot supply
ISDN (integrated services digital network) and other digital services over
twisted-pair wire more than 18,000 feet (some 3.5 miles) from the central
office. Perhaps a third of all the nation's phones are more than 3.5 miles
from a central office.<BR>
<BR>
What saves us is socialism. Closing the huge differential between the costs
of serving rural and urban customers is a Byzantine web of cross-subsidies,
whereby inner-city and business callers in urban areas subsidize the worthy
citizens of Kirby, Vt.; Vail, Colo.; Mendocino, Calif.; Round Rock, Texas,
and Tyringham, Mass., among other bucolic locales, to the tune of billions
of dollars. Overall, subsidies from business and urban customers to rural
and other expensive residential users total some $20 billion a year. In
case the cross-subsidies do not suffice to guarantee universality, Congress
has established a $700 million &quot;Universal Service Fund.&quot; For all
that, some 5% of homes still lack telephone service (compared with 2% unreached
by TV, which faces no universal service requirement).<BR>
<BR>
Lending huge physical authority to this Sisyphean socialist scheme are some
65,049,600 tons of copper wire rooted deep in the rights of way, depreciation
schedules, balance sheets, mental processes and corporate cultures of the
regional Bell operating companies and other so-called local-exchange carriers.
The minimum replacement cost of these lines deployed over the last 50 years
or more--and still being installed through the mid-1990s at a rate of at
least five million lines a year--is some $300 billion. By comparison, Calhoun
estimates, the telcos could replace every telephone switch for one-tenth
that amount while radically upgrading the system.<BR>
<BR>
In this cage of twisted copper wires writhe not only the executives of the
telephone companies, but also the addled armies of telecommunications regulators,
from the Federal Communications Commission and other Washington bodies to
50 state public utilities commissions and the towering hives of lawyers
in the communications bar. The coils of copper also subtly penetrate the
thought processes of MIT Media Lab gurus, libertarian lobbyists from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and myriad political analysts who see this
massive metal millstone as a fell weapon of monopoly power. The copper colossus
even intimidates scores of staunch Republicans who have arrived in Washington
determined to extirpate every government excess, but who bow before the
totem of universal service in their districts.<BR>
<BR>
Like any socialist system, the copper colossus will die hard. But die it
must.<BR>
<BR>
Some 20 years ago, AT&amp;T's long-distance lines comprised a similarly
imperious cage of copper wires, installed over the previous 50 years and
similarly impossible for rivals to duplicate. Then too, analysts termed
telephony a natural monopoly because the system could handle additional
calls for essentially zero incremental cost and because network externalities
ensured that the larger the number of customers, the more valuable the system.
These assumptions had led to government endorsement of the Bell monopoly
as a common carrier committed to universal service.<BR>
<BR>
Regulators, politicians and litigators always imagine that they can control
the future of telecom, awarding monopoly privileges in exchange for various
high-minded goals, such as universal or enriched services. But their actual
role, as Peter Huber and his associates show in their new text, Federal
Broadband Law, is mostly to promote monopoly at the expense of such values
as universality, which ultimately depend not on law but on innovation. As
a form of tax, regulations reduce the supply of the taxed output. It is
technological and entrepreneurial progress, impelled by low tax rates and
deregulation, that brings once- rare products into the reach of the poor,
always the world's largest untapped market.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, the decline and fall of the long-distance monopoly was not
chiefly an effect of politics or litigation but of technology. Effectively
dissolving the copper cage of long distance were the millimeter waves of
microwave radio. Over the years, it turned out you could set up microwave
towers anywhere and duplicate long-distance services at radically lower
cost without installing any new wires at all. But this realization came
woefully slowly to the regulators.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;above-890-megahertz&quot; decision of 1959, made possible by
new Klystron tubes and other devices that opened up higher frequencies to
communications, the FCC permitted creation of private microwave networks.
On the surface, it was a narrow decision affecting a few large corporations.
But as AT&T planners noted at the time, it represented a clear break from
the previous principles of common carriage, cross-subsidy and nationwide
price averaging in the telephone network.<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, over the next two decades a cascade of further decisions climaxed
with the authorization of MCI to emerge as a direct competitor to AT&amp;T.
Within less than a decade, MCI added to its panoply of aerial microwaves
the yet more advanced technology of single-mode glass fibers. Issuing some
$3 billion of junk bonds over a four-year period, MCI built the first nationwide
network of advanced fiber optics. GTE made comparable investments in Sprint,
and AT&T rushed to excel its new rivals. Combining microwave with fiber,
long-distance telephony became a technologically aggressive and openly competitive
arena; AT&amp;T's monopoly was a thing of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the remaining monopolies in local phone service face a threat from
radio technology still more devastating than the microwave threat to AT&T in
long distance. As with microwaves, the government--in the name of preventing
monopoly--dallied for decades before acting to allow elimination of the
monopolies it had earlier established. After the invention of cellular at
Bell Labs in 1947, some 34 years passed before the FCC finally began granting
licenses for cellular telephony. By the 1980s, the FCC and Judge Harold
Greene, managing the Modified Final Judgment breaking up AT&amp;T, permitted
limited competition in wireless telephony. However, the FCC allocated half
the metropolitan licenses to existing RBOCs, which had no interest in using
wireless to attack the local loop monopoly. The other licenses it assigned
by lottery to gamblers and financiers with no ability to create an alternative
local loop. The process of buying out the spectrum speculators required
leading wireless carriers to hobble themselves with huge amounts of junk-bond
debt. Although McCaw Cellular Communications created a robust national system,
its financial structure prevented aggressive price competition with wireline
service.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the idea persists that wireless telephony is an expensive supplement
to the existing copper colossus rather than a deadly rival of it. The installed
base of twisted-pair wire still appears to many to be a barrier to entry
for new competitors in the local loop, rather than a barrier to RBOC entry
into modern communications markets. The conventional wisdom sees the electromagnetic
spectrum as a scarce resource. Few believe that it will soon emerge as a
cheaper and better alternative to the local loop, in the same way that microwave
emerged as a cheaper and better substitute for copper long-distance wires.

Making Waves</B></PRE>
At the foundation of the information economy, from computers to telephony,
is the microcosm of semiconductor electronics. It reaches out in a fractal
filigree of wires and switches that repeat their network patterns at every
level from the half-adder in a calculator chip or the SLIC in a telephone
handset to the coaxial trees and branches of a cable TV system or the mazes
of switched and routed lines in the global Internet. In computers, engineers
lay out the wires and switches across the tiny silicon substrates of microchips.
In telecommunications, engineers lay out the wires and switches across the
mostly silicon substrates of continents and seabeds. But it is essentially
the same technology, governed by quantum science and electrical circuit
theory.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor engineers may still spend more of their time with circuit
theory, contemplating the operations of resistors, inductors and capacitors
on currents and voltages in the device. But quantum theory is most fundamental,
because it allows humans for the first time to manipulate matter from the
inside--to control the conduction bands and energy-band gaps of the internal
atomic structure of silicon and other elements, and to make electrons, holes
and photons leap and lase at the behest of the designer. It is quantum theory
that allows chip engineers to control with exquisite precision, gauged in
tenths of microns and trillionths of seconds, the movements of electrons
at the heart of electronics.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of quantum theory, however, is a perplexing duality. Most of
contemporary physics seems to deal with particles--electrons, quarks, leptons,
neutrons, protons. In 1994, for example, scientists at Fermilabs in Chicago
announced &quot;discovery&quot; of the &quot;top quark,&quot; which they
described as the &quot;last building block of matter.&quot; Yet these entities
manifest themselves only in the midst of explosions in which their wave
signatures can be identified. So-called quantum particle theory is unintelligible
without quantum wave theory.<BR>
<BR>
The elements of quantum physics intrinsically combine the characteristics
of particles--definite specks of mass--with the characteristics of waves--
an infinite radiance of fields and forces. Entirely unlike particles, waves
merge, mingle and mesh in vectors and tensors propagating boundlessly through
space.<BR>
<BR>
It is this paradoxical combination of the definite with the infinite that
gives the microcosm its promise as a medium, not only for computation in
one place, but for communications everywhere. Spectrum unfolds in a global
ethersphere of interpenetrating waves that reach in a self- similar fractal
pattern from the plasmas of semi-conductor lasers through the ethers of
the planet.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the telecosm of modern communications brings decisively to the fore
the wave side of the quantum duality. Wires may seem more solid and reliable
than air. But the distinction is largely spurious. In proportion to the
size of its nucleus, an atom in a copper wire is as empty as the solar system
is in proportion to the size of the sun. The atmosphere and wires are alternative
media, and to the electron or photon are only arbitrarily distinguishable.
Whether insulated by air or by plastic, both offer resistance, capacitance,
inductance, noise and interference. In thinking about communications, the
concept of solidity is mostly a distraction. The essence of new devices
emerges more and more as manifestations of waves.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in the air or in a wire, the electrons or photons do not travel;
they wiggle their charges, causing oscillations that pass through the medium
at close to the speed of light. As in waves of water, the wave moves, but
the molecules of water stay in the same place. Thus belied is the analogy
of particles or even bullets favored by physics teachers who give primacy
to the mass rather than to the wave. Since the age of carrier pigeons and
catapults, communications systems have transmitted masses only in the postal
services.<BR>
<BR>
Today, even in entirely stationary electronic systems, the wave action is
increasingly dominant. The microchip itself--a Pentium processor, say--now
runs at 120 megahertz, a rate in cycles per second that puts it in the middle
of the FM radio band. New computers must pass the FCC requirements for radio
emissions. Texas Instruments now advertises its 486 SXL-66 microprocessors
as selling for under 50 cents per megahertz. Increasingly in the world of
computers, people speak of bandwidth and cycles, reserving the discussion
of mass chiefly for the batteries. The world of the telecosm is subtly shifting
from electronics, with its implicit primacy of electrons, to what might
be termed spectronics, seeing the particle as an expression of the wave
rather than the other way around--moving from Bohr's atom and Heisenberg's
electronic uncertainty to Maxwell's rainbow and Schrodinger's wave equation.<BR>
<BR>
In a global marketplace increasingly unified by telecommunications at the
speed of light, the vision of waves as fundamental affords not only a better
image of physics, but also a better purchase on economic reality than a
spurious search for solid states, physical resources, national economies
and commodity products.<BR>
<BR>
Conceived as some irreducible essence, the particle of mass, whether in
the form of a top quark or Higgs boson, wire conduit or central switch,
pushes our thinking about the world toward a vision of ultimately discrete
and confinable entities, with electrons moving through the p-n junctions
of microchips like so many steel ingots crossing a national border. Conceived,
by contrast, as a continuous span of waves and frequencies, tossing and
cresting, reflecting, diffusing, superposing and interfering, the telecosmic
vision accords with the ever-rising global commerce in information services--ubiquitous,
simultaneous, convergent, emergent.<BR>
<BR>
To grasp the next phases of the information economy, one begins not with
the atom or any other discrete entity, but with the wave. In 1865, in a
visionary coup that the late Richard Feynman said would leave the American
Civil War of the same decade as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by
comparison, Scotch physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic
spectrum. This spread of frequencies usable for communications is both the
practical resource and the most profound metaphor for the global information
economy.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a domain of limits, to be husbanded by governments and appropriately
allocated by auctions at a price of billions of dollars for a tiny span
of wiggle rates? Is it beachfront property to be coveted as a finite and
unrenewable resource? Is it a constricted domain to be exploited under the
iron laws of diminishing returns? Is it a zero-sum game to erupt in Star
Wars and street fights as satellite magnates and personal communications
entrepreneurs crowd into a feudal fray of frequencies? At the heart of the
gathering abundance of the information economy, would it sustain a new economics
of scarcity?<BR>
<BR>
So one might imagine from today's conventional wisdom. Contemplating these
limits, diminishing returns and zero-sum economics at Richard Shaffer's
Mobile Forum in March was industry guru Carl Robert Aron. He sees the world
of wireless entering a &quot;new ice age,&quot; like the recent ordeal of
the tire industry in the face of radials. He predicts that customers, capital
and revenues will become increasingly scarce and many species of company
will become extinct. Offering a similarly grim vision, BellSouth Vice President
of Corporate Development Mark Feidler declares that the price elasticity
of demand for telephony is negative--you lower the price and revenues will
sink. On the same panel, AT&amp;T-McCaw executive Rod Nelson asserted that
he could see no threat from personal communications services, because McCaw
was already offering &quot;a low-priced, high-quality service.&quot; Even
Martin Cooper of ArrayComm saw spectrum as a limited resource sure to grow
more valuable over time.<BR>
<BR>
What would Maxwell say? As he discovered it, the spectrum is infinite, ubiquitous,
instantaneous and cornucopian. Infinite wave action, not the movement of
masses, is the foundation of all physics. It ushers in an age of boundless
bandwidth beyond the dreams of most communications prophets. As industry
guru Ira Brodsky concludes in his authoritative new book, Wireless: The
Revolution in Personal Communications, &quot;We are quickly moving from
the era of spectrum shortage to the age of spectrum glut.&quot; This expanding
wavescape is the most fertile frontier of the information economy. In its
actions are the essential character of the coming economics of abundance
and increasing returns.<BR>
<BR>
In contemporary networks, as Nicholas Negroponte stresses in his best-selling
book, Being Digital, all bits are fungible. In spectronics, all spectrum
is fungible. In particular, the distinction between wireline and wireless
service dissolves. A wire is just a means of spectrum reuse. Down adjacent
wires, appropriately twisted or insulated, you can transmit the same frequencies
without fear of interference or noise.<BR>
<BR>
Using new digital radio technologies, such as code division multiple access
or smart and directional antenna systems, you can similarly beam the same
frequencies through the atmosphere, insulated by air. The chief difference
is that the wire system costs far more to install and inhibits mobility.<BR>
<BR>
The only wire technology commanding a decisive edge over wireless for critical
applications is fiber optics. The intrinsic bandwidth of a fiber thread
is nearly 1,000 times larger than the bandwidth of all the &quot;air&quot;
currently used for terrestrial radio communications. In both media, capacity
is largely governed by the need to avoid the water molecules that absorb
many frequencies of electromagnetic <BR>
waves--in air, from humidity or precipitation; in fiber, from the unremovable
residue of water in the structure of the glass.<BR>
<BR>
Compared with perhaps 30 gigahertz of currently accessible frequencies in
the air, every fiber thread can potentially bear 25,000 gigahertz. This
huge bandwidth derives from the possibility of using infrared light frequencies
for long-distance communications rather than radio or microwave frequencies.
When you are dealing in terahertz (infrared light encompasses some 50 trillion
hertz worth of frequencies between 7.5 X 10[11] and 3.5 X 10[14]), there
is a lot of room for sending messages.<BR>
<BR>
One fiber thread the width of a human hair can potentially use about 25
trillion of those hertz for communications (the rest tend to be fraught
with moisture). This span is enough to carry all the phone calls in America
on the peak moment of Mother's Day, or to bear three million six-megahertz
high-definition television channels--all down one fiber thread the width
of a human hair. As Paul Green sums it up, fiber commands 10 orders of magnitude
greater bandwidth than copper telephone lines and 10 orders of magnitude
lower bit-error rates. Optical engineers have packed as many as a million
such threads in one bundle with a cross-section a centimeter square. Such
feats plausibly support the assertion that, as a practical matter, spectrum
is infinite.<BR>
<BR>
The capacity of fiber is so large that the best way to think of it is as
a radio system in glass--a fibersphere that can potentially accommodate
as many as 10,000 separate wavelength bitstreams. Under a system called
wavelength division multiplexing, users will tune in to a chosen frequency
band in the same way they currently time in to a chosen radio or television
channel, whether in the air or in a coaxial cable. Indeed, engineers can
take the same infrared frequencies used in fiber and move them to the air
for shorter distance applications such as local-area networks, point-to-point
connections between buildings, links between handheld computers and desktop
hosts, and even television remote controls. As tunable laser transmitters
and photodiodes, along with other optoelectronic gear, become more sensitive
and efficient, airborne infrared will become more robust and useful. Experiments
by the Israelis with ultraviolet frequencies suggest that even these superhigh
frequencies above visible light might someday be used for communications
through the atmosphere (offering tens of thousands of TV channels, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Now the FCC has auctioned off 120 megahertz of frequencies for personal
communications services. The most prominent winning bidders were consortia
led by Sprint, TCI, Comcast and Cox (a long-distance carrier and three cable
companies going under the name Wireless Co.); by AT&T; and by AirTouch,
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S West as PCS PrimeCo. Most analysis has focused
on what is called the wireless market and has assumed the major competitor
to PCS to be the current cellular companies. Aron's ice-age ruminations
stemmed from contemplation of this radical increase in competition for a
limited number of cellular customers who currently cost some $540 each to
sign up (counting handset subsidies) and whose per-capita revenues are declining
at a pace of some 8% per year. Remember BellSouth's Feidler's vision of
a negative elasticity of phone markets, meaning that lower prices bring
lower revenues?<BR>
<BR>
From a spectronic perspective, all this analysis is deeply misleading. Whether
channeled down wires or through the air, spectrum is spectrum. Digital wireless
is a cheaper and better way of delivering service. The market for PCS is
not the cellular customer, but the one billion wireline customers in rich
countries and the several billions of potential phone and teleputer customers
around the globe. In pursuing these customers, the price elasticities will
be dramatically positive, with various price points reachable with new wireless
technologies releasing torrents of new demand and new revenues. What Aron
calls an ice age will in fact prove to be a gigantic global warming, unleashing
huge new growth in telephony, using spectrum in all its various forms (except
perhaps the twisted-pair copper wires that currently dominate the installed
base of the industry).<BR>
<BR>
The winning bidders from AT&T and Sprint did not put up their $3.7 billion
in order to join a zero-sum straggle for new cellular customers. These bidders
are dominated by long- distance businesses that can use PCS to reduce their
some $30 billion in access charges to the local exchange carriers by creating
an alternative local loop. Similarly, MCI, though avoiding the auction,
created a subsidiary called MCI Metro that may seek to manage service for
spectrum winners in 17 cities, again harvesting the benefits of obviated
access charges. Then all these companies can use their PCS technologies
to pursue customers around the world without any thought of wire.<BR>
<BR>
A chart created by industry analyst Herschel Shosteck illustrates the opportunity.
The Shosteck chart is a bell curve relating the incomes of the world's households
to telephone penetration rates. He shows that telephony has so far penetrated
only to countries representing the top tail of the curve, where national
wealth suffices to reduce the cost of telephony to a threshold of between
4% and 5% of incomes. As incomes rise around the globe, more and more people
cross the telecom threshold. A chart of GDP in real dollars per capita versus
telephone penetration shows that a 40% rise in incomes could bring a 1,600%
increase in potential customers.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the surge in incomes, however, will be the plummeting cost of
wireless telephony. Shosteck estimates that between 1985 and 1994 the price
per customer dropped 80%, from $5,000 to $1,000. Combining these two trends,
he calculates that there will be between 400 million and 800 million new
wireless subscribers by the end of the year 2000. These numbers represent
an awesome upsurge from the world's current level of some 60 million cellular
customers. Any further acceleration in income growth or decline in telephone
prices will increase these numbers. A 50% further drop in telephone prices
combined with a 50% rise in incomes would quickly thrust the vast bulk of
the world's population above the Shosteck threshold. Far from the negative
elasticities that U.S. phone executives see in their saturated wireline
voice business, the world-wide communications market will be a financial
trampoline.

In an ordinary industry, a 50% drop in price seems a major obstacle. But
telephony is becoming a branch of the computer industry, which doubles its
cost effectiveness every 18 months. The wireless convergence of digital
electronics and spectronics will allow the industry to escape its copper
cage and achieve at least a tenfold drop in the real price of telephony
in the next seven years.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Stevens should meet Martin Cooper, a former research chief at Motorola
and now CEO of ArrayComm. Located in San Jose, ArrayComm is devoted to drastically
reducing the cost of telephone access over the next two years while entirely
obviating the problems of twisted-pair wiring that afflict Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
The current pitch of ice-age cellular providers is &quot;pay more and get
less. . .and don't even think about universal service.&quot; Although they
claim penetration rates in industrial countries of nearly 10%, most cellular
users make most of their calls on wireline systems. The real market share
of cellular is in fact under 1% in the industrial world. The cellular companies'
formula for success is to exploit the public hunger for mobility by charging
more money for worse service--extracting premium prices for calls with acoustics
and reliability far inferior to wireline telephony. Followed by both sides
of the cellular duopoly--by Bells, McCaws and other suppliers--this pay-more-
for-less-and-worse formula has concealed from much of the industry the basic
technological fact that wireless will soon be acoustically better than wireline
and drastically cheaper as well. As the CD example shows, after all, digital
sound systems are superior to analog. And without wires, phones finesse
the largest capital and labor costs of conventional telephony.<BR>
<BR>
In economic terms, the intrinsic cost advantage of wireless is concealed
by the colossal installed base of copper. Already mostly paid for and largely
written off, the 154 million twisted-pair access lines will allow the Bells
to compete in price for some time with wireless rivals that have lower real
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, technical reality will prevail in the end. Spectronics offers
technologies in four dimensions for dividing and conquering spectrum: Frequency
division, time division, code division and space division. All address in
various ways the issue of frequency rouse--how many times in a system particular
frequencies can be roused without causing interference in other calls using
the same frequencies. Of the four techniques, so far only frequency division
has been widely exploited. As these other methods come on line, the cost
of telephony will go over the same kind of digital cliff long familiar in
computers.<BR>
<BR>
Surveying all these proposed schemes and their promised upgrades (see sidebar
next page), it is safe to project between a 60% and 90% drop in the cost
of wireless telephony over the next five years, depending mostly on the
progress of CDMA. Qualcomm's CDMA could reduce costs tenfold, compared with
the threefold gains from current global services mobile (GSM) technology,
which contemplates an upgrade path chiefly through downgrading the voice
quality with a half-rate vocoder.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains in wireless efficiency from dividing by time, code or frequency
are compounded by dividing spectrum by space. Mathematically, every 50%
reduction in the cell radius yields a 400% increase in the number of customers
who can be served in a given area with a given technology. Huge theoretical
gains accrue from cell-splitting--reducing the physical extent of cells
and multiplying their numbery--converting current macrocells as large as
35 miles in diameter into microcells a mile or so in width, and into picocells
measured in hundreds of yards in buildings, shopping centers or congested
urban streets.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains, however, could be nullified by the expense and difficulty
of implanting base stations all over cities and neighborhoods. The key to
the gains of space division, therefore, is creation of base stations drastically
cheaper, smaller, more discreet and more functional than the current cell
sites, costing between $500,000 and $1 million, occupying 1,000 square feet
and containing between 55 and 416 radios, depending on the frequency reuse
factor. The most notable breakthrough in base stations is the Steinbrecher
MiniCell, to be demonstrated in July and launched at the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Putting a base station into a briefcase, Steinbrecher uses a single broadband
digital radio to perform the functions of between 55 and 416 analog transceivers.
The key breakthrough is a proprietary mixer that can flawlessly down-convert
all the waveforms in the entire cellular spectrum into a stream of baseband
digital bits without losing any information or introducing spurious signals.
Containing all the electromagnetic contents of the cell, this digital bitstream
is broken into channels by a 0.4- micron technology application-specific
integrated circuit and is interpreted by digital signal processors. Governed
by the learning curves of semiconductors, the MiniCell promises to reduce
the cost of a cell site by an initial factor of 10 and by an eventual factor
governed chiefly by the Moore's Law exponentials manifested in the PC industry.<BR>
<BR>
In an important article in the April issue of IEEE Personal Communications,
Donald Cox, former Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford, calculated
that such digital base station technologies soon could lower capital costs
per wireless customer to $14, compared with a current cellular cost of $5,555
(assuming, in both cases, 180 channels per unit).<BR>
<BR>
Using leading-edge silicon technology, the broadband digital radio can transform
the entire landscape of wireless. It takes the channeling, tuning, filtering,
modulation, demodulation, coding, decoding and other processing out of the
analog radio domain, where a different radio system is needed for each frequency
band or modulation scheme. Moved into a digital signal processor or ASIC,
these functions yield to the huge efficiencies of the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate in space division, for example, is devoting the entire available
spectrum to every caller. Using broadband digital radios fed by arrays of
smart antennas, Cooper's ArrayComm is approaching this ultimate. &quot;We
believe that over the next few years, everyone will be using broadband radios,&quot;
Cooper says, pointing to Watkins- Johnson and Airnet joining Steinbrecher
in this business (though with far narrower bandwidths).<BR>
<BR>
All base stations, one way or another, have to find all the callers in a
cell and link them to callers outside. Broadband digital radios move the
search function from an array of radios to a single computer. Cooper contrasts
the technology with radar. As he puts it, traditional radar systems use
active beams to scan a location and find a targeted object; ArrayComm uses
a passive array of antennas and a digital radio to provide a broadband snapshot
of a cell 20 times a second, and employs computers to locate the targeted
object, in this case a handset.<BR>
<BR>
Like the Craig McCaw-Bill Gates low-earth-orbit satellite scheme called
Teledesic, the ArrayComm IntelliCell originated with work done for the Strategic
Defense Initiative program. Inventor Richard Roy developed algorithms for
rapidly calculating the source and trajectory of missiles from their electromagnetic
emissions as detected by satellite antennas scanning the surface of the
earth. Now he is using similar algorithms to identify the position, direction,
distance and amplitude of electromagnetic emissions from handsets in a wireless
cell, as collected by arrays of smart antennas at a base station. Once the
information is digitized, Roy's algorithms can sort out all the calls by
their location in the cell, excavating signals otherwise buried in neighboring
noise or shrouded in cross- talk, and conducting several calls at once on
the same frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper gives the analogy of human hearing. &quot;You close your eyes and
I walk around talking, and you can point to me at any moment. Add another
voice and you can still listen to me, or shift to the other voice. You can
hear the voice you want to hear twice as loudly as the voice you want to
suppress. You null out the interference. This is not a physical process.
You don't move your ears. Your brain calculates and correlates the different
sounds or signals. That's what Dick Roy's algorithms do in our smart base
stations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Roy explains further: &quot;That works if you have a variety of frequencies.
Suppose, though, you were faced with a chores of monks all chanting in monotone
in the same frequencies. This is more like the cellular telephone or PCS
situation in the presence of interference or cross-talk. This is what prevents
frequency reuse in adjacent cells. Amid the drone of the monks, you could
not isolate the sound of one monk. What you need is more ears. Then you
could resolve the source of a particular sound by its location. That is
what we do with antenna arrays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adding a spatial dimension to the frequencies, time slots or codes tracked
by ordinary cell sites, an ArrayComm system can distinguish signals entirely
unintelligible to other systems. For example, an array with eight antennas
can effectively magnify the signal by a factor of eight. There is no theoretical
limit to the number of antennas, but as a practical matter, the size of
the array becomes a problem in urban cells. By moving up spectrum from 900
megahertz 15 centimeters to 1,800 megahertz, PCS reduces the size of the
antenna array from two meters across to one meter across (antenna size drops
in proportion to the decline in wavelength at higher frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the effective magnification of signals, an eight-antenna
array could double the range of a base station, quadruple the area covered,
reduce to one-third or one-fourth the number of cell sites, and raise frequency
reuse to 100%, without CDMA. Because CDMA doesn't define channels by frequency
at all, but by codes, its limit is the number of codes that can be differentiated
in the cell. Thus, Roy believes that among all the competing technologies,
CDMA can benefit most from using the spatial dimension. Spatial processing
can help differentiate the calls in a cell as the noise of call codes accumulates
toward the limit where further traffic is impossible. As Qualcomm leader
Andrew Viterbi declared in a paper released on Jan. 13: &quot;Spatial processing
remains as the most promising, if not the last frontier, in the evolution
of multiple access systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm is part of what Don Steinbrecher calls &quot;the transformation
of wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot; As a computer
business, wireless will share in the gains of Moore's Law. It will double
cost effectiveness every 18 months, rather than continuing on the stagnant
price curves of wireline telephony in its cage of copper, dominated by the
costs of rolling out trucks, digging trenches, laying wire and climbing
poles.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper predicts that over the next five years, the combination of broadband
digital radios, ArrayComm smart antennas and a stream of other advances
in wireless telephony will reduce the cost per minute of wireless phone
calls to a penny a minute, one-quarter the average wireline level and one-twelfth
the current cellular price. This price collapse will ignite huge positive
elasticities in demand, reaching for the first time billions of new customers
in India, China and Latin America who are now untouched by telephony.<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm's first customers are Alcatel in Europe, which is creating a system
for GSM, and DDI Tokyo Pocket Telephone. The fastest growing company on
the Tokyo stock exchange for the last five years, DDI is often termed the
MCI of Japan. Using transceiver chipsets from Cirrus Logic's PCSI subsidiary,
DDI is already the world leader in low-cost wireless telephony. The ArrayComm
technology should lower its costs to the point where these pocket telephones
can break through as a wireless local loop throughout the huge new markets
of Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the DDI technology, called Personal
Handy Phone, was combined with a Bellcore-Motorola proposal as a new low-end
wireless standard under the name Personal Access Communications Systems.<BR>
<BR>
By transforming the technical landscape of communications, spectronics are
also transforming the lawscape. Indeed, by entirely closing the gap between
the costs of serving rural and urban customers, digital wireless phones
will obliterate the need for cross-subsidies that underlie the entire regulatory
edifice. In the new world of bandwidth abundance, the only group that will
need cross- subsidies and emergency aid is the communications bar.<BR>
<BR>
As a guide to the era ahead, telephone executives, regulators and Washington
politicians should contemplate the computer industry. The market share of
centralized time- shared computer systems dropped from 100% in 1977 to less
than 1% in 1987. International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp.
lost nearly $100 billion in market cap in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Or, for a more recent example of the power of wireless technology in the
digital age, the telcos, regulators and politicians should consider the
video distribution industry, Last year, Washington was so obsessed with
the cable industry and its apparent monopoly power that Congress enacted
a reregulation bill that ultimately imposed 700 pages of new rules on the
distribution of video news and entertainment. Politicians and pundits let
forth a stream of lamentations about the future access of the poor and the
rural to the new services of digital television and proposed a series of
new requirements for universal service.<BR>
<BR>
A year later, however, the very survival of the cable industry as a distributor
of point-multipoint video is in doubt. Before Congress could enact broadband
universal service rules, Direct Broadcast Satellites were propagating 150
channels of digital video with supreme universality over the entire expanse
of the continental United States. Attaching 18-inch dishes to the tops of
their igloos, the Inuits might acquire television images of a variety and
resolution far excelling any offering of cable television in the midst of
the nation's capital. With a software upgrade to MPEG-2 video planned later
this year, the number of channels will rise to some 200.<BR>
<BR>
Privately dubbed &quot;deathstar&quot; by cable industry executives, digital
DBS became the fastest growing product in the history of consumer electronics.
Just seven months after its introduction, it had already surpassed the combined
first-year sales of VCRs, CD players and big-screen TVs.<BR>
<BR>
Today, in the name of deregulation, politicians are preparing to impose
a series of new competitive requirements upon the Bell operating companies,
on the assumption that they still wield monopoly power. Pundits still seem
to believe that the copper cage protects local telephone companies from
outside competition. But in fact, the cage incarcerates them in copper wires,
while the world prepares to pass them by.<BR>
<BR>
The digital future is not wired or wireless. It is spectronic and spectacular.
To participate in this explosive market, all telephone companies will have
to escape from their copper cages into the infinite reaches of the spectrum.<BR>

MICHAEL MILKEN IS BACK! Back, so the story goes, from the orgies of '80s
greed, back from the best-selling den of thieves, back from his preening
at the predators' ball, back from soft time at Pleasanton pen, back from
prostate cancer and plagues of litigation, back to tell his own book to
William Novak and to buy his redemption with the spoils of his crimes. Yes,
so they say, Milken is back, while thousands of plundered companies and
communities labor to regain their standard of living and jobs, long lost
in the shuffle of his dismal deals and loaded down with his &quot;high yields.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Milken is back. Back from the gutters of Ponzi finance, the rot of
junk and S&L sleaze, angling: to launder his weaseled wealth with educational
hype and charity hustles. Back, aiming now at history and posterity rather
than at new opportunity, but hitting it big instead with Michael Jackson,
Doonesbury laughs and Clifton compassion photo ops. Meanwhile, even the
ascendant Republicans in Washington try to steer clear of &quot;eighties
excesses&quot; of debt and deficits and supply-side economics.<BR>
<BR>
Or so it looks to media observers of the Milken saga. And yet slowly and
arduously, there is emerging from the carrels of the Harvard Business School
and other institutions a distinctly different tale.<BR>
<BR>
Under the leadership of Michael Jensen, a small group of Harvard Business
School scholars has been scrutinizing all the statistics of corporate behavior
during the 1980s. They have laboriously appraised the results of all the
leveraged buyouts, junk bond issues, venture capital, and other tools of
corporate making and remaking. They have arrived at unexpected conclusions
and have developed a new body of theory to explain them. From this perspective,
the events of the 1980s--and Milken's role--assume a wholly new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen puts the Milken episode in the context of another form of wretched
excess for which Milken was the remedy: namely, the excesses of corporate
waste and conglomeration by empire-building managers with scarcely any ownership
stake in their companies. Amid the sieges of deregulation and tax rate reduction,
amid the obvious tumult in the markets for oil, tires, tobacco, real estate,
gold and commodities, many industries needed profound restructuring. But
their entrenched managements were set to expand their domains through acquisition
and investment in new capacity. Meanwhile, a thousandfold rise in the cost-
effectiveness of microchips, governed by the centrifugal law of the microcosm,
rendered obsolete the dominant architecture of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
Most conspicuously, between 1977 and 1987 the percentage of total computer
power commanded by centralized systems dropped from nearly 100% to under
1%. Less obviously, but no less profoundly, the equally centralized structures
of television and telephony were also falling before the distributive force
of the microcosm. Ordaining that the price performance of microchips rises
by the square of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip,
the law of the microcosm exalts single chip systems, led by the PC. Pushed
into obsolescence were all monopolies and hierarchies, pyramids and power
grids of the old information structure, epitomized by the mainframe computer,
the broadcast network and the central telephone switch.<BR>
<BR>
The old establishment of AT&amp;T, the big three TV networks and some 1,400
over-the-air broadcast stations was breaking down into a new formation of
cable and wireless schemes. Affecting virtually every company in the economy
and threatening most existing management plans and practices, these trends
created huge opportunities for wealth creation and disruption.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with his move to Century City in Los Angeles in July of 1978,
Milken aggressively rode the microcosm--inside and outside of Drexel. Inside,
he concentrated on what Jensen describes as a key role of information technology:
&quot;taking the specific knowledge previously scattered through a firm
and making it into general knowledge usable by all.&quot; In this case,
it was a matter of turning Milken's command of the details of hundreds and
then thousands of high-yield issues into the foundation for a company that
could make these bonds the prime venture capital in the U.S. economy. From
the beginning, crucial to this goal was computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
A specialist in finance, information systems and operational research at
Wharton, he had begun his career at Drexel in 1970 with a computerized move
to speed up the delivery of securities to its customers, thus saving the
company some $ 500,000 in interest charges and setting a new standard in
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
In Los Angeles, he created an advanced system for trading based on what
was then a state-of-the-art Prime 550 Model 2. Through the RS-232 9600-baud
serial ports of up to 250 Televideo terminals, the Prime computer time-shared
a Fortran database containing the trading history of all Drexel customers,
some 1,700 high-yield securities and some 8,000 securities in the public
market.<BR>
<BR>
With a quick query, a member of Milken's team could determine the customer's
history, the amount of his potential profits or losses, his investment philosophy
and ability to buy new issues. Thus the team could link the buyers and sellers
of securities in a uniquely targeted and opportunistic way and could command
the detailed knowledge needed to counteract the strong prejudice and ratings
stigma against high-yield securities.<BR>
<BR>
Under William Haloc, a former systems analyst for Prime who joined Drexel,
the team also developed real-time analytics to allow instant calculation
of pricing for these intricate securities. These functions allowed salespeople
to view the name, issue and ratings of a security and to compute complex
yields and cash flows involving call features, sinking funds, refund schedules,
puts, warrants and prices, all instantly calculable on line. Meanwhile,
at rival firms, many dealers still fumbled with the levers on $ 3,000 Monroe
calculators.<BR>
<BR>
The entire system was monitored by Drexel Burnham's New York headquarters
and linked indirectly to the floors of the exchanges by Quotron, Reuters
and 10 other on-line services, each with a separate Rich monitor, switchable
from a keyboard. These arrays of small black monitors spread across the
desk collectively functioned like a present- day Windows display.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the features of Milken's system are Common today. But in 1980 they
were novel. This customized $ 2 million computer scheme, with five times
that amount for programming and maintenance, gave the Drexel team a mastery
of 5 the high-yield market that sometimes seemed positively sinister to
outside observers and competitors. But it was not magic or malfeasance;
it was the microcosm of the new technology joined with the knowledge and
investment genius of Michael Milken.<BR>
<BR>
More famously, Milken's grasp of the information age extended well beyond
Drexel's IS department. Focusing on emergent information companies responding
to the tectonic and regulatory turmoil unleashed by the microchip in TV
and telephony, Milken channeled a total of some $ 26 billion into MCI, McCaw,
Viacom, TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Cablevision Systems, News Corp. and other
cable, telecom, wireless, publishing and entertainment companies. At the
time, virtually none of these firms commanded substantial collateral acceptable
to a bank, and thus they could have raised these billions nowhere else.
Now, these companies are collectively worth some $ 224 billion and comprise
the foundations of a national information infrastructure unrivaled in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
With an eventual $ 2.5 billion from Drexel, MCI built the first national
single-mode fiber-optic network and spurred AT&T and Sprint into action
to give the U.S. a global lead in the technology. With another $ 1.2 billion,
McCaw launched the first national wireless telephone system. And with $
8 billion, TCI, Viacom, Time Warner, Cablevision Systems and Turner, followed
by many other Drexel high-yield issuers, made U.S. cable television a unique
national asset, with unequaled programming and broadband links. Redeemed
in the process were troubled companies providing equipment and services.
One of them was Corning, which supplied 62, 112 miles of state-of-the-art
fiber to MCI's pioneering network at a time when Corning had no other customers
for this crucial technology developed over the previous 17 years.<BR>
<BR>
Milken's influence reached well beyond his actual transactions. A once-lame
Disney was restructured with Milken's guidance and takeover pressure in
some three years of 5 a.m. meetings with Roy Disney, Frank Wells and Stanley
Gold. Then worth $ 1.8 billion, Disney emerged as a revamped Hollywood colossus
worth $ 30 billion 11 years later in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Comprising more than half of all high-yield bond issues, Milken's activities
also embraced thousands of companies beyond the telecom, cable TV and entertainment
field--for example, building Hasbro into the world's leading toy company
and Barnes & Noble into the leading independent bookseller. His example
helped inspire many rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann
Little, and Morgan Stanley, who also made heroic contributions to this campaign
of corporate renewal. In particular, Morgan Stanley channeled crucial billions
in high-yield funds to the computer, semiconductor and hard-disk drive industries
during extreme industry crises in the mid- and late 1980s as Drexel was
leaving the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1976 and 1993, Jensen calculates that in these campaigns of corporate
restructuring, American corporations conducted 42,621 merger and acquisition
deals worth a total of $ 3.1 trillion. In these transactions, selling: firms
won premiums of some 41%, generating $ 899 billion in constant dollar gains
to the shareholders. Since buying firms also gained on average, by increments
that increased over the years, Jensen's estimate represents a lower bound
on the yields of the restructuring movement.<BR>
<BR>
No substantial evidence supports the speculations by Larry Summers (now
Treasury Undersecretary) and others that these gains disguise large wealth
transfers from bondholders, workers, suppliers and communities. Indeed,
the evidence assembled by Jensen, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago,
Harvard economist Andre Schleifer and Jensen colleague Karen Wruck, among
others, shows that capital expenditures, employment, and research and development
all rose in the aftermath of these transactions.<BR>
<BR>
As Jensen now sums it up: &quot;These are lower-bound estimates because
they do not include gains that came about later or voluntary gains that
were achieved as a result of hostile offers. I don't know any way to add
up all these benefits. But it is clear that the impact was dramatic and
it left us much more competitive as a country. Today the Japanese and the
Europeans are suffering from their delay of restructuring and the U.S. is
much leaner and more efficient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Jensen and Milken agree that the opportunities today exceed even the
gains of the 1980s. Impelled by the restructuring campaign, the real value
of the equity of public firms more than doubled between 1981 and 1990, rising
by $ 1.6 trillion, or from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 3 trillion. Since then the
pace of technical change has accelerated and the possibilities for a deregulatory
breakthrough have soared with the election of a new Congress. Forbes ASAP
projects possible stock market gains for the rest of this decade of another
$ 2 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
The heightened pace of change, however, creates a desperate need for restructuring.
This $ 2 trillion opportunity depends on emancipating into the markets the
resources currently trapped in obsolete structures by capital gains taxes
near 40%, compounded by inflation, and by new antitakeover rules and outdated
telecom regulations. Flowing again into a new communications infrastructure,
into venture funds and into restructuring campaigns, freed capital can endow
entrepreneurs with the power to align their companies with the most potent
force in the history of technology.<BR>
<BR>
But first, America needs a new Milken. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Onrush of the Telecosm
</B></PRE>
With chip densities still doubling every 18 months and chip sales up nearly
30% each of the last two years, with computer MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) per dollar doubling every year and computer sales up over 25%
in each of the last two years, with hard-disk cost- effectiveness doubling
every nine months, and fiber-optics bandwidth exploding a thousandfold while
fiber deployment spreads at a pace of 1,300 miles a day--the onrush of technology
is now accelerating well beyond the pace of the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm is now potentially converging with
the law of the telecosm. This law ordains that the value and performance
of a network rise apace with the square of the increase in the number and
power of computers linked on it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers
and communications can ride an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
The 50 million new computers sold into America's homes and offices over
the last two years guarantee a huge market for broadband networks. Half
of the PCs sold in December bore Pentium microprocessors, and 60% of the
PCs went into homes. These computers process data at a pace rapidly approaching
100 MIPS. Early in the next century, just five years from now, most American
households will command multimedia teleputers processing data in billions
of instructions per second and pouring it out at gigabit-per-second rates--or
as much as a million times the current digital dribble of 9.6-kilobit modems.<BR>
<BR>
But not today. This computer-rich, bandwidth-poor situation means a crippling
and unnecessary mismatch between microcosm and telecosm, between the power
of PCs and the bandwidth of the networks that serve them--between PC instructions
per second on single-chip silicon and telco bits per second on twisted-pair
copper wires. Tens of millions of PC owners are demanding electronic commerce,
distance learning, full-motion videoconferencing, and ready access to the
graphics and hypertext of the Internet. World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Yet phone and cable executives dawdle with market surveys and experiments
with interactive TV that amazingly manage to prove that people don't even
want full-motion movies. Meanwhile, the values and sales of their companies
languish. In the last 12 months, for example, the 24 leading telecom and
cable companies, led by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, lost an average
of 12.8% of their market value. Facing a world of shining broadband opportunities
in their own businesses, narrowband executives grope for glamour in Hollywood
and grasp for growth overseas.<BR>
<BR>
American industry is still cowed by overreaching regulators obsessed with
corporate power. In a world of exploding competition in the telecosm -galvanized
by new wireless and wireline technologies emerging every week--the administration,
the FCC and Congress have long been paralyzed by nightmares of John Malone
of TCI and a possible single- wire stranglehold in St. Louis or of a blight
of disinvestment in phone service for South Dakota or Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
If current fears of monopoly result in a contrived two-wire mandate on America's
communications infrastructure, however, all the hopes for an integrated
broadband two-way net will die until well into the next century. With oceans
of bandwidth languishing just out of reach, the tremendous resource of broadband
home computers will waste away, gasping on the beach for two-way channels
for teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine and telecommerce, while
the telephone and cable companies &quot;compete&quot; with rival offerings
of mostly one-way floods of movies, shopping and the Sega Channel for TVs.
By betraying its precious world- leading endowment of PCs in order to save
its existing telcos and TV companies, the U.S. still could make a literal
$ 2 trillion mistake. 
<PRE><B>

The Amazing Vindication of Junk
</B></PRE>
To grasp the size of possible opportunity and the possible mistake, let
us return to Milken and his achievement of the 1980s, which set the stage
for the current drama. Never in history has a convicted white- collar felon
been so luminously vindicated by the passage of time. His six alleged felonies
dwindled to a series of debatable violations, devoid of insider trading
and essentially costing their victims nothing (or a total of $ 318,082,
according to a dubious estimate by the court that forced him into a plea
through RICO threats against him, his family and Drexel). Returning to the
volumes of the 1980s peak, his supposed Ponzi scheme of junk finance became
the most profitable class of domestic fixed-income securities of the early
1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if the few Savings & Loans that held a substantial portfolio of
junk had been permitted to keep it, they would have survived, prospered
and paid millions of dollars of taxes rather than collapsed into the hands
of the FDIC. For example, the shareholders of Columbia Savings & Loan may
have suffered from Thomas Spiegel's undue extravagance in company jets and
bullet-proof bathrooms. But the government crackdown cost them $ 700 million
and cost the taxpayers $ 1 billion, though the bank was on track to profit
massively from falling interest rates on its deposits and thriving high-yield
securities.<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs such as ex-Drexel luminary Leon Black, who purchased the bonds
from the government at bargain-basement rates, became billionaires on the
proceeds and were charged with gulling the regulators. Meanwhile, the companies
that Milken financed with these securities now form the foundations of a
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
A minor triumph came at the end of 1994 when Vanity Fair magazine, avid
vessel of many a lurid exposed of Milken and his team, published a lavishly
photographed story on &quot;America's New Establishment.&quot; Among the
19 names were Ted Turner, Craig McCaw, Sumner Redstone, Gerald Levin, John
Malone, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Ronald Perelman and
Bill Gates. Although Milken was never mentioned, all these high fliers--with
the exception of Gates--rose to prominence largely or partly on a cresting
tide of Milken's junk.<BR>
<BR>
Why does junk work! Primarily because it frees capital from corporate bureaucracy
and gets it into the hands of entrepreneurs. During the 1980s, lower taxes
and new technologies had transformed the economic environment. What was
precious in the 1970s--metals, minerals, real estate and collectibles, all
mashed together in diversified conglomerates and tax shelters-became disposable
junk in the 1980s. What was junk in the 1970s and early 1980s--Milken's
array of leveraged cable, fiber, wireless and content schemes--became the
precious foundations of a new information infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
How could this be so? How could one man with a poorly named venture-debt
financing vehicle contribute so hugely to the U.S. economy while, according
to Jensen's analysis, the nation's 500 largest corporations, led by a $
100 billion opportunity loss at General Motors in 11 years, incurred negative
returns with their free cash flow (cash flow beyond the amount needed to
fund all internal investments with a positive net present value)?<BR>
<BR>
Did not Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller win a Nobel prize for their
so-called M&M theorems showing that the performance of corporations is independent
of their capital structure? Have not scores of economists pursuing the Efficient
Market Hypothesis demonstrated that in general the capital exchanges are
fully efficient, that company prices reflect all of the available information
and no individual investor can systematically outwit the tape without illegal
manipulation or insider trading?<BR>
<BR>
In his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 1993,
however, Jensen answered all these arguments. On the basis of new research
on the experience of the 1980s, he declared that the M&amp;M theorems, &quot;while
logically sound, are empirically incorrect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The central problem of the corporation, according to Jensen, is the &quot;agency&quot;
dilemma-the divergence between the interests of the managers and the owners
of large businesses. This problem is inherent in all cooperative human endeavor:
the interests of the individuals always deviate at the margin from the goals
of the group. But in times of rapid technological and political transformation,
as Jensen argues, the agency gap becomes a gulf. The structure of the corporation,
the training of its engineers, the skills of its executives, the costs of
its processes all become misaligned with the realities of a new technological
base, a rapidly changing state of the art, and a political environment in
upheaval.<BR>
<BR>
General Motors was the worst example, investing $ 121.8 billion during the
1980s in R&amp;D and capital equipment while the value of the company dropped
to $ 22.9 billion. IBM invested $ 101 billion while its value was dropping
to $ 64.6 billion by the end of 1990 (on the way to further collapse to
$ 41 billion in early 1995). Collectively, the 500 largest U.S. corporations
wasted hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow. What was needed,
according to Jensen, was a total overhaul of most of these companies, their
strategic redirection, and the replacement or redeployment of roughly half
of the existing managers. What occurred was a prodigal waste of resources
in defense of the obsolete structures and practices of the incumbent management.<BR>
<BR>
Creating most of the new value during the 1980s were companies funded or
restructured by corporate raiders, venture capitalists and even--in the
case of a $ 75 billion gain from the AT&T breakup--the courts (disbanding
a monopoly previously created by government). Using equity, venture capitalists
overcome the agency gulf by playing an active controlling role on company
boards and managements and by insisting that executives are compensated
chiefly through stock and options. Using venture debt and an array of complex
securities, Michael Milken overcame the agency gulf by similarly active
intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Millken channeled billions of dollars into companies such as McCaw or MCI
largely owned by the management, to compete with industry leviathans. For
companies not owned by their executives, he funded leveraged buyouts that
transformed nonowner managers feeding on free cash flow into heavy owners
of equity with virtually no liquid resources. Contracted to divert all their
free cash flow to the holders of high-yield debt, the new owner-managers
were forced to please the capital markets in order to fund any new projects.
<PRE>
<B>
The Productivity Boom</B></PRE>
With the agency problem solved, these companies became lean and mean leaders
of the global economy. Contrary to the claims of many economists, from Alan
Blinder to Lester Thurow, productivity soared. Mired in the murky data on
service-sector productivity--which was stultified by the practice of measuring
most outputs by the cost of the inputs--economists tended to miss the prodigious
real growth of the 1980s. For example, in the brokerage and finance arenas,
productivity stagnated in the data, but between 1973 and 1987 the number
of shares traded daily grew from 5.7 million to 63.8 million, while employment
only doubled in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Manufacturing productivity numbers, though more accurate, also suffer from
severe miscalculations. In a world of creative destruction, they tend to
assume that products, such as computers, that decline in price are dropping
in value. And while registering every new steel ingot, automobile or chocolate
bar, they assume that novel products represent no productivity gain at all.
These are not trivial mistakes. During the past 20 years, the cost of computers
has dropped approximately one millionfold. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics
shows merely an annual drop varying between 14.9% in 1992 and 6.7% in 1994.
The government has finally recognized the flaws in this statistical series,
and is moving ever so slowly to correct it. But the problem is fundamental.<BR>
<BR>
Using the criteria applied to productivity in the auto industry, the statisticians
would have to multiply the improvement in computing cost-effectiveness by
the increase in the number of computers sold. Thus, with the explosion of
sales of billions of microcomputers of all kinds, from desktop systems to
embedded devices, a consistent BLS would find that the contribution of computers
to gross domestic product was close to a billion times larger than the entire
GDP of 1970. Of course, such an exercise would be preposterous. But hardly
more preposterous than mostly ignoring the productivity gains in these industries
of rapid advance, plummeting prices and cornucopian innovation.<BR>
<BR>
Even using existing data, total factor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing
sector more than doubled during the 1980s from the level during the previous
30 years. From 1950 to 1980, this productivity index rose an average of
1.4% per year; between 1981 and 1990, it rose at a rate of 3.3%. Labor productivity
rose from 1.4% per year in the earlier period to 3.8% in the `80s. Contrary
to the usual claims, wages rose at least 10%, according to Social Security
system data, while the number of jobs rose by 18 million.<BR>
<BR>
But the most striking productivity surge came in the growth of the productivity
of capital. In essence, Milken, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann Little
and others took the vast incarcerated capital resources trapped in old-line
businesses and put it back into the markets. Not only was the productivity
of the capital left behind hugely enhanced by the disciplines of restructuring,
but the freed capital flowed into venture funds and high-yield markets where
it fueled what Jensen calls &quot;a Third Industrial Revolution.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The results were dramatic. In decline for 30 years, at an annual rate of
minus 1.03%, the capital productivity index has long been beloved by Marxists
as a portent of the collapse of capitalism. During the 1980s, however, this
decline was decisively reversed. The productivity of capital as measured
in the data rose by 2.03% annually as computerized information systems transformed
the technology of finance.<BR>
<BR>
Decisively reversed as well was a long decline of U.S. market share in the
global economy. By the period between 1987 and 1992, U.S. corporations were
generating 47.7% of all the profits in the industrial world on 37.5% of
the revenues. Spearheading the U.S. economy were information firms, with
some 70% of global profits.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was overthrown by the restructuring of the 1980s all the indifference
theorems, Efficient Market Hypotheses, corporate optimality concepts, macroeconomic
monotheories wielded in business schools and economics departments to explain
away the power and &quot;wash&quot; away the paramount worth of individual
entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, the giant corporation, with managers
largely free of ownership claims, gained its preeminence as a way of diffusing
risk among millions of stockholders with diverse portfolios. But with the
securitization of venture debt by Michael Milken and others, these behemoths
emerge as marketplace survivors largely because of their prowess at politics,
litigation and media management--core competencies that in the course of
a decade succeeded both in derailing the Milken threat and enacting laws
and regulations to forestall any followers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because of a bias in favor of the capitalists, Jensen's course vies
with Michael Porter's similarly entrepreneurial class as the most popular
in the last 15 years with students at Harvard Business School--a fact which
bodes well for the future of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen and Milken agree that today's economy faces technological transformations,
agency misalignments and restructuring chances even greater than the economy
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;The opportunity is truly huge,&quot;
says Jensen. ASAP estimates that in this 40% larger economy, there should
be a chance for Milkenesque investors to raise stock market value by more
than 67%, implying both a revitalized U.S. economy, a Dow level over 6500,
a Standard & Poor's Index exceeding 700, and a Nasdaq over 1400.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains, however, how to realize these gains. Because of the
incredible continuing grip of obsolete regulations and the huge mismatch
between microcosm and telecosm, the fabulous new fiber and wireless technologies
have yet to force a corresponding industrial restructuring. The same old
players are still on the field protected by the same government rules, administered
still by Judge Harold Greene in the Modified Final Judgment breaking up
AT&T 11 years ago, and regulated still by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Justice Department and 5O state Public Utilities Commissions as if history
had stood still. Forty million computers with multimedia powers remain stranded
in homes with four-kilohertz copper connections to the world while communications
companies still ponder the perplexities of interactive TV and regulators
ruminate about how to prevent monopoly and preserve universal service. 
<PRE><B>

Cable TV's Impending Death</B></PRE>
Capsizing this entire teetering apparatus of petty fears and pettifoggery
will be this year's ascent of new wireless technologies. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs 10 to 30 times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
By nature, the U.S. Senate is dominated by rural customers. Many are Republicans.
Therefore, universal service has posed a paralyzing problem for programs
of deregulation. But new wireless digital technologies have utterly banished
this problem.<BR>
<BR>
At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the gap in costs between rural and urban customers. At
the same time, with supreme universality across the entire continent, Direct
Broadcast Satellite already delivers service superior to cable. Already
in the sky, DBS is a big bang that will ultimately transform the entire
corporate landscape of U.S. communications with a cascade of imperious new
realities.<BR>
<BR>
In digital DBS, GM Hughes, Hubbard Broadcasting and Thomson's RCA have delivered
a knockout new conduit for delivering one-way video. In image resolution,
in audio quality, in number of channels and in raw reach and efficiency
of point-to-multipoint transmission, DirecTV not only decisively outpaces
even the studio offerings at cable company headends but also vastly and
instantly excelled them in coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the only weakness of DBS is a lack of certain critical content
such as local and broadcast network programming. The lack will be addressed,
with the help of Michael Milken, by major new restructuring this year.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely devastating to broadcast cable TV, a still more powerful DBS
will send reverberations throughout the broadcast industry and profoundly
affect computers, government regulators and telephone companies as well.
As Milken explains, &quot;Everything in the information economy is connected
to everything else.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As government regulators will be the last to notice, DBS utterly overthrows
the prime premise of cable regulation: the view that cable commands some
kind of monopoly in delivering one-way video programming. Far from a monopoly,
one-way cable TV is essentially dead. In response to DBS, cable has no choice
but to change its business radically to two- way computer services.<BR>
<BR>
The market opportunity is obvious and immense. The Internet boasted five
million host computers and over 30 million estimated users in January, and
growth of 26% in the last quarter of 1994. The largest spurt of expansion
in recent history, this surge came despite acute frustration at the narrow
bandwidth of available phone connections.<BR>
<BR>
At present, only the cable TV industry commands conduits to homes capable
of accommodating these multimedia teleputers. One-gigahertz cable TV coax
can accommodate some eight billion bits per second of two- way data or some
5,000 channels of the kind of MPEG1 video now offered in one direction by
DBS. Such bandwidth could accommodate ubiquitous videoconferencing and commerce.
By contrast, your phone line modem labors to transmit 14.4 thousand bits
per second, or enough to send one MPEG movie in two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Reaching 63% of U.S. households, including at least 92% of homes with PCs,
cable supplies the obvious conduit for the exploding computer business.
Intel, General Instrument, Digital Equipment, Hybrid and Com21, among other
companies, are supplying cable modems and software for high-speed bidirectional
traffic over the existing cable plant. But consummation of the network will
entail large investments in fiber and switching at a time when cable is
just emerging from its regulatory shadows into the deadly Ku-band radiance
of DBS.<BR>
<BR>
The most obvious source of capital is the RBOCs, the local telephone companies
(though Milken stresses that the public utilities are a major alternative).
The Bells already command nine times as much fiber as cable TV does and
invest every year more money than the total $ 23 billion of cable revenues.
What they lack is bandwidth for broadband access to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The key to access to these huge new computer markets, therefore, is forthcoming
congressional action to permit collaboration between the RBOCs and the cable
companies within their own regions. If necessary, the telephone companies
must be allowed to buy cable companies and merge their systems. The coming
ascent of DBS should relieve the fears of monopoly that have long deterred
action. If it does, the cascade of change spurred by DBS will lead to a
flood of new commerce and communication on the networks of America.<BR>
<BR>
The endowment of DBS with new programming clout, however, will prove to
be the last triumph of conduit-content convergence. The restructuring paladins
of the broadband era will devote much of their efforts to dismantling the
content-conduit conglomerates that currently dominate the cable industry
and that are now in formation by the telephone companies.<BR>
<BR>
In a broadband era, content-conduit combines no longer make sense. Consider
that you are Warner Entertainment, a content company. You do not want to
restrict your movies to one conduit. You want to sell them through everyone's
conduit. Consider that you are Warner Communications, a cable firm. With
eight gigabits per second--enough for 5,000 movie channels--you want to
sell everyone's movies, not restrict yourself to Warner's.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to mix content and conduit--artists and engineers-produce misaligned
companies that need restructuring. Content follies crowd into the agency
gulf. Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis gave superagent Michael Ovitz
$ 14 million to pursue more &quot;content&quot; while Ameritech, BellSouth
and Southwestern Bell (SBC) romanced Disney.<BR>
<BR>
What would a new restructuring king do in the face of such ham- handed diversification?
Bring on the raiders. Sic some junkyard Doberman on the succulent bells
and whistles acquired by cable and telephone firms. Let him spin off their
recent acquisitions and interactive TV experiments and game channels and
refocus these companies on the computer networking business where they belong,
and where they can harvest the bonanza of a global economy rapidly uploading
onto the Net.

The Two-Wire Delusion
</B></PRE>
Washington has to make a choice. Is it going to allow a freedom model that
permits telephone companies and cable companies to combine as common carriers
to build a true broadband infrastructure, in which millions of entrepreneurs
can cavort and compete in content and context? Or will regulators impose
a spurious competitive model, with two or more wires to every home, all
imitating the current cable strategy of wannabe content-conduit monopolies.<BR>
<BR>
As venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned in the Feb. 27 issue of ASAP:
&quot;There is an unspoken assumption in government circles that we can
move local loop communications to a fiercely competitive business model
and build an information superhighway at the same time...an implicit assumption
that the regional Bell operating companies and the cable companies are a
bunch of knuckle-dragging dimwits who will build the superhighway no matter
what... [But] telecom businesses are characterized by high fixed costs.
There is no such thing as limited competition... As you infuse competition...the
value model of the industry collapses. And when it does, the effect will
be exactly the same as stepping on a large cow pie in your hiking boots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Congressman Jack Fields, new Republican chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee,
disagrees: &quot;I am convinced that the [industry] people we talked with
will respond to telecom reform. They have tens of billions of dollars parked
on the side of the information superhighway waiting for us to pass a piece
of legislation to give definition and certainty to the scene.&quot; But
the people he consulted--chiefly the leaders and the lobbyists of the RBOCs
and cable companies--are not the ones who will decide whether the highway
is built.<BR>
<BR>
Making that decision will be the same capital markets that punished Bell
Atlantic and TCI for their broadband plans and thwarted the merger between
them. As soon as it became clear--through the passage of the cable re-regulation
act of 1992 and related policies of the FCC--that the regulators would permit
collaboration only in regions where the two companies had no competitive
advantage, the case for the combine collapsed. Under a regulatory system
in which the government can sweep down and confiscate profits and channel
them into quixotic schemes of universal service in three dimensions for
the homeless or require irrational competitive behavior in a two-wire multisubsidiary
world, a true broadband two-way network makes no business sense. What will
emerge instead is an array of dueling brands of 500-channel TV, claiming
to be interactive for the benefit of Congress and the press.<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets will avoid cow-pie competition at all costs. Under these
circumstances, a true broadband system will not be completed until 2020
in the U.S. But the competitive model is fundamentally misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
To the Washington regulators and their elected allies, competition has always
meant rivalry between the existing competitors--long distance, broadcast,
Baby Bells and Cable TV--and the regulation succeeds as long as all the
teams stay on the field. But all technological competition--all innovation--consists
of the pursuit of fugitive positions of monopoly. Current legislative proposals
from the administration and its congressional allies resemble a broad national
effort in 1981 to defend the mainframe BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell) from imperial IBM. Just as the IBM &quot;monopoly&quot;
was about to fall before the microcosm, led by Intel and Microsoft, so the
RBOC and broadcasting &quot;monopolies&quot; are about to fall before the
telecosm of broadband digital computer networks, which will also sorely
challenge Intel and Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
The new information infrastructure will bring a cornucopia of new services
from a variety of new sources that cannot even be defined as yet. All we
know is that none of the existing rivals is likely to survive in recognizable
form. Only a true freedom model that allows a complete reconstruction of
the world of communications--with anyone collaborating or competing, merging
or metamorphing with anyone rise--can allow this new era to come to fruition.
Only a freedom model can release the $ 2 trillion of new asset value that
the scholars of restructuring promise for the U.S. economy of the 1990s
and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
This result the Republicans on Capitol Hill command the unique and precious
and passing opportunity to achieve. So open the floodgates of capital for
new corporate raiders and remakers, venturers and reinventors. Rejoice in
the return of Milken and pray that he be joined by scores of rivals, including
those allowed to use the securities markets. Virtually all the cable and
telephone companies, from MCI to TCI to SBC, should be up for grabs, by
each other and from outside firms. Sitting on $ 10 billion of cash, IBM
could fruitfully enter the fray, or be frayed itself. IBM could combine
its global ATM network with cable access to homes. For many of these companies,
capital is far less scarce than vision.<BR>
<BR>
Milken cites MCI. &quot;Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with
billions of dollars of capital expenditures to make. They had a clear understanding
of what their business was. We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital and that fueled the spread of fiber optics throughout the country
during the 1980s. Today their situation is far less clear. They have $ 3
billion in cash, they could borrow $ 6 billion more; they've got a strategic
worldwide partnership with British Telecom. Today the challenge is not capital.
It is vision. It is, what should MCI's future be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With MCI's current resources, it could buy cable facilities across the country,
join them with its fiber network, complement them with wireless personal
communications services and Internet connections, and outwit AT&T as brilliantly
as it did in the 1980s. But it has to be willing to bet the company again.
The question is whether the current management, with Bill McGowan in his
grave, can escape the agency trap, shun the cushions of large corporate
life, and become a real competitor again rather than a protected player
in a continued government sham of &quot;competition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When a visitor at one of the Capitol Hill offices in charge of telecom policy
points to the benefits of real competition and restructuring, the politician
will usually respond: &quot;The companies do not tell us that.&quot; The
dirty little secret of all too many telephone and cable companies is that
they prefer government-regulated &quot;competition&quot; to real entrepreneurial
risks and rewards. As long as telco and cable lobbyists fail to urge true
competition, these companies deserve much of the blame. for the Third World
regulations that still limit the horizons of their industry.<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly, however, the situation is changing from an unexpected source.
While much of industry still lags, the politicians seem ready at last to
seize the day with a new freedom model. Now the congealed glaciers of telecom
can begin to break up under the blows of a reinvigorated market for corporate
control.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, the best solution will be again to deregulate Milken. 
<PRE><B>

Postscript: The Return of Mike Milken</B></PRE>
One morning, in his office on a quiet street in Los Angeles near Bel Air,
Milken is probing some of the outward edges of the new regime, delving into
a business plan for ridefilms. Ridefilms are a brand new industry of convergence
that blends features of theatrical films, theme- park rides and arcade games.
Giving the viewer the sensation of plummeting motion and soaring flight
on platforms that move in sync with motion on the screen, these systems
are virtual reality that really works.<BR>
<BR>
Presenting the project of the day is Whitmore Kelley of Berkshire Motion
Pictures, the firm that created the pioneering &quot;Back to the Future:
The Ride&quot; for Universal Theme Parks. He is proposing Ridetime, a low-cost
system of theater capsules for children between the ages of four and 10.<BR>
<BR>
These turnkey theaters could bring ridefilms to malls, shopping centers,
toy stores, theme parks, resorts, restaurants and family entertainment centers
at a toll of $ 1.50 per child, eight children at a time. Offering four-minute
musical adventures with engaging plots and educational themes, these systems
would be the first to shun the &quot;testosterone market&quot; of the arcades
and focus on young children.<BR>
<BR>
Milken had heard enough. He confessed he had only been able to read five
sections of the business plan during the two or three minutes that had elapsed.
But with a quizzical Columbo look, he said he had some questions. He had
recently seen similar systems in Norway and Sweden. Small groups of parents
and kids together paid the equivalent of $ 4 apiece to plummet down an Olympic
Alpine downhill or bobsledding course. No, they weren't real ridefilms,
with synchronized physical movement, but they were cheap to produce and
offered a similar experience and there would be a lot more where those came
from. How would Berkshire compete with these? Let's say he owned space in
an arcade. Teenagers pump in money all day long and deep into the night.
Why would he give space to a children's ride that takes up twice as much
room and closes down at bedtime? Interactivity? Watch out for that. Kids
today get real interactivity on their computers and Nintendo machines at
home. Any effort to provide interactive features for eight kids at once
might well turn them off. Where would the parents be? They would see the
show for nothing, standing behind the kids, without the motion that makes
it interesting. That's a downer. A four-year-old will demand that the parents
sit with him. The parents are your customers. Make them pay and let them
ride.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting that Kelley had described other ridefilm companies as the competition,
Milken demurred. The computer software industry would be the competition.
He grilled Kelley on the size of the capsule, its cost per square foot,
its yield to the owner of the space in a mall, the quality of the images,
the nature of the liquid crystal projection technology.<BR>
<BR>
As Kelley described it, &quot;Milken is so mentally aggressive and determined
I was astonished. I came in and he began playing the flute and several other
instruments at once, and I had to figure out what the dance was and start
moving and shaking in time. Teaching, learning and testing at the same time.
. .he was amazing.&quot; At the end of the presentation, Milken announced
that he was impressed and would go visit a prototype of the new system nearby
in the L.A. suburbs.<BR>
<BR>
Or watch him on President's Day in a paneled room in Atlanta's Occidental
Grand Hotel. He is contemplating a new learning network as a climax to some
25 years and $ 250 million of Milken family ventures in the field of education.
Milken has assembled leading experts on education, film and finance to consult
with the CEO of the new project, Hamilton Jordan, recently of Whittle Communications.<BR>
<BR>
Milken began with the crucial rule that the educational network &quot;go
first to the home, later to the schools,&quot; rather than the other way
around (which was Whittle's mistake). &quot;The teachers themselves will
bring any good material into the schools,&quot; he said. He ended by suggesting
that the group had radically underestimated the size of their potential
market. He pointed to his earlier investment in Interface Group, the sponsor
of Comdex, recently sold to Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank
Corporation for $ 800 million. Virtual conferences and teleconferences for
training and education and lifelong learning could become a leading vehicle
of convergence, joining software, computers, consumer electronics, telephones
and even public utilities.<BR>
<BR>
As he summed up, he declared that the size of the educational market, appropriately
defined today to include corporate training, was not $ 400 billion as Jordan
had said, but more than $ 1 trillion. Visionary and trenchant as ever, lifting
the horizons of all around him, Milken was clearly back.

Breakup Candidates?
</B></PRE>
AT&amp;T: In both history and promise, AT&T may be the world's greatest
technology company, combining microcosm with telecosm more intimately than
any other. With Bell Labs, 59% of the long-distance market, and McCaw's
access to the local loop, AT&T today also should be one of the most valuable
companies in the world. But its management has reduced its market cap to
just over one times sales, making it nearly the cheapest major phone company
in the country. Bell Labs performed much of the early work on the vital
new multimedia communications technology of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM),
but a new startup named Fore Systems dominates the market with scores of
other companies. Judge Green broke up AT&T once. Smart management would
break it up again.<BR>
<BR>
TIME WARNER: Time Warner went to the well for high-yield securities in 1984
at the time of the Atari crash. It plunged deep into debt to save the company
and preserve it film assets. With Lorimar, it produced more than a third
of all TV programming; with Warner films, it was the dominant Hollywood
force; with Warner records, it ruled music; and with Warner Communications,
it was the second-biggest cable system. In other words, it followed the
content-conduit strategy. Unfortunately, this strategy twisted its Orlando
project into unprofitable knots. Mobilizing some of the best technology
in the world- Silicon Graphics 3D interface and servers, AT&amp;T ATM, Scientific
Atlanta's 64QAM transmission-Warner compressed it into a TV set-top box
and centralized server system focused on delivering movies over cable conduits.
This business won't pay for the plant. Perhaps belatedly recognizing this
problem, the company is now veering in the oppsite direction, ordering 1.5
million new analog set-top boxes for $ 250 million from General Instrument.
Don't they grasp the deadly meaning of the DBS big bang?<BR>
<BR>
This company needs restructuring to get ready for a broadband world. It
must spin off its precious content and transform its conduit to accommodate
the only real interactive machines with market penetration, namely PCS.<BR>

But I don't understand howIntel gets hurt unless it stops delivering the best price/performance microprocessors.The more network connectivity the more we need MIPS. Andy Grove is rightthat DSPs are just a complex way of getting more MIPS. Just because bandwidthreduces some of the need for compression doesn't mean bandwidth reducesdemand for cycles.<BR><BR>In any case Gilder is very stimulating even when I disagree with him, andmost of the time I agree with him.<BR><HR><B><TT>Nicholas Negroponte - Director,<BR>MIT Media Laboratory, Boston, MA</TT></B> <H3>Debunking Bandwidth:</H3>When our world is fibered, the planet is like a desktop. Earth is but abackplane for a single computer. True. But as mere humans, the bandwidthwe're really interested in is the one that exists between us and computers,be they the size of a cuff link or a country. That bandwidth is often onewe want to be smaller, not bigger. Most of us, most of the time, want lessbits, not more bits. Sure we want gigabits, but only for a few millionthsof a second at a time.<BR><BR>Remember the early days of computing when stacks of fanfolded output weredropped on an executive's desk? People caught on quickly; that was data,not information. Today, for some reason, we have forgotten some simple conceptsabout what constitutes meaning and understanding and where they come from.You. So while it is real easy to ship vast amounts of data and high-resolutionimages back and forth between computers and while it is suddenly possibleto ignore geographic constraints, let's not forget that in many cases &quot;lessis more&quot; when it comes to bandwidth.<BR><BR>Narrow channels force us to be smarter. Yes, bandwidth will be free, butso will computing. The future will not be driven by either MIPS or BPS,but information and entertainment content. Andy Grove does not need to worryabout John Malone or Bill Gates. He has to worry about Michael Ovitz.<BR><BR><HR><PRE><B>Mark Stahlman - President,New Media Associates,  New York, NY</B></PRE><H3>Bandwidth to Burn: Now What Do We Do?</H3>Gilder has made a case for vastly expanded bandwidth overwhelming the influenceof the steady march of computing power. [But] what new need will drive businessesto translate the inventions Gilder describes into significant new mediaopportunities?<BR><BR>Apparently, it's the need for video-on-demand. [But] if this were a plausiblemass market, the streets of New York would be filled with bicycle messengersdelivering Tom Cruise with bags of Chinese food. No, during the next fiveto 10 years, bandwidth will certainly be consumed in much greater quantities--butfor completely different reasons. We will dramatically extend ourselvesand our social relationships with video-telephones. We will consume substantialbandwidth by substituting bandwidth for gasoline--through telecommuting.We will network to multimedia databases (such as the current Internet-basedWorld Wide Web) and dramatically expand our range of social contacts--acrossborders, cultures and tribes.<BR><BR>Unfortunately for Gilder's bandwidth braggarts, these enormous markets willbe built using a telecommunications technology which began deployment over10 years ago--ISDN--and in which none of them has any important financialstake today. Unglamorous, ungainly, even downright ugly, ISDN (integratedservices digital network) will be supplied by old-time telephone companies(not cable companies) and it will be driven by the steady progress of personalcomputers--themselves now a 15- to 20- year-old industry. As has been widelynoted, we tend to overestimate (sometimes dramatically) the near-term impactof new technologies and underestimate the long-range effects.<BR><BR>In this age, new technology hype has become an epidemic. Reality itself,as it turns out, is far more interesting.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael Slater - President,MicroDesign Resources,and Editorial Director,Microprocessor Report,  Sebastopol, CA</B></PRE>Increasing bandwidth will provide computers with more information to process,and this will increase, not decrease, the computational requirements. Havinghigh bandwidth makes it possible for the interface nodes to be less intelligent,but this is not necessarily desirable. Furthermore, the time frame mustbe considered; high-bandwidth WAN (wide area network) connections are notgoing to be widely available for years, and in the meantime, computationalpower will continue to be critical as a way to mitigate bandwidth limitations.<BR><BR>No matter how much bandwidth is available, it is still very desirable tohave high-performance computational ability in desktop systems. Renderingof three-dimensional images from mathematical representations, for example,is something that has widespread application not only in games, but in otherconsumer applications (like home and garden design programs). Orders ofmagnitude more performance will result in direct improvements in such applications,and bandwidth is no substitute here.<BR><BR>Finally, with regard to the inclusion of signal-processing capabilitiesin general-purpose microprocessors, I disagree with Gilder's conclusionthat this will not occur. Minor extensions to general-purpose architectures,such as the ability to perform four 8-bit additions in parallel using thesame hardware that normally performs a single 32-bit addition, will providea significant boost for applications such as video decompression. The costof adding these features is small, and the benefit is great. Sun and HPhave already made such additions to their processors, and I expect Inteland other x86 vendors will do so in the future. Dedicated DSPs will alwaysbe able to provide higher performance, but the incremental cost/performanceof adding functions to the host CPU is superior.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael E. Treacy - President,Treacy &amp; Co.,  Cambridge, MA{Treacy is co-author of The Discipline of Market Leaders}</B></PRE>[Gilder's] view is rounded on the narrow philosophy of technological determinism.It is a peculiar and persistent form of myopia based on the wobbly assertionthat the best technology will win in the marketplace. He who rides the besttechnological wave will ascend to glory. Oh, if it were only so! If technologydetermined success, there would be no Microsoft today. By any reasonablestandards, MS-DOS, the foundation of Mr. Gate's empire, was an average technologywhen it was brought to market more than a decade ago. But Microsoft hadall the other elements that created a compelling value proposition for itscustomer.<BR><BR>Value is what customers want. Intel has got what it takes and has been avalue leader for many years. Andy Grove has already begun to direct Intel'sdevelopment portfolio toward communications opportunities. He has read thesignals and made the call, just as he did several years ago when he vacatedthe memory-chip business, in advance of grinding competition and shrinkingmargins. With constant vigilance and change, Intel's success can continuefor years to come.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Howard Anderson - Managing Director,The Yankee Group,and General Partner,Battery Ventures,  Boston, MA</B></PRE>George Gilder's analysis of the changes in the computing and communicationstradeoff is brilliant, concise, analytical--and flawed. His portrait ofthe rapid changes in communications and relative disadvantage of the old-linecomputer industry (Intel, etc.) does not overestimate the movement. It underestimateshow the next 10 years will be the decade of Bandwidth on Demand. Considerthis: <UL><LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of bandwidth will drop faster than the costof computing. <LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of switching will drop faster than the costof bandwidth. </UL>Historical examples: The cost of a T1 line (1.54 megabits) coast to coastin 1985 was $ 40,000/month. Today? Under $ 2,000/month, a drop of 95%.<BR><BR>Assume the following: by 2000, computing is free, and bandwidth is free.Now--design the future!<BR><BR>The amount of money spent on ATM Research and Development (Source: YankeeGroup ATM Planning Service): <UL><LI>1993:$ 335 million <LI>1994:$ 550 million <LI>1995:$ 950 million </UL>So Gilder is right on about the impact of ATM. In fact, Fore Systems, whereour sister company Battery Ventures is the second-largest outside stockholder,carries a market capitalization of $ 900 million--on a $ 60 million salesbase demonstrating that the ATM value is well known within the industry.<BR><BR>This past year, the Yankee Group trained 5,000 end-users on the use of ATMtechnology and the most frequently asked question was, &quot;How in theworld am I going to use all that bandwidth?&quot; But it was only 10 yearsago that users thought they would fall off the end of the earth if theywent faster than 2.4 kilobits!<BR><BR>Which leads to some immutable laws about networks, which Gilder alludesto: <UL><LI>Networks always grow. <LI>Networks always become more complex. <LI>Networks find applications that double the bandwidth needed every threeyears. <LI>The cost of bandwidth is artificially high. </UL>Andy Grove is right: &quot;Only the paranoid survive.&quot;<BR><HR><PRE><B>G. A. Keyworth, IIThe Progress and Freedom Foundation,Washington, D.C.</B></PRE>George Gilder's article goes yet another step in establishing him as theforefront signal-to-noise processor&quot; of information technology. Yet,I confess to being somewhat confused by it.<BR><BR>My dilemma resides in what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--thatwe humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through oureyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears. The kind of bandwidththat Gilder projects are important to machine-to-machine communications,i.e., to networks, but it is the computer (in some form, whether PC, PDA,digital-phone or digital-TV) that will continue to determine the &quot;match&quot;between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule.<BR><BR>Bandwidth is important, because it will make the connection a richer one,but the fact remains that we humans lack broadband input channel to accessall that bandwidth directly. And it is the computer that must bridge thatgap, keeping it in the driver's seat as we enter the realm of ubiquitous,connected computing.<BR><BR>Gilder's article makes an additional point, and one that falls too oftenon deaf ears in Washington. That is that bandwidth scarcity, the basis formuch of our telecommunications regulation, is an outdated concept. Onlymajor revamping of the government's role in telecommunications will permitthe natural competition between computing and communications to play out.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Eric Schmidt - Chief Technical Officer,Sun Microsystems,  Mountain View, CA</B></PRE>Gilder's article does a wonderful job showing the potential impact of thebandwidth revolution. Let me give you two examples of approaches in computersystems to exploit enormous bandwidth increases:<BR><BR>The speed of light is not doubling every 18 months. There is a revolutionin system design for small, fast machines just as significant as the onefor broadband networks in your article. What we call today &quot;large servers&quot;will in fact have to become physically very small. We are now approaching&quot;design for light speed&quot; in computer systems, and we have to keepour handy ruler, measured in nanoseconds, ready for each new board design.Light travels about four inches in a nanosecond in today's wires, so that,in a 500-megahertz (two nanosecond) computer design, we have less than eightinches of room for our signals to travel in a synchronous processor design(as most are). This means that the fastest computers in our future willalso have to be the smallest!<BR><BR>The backplanes of these machines have to be physically very short. The limitof a single backplane makes it hard to keep up with the improvements inprocessor speeds, using traditional backplane designs.<BR><BR>Switching becomes a core strategy for computer systems. Two approaches thatmerge switching and architecture are now popular. One, called DistributedShared Memory, uses a switching network to link cache-coherent memoriestogether. In DSM computers, the power of shared memory designs can be extendedover very high- speed switched memory networks. The other, called clustering,has been around for at least 15 years, and uses a switching network to linkcomputer systems. In this approach, applications are modified to share commondisks, peripherals and software.<BR><BR>Small size and switching are the future of high-performance computing. Bothare based on networking as their core. As the switched networks get fasterthese architectures will come to dominate computing. The fastest improvingtechnology, in this case networking, always drives the architecture. Thehollowing out of the computer occurs when high-performance computers trulyspan networks. ATM asynchronous transfer model, now in its infancy, is thelikely network for us to bet on.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Steven Dorfman - President,Hughes Telecommunications and Space Co.GM Hughes,  Los Angeles, CA</B></PRE>In &quot;Ethersphere&quot; (Oct. 10) Gilder offers the view that high- poweredgeostationary satellites--the mainstay, high-capacity platforms of our past,current and future service offerings--are already antiques, and soon willbe displaced entirely by thousands of low earth orbiting satellites. Thatthese highly touted systems are nonexistent, unlaunched and unproven [andrequire major technical breakthroughs] are details that conveniently escapeGilder's scathing assault on geostationary systems.<BR><BR>Gilder should recognize that new technology products are designed and broughtto market based on a host of considerations in addition to pure technicalfeasibility. Tradeoffs are--must be--made. But to Gilder, &quot;tradeoff&quot;would appear to be synonymous with &quot;sellout.&quot;<BR><BR>In the corporate world, this is business naivet&Ccedil;. In deciding whatform Hughes's new Spaceway and DirecTV services, for example, should take,our goal was to deploy systems that: maximized technology insertion, therebyminimizing risk; provided a low-cost service for which there was demonstratedconsumer demand; and faced minimal regulatory, technology-development, orfinancing delays, thereby expediting service introduction.<BR><BR>A Ka-band GEO system, evolved from U.S. defense communication satelliteapplications, Spaceway is the logical extension of Hughes's universe of120,000 very small aperture terminal antennas worldwide, used for privatenetwork, two-way voice, data and video. Our me-satellite regional approachprovides global coverage at a cost of $ 3 billion. Because service can berolled out incrementally, revenues can be generated before full system deployment.(By contrast, virtually all 840 Teledesic satellites must be operational--ata $ 9 billion system cost--before service can begin.)<BR><BR>Our comparatively low investment cost and highly efficient spot beam architecture,whereby we cost-effectively target our capacity to the world's most populatedregions, yield significant savings and low user costs. . .critical becausedeveloping nations with limited communications infrastructure are a keymarket.<BR><BR>For voice, we expect that developing regions without access to low-costterrestrial voice service will embrace Spaceway despite the fractional timedelay--at least until terrestrial infrastructure is available. This is asignificant, revenue- generating window of opportunity for us. As for dataapplications, our VSAT experience has shown that custom developed protocolsprovide totally acceptable throughput efficiency and seamless interactivity.In short, we believe &quot;the delay issue&quot; has been overstated. Thereis a different delay issue, however, that cannot be overstated. Gilder is,I believe, overly optimistic about how soon Teledesic's technology willbe ready--and hence, how soon service revenues can be generated.<BR><BR>I believe Spaceway is the best technological solution for this market atthis time. But if tomorrow the technology and market are in place so thatthe LEO system makes sense, rest assured that Hughes will introduce an innovativeLEO product of Our own.<BR><BR>Gilder attaches far too little import and value (in the form of operatingprofits) to today's technology. Nowhere is this more clear than in his assessmentof satellite direct-to-home television programming. Gilder calls DBS &quot;one-size-fits-allprogramming,&quot; stressing its lack of sufficient consumer choice andabsence of Interactivity. But in holding out for a fiber solution, Gilderis making a poor business decision.<BR><BR>Today, Hughes's two DirecTV GEO satellites are filled with 150 program channels.We are adding 3,000 subscribers a day, and will break even (three million)by mid-1996. With 10 million subscribers projected by 2000, DirecTV willbe a $ 3 billion a year business, with $ 1 billion in operating profit.<BR><BR>Waiting for the future, Gilder, carries a price tag most CEOs can't afford,and are not prepared to pay. <PRE><HR></PRE><H2><CENTER>GEORGE GILDER REPLIES:</CENTER></H2>I want to thank my correspondents for their alternately poetic, ironic,trenchant and pithy responses. So many of them, though, share the notionthat I predicted dire straits for Intel that I must assume a lack d clarityin my treatment of the issue. I predicted that new and larger opportunitieswould arise in the field of communications processors and systems that centralprocessing units would bear a declining share of total processing not thatthey would in themselves decline in any absolute sense. Indeed, CPUs shouldcontinue to improve their cost-effectiveness apace with Moore's Law, plusan increment for architectural advances in parallelism. Such advances, however,will fail to keep pace with the onrushing expansion of bandwidth, as furtherdetailed by Howard Anderson's intriguing letter. Bandwidth gains will befed on the demand side, as Mark Stahlman incisively observes, more by theneeds of teleconferencing and telecommuting than by the need for one-wayvideo-on-demand.<BR><BR>Thus I agree with Bill Gates that Intel can continue to thrive as long asit continues to produce the most cost-effective microprocessors. I did raisethe possibility, foreshadowed by Microunity's new semiconductor lab process,that Intel's existing technology might face rivals that could produce moreMIPs or gigabits per second per watt. Power efficiency will be a crucialindex in a time of seething CPUs and increasing demands for power- savingdesigns from producers of mobile appliances, such as the digital cellularcommunicators which will be the most common PCs of the next decade.<BR><BR>Focusing on gigabits per second as a prime spec, these devices may welleclipse CPUs in raw processing pace and find a wide range of applicationsin digital radio, real-time compression and decompression, pattern recognition,echo- cancellation and other digital signal processing uses. The demandsof these applications have already impelled an array of processing and architecturaladvances at Microunity, Texas Instruments and elsewhere in the pullulatingfield of DSP. Unconstrained by proprietary legacies and immense installedbases, perhaps other manufacturers will also find ways to excel the Moore'sLaw pace of Intel's majestic progress down the learning curve of three-voltCMOS technology.<BR><BR>Jay Keyworth and Nicholas Negroponte both eloquently point to the centralparadox of the information age. While production systems of the industrialage use scarce resources, such as land, labor, and capital, to create abundance,production systems of the information age use abundant resources, such asbits and bandwidth, to create knowledge scarce enough to fit the bandwidthof humans. This distillation function--delivering correct and useful datato human beings with their Keyworth window of roughly 30 kilohertz cochleaand 30 megahertz retinas--requires processing speeds orders of magnitudeabove the human rates, just to sample, quantize and codify the flow. Toscan, select, recognize, correct, decompress, echo-cancel, visualize orotherwise manipulate the data entails still further accelerations of processingpower.<BR><BR>Communications processors may well emerge as most efficient for many ofthese tasks. The idea that all such functions will be sucked into the CPUhas a long history, but motherboards and their buses remain as crowded asever. I suspect that the bandwidth explosion will offer many opportunitiesfor processors specializing in communications.<BR><BR>Steven Dorfman of Hughes, I predict, will do better both for his companyand his two-way communications from space by moving quickly rather thanslowly to low earth orbits. I fully share his admiration for the point-tomultipoint-powers of DBS and I have long cited them as a prime reason forthe obsolescence of cable TV regulations based on the assumption of monopoly.Indeed, I predict far more than 10 million users by 2000 if Hughes and itssuppliers can meet the demand. But satellite and cable TV vendors will prosperbest by providing two-way channels for the 110 million personal computersin the land. I expect that these channels--particularly CATV, not ISDN--willprovide the dominant access channel for computers over the next decade.<BR><BR>Above all, I hope that whoever Andy Grove fears most, it is not MichaelOvitz. Grove goes Hollywood and we'll all be in trouble.<BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="49" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<HR><BR>
Andrew Grove, Titan of Intel, is widely known for his belief, born in the
vortex of the Hungarian Revolution and honed in the trenches of Silicon
Valley, that &quot;only the paranoid survive.&quot; If so, the Intel chief
may soon need to resharpen the edges of fear that have driven his company
to the top. Looming on the horizons of the global computer industry that
Grove now shapes and spearheads is a gathering crest of change that threatens
to reduce the microprocessor's supremacy and reestablish the information
economy on new foundations. Imparting a personal edge to the challenge are
the restless energies of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Tele-Communications
Inc.'s John Malone, providing catalytic capital and leadership for the new
tides of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Grove's response is seemingly persuasive. &quot;We have state-of-the-art
silicon technology, state-of-the art microprocessor design skills and we
have mass production volumes.&quot; These huge assets endow Intel as a global
engine of growth with 55% margins and more than 80% market share in the
single most important product in the world economy. Why indeed should Grove
worry?<BR>
<BR>
One word only may challenge him and with him much of the existing computer
establishment. Let us paraphrase a 1988 speech by John Moussouris, chairman
and chief executive of the amazing Silicon Valley startup MicroUnity, which
gains a portentous heft from being financed heavily by Gates and Malone:
If the leading sage of computer design, in his last deathbed gasp, wanted
to impart in one word all of his accumulated wisdom about the coming era
to a prodigal son rushing home to inherit the business, that one word would
be &quot;bandwidth.&quot; Andy Grove knows it well. Early this year he memorably
declaimed: &quot;If you are amazed by the fast drop in the cost of computing
power over the last decade, just wait till you see what is happening to
the cost of bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, is one of the
few men who have measured this coming tide and mastered some of its crucial
implications. His key insight is that the onrush of bandwidth abundance
overthrows Moore's Law as the driving force of computer progress. Until
now progress in the computer industry has ridden the revelation in 1979
by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors on chips,
and thus the price-performance of computers, doubles every 18 months. Soon,
however, Schmidt ordains, bandwidth will be king.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth is communications power--the capacity of an information channel
to transmit bits without error in the presence of noise. In fiber optics,
in wireless communications, in new dumb switches, in digital signal processors,
bandwidth will expand from five to 100 times as fast as the rise of microprocessor
speeds. With the rapid spread of national networks of fiber and cable, the
dribble of kilobits (thousands of bits) from twisted-pair telephone lines
is about to become a firehose of gigabits (billions of bits). But the PC
is not ready. Attach the firehose to the parallel port of your personal
computer and the stream of bits becomes a blast of data smithereens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tsunami of Gigabits<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The bandwidth bottleneck of telephone wires has long allowed the computer
world to live in a strange and artificial isolation. In the computer world,
Moore's Law has reigned. At its awesome exponential pace, computer price-performance
would increase some one hundredfold every 10 years. This means that for
the price of a current 100 mips (millions of instructions per second) Pentium
machine, you could buy a computer in 2004 running 10 billion instructions
per second. Since today the fastest bit streams routinely linked to computers
run 100 times slower, at 10 megabits per second on an Ethernet, 10 bips
seems adequate as a 10-year target. All seems fine in computer land, where
users rarely wonder what happens after the wire reaches the wall.<BR>
<BR>
In the face of the 10 times faster increase in bandwidth, however, Moore's
Law seems almost paltry. The rise in bandwidth does not follow the smooth
incremental ascent that the heroic exertions, inventions and investments
of Andy Grove and his followers have maintained in microchips. bandwidth
bumps and grinds and then volcanically erupts. The communications equivalent
of those 10 bips that would take 10 years to reach according to the existing
trend would be 10-gigabit-per-second connections to their corporate customers
next year.<BR>
<BR>
During the very period of apparent bandwidth doldrums during the 1980s,
phone companies installed some 10 million kilometers of optical fiber. So
far only an infinitesimal portion of its potential bandwidth has been delivered
to customers. Moussouris estimates that the bandwidth of fiber has been
exploited one million times less fully than the bandwidth of coax or twisted
pair copper.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the tide is now gathering toward a crest. This year, MCI offers
its corporate customers access to a fiber connection at 2.4 gigabits per
second. Next year that link will run at 10 gigabits per second for the same
price. Two years after that it is scheduled to rise to 40 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, at Martlesham Heath in the United Kingdom, home of British Telecom's
research laboratories, Peter Cochrane announced in early September that
he could send some 700 separate wavelength streams in parallel down a single
fiber-optic thread the width of a human hair. Peter Scovell of Northern
Telecom's Bell Northern Research facility declares that by using &quot;solitons&quot;--an
exotic method of keeping the bits intact at high speeds through a kind of
surface tension counterbalancing dispersion in the fiber--it will be possible
to carry 2.4 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) on each wave length
stream. That would add up to more than 1,700 gigahertz on every fiber thread.<BR>
<BR>
Blocking such bandwidths until recently was what is called in the optics
trade the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot; The light signals had to be
converted to electronic pulses every 35 kilometers in order to be amplified
and regenerated. Thus fiber optics could not function any faster than these
electronic amplifiers did, or between two and 10 gigahertz. In the late
1980s, however, a team led by David Payne of the University of Southampton
pioneered the concept of doping a fiber with the rare earth element erbium,
to create an all-optical broadband amplifier. Perfected at Bell Labs, NTT
and elsewhere, this device overcomes the electronic bottleneck and allows
communications entirely at the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
IBM's optical guru Paul Green prophesies that within the next decade or
so it will be possible to send some 10,000 wavelength streams down a single
fiber thread. Long prophesied by fiber optics pioneer Will Hicks, these
developments remain mostly in the esoteric domains of optical laboratories.
But IBM recently installed its first all-optical product--its MuxMaster--for
a customer running 20 wavelengths on a fiber connecting offices in New York
to a backup tape drive in New Jersey. Telephone companies from Italy to
Canada are now deploying erbium-doped amplifiers. Long the frenzied pursuit
of telecom laboratories from Japan to Dallas and government bodies from
ARPA to NTT (now turning private), all-optical networks have become the
object of entrepreneurial startups, such as Ciena and Erbium Networks.<BR>
<BR>
Returning from the ethers of innovation to existing broadband technology
connecting to people's homes, Craig Tanner of CableLabs in Louisville, Colo.,
maintains that a typical cable coax line can accommodate two-way streams
of data totaling eight gigabits per second. In Cambridge and other eastern
Massachusetts cities, Continental Cablevision is now taking the first steps
toward delivering some of this bandwidth for Andy Grove's PC users. Today,
using Digital Equipment's LANCity broadband two-way cable modems, David
Fellows, Continental's chief technical officer, can offer 10 megabits per
second Ethernet capability 70 miles from your office. That increases the
current 9.6 kilobits per second speeds of most telephone modems by a factor
of 1,000.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term contributor to the tides of bandwidth is a
new communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode. ATM is
to telecommunications what containerization is to transport. It puts everything
into same-sized boxes that can be readily handled by automated equipment.
Just as containerization revolutionized the transport business, ATM is revolutionizing
communications. In the case of ATM, the boxes are called cells and each
one is 53 bytes long, including a five-byte address. The telephone industry
chose 53 bytes as the largest possible container that could deliver real-time
voice communications. But the computer industry embraced it because it allows
fully silicon switching and routing. Free of complex software, small packets
of a uniform 53 bytes can be switched at enormous speeds through an ATM
network and dispatched to the end users on a fixed schedule that can accommodate
voice, video and data, all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Available at rates of 155 megabits per second and moving this year to 622
megabits and 2.4 gigabits, ATM switches from Fujitsu, IBM, AT&amp;T, Fore
Systems, Cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications and every other major manufacturer
of hubs and routers will swamp the ports of personal computers over the
next five years.<BR>
<BR>
Why should all this bandwidth arouse the competitive fire of Andy Grove?
The new explosions of bandwidth enable interactive multimedia and video,
riding on radio frequencies, into every household--through the air from
satellites and terrestrial wireless systems, through fiberoptic threads
and cable TV and even phone-company coax.<BR>
<BR>
If the personal computer cannot handle these streams, John Malone's set-top
boxes, Sega or Nintendo game machines or Bill Gates's new communications
technology will. A communications technology that can manage multimedia
in full flood can also in time relegate one of Grove's CPUs to service as
a minor peripheral. The huge promise of the PC industry, with its richness
of productivity tools and cultural benefits, could give way to an incoherent
babel of toys, videophones and 3D games.<BR>
<BR>
Redeeming the new era for the general-purpose PC entails overcoming the
technical culture and mindset of bandwidth scarcity. In today's world of
bandwidth scarcity, arrays of special-purpose microprocessors constantly
use their hard-wired computer cycles to compensate for the narrow bandwidth
of existing channels and to make up for the small capacity of the fast,
expensive memories where the data must be buffered or stored on the way.
This is the world that Intel dominates today--a world of CPUs incapable
of handling full multimedia and radio frequency demands, a world of narrowband
four-kilohertz pipes to the home accessed by modems at 9.6 kilobits per
second and a world of what Moussouris call arrays of &quot;twisty little
processors,&quot; such as MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) decoders from
C-Cube and IIT, graphics accelerators from Texas Instruments and an array
of chips from Intel.<BR>
<BR>
By fixing the necessary algorithms in hardware, these devices bypass the
time-consuming tasks of retrieving software instructions and data from memory.
Thus these chips can perform their functions at least 100 times faster than
more general-purpose devices, such as Intel's Pentium, that use software.
But all this speed comes at the cost of rigid specialization. An MPEG-1
processor cannot even decode, MPEG-2. When the technology changes, you have
to replace the chip. Such special-purpose devices now handle the broadband
heavy lifting for video compression and decompression, digital radio processing,
voice and sound synthesis, speech recognition, echo cancellation, graphics
acceleration and other functions too demanding for the central processor.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, contemplate a world of bandwidth abundance. In a world of bandwidth
abundance, specialized, hard-wired processing will be mostly unnecessary.
In the extreme case, images can flow uncompressed through the network and
onto the display. Bandwidth will have obviated thousands of mips of processing.
The microprocessor instead can focus on managing documents on the screen,
popping up needed information from databases, performing simulations or
visualizations and otherwise enriching the conference. The arrival of bandwidth
abundance transforms the computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Grove's and Intel's bold investments in chip-making capability --
some $ 2.4 billion in 1994 alone--the entire information industry has waxed
fat and happy on the bonanzas of Moore's Law. Now, however, some industry
leaders are gasping for breath. Exkhard Pfeiffer of Compaq has denounced
Intel's avid campaign to shift customers toward the leading-edge processors
such as Pentium, embodying the latest Moore's Law advances. Gordon Moore
himself has recently questioned whether the pace of microchip progress can
continue in the face of wafer factory costs rising toward $ 2 billion for
a typical &quot;fab.&quot; He has pronounced a new Moore's Law: The costs
of a wafer fab double for each new generation of microprocessor.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, but the new world of the telecosm offers no rest for weary microchip
magnates or future-shocked PC producers. Driven by the new demands of video
and multimedia, the pace of advance will now accelerate sharply rather than
slow down.<BR>
<H4>Feeding the Tiger</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplate the advance of the Tiger, Microsoft's all-software scheme for
video-on-demand based entirely on PCs. Although Tiger has been presented
as merely another way to build a &quot;movie central&quot; for cable headends
or telco central offices, its real promise is not to redeem the existing
centralized structure of video but to allow any PC owner to create a headend
in the kitchen for video-on-demand. Today, such capability would mean buying
a supercomputer plus an array of expensive boards containing special-purpose
processors. Tiger's consummation as a popular product therefore will require
a new regime of semiconductor progress.<BR>
<BR>
Driven by this imperative, a pioneering combine of Gates, Malone and Moussouris
is making an audacious grab for supremacy in the telecosm. Just three miles
from Intel and fueled by ideas from a 1984 defector from an Intel fabrication
team, Moussouris's MicroUnity is a flagrantly ambitious Sunnyvale, Calif.,
startup launched in 1988. Fueled by some $ 15 million from Microsoft and
$ 15 million from TCI, among several other rumored backers, it plans a transformation
of chip-making for the age of the telecosm, optimized for communications
rather than computations.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity's goal is a general-purpose mediaprocessor, software programmable,
that can run at no less than 400 billion bits per second--some hundreds
of times faster than a Pentium--and perform all the functions currently
done in special-purpose multimedia devices. Escaping the tyranny of fixed
hardware standards, the mediaprocessor could receive decompression codes
and other protocols, algorithms and services over the network with the video
to be displayed in real time.<BR>
<H4>The Great Bandwidth Switch</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In launching Tiger and MicroUnity, Gates and Malone are signaling a fundamental
shift in the industry. Ruling the new era will be bandwidth or communications
power, measured in billions of bits per second rather than in the millions
of instructions per second of current computers. The telecosmic shift from
mips to bandwidth, from storage-oriented computing to communications processing,
will change the entire structure of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the industry has been driven by increases in computer power
embodied in new generations of microprocessors--from the 8086 to the Pentium
and on to the P-6 and new Reduced Instruction Set screamers such as the
Power PC, Digital Equipment's Alpha and Silicon Graphics new R-1000 (the
latest in the family from Moussouris's previous company Mips Computer, now
owned by Silicon Graphics). External computer networks typically run much
more slowly than internal networks, the backplane buses connecting microprocessors,
memories, keyboards and screens. These buses race along at some 40 megabits
per second, up to Intel's new gigabit-per-second PCI bus. Even when computers
are linked in local area networks in particular buildings at 10 megabit-per-second
Ethernet speeds, they face a communications cliff at LAN's end: the four-kilohertz
wires of the telephone company. Under this regime, the processor is king
and Moore's Law dictates the pace of change.<BR>
<BR>
In the age of the telecosm, however, all these rules collapse. When the
network increasingly runs faster than the processors and buses in the PC,
the computer &quot;hollows out,&quot; in the words of Eric Schmidt. The
network becomes the bus and any set of interconnected processors and memories
can become a computer regardless of their location. In this bandwidth-driven
world, the key chips are communications processors, such as digital signal
processors (DSPs) and MicroUnity's mediaprocessors, which must function
at the pace of the network firehose rather than at the pace of the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, communications processors have indeed been improving
their price/performance tenfold every two years--more than three times as
fast as microprocessors. This kind of difference add up. Soaring DSP capabilities
have already made possible the achievement of many new digital technologies
previously unattainable. Among them are digital video compression, video
teleconferencing, broadband digital radios pioneered by Steinbrecher (see
Forbes ASAP, April 11, 1994), digital echo cancellation and spread-spectrum
cellular systems that allow 100% frequency reuse in every cell. All these
schemes require processing speeds far in excess of the bit rate of the information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in accord with the prevailing MPEG standards, digital video
compression produces a bit stream running at between 1.5 and six megabits
per second. But in order to produce this signal manageable by a 100 mips
Pentium, a supercomputer or special-purpose machine must process raw video
bit flowing 100 times as fast as the compressed format--uncompressed video
at a pace of 150 to 600 megabits per second. The complex and exacting process
of compressing this onrush of bits--compensating for motion, comparing blocks
of pixels for redundancy, smoothing out the flow of data--entails computer
operations running 1,000 times as fast as the raw video bits. That is, the
video compression algorithm requires a processing speed of between 150 and
600 gigabits per second--hundred of times faster than the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, just to digitize radio signals requires a sampling rate twice
as fast as the radio frequency--at a time when new wireless personal communications
systems are moving to the two gigahertz bands and wireless cable is moving
to 28 gigahertz. A broadband digital radio must handle some large multiple
of the highest frequency it will process. Code division multiple access
(CDMA) cellular systems depend on a spreading code at least 100 times faster
than the bit rate of the message.<BR>
<BR>
In order to feed the Tiger and other such bandwidth-hungry systems, communications
processors will have to continue this breathtaking binge of progress beyond
the bounds of the microcosm. Grove does not believe this possible. He contends
that the surge in DSP will dwindle and converge with Moore's Law, allowing
the central processor to suck in functions currently performed in digital
signal processors and other communications chips. DSP is nice, Grove observes,
&quot;but it is not free--unless, that is, it is performed in the Intel
CPU, obviating the need to buy a DSP chip at all.<BR>
<BR>
But in an era when the network advances faster than the CPU, it is more
likely that communications processors will gradually &quot;suck in&quot;
and &quot;hollow out&quot; the functions of the CPU, rather than the other
way around. Echoing Sun's perennial slogan, Schmidt predicts that the network
will become the computer. In this era, Moore's Law and the law of the microcosm
are no longer the driving force of progress in information technology. Bandwidth
is king.<BR>
<BR>
As the great pioneer of communications theory Claude Shannon wrote in 1948,
bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Since ultimately a microprocessor
is a set of millions of transistor switches inscribed on a chip, bandwidth
can even serve as a substitute for mips. With sufficient communication,
engineers can duplicate any computer network topology they want. As the
network becomes the computer, they thus redefine the optimal architectures
of computing. As an example, take the problem of video-on-demand now being
confronted by every major company in the industry from IBM to Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992, Microsoft assigned this problem to Craig Mundie, a veteran of Data
General in Massachusetts, who had gone on to found Alliant Computer, one
of the more successful of the massively parallel computer firms. As a supercomputer
man, Mundie initially explored a hardware solution, hiring a team of computer
designers from Supercomputer Systems Inc. SSI was Steve Chen's effort to
follow up on his successes at Cray Research with a machine for IBM. Although
IBM ultimately closed SSI down, Chen commanded some of the best talent in
supercomputers. Mundie hired George Spix and a team from SSI.<BR>
<H4>Looking to Software</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, video-on-demand seems a super-computer task. It entails
taking tens of thousands of streams of digital images, smoothing them into
real-time flows, and switching them to the customers requesting them. Essentially
huge hierarchies of storage devices, including fast silicon memories, connected
through a specialized switching fabric to arrays of fast processors, supercomputers
seem perfectly adapted to video-on-demand, which as Bill Gates explains,
is &quot;essentially a switching problem.&quot; This is the solution chosen
by Oracle Systems, using its nCube supercomputer, and by Silicon Graphics,
employing its PowerChallenge server.<BR>
<BR>
According to Mundie, the SSI team developed an impressive video server design.
But they soon discovered they were in the wrong company. As Gates told Forbes
ASAP, &quot;Microsoft looks for a software solution to all problems. IBM
looks for a mainframe hardware solution. Larry Ellison owned a supercomputer
company so he looked for that solution. Fortunately for us, software solutions
are the most scaleable, flexible, fault-tolerant and low cost.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Enter Rick Rashid, a professor from Carnegie Mellon and designer of the
Mach kernel adopted by Next, IBM and the Open Software Foundation and incorporated
in part in Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Rashid joined Microsoft
in September 1991 and began to focus on video-on-demand in 1992. Like most
other people confronting this challenge, he first assumed that the huge
bit streams involved would require specialized hardware--RAID (redundant
arrays of inexpensive disk) storage, fast buffer memories and supercomputer-style
switches. Soon, however, he came to the conclusion that progress in the
personal computer industry would enable an entirely software solution.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the memory problem illustrates a tradeoff between bandwidth
and processing speed. Expensive hierarchies of RAID drives and semiconductor
buffer memories managed by complex controller logic can speed the bit streams
to the switch at the necessary pace. But Rashid and Mundie saw that bandwidth
offered a cheaper solution. Through clever software, you could &quot;stripe&quot;
the film bits across large arrays of conventional disk drives and gain speed
through bandwidth. Rather than using one fast memory, plus fast processors,
and hard-wired fault tolerance to send the movie reliably to a customer,
you spread the images across arrays of cheap, slow disk drives--Seagate
Barracudas--which, working in parallel, offer bandwidth and redundancy limited
only the number of devices. Having dispensed with the idea of contriving
expensive hardware solutions for the memory problem, Rashid recognized that
with Windows NT he commanded an operating system with real-time scheduling
guarantees that laid the foundation for a software solution. On it, he could
proceed to build Tiger as a continuous digital stream operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Liberated from special-purpose hardware, the team could revel in all the
advantages of using off-the-shelf personal computer components. Mundie explains:
&quot;The personal computer industry commands intrinsic volume and a multi-supplier
structure that takes anything in its path and drives its costs to ground.&quot;
A burly entrepreneur of massively parallel supercomputers, Mundie became
a fervent convert to the manifest destiny of the PC to dominate all other
technologies in the race to multimedia services, grinding all costs and
functions into the ground of microprocessor silicon.<BR>
<BR>
Video-on-demand has been heralded as the salvation of the television industry,
the supercomputer industry, the game industry, the high-end server industry.
It has been seen as Microsoft's move into hardware. Yet nowhere in the Tiger
Laboratory in Building Nine is there any device made by any TV company,
supercomputer firm, workstation company, or Microsoft itself. On one side
of the room are 12 monitors. On the other side are 12 Compaq computers piled
on top of each other, said to be simulating set-top boxes. Next to these
are a pile of Seagate Barracuda disk drives, each capable of holding the
nine gigabytes of video in three high-resolution compressed movies. Next
to them are another pile of Compaq computers functioning as video servers.<BR>
<BR>
All this gear works together to extend Microsoft's long mastery of the science
of leverage, getting most of the world to drive costs to ground--or grind
cost into silicon--while the grim reapers of Redmond collect tolls on the
software. Exploiting another of Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy's famous
laws--&quot;The smartest people in every field are never in your own company&quot;--Gates
has contrived to induce most of the personal computer industry, from Bangalore
to Taiwan, to work for Microsoft without joining the payroll.<BR>
<BR>
In the new world of bandwidth abundance, however, it is no longer sufficient
to leverage the PC industry alone. Gates is now reaching out to leverage
the telephone and network equipment manufacturing industries as well. Transforming
all this PC hardware into a &quot;Tiger&quot; that can consume the TV industry
is an ATM switch. In the Tiger application, once one ATM switch has correctly
sequenced the movie bits streaming from the tower of Seagate disks, another
ATM switch in a metropolitan public network will dispatch the now ordered
code to the appropriate display. Microsoft's Tiger and its client &quot;cubs&quot;
all march in asynchronous transfer mode.<BR>
<H4>The Masters of Leverage</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is this a brilliant coup? It positions Microsoft to harvest the fruits
of the single most massive and far-reaching project in all electronics today.
Some 600 companies are now active in the ATM forum, with collective investments
approaching $ 10 billion and rising every year. Not only are ATM switches
produced by a competitive swarm of companies resembling the PC industry,
ATM also turns networks of small computers into scaleable supercomputers.
It combines with fiber-optic links to provide a far simpler, more modular
and more scaleable solution than the complex copper backplane buses that
perform the same functions in large computers. ATM and fiber prevail by
using bandwidth as a substitute for complex protocols and computations.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft Technical Director Nathan Myhrvold points to the Silicon Graphics
PowerChallenge superserver as a contrast. &quot;They have a bus that can
handle 2.4 gigabytes per second and which is electrically balanced to take
a bunch of add-in cards (for processor and memory).&quot; The complexities
of this solution yield an expensive machine, costing more than $ 100,000,
with specialized DRAM boards, for example, that cost 10 times as much per
megabyte as DRAM in a PC.<BR>
<BR>
This problem is not specific to Silicon Graphics. All supercomputers with
multiple microprocessors linked with fast buses face the same remorseless
economics and complexities. By contrast, the $ 30,000 Fore systems ATM switch
being used in Tiger prototypes--together with the PCI buses in the PCs on
the network--supply the same 2.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth that
the PowerChallenge does. And, as Myhrvold points out, &quot;ATM prices are
dropping like a stone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Microsoft sage explains: ATM switches linked by fiber optic lines are
far more efficient at high bandwidth than copper buses on a backplane. ATM
allows &quot;fault tolerance and other issues to be handled in software
by treating machines (or disks, or even the ATM switch itself) as being
replaceable and redundant, with hot spares standing by.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Gates told ASAP, video-on-demand is essentially a switching problem.
You can create an expensive, proprietary, and unscaleable switch using copper
lines and complex protocols on the backplane of a supercomputer, or you
can use the bandwidth of fiber optics and ATM as a substitute for these
complexities. You can put the ATM switches wherever you need them to create
a system optimized for any application, allowing any group of PCs using
Windows NT and PCI buses to function as video clients or servers as desired.
As Microsoft leverages the world, it won't object if the world chooses to
lift NT into the forefront of operating systems in unit sales.<BR>
<BR>
Mundie and his assistant Redd Becker earnestly explain the virtues of this
scheme and demonstrate its robustness and fault tolerance by disabling several
of the disk drives, cubs and servers without perceptibly affecting the 12
images on the screen. They offer it as a system to function as a movie central
server resembling the Oracle nCube system adopted by Bell Atlantic, or the
Silicon Graphics system used by Time Warner in its heralded Orlando project.
But the Tiger is fundamentally different from these systems in that it is
completely scaleable and reconfigurable, functioning with full VCR interactivity
for a single citizen or for a city. It epitomizes the future of computing
in the age of ATM, a system that will soon operate at up to 2.4 gigabits
per second. Two point four gigabits per second is more than twice as fast
as the Intel PCI bus that links the internal components of a Pentium-based
personal computer.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, ATM technology can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and an external Barracuda, between a video client and a video
server. To the CPU, a local area network or even a wide area network running
ATM can function as a motherboard backplane. With NT and Tiger software,
PCs will be able to tap databases and libraries across the world as readily
as they can reach their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives. Presented as an
application-specific system for multimedia or movie distribution in real
time, it is in fact a new operating system for client-server computing in
the new age of image processing.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Bell, now on Microsoft's technical advisory board, sums up the future
of computing in an ATM world: &quot;We can imagine a network with a range
of PC-sized nodes costing between $ 500 and $ 5,000 that provide person-to-person
communication, television and when used together (including in parallel),
an arbitrarily large computer. Clearly, because of standards, ubiquity of
service and software market size, this architecture will drive out most
other computer structures such as massively parallel computers, low-priced
workstations and all but a few special-purpose processors. This doomsday
for hardware manufacturers will arrive before the next two generations of
computer hardware play out at the end of the decade. But it will be ideal
for users.&quot; And for Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of equipment that feeds the Tiger, however, what Bell
calls &quot;doomsday for hardware manufacturers: may well be as profitable
as the current rage of &quot;Doom,&quot; the new computer game infectiously
spreading from the Internet into computer stores. The new Tiger model provides
huge opportunities for manufacturers of new ATM switches on every scale,
for PCs equipped with fast video buses such as PCI, for vendors of network
hardware and software, and perhaps most of all for the producers of the
new communications processors.<BR>
<BR>
For all the elegance of the Tiger system, however, Gates understands that
it cannot achieve its goals within the constraints of Moore's Law in the
semiconductor industry. The vision of &quot;any high school dropout buying
PCs and entering the interactive TV business&quot; cannot prevail if it
takes a supercomputer to compress the images and an array of special-purpose
processors to decode, decrypt and decompress them. Facing an ATM streams
of 622 megabits per second--perhaps uncompressed video, 3-D or multimedia
images--Eric Schmidt points out, a 100 mips Pentium machine would have to
process 1.47 million 53-byte cells a second. That means well under 100 instruction
cycles to read, store, display and analyze a packet. Since most computers
use many cycles for hidden background tasks, the Pentium could not begin
to do the job. Gate's adoption of Tiger, his alliance with TCI, his investments
in Teledesic, Metricom, and MicroUnity, all bring home face-to-face with
the limits of current computer technology in confronting the telecosm. With
MicroUnity, however, he may have arrived at a solution just in time.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity seems like a throwback to the early years of Silicon Valley,
when all things seemed possible--when Robert Widlar could invent a new product
for National Semiconductor on the beach in Puerto Vallarta, and develop
a new process to build it with David Talbert and his wife Dolores over beers
on a bench at the Wagon Wheel. It was an era when scores of semiconductor
companies were racing down the learning curve to enhance the speed and functions
of electronic devices. Most of all, the MicroUnity project is a climactic
episode in the long saga of the industry's struggle between two strategies
for accelerating the switching speeds in computers.<BR>
<H4>A New Moore's Law?</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel Chairman Gordon Moore recently promulgated a new Moore's Law, supposedly
deflecting the course of the old Moore's Law, which ordains that chip densities
double every 18 months. The new law is that the costs of a chip factory
double with each generation of microprocessor. Moore speculated that these
capital burdens might deter or suppress the necessary investment to continue
the pace of advance in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Gerhard (&quot;Gerry&quot;) Parker, Intel's chief technical officer, however,
presents contrary evidence. The cost for each new structure may be approximately
doubling as Moore says. But the cost per transistor--and thus the cost per
computer function--continues to drop by a factor of between three and four
every three years. Not only does the number of transistors on a chip rise
by a factor of four, but the number of chips sold doubles with every generation
of microprocessor, as the personal computer market doubles every three years.
Thus there will be some eight times more transistors sold by Intel from
a Pentium fab that from a 486 fab. At merely twice the cost, the new fab
seems a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Intel gets paid not for transistors but for computer functions.
To realize the benefits of the new fabs, therefore, Intel must deliver new
computer functions that successfully adapt to the era of bandwidth abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it is worth noting that measured in telecosmic terms of useful
terabits per second of bandwidth, a MicroUnity fab ultimately costing some
$ 150 million might generate more added value than a $ 2 billion megafab
of Intel.<BR>
<H4>Return to Low and Slow</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since as a general rule, the more the power, the faster the switch, you
can get speed by using high-powered or exotic individual components. It
is an approach that worked well for years at Cray, IBM, NEC and other supercomputer
vendors. Wire together superfast switches and you will get a superfast machine.<BR>
<BR>
The other choice for speed is to use low-powered, slow switches. You make
them so small and jam them so close together, the signals get to their destinations
nearly as fast as the high-powered signals. This approach works well in
the microprocessor industry and in the human brain.<BR>
<BR>
Despite occasional deviations at Cray and IBM, low and slow has been the
secret of all success in semiconductors from the outset. Inventor William
Shockley substituted slow, low-powered transistors for faster, high-powered
vacuum tubes. Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments replaced fast germanium with
slower silicon. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild spurned the fast track of mountainous
Mesa transistors to adopt a flat &quot;planar&quot; technology in which
devices were implanted below the surface of the chip. Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce then substituted slow resistors and capacitors as well as slow transistors
on integrated circuits for faster, high-powered devices on modules and printed
circuit boards. Federico Faggin made possible the microprocessor by replacing
fast metal gates on transistors with slow gates made of polysilicon. Frank
Wanlass and others replaced faster NMOS and PMOS technologies with the 1,000
times slower and 10 times lower-power Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors
(CMOS) that now rule the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Low and slow finds its roots in the very physics of solid state, separating
the microcosm from the macrocosm. Chips consist of complex patterns of wires
and switches. In the macrocosm of electromechanics, wires were simple, fast,
cool, reliable and virtually free; switches were vacuum tubes, complex,
fragile, hot and expensive. In the macrocosm, the rule was economize on
switches, squander on wires. But in the microcosm, all these rules of electromechanics
collapsed.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, switches are almost free--a few millionths of a cent.
Wires are the problem. However fast they may be, longer wires laid down
on the chip and more wires connected to it translated directly into greater
resistance and capacitance and more needed power and resulting heat. These
problems become exponentially more acute as wire diameters drop. On the
other hand, the shorter the wires the purer the signal and the smaller the
resistance, capacitance and heat.<BR>
<BR>
This fact of physics is the heart of microelectronics. As electron movements
approach their mean free path-- he distance they can travel &quot;ballistically&quot;
without bouncing off the internal atomic structure of the silicon--they
get faster, cheaper and cooler.<BR>
<BR>
At the quantum level, noise plummets and bandwidth explodes. Tunneling electrons,
the fastest of all, emit virtually no heat at all. It was a new quantum
paradox; the smaller the space the more the room, the narrower the switches
the broader the bandwidth, the faster the transport the lower the noise.
As transistors are jammed more closely together, the power delay product--the
crucial index of semiconductor performance combining switching delays with
heat emission--improves as the square of the number of transistors on a
single chip.<BR>
<BR>
Since the breakthrough to CMOS in the early 1980s, however, the industry
has been slipping away from the low and slow regime. Falling for the electromechanical
temptation, they are substituting fast metals for slow polysilicon. For
better performance, companies are increasingly turning to gallium arsenide
and silicon germanium technologies. Semiconductor engineers are increasingly
crowding the surface of CMOS with as many as four layers of fast aluminum
wires, with tungsten now in fashion among the speed freaks of the industry
. The planar chips that built Silicon Valley have given way to high sierras
of metal, interlarded with uneven spreads of silicon dioxide and other insulators.
Meanwhile, the power used on each chip is rising rapidly, since the increasing
number of transistors and layers of metal nullify a belated move to three-volt
operation from the five volts adopted with Transistor Transistor Logic in
1971. And as the industry loses touch with its early inspiration of low
and slow, the costs of wafer fabrication continue to rise--to an extent
that even demoralizes Gordon Moore.<BR>
<BR>
In radically transforming the methods of semiconductor fabrication, John
Moussouris and James (&quot;Al&quot;) Matthews, MicroUnity's director of
technology, seem to many observers to be embarking on a reckless and self-defeating
course. But MicroUnity is betting on the redemptive paradoxes of the microcosm.
Returning to low and slow, Moussouris and Matthews promise to increase peak
clock speeds by a factor of five in the next two years and chip performance
by factors of several hundred, launching communications chips in 1995 that
function at 1.2 gigahertz and perform as many as 400 gigabits per second.<BR>
<H4>Matthews and Mead</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pursuing this renewal of wafer fabrication at MicroUnity, Matthews has
applied for some 70 patents and won about 20 to date. A veteran of Hewlett-Packard's
bipolar process labs who moved to Intel in the early 1980s and spearheaded
Intel's switch to CMOS for the 386 microprocessor, Matthews has also worked
as an engineer at HP-Avantek's gallium arsenide fabs for microwave chips.
Commanding experience in diverse fab cultures, Matthews thus escapes the
cognitive trap of seeing the established regime as a given, rather than
a choice.<BR>
<BR>
At Aventek, Matthews plunged toward the microcosm and prepared the way for
his MicroUnity process after reading an early paper by Carver Mead, the
inventor of the gallium arsenide MESFET transistor. Mead had prophesied
that the behavior of these transistors would deteriorate drastically if
the feature sizes were pushed below two-tenths of a micron at particular
doping levels (technically impossible at the time). In the mid-1980s, though,
Matthews noticed that these feature sizes were then feasible. Testing the
Mead thesis, he was startled to discover that far from deteriorating below
the Mead threshold, these transistors instead showed &quot;startlingly anomalous
levels of good behavior,&quot; marked by high gain and plummeting noise.<BR>
<BR>
Based on this discovery, he created a low-noise, gigahertz-frequency amplifier
for satellite dishes being sold in the European market. Matthew's process
reduced the cost so drastically that Sony officials were said to be contemplating
claims of dumping. Avantek was charging a few dollars for microwave frequency
chips that cost Sony perhaps some hundreds of dollars to make.<BR>
<BR>
Having discovered the &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot; of gallium arsenide
devices pushed beyond the theoretical limits, Matthews at MicroUnity decided
to experiment with bipolar devices. Bipolar devices are usually used at
high power levels with so-called emitter coupled logic to achieve high speeds
in supercomputers and other advanced machines. Inspired by his breakthrough
with gallium arsenide, Matthews believed that biopolar performance also
might be radically different at extremely low power--under half a volt and
at gate lengths approaching the so-called Debye limit, near one-tenth of
a micron.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, Matthews was startled by &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot;
as processes approached the quantum mechanical threshold. It turned out
that at high frequencies biopolar transistors use far less power even the
CMOS transistors, famous for their low-power characteristics. At these radio-frequency
speeds, however, he discovered that the transistors could not operate with
aluminum wires insulated by oxide. Therefore, he introduced a technique
he had used with fast bipolar and gallium arsenide devices: gold wires insulated
by air. Replacing oxide insulators with &quot;air bridges&quot; drastically
reduces the capacitance of the wires and allows the transistor to operate
at speeds impossible with conventional device structures.<BR>
<BR>
With these adventures in the microcosm behind him, Matthews was ready to
develop a new process and technology for MicroUnity. Based on combining
the best features of biopolar and CMOS at radially small geometries, the
new technology uses bipolar logic functioning at gigahertz clock speeds,
with CMOS retained chiefly for memory cells and with gold air bridges for
the metalization layers. Perhaps it is a portent that the gold wires across
the top of the chip repeat the most controversial feature of Jack Kilby's
original integrated circuit. (Matthews is also seeking patents for methods
of using optical communications on the top of a silicon chip).<BR>
<BR>
In essence, Matthews is returning to low and slow. He is shearing off the
sierras of metal and oxides and restoring the planar surfaces of Jean Hoerni.
Because the surface is flat to a tolerance of one-tenth of a micron, photolithography
gear can function at higher resolution despite a narrow depth of field.
Elimination of the aluminum sierras also removes a major source of parasitic
currents and transistors and allows smaller polysilicon devices to be implanted
closer together. A major gain from these innovations is a drastic move to
lower power transistors. Rather than using the usual three volts or five
volts, the MicroUnity devices operate at 0.3 volts to 0.5 volts (300 to
500 millivolts). In the microcosm, smaller devices closer together at lower
power is the secret of speed.<BR>
<BR>
Although MicroUnity will not divulge the details of future products, ASAP
calculates on the basis of information from other sources that the MicroUnity
chip can hold more than 10 million transistors in a space half the size
of a Pentium with three million transistors. With lower power transistors
set closer together, the MicroUnity chip can operate with a clock rate as
much as 10 times faster than most current microprocessors and at an overall
data rate more than 100 times faster. Low and slow results in blazing speed.<BR>
<BR>
For ordinary microprocessor applications, an ultrafast clock is superfluous.
Since ordinary memory technology is falling ever farther behind processor
speeds, fast clocks mean complex arrangements of cache on cache of fast
static RAM and specialized video memory chips. By using the MicroUnity technology
at the relatively slow clock rates of a Pentium, MicroUnity might be able
to produce Pentiums that use from five to 10 times less power--enabling
new generations of portable equipment.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity, however, is not building a CPU but a communications processor.
In the communications world, the fast clock rate gives the &quot;mediaprocessor&quot;
the ability to couple to broadband pipes using high radio frequencies. Most
crucially, the mediaprocessor can connect to the radio frequency transmissions
over cable coax.<BR>
<BR>
Along with Bill Gates, one of the leading enthusiasts of MicroUnity is John
Malone, who for the last year has been celebrating its potential to create
a &quot;Cray on a tray&quot; for his set-top boxes and cable modems. For
the rest of this decade, most Americans will be able to connect to broadband
networks only over cable coax. Thus the link of TCI to MicroUnity and to
Tiger offers the best promise of an information infrastructure over the
next five years, affording a potential increase in bandwidth of 250,000-fold
over the current four-kilohertz telephone wires.<BR>
<BR>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies and the cable companies agree that
cable coax is the optimal broadband conduit to homes and that fiber optics
is the best technology for connecting central switches or headends to neighborhoods.
Looping through communities, with a short drop at each home--rather than
running a separate wire from the central office to every household--hybrid
fiber-coax networks, according to a Pacific Bell study can reduce the cost
of setup and maintenance of connections by some 75% and cut back the need
for wire by a factor of 600.<BR>
<BR>
In order to bring broadband video to homes, companies must collaborate with
the cable TV industry. Collaborating with TCI, Microsoft once again has
chosen the correct technology to leverage. With Digital Equipment, Zenith
and Intel all engaged in alliances for the creation of cable modems--and
several other companies announcing cable modem projects--Gates may well
be leading the pack in transforming his company from a computer company
into a communications concern, from the microcosm into the telecosm.<BR>

All the bandwidth in the world, however, will get you nowhere if your transceiver
cannot process it. By returning to the inspiration of the original Silicon
Valley, MicroUnity offers a promising route to the communications infrastructure
of the next century, overthrowing Moore's Law and issuing the first fundamental
challenge to Moore's company. As Al Matthews puts it: &quot;Bob Noyce [the
late Intel founder with Gordon Moore] is my hero. But there is a new generation
at hand in Silicon Valley today, and this generation is doing things that
Bob Noyce never dreamed of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Moussouris promises to deliver 10,000 mediaprocessors for set-top boxes
in 1995. As everyone agrees, this is a high-risk project (although Bill
Gates favorably compares MicroUnity's risk to his other gamble, Teledesic).
Even if it takes years for MicroUnity to reach its telecosmic millennium,
the advance of communications processors continues to accelerate. Already
available today, for example, is Texas Instruments' MVP system--the first
full-fledged mediaprocessor on one chip. It will function at a mere 30 to
50 megahertz but performs between two and three billion signal processing
steps per second or roughly between 1,000 and 1,500 DSP mips. Rather than
revving up the clock to gigahertz frenzies, TI gained its performance through
a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data approach associated with the massively
parallel supercomputer industry. The MVP combines four 64-bit digital signal
processors with a 32-bit RISC CPU, a floating point unit, two video controllers,
64 kilobytes of static RAM cache and a 64-bit direct memory access controller--all
on one sliver of silicon, costing some $ 232 per thousand mips in 1995,
when Pentiums will give you a hundred mips for perhaps twice as much.<BR>
<BR>
This does not favor the notion that microprocessors will soon &quot;suck
in&quot; DSPs. DSP mips and computer mips are different animals. As DSP
guru Will Strauss points out, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a microprocessor
mips rating must be divided by about five to get a DSP mips rating.&quot;
To equal an MVP for DSP operations, a microprocessor would have to achieve
some 5,000 mips.<BR>
<BR>
Designed with the aid of teleconferencing company VTEL and Sony, the MVP
chip can simultaneously encode or decode video using any favored compression
scheme, process audio, faxes or input from a scanner and perform speech
recognition or other pattern-matching algorithms. While Intel and Hewlett-Packard
have been winning most of the headlines for their new RISC processing alliance,
the key development in the microprocessor domain is the emergence of this
new class of one-chip multimedia communications systems.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. Over the next decade, computer speeds will rise about
a hundredfold, while bandwidth increases a thousandfold or more. Under these
circumstances, the winners will be the companies that learn to use bandwidth
as a substitute for computer processing and switching. The winners will
be the companies that most truly embrace the Sun slogan: &quot;The network
is the computer.&quot; As Schmidt predicts, over the next few years &quot;the
value-added of the network will so exceed the value-added of the CPU that
your future computer will be rated not in mips but in gigabits per second.
Bragging rights will go not to the person with the fastest CPU but to the
person with the fastest network--and associated database lookup, browsing
and information retrieval engines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm will eclipse the law of the microcosm as the driving
force of progress. Springing from the exponential improvement in the power
delay product as transistors are made smaller, the law of the microcosm
holds that if you take any number (N) transistors and put them on a single
sliver of silicon you will get N squared performance and value. Conceived
by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, the law of the telecosm holds
that if you take any number (n) computers and link them in networks, you
get n squared performance and value. Thus the telecosm builds on and compounds
the microcosmic law. The power of Tiger, MicroUnity and TCI comes from fusing
the two laws into a gathering tide of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
With network technology advancing 10 times as fast as central processors,
the network and its nodes will become increasingly central while CPUs become
increasingly peripheral. Faced with a CPU bottleneck, multimedia systems
will simply bypass the CPU on broadband pipes. Circumventing Amdahl's Law,
system designers will adapt their architectures to exploit the high bandwidth
components, such as mediaprocessors, ATM switches and fiber links. In time
the microprocessor will become a vestigial link to the legacy systems such
as word processing and spreadsheets that once defined the machine. All of
this means that while the last two decades have been the epoch of the computer
industry, the next two decades will belong to the suppliers of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The chief beneficiaries of all this invention, however, will be the people
of the world, ascending to new pinnacles of prosperity in an Information
Age. Although many observers fear that these new tools will chiefly aid
the existing rich--or the educated and smart--these technologies have already
brought prosperity to a billion Asians, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia
and China, previously mired in penury.<BR>
<BR>
Communications bandwidth is not only the secret of electronic progress.
It is also the heart of economic growth, stretching the webs of interconnection
that extend the reach of markets and the realms of opportunity. Lavishing
the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly productive
tools and unleashing creativity with increasingly fertile and targeted capital,
the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope to the masses of people
whom the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>

&quot;They'll Be Crowding The Skies.&quot;
</B></PRE>
THUS STEVEN DORFMAN, president of telecommunications and space operations
for GM Hughes_the colossus of the satellite industry_warned the world of
a new peril in the skies. Planning to launch 840 satellites in low earth
orbits, at an altitude of some 435 miles, were a gang of cellular phone
jocks and computer hackers from Seattle going under the name of Teledesic.
Led by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, they were barging onto his turf and threatening
to ruin the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
You get the image of the heavens darkening and a new Ice Age looming as
more and more of this low-orbit junk_including a total of some 1,200 satellites
from Motorola's Iridium, Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar and Teledesic, among
other LEO projects_accumulates in the skies. Ultimately, from this point
of view, you might imagine the clutter of LEOs eclipsing the geostationary
orbit itself, the so-called Clarke belt, some 21,000 miles farther out.
Named after science-fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke, the geostationary orbit
is the girdle and firmament of the Hughes empire.<BR>
<BR>
In an article in Wireless magazine in 1945, Clarke first predicted that
satellites in orbit 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers) above the equator,
where the period of revolution is 24 hours, could maintain a constant elevation
and angle from any point on Earth. In such a fixed orbit, a device could
remain for decades, receiving signals from a transmitter on the earth and
radiating them back across continents.<BR>
<BR>
The Clarke orbit also posed a problem, however_the reverse square law for
signal power. Signals in space attenuate in proportion to the square of
the distance they travel. This means that communications with satellites
22,000 miles away typically require large antenna dishes (as much as 10
meters wide) or megawatts of focused beam power.<BR>
<BR>
Now, however, a new satellite industry is emerging, based on gains in computer
and microchip technology. These advances allow the use of compact handsets
with small smart antennas that can track low earth orbit satellites sweeping
across the skies at a speed of 25,000 kilometers an hour at a variety of
altitudes between 500 and 1,400 kilometers above the earth. Roughly 60 times
nearer than geostationary satellites, LEOs find the inverse square law working
in their favor, allowing them to offer far more capacity, cheaper and smaller
antennas, or some combination of both. Breaking out of the Clarke orbit,
these systems vastly expand the total available room for space-based communications
gear.<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed possible to &quot;crowd&quot; the Clarke belt_a relatively
narrow swath at a single altitude directly above the equator. But even this
swath does not become physically congested; collisions are no problem. The
Clarke belt becomes crowded because the ability of antennas on the ground
to discriminate among satellites is limited by the size of the antenna.
Spaceway and Teledesic both plan to use the Ka band of frequencies, between
17 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second. In this
band, reasonably sized antennas 66 centimeters wide can distinguish between
geostationary satellites two degrees apart. That's some 800 miles in the
Clarke belt. Thus no physical crowding. But it means that there are only
a total of 180 Clarke slots for Ka band devices, including undesirable space
over oceans.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs, however, can be launched anywhere between the earth's atmosphere and
a layer of intense radiation called the Van Allen Belt. The very concept
of crowding becomes absurd in this 900 kilometer span of elevations for
moving orbits that can be 500 meters apart or less. Thus the 21 proposed
orbital planes of Teledesic occupy a total of 10 kilometers of altitude.
At this rate, 70 or more Teledesic systems, comprising some 65,000 satellites,
could comfortably fit in low earth orbits.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, it was clear that the LEOs, one way or another, were crowding
Hughes. Hughes commands satellite systems or projects that compete with
every one of the LEOs. Hughes responded to the threat of Teledesic by announcing
the expansion of its Spaceway satellite system, then planned for North America
alone, to cover the entire globe. Then, invoking the absolute priority currently
granted geostationary systems, Hughes asked the Federal Communications Commission
to block Teledesic entirely by assigning Spaceway the full five gigahertz
of spectrum internationally available in the Ka band.<BR>
<BR>
On May 27, Dorfman summoned the upstarts, Craig McCaw and Teledesic President
Russell Daggatt, to Hughes headquarters in Los Angeles for a talk. Busy
with Microsoft_the Redmond, Wash., company that in 1993 temporarily surpassed
the market value of General Motors_Teledesic partner Bill Gates did not
make the trip. But as the epitome of the personal computer industry, his
presence haunted the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Together with Spaceway chief Kevin McGrath, Dorfman set out to convince
the Seattle venturers to give up their foolhardy scheme and instead join
with Hughes in the nine satellites of Spaceway. Not only could Spaceway's
nine satellites cover the entire globe with the same services that Teledesic's
840 satellites would provide, Spaceway could be expanded incrementally as
demand emerged. Just loft another Hughes satellite. Indeed, Spaceway's ultimate
system envisaged 17 satellites. With &quot;every component proprietary to
Hughes,&quot; as Dorfman said, the satellites only cost some $ 150 million
apiece. By contrast, most of the $ 9 billion Teledesic system would have
to be launched before global services could begin.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the new LEOs marked as decisive a break in the history of space-based
communications as the PC represented in the history of computing. Moreover,
Teledesic would be the only LEO fully focused on serving computers_the first
truly &quot;global Internet,&quot; as McCaw's vice president Tom Alberg
depicted it. It brings space communications at last into the age of ubiquitous
microchip intelligence, and it brings the law of the microcosm into space
communications.<BR>
<BR>
If you enjoyed the New World of Wireless on the ground with its fierce battles
between communications standards, technical geniuses, giant companies, impetuous
entrepreneurs and industrial politicians on three continents_you will relish
the reprise hundreds and even thousands of miles up. Launching Teledesic,
McCaw and Gates were extending bandwidth abundance from earth into space.
Observers, however, often did not like what they heard.

Bad Press For Two Billionaires
</B></PRE>
Every so often, the media is taken by the notion of technology as a morality
tale. In place of a gripping saga of unjustly obscure geniuses enriching
the world by their heroic creativity in the teeth of uncomprehending bureaucrats
and politicians, the media treat technology ventures as a school for scandal.
We have mock exposes of computer hype, monopoly, vaporware, viruses, infoscams,
netporn, securities &quot;fraud&quot; and deviously undocumented software
calls. Pundits gabble endlessly about the gap yawning between the information
rich and the information poor, thus consigning themselves undeniably, amid
many yawns, to the latter category. While American market share climbs near
70% in computers, networks, software and leading-edge semiconductors, analysts
furrow the brows of the Atlantic Monthly with tales of farseeing foreign
teams, spearheaded by visionary government officials, capturing the markets
of American cowboy capitalists. They spiel implausible yams of tough-minded
trade warriors prying open the jaws of Japan for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us,
closing down vicious Korean vendors of low-priced dynamic RAMs, or blasting
through barriers to U.S. telecom gear in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, saving
the day for Motorola's soon-to-be cobwebbed factories for analog cellular
phones.<BR>
<BR>
One of these sagas began early this year with two Seattle billionaires,
McCaw and Gates, allegedly boarding McCaw's sleek yacht and going on an
ego trip. With McCaw pitching in an early nickel, and the boat, and Gates
hoisting his name as a sail, the two tycoons seemed to sweep away from the
shores of rationality, as the media told it, into a sea of microwaves and
arsenic. Spinning out Teledesic to build an information superhighway in
the sky, they proposed to strew the heavens with 840 satellites, plus 84
spares. All would whirl around the world at a height of 700 kilometers (435
miles), using what they told the FCC would be some 500 million gallium arsenide
microchips to issue frequencies between 20 and 60 gigahertz from some 180,000
phased-array antennas. The entire project seemed suffused with gigahertz
and gigabucks. &quot;We're bandwidth bulls,&quot; says Teledesic President
Daggatt.<BR>
<BR>
In case the hype of the sponsors failed to keep the system radiant and aloft,
fueling it also would be a total of 12,000 batteries fed by thin film solar
collectors stretching out behind the satellite &quot;birds&quot; in some
130 square kilometers of gossamer wings. Working at 4% efficiency, these
cells would collectively generate 10 megawatts of power, enough to light
a small city, but, so the critics said, insufficient to reach Seattle at
microwave frequencies in the rain. (The Teledesic frequencies are readily
absorbed by water in the air). To manage the elaborate mesh of fast-packet
communications among the satellites and ground terminals, the constellation
would bear some 282,000 Mips, or millions of instructions per second, of
radiation-hard microprocessors and a trillion bytes or so of rad-hard RAM.
In effect, Teledesic would be launching into space one of the world's largest
and most expensive massively parallel computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
At a mere $ 9 billion, to be put up by interested investors, Teledesic's
lawyers told the FCC, the price would be a bargain for the U.S. and the
world. (By contrast, current plans call for $ 15 billion just to lay fiber
for interactive TV in California). But former Motorola, now Kodak, chief
George Fisher fresh from pondering numbers for the apparently similar Iridium
projects_suggested that $ 40 billion for Teledesic would be more like it.
(Teledesic had the improbable result of making Iridium's 66-satellite plan,
greeted in 1990 with much of the scorn now lavished on Teledesic, seem modest).
Just rocketing the 840 satellites into orbit was said to entail a successful
launch every week for a year and a half at a time when hoisting satellites
is still a precarious and sometime thing.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Teledesic succeeded in getting the things up, so other scientists
suggested, the satellites would then be impaled on some 7,000 pieces of
space debris in the chosen orbits. In any case, so it was widely reported,
10% would fail every year, some tumbling out of orbit, others joining the
whirl of litter, where they would fly ready to impale the remainder of the
satellites and the remnants of the two billionaires' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Surely these sages know that by the year 2001, when the systems would be
up and running, the world will be swimming in the bandwidth of &quot;information
superhighways.&quot; Why support this lavish launch of technology for a
communications system that would be dwarfed by capabilities already demonstrated
on the ground?<BR>
<BR>
Summing up a near-consensus of critics, John Pike, director of the Federation
of American Scientists' Space Policy Project, declared to the Wall Street
Journal, &quot;God save us. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of!&quot;
Provoking Pike may have been the origins of the multisatellite architecture
in the Star Wars &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; program. Teledesic's most
amazing achievement to date has been to displace the Strategic Defense Initiative
as Pike's peak example of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
While McCaw and Gates could be dismissed as tyros in the satellite field,
Hughes is world champion. Since 1963, the company has put 107 communications
satellites into orbit. With 19 in 1994, this year should be its biggest
ever. In 1993, well before the Teledesic announcement, Dorfman announced
the first version of Spaceway_a $ 660 million, two-satellite system offering
voice, data and video services_as a contribution to &quot;information superhighways.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of all the terrestrial uproar surrounding superhighwaymen Al
Gore, John Malone of TCI, Raymond Smith of Bell Atlantic and scores of other
telco and cable magnates, however, no one paid much attention to Hughes.<BR>
<BR>
Then came Gates and McCaw with Teledesic and claims of 20 million potential
subscribers, two million simultaneous connections, billion-bit-per-second
&quot;gigalinks,&quot; bandwidth on demand and an array of other features,
all advertised at a cost for Spaceway-type services nearly three times lower
per bit per second. Everyone noticed Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of July, though, Hughes raised the stakes. With successful launches
under way in China, Brazil and French Guiana to provide exclamation points,
Hughes made a new submission to the FCC, extending Spaceway into a nine-satellite
global system costing $ 3.2 billion. McGrath plausibly claimed it could
be in place long before Teledesic and offer nearly all its functionality
at a third of the price.<BR>
<BR>
Already planned to be in place by 1998, however, were several other LEO
projects, led by Motorola's Iridium and Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar. As
mobile phone projects, these systems could not readily offer service at
T-1 data rates. But their sponsors promised availability for simple E-mail,
faxes and paging.<BR>
<BR>
By mid-1994, Motorola seemed to command the financial momentum. The company
succeeded in raising some $ 800 million in equity investments from companies
around the globe, including Lockheed and Raytheon (which would build the
satellites), Great Wall of China and Khrunichev Enterprises of Russia (which
together would launch a third of them), the Mawarid Group of Saudi Arabia
(which pitched in $ 120 million) and Kyocera, Mitsui and DDI, which together
put up another $ 120 million (Kyocera will build the dual mode handsets
for Japan and DDI will sell and service them). On August 10, an Indian consortium
purchased a 5% stake and a seat on the board for $ 38 million. Motorola
claimed its share of the equity was dropping to 28.5%, well on the way to
the company's final target of 15%. Motorola estimates that much of the additional
$ 2 billion in the plan could come from debt securities and loans.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's attractions are impressive. It provides ubiquitous global phone
service at a premium price with little or no dependence on local terrestrial
facilities. In times of disaster or political crisis, or in places with
sparse or unreliable local service, the system can route calls among the
66 satellites in space bypassing all infrastructure on the ground. For an
elite of government officials and corporate figures operating in remote
areas, the availability of Iridium should be worth the money. A bold and
visionary concept when it emerged in 1987 from a team in the company's satellite
systems engineering group, it endows many regions of the earth with voice
and limited data communications for the first time. For example, it actually
focuses on polar domains, such as parts of Siberia, poorly served by other
satellite systems. Kazuo Inamori, the venerable chairman of Kyocera, also
believes that Iridium will be popular in the 60% of territorial Japan not
currently covered by cellular.

&quot;Give Us Spectrum, Let Others Fight&quot;

</B></PRE>
None-the-less, beyond the bold and ingenious concept (Daggatt calls Iridium
&quot;the real pioneer of LEOs&quot;), the system suffers from technical
flaws. Were it not for Globalstar, perhaps these flaws would not have become
evident until alter the 66 birds were aloft. A far simpler and cheaper solution,
Globalstar uses 48 satellites with no links between them. Each functions
as a &quot;bent pipe&quot; transponder, receiving signals from a phone on
the ground and passing them back to any gateway within the satellite's 1,500-mile-wide
footprint, linked to locally available telephone networks. Because Globalstar
uses local phone systems rather than bypassing them, the system has been
able to raise a total of some $ 300 million in support from Alcatel, France
Telecom, Vodafone (serving the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong),
Airtouch-U S West, Hyundai and DACOM in Korea, Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia.<BR>
<BR>
This amount may seem small beside the billion raised by Iridium. But Globalstar
has capital costs (at $ 1.8 billion) one-half Iridium's, circuit costs one-third
Iridium's, and terminal costs (at $ 750 each) one-fourth Iridium's. With
no intelligence in space, Globalstar relies entirely on the advance of intelligent
phones and portable computer devices on the ground; it is the Ethernet of
satellite architectures. Costing one-half as much as Iridium, it will handle
nearly 20 times more calls.<BR>
<BR>
The advantages of Globalstar stem only partly from its avoidance of complex
intersatellite connections and use of infrastructure already in place on
the ground. More important is its avoidance of exclusive spectrum assignments.
Originating several years before spread-spectrum technology was thoroughly
tested for cellular phones, Iridium employs time division multiple access,
an obsolescent system that requires exclusive command of spectrum but offers
far less capacity than code division multiple access.<BR>
<BR>
Like conventional cellular or radio transmissions that differentiate signals
by time slot or frequency, TDMA sharply restricts the reuse of spectrum
in nearby cells. By contrast, CDMA is a form of spread-spectrum communications
that differentiates signals by a spreading code and allows the use of the
same frequencies all the time, everywhere. Just as you can reduplicate wireline
spectrum merely by laying another fiber, you can now manufacture new spectrum
in the air merely by breaking large cells into smaller ones.<BR>
<BR>
Among some six companies seeking low earth orbit satellite approval from
the FCC in 1993, only Iridium used TDMA, requiring national and international
bodies to pick it as a winner from the outset and assign it exclusive spectrum.
By contrast, in a majority report issued to the FCC on April 6, 1993, CDMA
companies in the U.S., including TRW, Loral-Qualcomm, Celsat and American
Mobile Satellite, could all agree to share spectrum and let the market choose
winners. A Motorola lawyer explained to Space News, &quot;Give us the spectrum
and let the others fight for whatever's left.&quot; In the face of alternatives
with no need for exclusive spectrum allocations, Iridium could fly only
if it offered radically superior performance or capacity. But TDMA dooms
it to generally inferior performance and capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TDMA systems, which can &quot;see&quot; only one satellite signal
at a time, CDMA handsets have &quot;path&quot; diversity, using &quot;rake
receivers&quot; that can combine a number of weak signals into an intelligible
stream. Iridium and other TDMA systems compensate by using more power. But
no practical amount of power can propel a satellite signal through a tin
roof. And excess power means larger handsets or heavier satellites. Iridium
satellites together use 80% more power than Globalstar's, yet employ antennas
nearly twice as large and offer 18.2 times less capacity per unit area.
<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic also suffers from the use of TDMA. But Teledesic's T-1 capabilities
would compensate with 100,000 times more bandwidth and with a bit error
rate that can accommodate the new fiber standards such as SONET-ATM (synchronous
optical network/asynchronous transfer mode), which send packets without
retransmission. The issue is whether these features can justify the political,
financial, and performance costs of using a modulation scheme_TDMA_that
severely limits spectrum sharing and path diversity.<BR>
<BR>
So what is this, another saga of hubris on the information super-highway_to
go with the Raymond Smith-John Malone follies? Perhaps good new ideas are
harder to come by as company revenues grow into the billions, and Gates
and McCaw disinvest and diversify as fast as they can from their increasingly
cumbrous vessels of wealth. Having recently passed the billion-dollar mark
in his systematic process of disinvestment from Microsoft_he retains $ 8
billion or so_Gates at times seemed embarrassed by his link to this gigantic
project. He told us it was too early to write about Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
No, the story is in fact more interesting. Impelled by the onrushing rise
in the cost-effectiveness of individual chips compared to multichip systems,
the Law of the Microcosm dictates decentralization of all information architectures.
During the 1980s, this centrifuge struck the mainframe computer establishment
of IBM. During the 1990s, the personal teleputer, summoning and shaping
films and files of images from around the world, will collide with the centralized
establishments of TV broadcasting. At the end of the century, Teledesic
and the other LEOs will usher in the age of decentralization in space.<BR>
<BR>
From this point of view, Gates' participation becomes more readily intelligible.
Gates seems always to follow the microcosm wherever it leads. A vision of
software for decentralized systems of personal computers informs everything
Microsoft does. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, for example, Microsoft made an investment in Metricom, a wireless
terrestrial system that supplies links of up to 56 kilobits per second to
portable computers or personal digital assistants. Within cells, the devices
can communicate directly with one another; outside the cell, Metricom routes
its calls through an expandable mesh of nodes each the size of a shoebox
and costing less than $ 1,000. Based on spread-spectrum technology, the
system operates at power levels low enough to avoid the need for FCC licenses.
Yet it can be expanded to metropolitan-area dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
In many respects, Teledesic is Metricom in the sky. It is focused on computer
communications. It routes packets by the most convenient path through a
mesh of nodes. It is based on microprocessor technology. (Both Teledesic
and Metricom plan to employ devices from Motorola's 68000 family). As Gates
explains the system: &quot;Some functions are most efficiently performed
by large numbers of small processors working together, rather than a few
large ones.&quot; The entire new generation of low earth orbit satellite
systems relies on this centrifugal force of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
It was not supposed to happen this way. Just as Grosch's Law of the computer
industry implied that computer power rose by the square of the cost, there
was a similar law of the satellite industry that held satellite efficiency
to be proportional to see. In a popular text, &quot;Communications Satellite
Systems,&quot; published in 1978, James Martin cited an AT&T study showing
that just six satellites could carry all the long-distance traffic from
the American continent; no fiber optics would be necessary. &quot;The next
major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of
scale which today's technology offers,&quot; wrote Martin, urging creation
of &quot;massive hardware&quot; as heavy as several tons and &quot;immensely
powerful satellites with large antennas beaming as much information as we
are capable of using to our rooftops.&quot; Many satellite advocates, led
by Arthur C. Clarke, viewed with impatient scorn the expensive terrestrial
systems that somehow forestalled the manifest destiny of big birds to rule
the world of communications. 
<PRE>
<B>

Bringing The Microcosm To Space
</B></PRE>
In 1994, the big bird dream still flourishes in Spaceway, the international
consortium Inmarsat, and the new launch this summer of direct broadcast
satellite technology by Hughes's DirecTV, Hubbard's USSB, TCI's Primestar,
and Rupert Murdoch's imperial systems in Europe and Asia. Using centralized
satellites in geosynchronous orbits, DBS is the ultimate broadcast medium,
reaching billions of potential customers at the cost of reaching hundreds
of thousands through cable-TV systems. But these geostationary satellite
systems suffer from the same flaws as mainframes: sclerosis by centralization.
At a time when customers want the choice, control, convenience and interactivity
of computers, the big birds offer one-size-fits-all programming at specified
times, with little ability to control the flow or interact with it.<BR>
<BR>
The real showstopper in the long run, though, is a nagging half-second time
delay for Clarke orbit signals. Bad enough for voice, a half-second is near
eternity for computer communications; for the living-room and desktop supercomputers
of 2001, a half-second delay would mean gigabytes of information to be stored
in buffers. While companies across the country, from Intel to Digital Equipment,
are rushing to market with cable modems to allow computer connections to
CATV coax, geosatellites remain mostly computer-hostile. Even with the new
digital cosmetics of DBS, geosynchronous satellites are a last vestige of
centralization in a centrifugal world.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Teledesic brings the microcosm to space. Rather than gaming
economies of scale from using a few huge satellites, Teledesic gains economies
of scale by launching as many small birds as possible. Based on Peter Huber's
concept of a geodesic network_a mesh of peers equally spaced apart like
the nodes in a geodesic dome_Teledesic is not a hierarchy but a heterarchy.
Distributing the system responsibilities among 840 autonomous satellites
diminishes the requirements, such as message throughput and power usage,
for each one. Building redundancy into the entire constellation, rather
than within each satellite, yields higher overall reliability, while reducing
the complexity and price of each unit.<BR>
<BR>
As Craig McCaw explains, &quot;At a certain point, redundant systems create
more complexity and weight than they are worth. Rather than having each
satellite a 747 in the sky with triply redundant systems, we have hundreds
of satellites that offer self-redundancy.&quot; Eschewing the Hughes philosophy
of &quot;every component proprietary to Hughes,&quot; Teledesic will manufacture
and launch a large number of satellite peers, using off-the-shelf parts
whenever possible. This approach also provides economies of scale that,
according to a study by brilliant pebbles contractor Martin Marietta, could
lower unit costs by a factor of one hundred or more.<BR>
<BR>
Just as microcosmic technology uses infinitesimal low-powered transistors
and puts them so close together that they work faster than large high-powered
transistors, Teledesic satellites follow the rules of low and slow. Rather
than one big powerful bird spraying signals across continents, Teledesic
offers 840, programmably targetable at small localities. Just 435 miles
out, the delay is measured in milliseconds rather than half-seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The total computing power and wattage of the constellation seems large,
as is needed to sustain a volume of some two million connections at a time,
four times Spaceway's capacity. But with other link features equal, between
1,226 and 3,545 times more power is needed to communicate with a geostationary
satellite than with a LEO.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, unlike Iridium, TRW's Odyssey, and Globalstar, Teledesic
from the outset has targeted the fastest- growing market of the future:
communications for the world's 125 million PCs, now growing some 20% a year.
And Teledesic has correctly chosen the technology needed to extend computer
networks globally_broadband low earth orbit satellites. The real issue is
not the future of Teledesic but the future of Iridium.<BR>
<BR>
In the short run Iridium's voice services cannot compete with Globalstar's
cheaper and more robust CDMA system. But in the long run Iridium could be
trumped by Teledesic. Although Teledesic has no such plans, the incremental
cost of incorporating an &quot;L&quot; band transceiver in Teledesic, to
perform the Iridium functions for voice, would be just 10% of Teledesic's
total outlays, or less than $ 1 billion (compared with the $3.4 billion
initial capital costs of Iridium). But 840 linked satellites could offer
far more cost-effective service than Iridium's 66.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's dilemma is that the complexities and costs of its ingenious mesh
of intersatellite links and switches can be justified only by offering broadband
computer services. Yet Iridium is a doggedly narrowband system focused on
voice.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium eventually will have to adopt Teledesic's broadband logic and architecture.
To protect its global lead in wireless communications and equipment, Motorola
should join with Teledesic now, rather than later. Working with Lockheed,
Motorola is making impressive gains in satellite-manufacturing technology.
Supplying both handsets and space gear for computer networks, Motorola could
turn its huge investment of time, money and prestige in Iridium into a dramatic
global coup in wireless computer services. As part of a broadband system,
Iridium could still become a superb brand name for Motorola. But persisting
in a narrowband strategy in the name of avoiding Teledesic's larger initial
costs, Motorola's executives will end up inflicting serious strategic costs
on the company.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the famous objections to Teledesic are based on ignorance or misinformation.
Launch anxieties spring chiefly from the GEO experience. LEOs are 60 times
nearer and between a tenth and a third the weight. Teledesic satellites
are designed to be hoisted in groups of eight or more. From Great Wall in
China to Khrunichev in Russia, companies around the world will soon be competing
to supply low-cost launching facilities for the system. Orbital Sciences,
an entrepreneurial dervish near Washington's Dulles Airport with some $
190 million in revenues, has developed a low-cost method for lofting groups
of LEOs from an adapted Lockheed 1011 Tristar.<BR>
<BR>
Other fears are similarly fallacious. Teledesic will work fine in the rain
because the high minimum vertical angle (40 degrees) of its satellite links
from the ground reduces the portion of the path exposed to water to a manageable
level. By contrast, geostationary satellites must operate at eight degrees,
passing the signal through a long span of atmosphere. Made of tough new
composite materials, Teledesic satellites will endure the kind of debris
found in space mostly unscathed. The solar arrays can accept holes without
significantly damaging overall performance. All in all, Teledesic's designers
expect the birds to remain in orbit for an average of ten years. With most
of its key technologies plummeting in price along with the rest of electronic
components, the system may well cost even less and perform better than its
business plan promises or George Fisher speculates.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, widely charged with reckless technological presumption, the designers
of Teledesic in fact seem recklessly cautious in their assumptions about
the rate of microchip progress. For example, their dismissal of CDMA assumes
that the high speed of the spreading code functions_requiring digital signal
processors that race at least 100 times the data rate_pushes cheap T-1 performance
far into the future. Yet in early 1995, Texas Instruments will ship its
multimedia video processor, a marvel that combines four 64-bit DSPs, a 32-bit
RISC CPU, 50 kilobytes of on-chip memory, a floating-point unit and a 64bit
direct memory access controller all on one chip. This device now performs
two billion operations per second and, with an upgrade from 35 megahertz
to 50 megahertz clock rate, soon will perform three billion. The estimated
cost in 1995 is around $ 400, or a stunning $ 133 per bop (current Pentiums
charge three times as much for 100 mips). Five years from now, when Teledesic
gets serious, that kind of one-chip computing power can implement CDMA for
broadband data without any cost penalty. Future generations of CDMA systems
may be able to offer, at a dramatically lower price, the same broadband
services in mobile applications that Teledesic now promises for fixed services
only.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that Teledesic meets the CDMA challenge, the other fear is that
terrestrial systems will capture enough of the market to render Teledesic
unprofitable. This fear, however, can come true only if governments delay
this supremely beneficial system well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the competition, satellite systems can provide global coverage at
once. Whether for $ 9 billion or $ 90 billion, no terrestrial system will
cover the entire world, or even the entire U.S., within decades of Teledesic.
As soon as it is deployed, it will profoundly change the geography and topography
of the globe. Suddenly the most remote rural redoubt, beach, or mountain
will command computer communications comparable to urban corporations today.
The system can make teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine, and teleschooling
possible anywhere. Gone will be the differences among regions in access
to cultural and information resources. People will be able to live and work
where they want rather than where corporations locate them.<BR>
<BR>
This change transforms the dimensions of the world as decisively as trains,
planes, automobiles, phones and TVs changed them in previous eras. It will
extend &quot;universal service&quot; more dramatically than any new law
can.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Teledesic can eliminate the need to cross-subsidize rural customers.
Determining the cost of wire-line services are the parameters of population
density and distance from the central office. Rural customers now cost between
10 and 30 times as much to serve with wires as urban customers do. Teledesic
will bring near-broadband capabilities to everyone in the world at the same
price.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, this expansion of the communications frontier will foster
the very economic development that will fuel the demand for the service.
Today, it does not pay to bring telecommunications to poor countries that
might benefit most. Teledesic and other satellite services break the bottleneck
of development. Simultaneously opening the entire world, it enriches every
nation with new capital exceeding the fruits of all the foreign aid programs
of the era.<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic is a venture worthy of McCaw and Gates. In its impact on the world,
it may even rival the Herculean contributions of its sponsors in cellular
and software. The issue is not the technology or the commitment of the principals.
The issue is the readiness of the U.S. government to accommodate this venture.
Before Teledesic can be approved internationally, it will have to attain
a license from the FCC in the U.S. It has taken four years to approve Iridium.
It took 30 years to approve cellular. How long will it take to approve Teledesic?<BR>
<BR>
Currently Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar face several political obstacles.
The International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulation 2613 gives
GEOs absolute priority over LEOs. For Spaceway, Hughes is now demanding
an exclusive license for the full five gigahertz available in the Ka-band
worldwide, leaving no room for Teledesic or any other Ka-band LEO. Under
current law, Hughes or other GEO systems could usurp any LEO that was launched.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs are a major American innovation. The U.S. government should take the
lead now in spearheading a change in the regulations to accommodate LEOs.
This is no minor matter. As the dimensions and promise of Teledesic loom
more starkly, the Japanese or Europeans are certain to make similar proposals.
&quot;When they do,&quot; Craig McCaw predicts, &quot;they will immediately
have their government on board. They will be able to go to the ITU right
away. My greatest fear is that we will have the technology all ready, and
foreign companies will beat us out because they can get their governments
in line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government was on board for Apollo 25 years ago and the U.S. won
the first space race. This space race is just as important, but the government
is treating it as some sleepy-time infrastructure project. In fact, it is
the information superhighway going global and ubiquitous. It is the ultimate
promise of the information age, says McCaw. 
<PRE>
<B>

Sustaining The U.S. Lead In Technology
</B></PRE>
McCaw explains: &quot;It'll mean ecological disaster if China mimics what
we did_building more and more urban towers and filling them up with people
who queue up every day on turnpikes into the city, emitting fumes into the
air, and then building new towers and new highways when you want to move
the company, and then digging up the highways to install new wires.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McCaw waves toward the window, out at Lake Washington. &quot;Look at that
floating bridge. It took $ 1.5 billion to cross Lake Washington, then it
got busted in a storm. Cross this lake, any lake, any ocean in the world
with broadband wireless. That's the promise of Teledesic. All you do is
to reconfigure the communications in software at zero incremental cost.
No wires for the final connections. It's what we do in Hong Kong and Shanghai,
where everyone uses a cellular phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Vice President Gore and other members of the administration
continually ask what they can do for technology. One thing they can do is
vastly streamline the process for approval of communications projects. At
the moment, Congress is determined to retain bureaucratic dominance over
the most dynamic enterprise and technology in the world economy_what they
like to term the information superhighway. They see it as a possible source
of congressional power, campaign finance, employment and pelf, like the
Baby Bells today or like existing construction projects. Rather than turn
telecom into a vast porkbellied poverty program, however, the administration
should deregulate the field. Communications companies must be permitted
to compete and collaborate wherever the technology leads.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the administration knows it or not, these technologies are its greatest
political asset. The high-tech industries unleashed in the 1980s by venture
capital and junk bonds are now the prime fuel of the economy of the 1990s.
Comprising perhaps 60% of incremental GDP and 48% of exports, the momentous
upsurge of computers and communications is even compensating for the mistakes
of the Bush and Clinton regimes and making plausible Clinton's continuing
claims of economic success. But now Clinton, Gore and FCC Chairman Reed
Hundt must make a choice. If they want to maintain this redemptive U.S.
lead in technology, they must be willing to forge new alliances in Congress
to get the politicians and bureaucrats out of the way of the future. A good
start would be to open the floodgates for the global onrush of low earth
orbit satellites dedicated to computer communications. If they do, they
can help make the world, as McCaw's Alberg puts it, &quot;a truly global
Internet in an ever-expanding ethersphere.&quot; 
<PRE>
<B>
And The Winner Is...
</B></PRE>
Globalstar is the easy winner for current offering of mobile phone services
under a CDMA regime of spectrum sharing. But Teledesic can add phone services
to its broadband computer system. Over time, Teledesic's 840 satellites
will outperform Globalstar's 48. Big question: When will microchip technology
advance enough to allow broadband applications over CDMA? When that happens,
Globalstar has a shot at the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium is both too expensive to compete in mobile phones and too narrowband
for data. Today's champ Spaceway is maturing. Big winner for the next decade
is... Teledesic.

<HR><BR>
Big Government and Mass Media always feed on fear of monsters. While politicians
promise to protect the people from the dreaded private sector, leading newspapers
such as the Washington Post and network shows such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
chime in with continuing reports on the economy as seen from the shores
of Loch Ness. Peering through the shifting, inscrutable murk of the marketplace,
pundits both private and public can descry beneath every ripple of industrial
change the spectral shape of some circling shark or serpent from which only
a new bureaucracy or liberal constabulary can save us.<BR>
<BR>
There are always many witnesses to the threat. In his campaigns of creative
destruction, any great capitalist provokes enough panic in the establishment
to fuel the beadles who would bring him down. Losing competitors, whether
in oil or software, are always in the vanguard of the monster hunt, which
is therefore usually launched in the name of &quot;competition&quot; and
is designed to stop it in its tracks before anyone wins.<BR>
<BR>
In the industrial era it was the so-called Robber Barons--creators of the
great industries of oil, steel and finance--who greased the growth of government
with their chimerical menace. Radically reducing the prices of their products,
such leaders as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan expanded the economy to
serve middle- and lower-income customers and laid the foundation for the
American industrial leadership that triumphed in two world wars. But at
the same time, charged with predatory pricing, collusive marketing dumping
and other competitive violations, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan emerged
as the monsters of monopoly who fueled the growth of government through
the first 40 years of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Now, with information technology driving private sector wealth and power,
there is a need for new monsters to fuel new sieges of government and regulatory
growth. This time the monsters bear the names of Milken, Gates and Malone--new
trolls to terrify little children and cause competitors to cozen Washington
and judges to reach for their RICO bludgeons and commissioners to salivate
and shuffle subpoenas and senators to tremble and wreak new tomes of law
and bureaucrats to sow the economy with minefields of abstruse new rules.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three new monsters, big government managed to deliver us first from
Michael Milken, depicted as a Banker Shark. But Milken's vision impregnably
survives in the form of the industries and infrastructures he financed,
chiefly cellular phones, fiber optics and cable television--the forces that
laid the foundation for a new broadband economy.<BR>
<BR>
With Milken laid low by cancer and the courts, Washington needed new monsters
for the 1990s. After serious and continuing contemplation of Bill Gates
as a possible MicroShark hidden amid the mazes of Windows and DOS, Washington
recently has focused on the formidable visage of John Malone.<BR>
<BR>
As the titan of cable and leader of Tele-Communications Inc., better known
as TCI, he was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Milken's bonds. At a time
when governments everywhere covet the huge, new wealth emerging from information
superhighways, Malone has become the favored target of the Loch Ness news
hounds and public-law pinstripes: an Abominable Snowman ranging down from
the Rockies to raid and ruin rival companies, terrorize politicians and
gouge his 21 million customers. Or, in the words of then Senator Albert
Gore, Malone is Darth Vader himself.<BR>
<BR>
This particular monster hunt, however, could not be more ill- timed. There
is no way that this administration can demonize the cable industry and micromanage
telecom without direly damaging all its hopes for an information superhighway
and thus the best prospects for the future of the U.S. economy. Just as
the automobile industry was the real heir to the triumphs of the &quot;robber
barons&quot; in oil, steel and finance, so the computer industry--the core
of U.S. world industrial leadership--will be the chief beneficiary of cable
and telecom ventures in broadband networks.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. now commands global dominance in computer technology. But as Andrew
Grove told Forbes ASAP, &quot;infinite processing power will only get you
so far with limited bandwidth.&quot; The next generation of computer progress
depends upon the efficient use of cable bandwidth to homes and home offices,
which comprise a fist-growing 60 percent of the current market for computers.
Even if computer executives fail to see the threat, the monster hunt against
cable thus jeopardizes the supreme achievement of the American economy over
the last decade--its global lead in computers.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government constantly reiterates its desire for information superhighways.
The problem is that punctuating the call for broadband nets is an insistent
mantra of &quot;competition&quot; that reverberates through the speeches
of nearly all participants in the debate. As Ward White, vice-president
of government affairs for the U.S. Telephone Association, points out, however,
this mantra of competition &quot;disguises a new scheme of market allocation
run by the regulators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In this competition no one can win or make any money. The $ 10 billion in
profits claimed by the Baby Bells still under the Greene thumb are highly
questionable. Most of their copper wires and narrowband switches--rapidly
obsolescing by any objective standard--are being written off over decades.
That means the real costs of the Bells should be much higher than their
announced costs, which do not adequately reflect the fact that their $ 300
billion worth of plant and equipment is rapidly losing market value. As
TCI's sharp and salty young COO, Brendan Clouston, points out, telephone
companies are used to pretending to make money under rate-of-return regulations
when they are really losing it.<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies, by contrast, are used to pretending to lose money when
in fact they are raking it in. A standing joke around the offices of John
Malone's cable empire, which comprises TCI and Liberty Media, asks what
Malone will do if the firm ever reports a large profit. The answer: Fire
the accountant. Indeed, TCI did not report even a cosmetic profit until
the first quarter of 1993. Cable firms were financed with junk bonds and
other debt that allows investors to be paid off with tax- deductible interest
payments rather than double-taxed dividends and capital gains favored by
the telcos.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Milken, the financial father of the cable industry, channeled some
$ 10 billion in high-yield securities to TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom
and other cable firms at a time when they were struggling for survival.
As a result, the cable companies are eight times more leveraged in their
debt-equity ratios than telephone companies are. But driven by the demands
of debt, the cable firms use their capital some two-and-a-half times more
efficiently. Generating $ 20 billion in revenues, one-fourth as much as
the telcos, cable firms use just one-tenth the capital.<BR>
<BR>
The cable companies are leveraged at a rate of between seven- and ten-to-one
on their cash flow. Moreover, some 60 percent of cable company assets are
&quot;good will.&quot; Included in the purchase price of new acquisitions,
&quot;good will&quot; represents the intangible value of cash flows and
synergies expected from new technologies and programming.<BR>
<BR>
Built on vision and debt, such entrepreneurial companies cannot invest without
the possibility of large returns. Attack the cable industry's cash flow
and prospects, and you attack its lifeline. Attack the cable industry's
cash flow and prospects, and you reduce its available investment by a factor
of five or more. Bell Atlantic was originally willing to pay for TCI nearly
12 times its cash flow. 
<PRE><B>

The Real Monster:  Government
</B></PRE>
In this highly leveraged arena government itself is the real monster: an
800-pound gorilla. Where does the 800-pound gorilla sit? Wherever it wants.
Early in April of this year it chose to sit on the cable industry. More
specifically, it plumped down in the middle of Brendan Clouston's desk in
the form of a 700-page FCC document reregulating the cable industry. It
was full of detailed regulations on everything from how fast he must pick
up his phones for customer complaints and what he should charge for each
tier of service and for each component of cable gear, to how large, implicitly,
his return on investment can be (about 11.5 percent). He faced the mandate
to adjust nearly every price and policy in the company within six weeks
and to justify each price by filling out 60 pages of forms. In a menacing
note for the future portending new government plans for redistributionist
pricing, he is required to report the median income in each of his service
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is not really to blame for this onslaught, since it resisted the
new congressional power grab. In any case, this agency is only part of Clouston's
problem. He also faces an aggressive new spirit at the Federal Trade Commission,
at the Department of Justice and in Congress, which permits him to collaborate
with any company as long as it is not a telephone firm with useful fiber
networks and switching systems in TCI's own regions. Full of rhetoric inviting
every industry from the telcos to the power companies into the cable trade,
many of the legislative proposals, FTC policies and FCC ukases converging
on Clouston's desk seem to be intended to transform cable from a galvanizing
entrepreneurial force in the U.S. economy into a sleepy-time public utility
run by lawyers. At stake is the future of the information superhighway and
thus the future of the U.S. economy. 
<PRE>
<B>

Superhighway Hype is Understated
</B></PRE>
Information superhighways are one of those rare technologies that are actually
far more powerful and promising than the hype surrounding them. The first
fruits of this development are already evident, as the U.S. has led the
world in deploying computer networks. Over the next five years broadband
networks can transform the entire economy, projecting it onto a higher plane
of growth and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For the last decade the performance of the economy has perplexed the economics
profession. Throughout the 1980s most economists predicted that U.S. interest
rates would soar as a result of world-lagging rates of personal savings.
When interest rates instead dropped, economists pointed to a &quot;dangerous
dependence&quot; on foreign sources of capital such as Japan, which were
investing close to $ 100 billion annually in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Today, adverse tax and regulatory policies in the U.S. have entirely reversed
capital flows, with funds now leaving the U.S. for foreign markets at an
annual rate of $ 80 billion. Meanwhile, as Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey has warned, personal savings have plunged to all-time lows. By every
rule of economics, interest rates should soar or growth should collapse.<BR>
<BR>
Yet despite a slight upward drift in recent months, U.S. interest rates
remain low by historic standards, and the U.S. continues to lead the major
powers in economic growth and has extended its lead in productivity. As
Michael Jensen of Harvard Business School has shown, a close analysis of
the figures from U.S. corporations now reveals a historic acceleration of
U.S. productivity growth during the 1980s. According to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley, between 1987 and 1992 U.S. corporations captured some 47.7 percent
of global profits and 37.4 percent of global sales. Continued slumps in
Europe and Japan combined with reviving growth in the U.S. indicate that
U.S. market share is still rising.<BR>
<BR>
This record of supremacy is entirely baffling to the economics profession
and its megaphones in the media. Focusing on the Loch Ness news, they have
spent a decade in lamentations over the prospects of the U.S. economy, reaching
a pitch of funereal keening during the 1992 election campaigns. But to analysts
focused on the ever-growing U.S. lead in technology, these results are no
mystery at all.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. supremacy is focused on information tools and spearheaded by computer
networks. U.S. companies command some two-thirds of the world's profits
in information technology, hardware and software, and entirely dominate
world markets in computer networks. Half the world's 110 million personal
computers are in the U.S., and between 1989 and 1993 the share connected
to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate information industry is finance. During the last decade the
U.S. employed information technology to transform its financial system.
Spearheaded by Milken and a $ 200 billion junk bond market, the U.S. drastically
reduced the role of banks and proliferated an array of more flexible and
specialized financial agencies. While over the last 12 years banks' share
of private credit for non-financial companies dropped from two- thirds to
less than 20 percent, the U.S. surged into global leadership in applying
information technology to the field of financial innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm shattered the financial system into
silicon smithereens and vastly enhanced its productivity. As the late Warren
Brookes has written, &quot;If every bank is nothing more than an information
system, then by definition every information system has the capacity to
be a bank, and every owner of an information system, from a desktop computer
to a mainframe terminal, can be a banker.&quot; What happened was that thousands
of brokers, mathematicians, financial consultants, insurance salespeople,
credit card merchants and bonds traders took this opportunity to break into
the field of financial entrepreneurship.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the U.S. set an entirely new world standard for capital efficiency,
generating far more economic growth per dollar of savings than any other
country. As explained two centuries ago by Adam Smith, key to productivity
growth is the refinement of the division of labor, the expansion of specialization,
the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and niches. The key force fostering
specialization in the U.S. is computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade computer networks will expand their bandwidth by factors
of thousands and reconstruct the entire U.S. economy in their image. TV
will expire and transpire into a new cornucopia of choice and empowerment.
Great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to
rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities. The most
deprived ghetto child in the most blighted project will gain educational
opportunities exceeding those of today's suburban preppie. Small towns will
become industrial centers in the new information economy. Hollywood and
Wall Street will totter and diffuse to all points of the nation and the
globe. Families will regroup around the evolving silicon hearths of a new
cottage economy. Video culture will transcend its current mass-media doldrums,
playing to lowest-common-denominator shocks and prurient interests, and
will effloresce into a plethora of products suggestive of the book industry.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or down the street or in their local office or corporation.
Instead, they will seek out and command their first choices in employment,
culture, entertainment and religion. They will reach out across the country
and around the world to find the best colleagues for every major project.
Productivity and efficiency will inexorably rise. A culture of first choices
will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward the mediocre,
convenient or crude.<BR>
<BR>
The entire centralizing force of the Industrial Revolution, which brought
capital and labor together in vast pyramidal institutions and reduced workers
to accessories of the machine and the tube, will give way to the explosive
centrifuge of the microcosm and telecosm. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and Machine Age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
The vision of information superhighways revitalizing the American economy
and culture is far more true and compelling than even its advocates comprehend.
People who underestimate the impact of bandwidth will miss the supreme investment
opportunities of the epoch. 
<PRE><B>

Decline and Rise of the Malone Model
</B></PRE>
Dominant in the industry are two essential models for fulfilling the promise
of the superhighway. One scheme, long associated with John Malone and other
cable executives, is the monster model: combining content and conduit in
order to gain monopoly rents.<BR>
<BR>
Because it reaches more than 20 percent of all cable customers, access to
the TCI conduit can heavily influence the success or failure of any content
venture. As Andrew Kessler, partner and multimedia guru at Unterberg Harris
and Forbes ASAP columnist, puts it, &quot;If you want to create a cable
channel, you may have to send it through Malone's bottleneck--a satellite
dish farm outside Denver. I suspect that could cost you some $ 4 million
in cash, or, alternatively, you can give Malone 30 percent of your company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This monster model is in essence the way Malone built up Liberty Media and
the content side of TCI, which together own parts of TNT, the Discovery
Channel, American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment TV, Court TV, Encore,
Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network, QVC, Video Jukebox and an
array of regional sports networks. It has been widely reported that AT&T
and financier Herbert Allen are creating a new classic sports network and
will give a chunk of it to Liberty in exchange for access to Malone's conduit.<BR>
<BR>
The other model is that of the common-carrier, upheld both by the telephone
companies and by Internet. In this model you build an open conduit and exercise
virtually no influence on content. Using the phone system or Internet, people
can communicate anything they want as long as they observe the protocols
of the public switched telephone network or of Internet's TCP/IP. Extended
to images, this model suggests a &quot;video dial tone.&quot; You can dial
up any other machine connected to the network and download or upload any
films, files, documents, pictures or multimedia programs that you wish.
Although telephone companies or Internet providers may own content. they
cannot privilege their own programming. Their content has to compete for
customers freely with all other content available on the network.<BR>
<BR>
The notoriety of the Malone model and the resentment it arouses far and
wide explain much of the hostility toward the cable industry and John Malone.
This may even explain the current rage to reregulate the industry. The great
irony today is that Malone and the rest of the cable leaders were in the
process of abandoning the Malone model at the very moment that many telephone
executives seemed to adopt it.<BR>
<BR>
It was Malone, after all, who was willing to sell his content to Bell Atlantic,
and it was Raymond Smith, above all, who insisted on acquiring the assets
of Liberty Media. It was Bell South that was willing to pitch in some $
2 billion to QVC's bidding for Paramount when John Malone left Batty Diller
high and dry. Ameritech, too, was reported to be preparing a pitch for Paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Malone was right in his attempt to sell out at the top to Bell Atlantic.
The idea of combining conduit and content was valid in a regime of bandwidth
scarcity. In a regime of broadband information superhighways, however, content
providers will want to put their programming on everyone's conduits, and
conduit owners will want to carry everyone's content. In a world of bandwidth
abundance Paramount will not want to restrict its films to Bell South's
network any more than Bell South will exclude films from other sources.<BR>
<BR>
The key condition for the success of the open model and the eclipse of the
Malone model, however, is real bandwidth abundance. If the federal government
prohibits the interconnection of conduits, then the Malone model gains a
new lease on life. In a world of bandwidth scarcity the owner of the conduit
not only can but must control access to it. Thus, the owner of the conduit
also shapes the content. It does not matter whether the conduit company
is headed by a scheming monopolist or by Mitch Kapor and the members of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Bandwidth scarcity will require the
managers of the network to determine the video programming on it.<BR>
<BR>
In a world of information superhighways, however, the most open networks
will dominate, and the proprietary networks will wither. Malone's understanding
of this fact--that his own model would soon expire in an environment of
bandwidth abundance--motivated his effort to merge with Bell Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm inexorably dictates mergers not between content
and conduit, but between conduit and conduit. In particular, today it mandates
the merger of the huge fiber resources of the telephone companies--which
are nine times as extensive as cable industry fiber and are estimated to
rise to 2.7 million lines by next year--with the huge asset of 57 million
broadband links to homes commanded by the cable industry. Obstructing such
mergers in the name of competition, or antitrust, or regulatory caprice,
is wantonly destructive to the future of the economy.

The Siren Call From Foreign Shores
</B></PRE>
Most of the gains of the telecosm depend on government willingness to allow
the creation of coherent broadband networks with no prohibitions against
the convergence of cable and telco systems. For a while it appeared that
the Clinton administration was willing to accommodate this development.
Now it appears that it prefers to lead the U.S. government into a private-sector
monster hunt. Rather than releasing America's cable and telco firms to build
this redemptive infrastructure, Washington leaders seem chiefly concerned
with assuring themselves that no one will make any money from it. As a result,
with some $ 1 billion in annual funding from Wall Street, cable and telephone
firms are increasingly moving abroad to fulfill the promise of information
superhighways.<BR>
<BR>
TCI and U.S. West, for example, are serving some quarter- million British
citizens with combined telephone and cable functions over a hybrid network
of coax and fiber. The current regulatory climate dooms the proposed merger
of Southwestern Bell and Cox Cable and their plans to launch information
highways in Phoenix and Atlanta. But these companies continue to expand
their hybrid cable and phone networks In Liverpool and Birmingham in England.
In the U.S. NYNEX has been one of the most sluggish Bells in information
superhighway projects. But from Gibraltar to Bangkok, it is supplying an
array of wireless and wireline services. In the U.K. NYNEX Cablecomm holds
17 cable franchises passing 2.5 million homes and plans some $ 2 billion
in future investments. In the wake of the new regulations Bell Canada International
(BCI) reduced its offer for Jones Intercable by five percent, but the two
companies are barging ahead in East London, Leeds and Aylesbury. Time Warner,
Ameritech and other cable and telephone companies are also rushing to less
regulated realms to lay information infrastructure everywhere from Scotland
to New Zealand.<BR>
<BR>
In the U.S. such collaborations of cable and telephone companies would be
paralyzed by litigation and bureaucracy. It appears increasingly possible
that despite the huge lead created by the U.S. cable industry, which, unique
in the world, has extended broadband access to some 95 percent of American
homes, broadband networks will first be built outside the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
American politicians must face reality. With cable, the U.S. is far and
away the world leader in broadband technology. With cable, the U.S. can
have a national network reaching every American community by the year 2000.
Without cable, however, the U.S. can forget the idea of building a national
system of information superhighways in this decade. Without cable, the global
race is even, and several European and Asian countries command a significant
edge as a result of their integrated cable and telephone firms.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. panacea of &quot;competition&quot; without winners may work for
commodity markets, which require low levels of incremental investment and
offer returns commensurate with the rate of interest. Governing technological
progress, though, is the very different regime of dynamic competition and
creative destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling most technology investment is the pursuit of transitory positions
of monopoly that may yield massive profits. That's why in the late 1970s
and early 1980s Milken directed some $ 17 billion to the cable TV, fiberoptic
telephony and cellular telephone industries, giving the U.S. a decisive
lead in all these areas. That's why Intel Corp. has been investing $ 2 billion
a year in new wafer fabrication capacity to secure its global edge in microprocessors.
That's why Microsoft invests $ 1 billion a year or more (depending on definitions)
in new software technology to integrate ever-new functions into its dominant
operating systems. And that's why Bell Atlantic contemplated investing what
amounted to some $ 33 billion in John Malone's company, TCI.<BR>
<BR>
Until replaced by a better system, every innovation gives its owner a temporary
monopoly. Otherwise it is not a true innovation. Today, whether anyone likes
it or not, the cable industry has a temporary monopoly on broadband links
to the home. By interconnecting these links to the fiber networks of the
phone companies, the two industries together can create a national information
superhighway some five or 10 years sooner than can Japan or Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Some 79 percent of the costs of a network come in the final connections
to homes: the distribution and drops that the cable industry has installed
over the last 25 years. Joined with the telephone industry's fiber optics--nine
times more extensive than the cable industry's fiber deployment--this hybrid
cable-telco network would represent an authentic innovation and would trigger
a flood of real competition supplying a huge array of powerful new broadband
communications services. According to authoritative estimates cited by Vice-President
Gore and the FCC, these innovations would increase U.S. productivity growth
by 40 percent over the next decade. This immense undertaking would also
yield huge profits for as long as a decade to some of the companies that
master it.<BR>
<BR>
The government might regard these profits as &quot;obscene.&quot; But they
will be indispensable both to pay for the transformation of American media
and to attract the next generation of competitors into the business. These
rivals are already on the way: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), wireless
cellular &quot;cable&quot; at 28 gigahertz, low-earth-orbiting satellites
such as the Gates-McCaw Teledesic, all-fiber &quot;Internets&quot; and the
array of passive fiber- to-the-home technology summed up as the fibersphere.
Even broadcasters and utilities will enter the field. In a world where the
government micromanages communications in the name of &quot;competition,&quot;
however, all these capital-hungry competitors will languish. 
<PRE><B>

Dynamic Competition or Static Competitors?
</B></PRE>
The dynamics of competition on the information superhighway repeats the
previous dynamics of competition in computers. Preventing the dominance
of successful technologies--sustaining an artificial diversity--is anticompetitive.
If in the early 1980s the Department of Justice had ruled against the Microsoft
and Intel standards, for example, and had required a variety of microprocessor
instruction sets and operating systems, the result would have been less
competition in computers, not more. Perhaps Pick, Quarterdeck, Digital Research
and others would have gained share against Microsoft. But the applications
software business, with its floods of real competition in new programs for
everything from financial management to videogames, would have languished,
along with the parallel markets in hardware peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that Microsoft faces antitrust pressure at the twilight of its
dominance. Impelled by the new markets for multimedia and handheld communicators,
the industry is on the cusp of an entirely new landscape of competition.
In this new arena Microsoft's present market share and installed base are
barriers to entry for Microsoft rather than for its rivals. If Microsoft
is to prevail in these new areas, it must cannibalize its own systems and
compete on an equal basis with everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
The laws of dynamic competition apply just as forcefully to networks as
to computers. Just as the time arrived when text editing and disk utilities
would be integrated into operating systems--or floating point computations
would be integrated into microprocessors--broadband cable services now must
be integrated into the public switched telephone network (PSTN), not segregated
from it. Despite the &quot;competitive&quot; access dreams of politicians
and regulators, true competition requires that the &quot;two-wire model&quot;
of home communications give way to a broadband, one-wire system.<BR>
<BR>
The best and most cost-effective network practicable today is a combination
of telco fiber and cable coax. Even the telephone industry agrees. U.S.
West, Pacific Telesis and Bellcore all have resolved on the same hybrid
system that TCI, Time Warner and Cablelabs have pioneered. Without mergers
with cable firms, the telcos in essence will try to rebuild cable networks.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to duplicate the connections to homes built by the cable industry
over the last 25 years, however, the telephone industry would have to spend
some $ 200 billion. It would have to sustain this level of new investment
while maintaining its existing plant and expanding into long-distance and
other services. It would have to summon large incremental capital in the
face of continued competition from the cable industry's taking of many of
the most profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos currently declare they are willing to make these investments.
They tell Washington regulators and politicians that all will be fine as
long as they are allowed to own programming and information services and
build equipment. But the message from the markets is clear and to the contrary.
At the very time that telco executives were intoning their bold plans, telephone
and cable share prices were plunging toward new lows. Now Raymond Smith
of Bell Atlantic is announcing a half-billion- dollar reduction in infrastructure
outlays. Southwestern Bell is giving up its plans to buy Cox Cable. Under
a similar &quot;competitive&quot; regime in cellular telephony, even AT&T and
McCaw have found their merger in jeopardy.<BR>
<BR>
Under rate-of-return regulations with prohibition of cross- subsidies from
current cash flow, a &quot;competitive&quot; information superhighway simply
cannot fly. An information superhighway cannot be built under a canopy of
federal tariffs, price controls, mandates and allocated markets. 
<PRE><B>

Highway Imperative:  Cable-PC</B></PRE>
Politicians must recognize that what is at stake is not merely games, entertainment
and a few educational frills but the very future of the U.S. economy. Cable
is central not only to the next generation of television technology but
also to the next generation of computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many companies offer bold words in business plans for interconnecting
homes with new networks. Indeed, the telcos can provide some intriguing
computer services through their accelerating rollout of Integrated Services
Digital Networks (ISDN), as was so eloquently urged by Mitch Kapor and others.
Internet will continue to expand rapidly its cornucopia of mostly narrowband
offerings. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw may even enlarge the bandwidth available
to homes to a level of 2.4 megabits per second through their elegant and
ambitious Teledesic. Direct broadcast satellite systems and public utilities
and wireless cable operators will all enrich the flow of video to the nation's
homes.<BR>
<BR>
Except in the short ran, though, these systems are not remotely competitive
with cable. Available ISDN, for example, offers less than one-100th the
bandwidth of one digital cable channel and less than one-1,000th the bandwidth
of a cable coax line. The other rivals to cable, from direct broadcast satellite
to Teledesic, are similarly far too little and too late. Even the advanced
28-gigahertz wireless cable projects, for all their promise as supplementary
systems, cannot ultimately compete with the potential two-way bandwidth
of fiber-coax systems in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
All the current plans of the telephone companies and the government leave
the huge U.S. endowment of home computers--the fastest-growing and most
promising segment of the computer industry--stranded in a narrowband world.
Only the cable industry's gigahertz links, passing into some 95 percent
of American homes, can launch the American personal computer industry into
a new level of two-way broadband digital connectivity.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason the future of the American computer industry largely depends
on the future of the cable industry. By linking America's computers to broadband
networks and then to telco fiber systems, cable can be the great enabler
of the next phase of development in America's digital economy.<BR>
<BR>
In laying broadband systems the cable industry has already been forced to
solve many of the key problems of an information superhighway. Although
often depicted as an intrinsically one- way service, cable technology has,
in fact, long provided two-way capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
Every cable coax line, for example, offers potential bandwidth equivalent
to six times the 160 megahertz of spectrum assigned by the FCC for personal
communications services. Cable can accommodate as much as one gigahertz--a
billion cycles per second--of communications power. This is some 250,000
times the capacity of a four-kilohertz telephone line to the home. Just
one six-megahertz cable channel commands 1,500 times the bandwidth of a
telephone line. In every coax connection the first four channels, between
five and 30 megahertz, are reserved not for broadcast but for reverse communications
to the headend. Widely used to transfer video programming among headends
and satellite dishes and other programming sources, these channels alone
already represent a potential information highway for home computers 2,500
times faster than a 9,600-baud modem to a phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Even these possibilities, however, underestimate the potential of cable.
The coax laid by the cable firms must carry analog video material without
interference or distortion. This means cable equipment must track perfectly
all the analog waveforms representing the shape and brightness of the image,
and must detect tiny differences in the frequencies of FM signals bearing
color and sound information. Because any deviation in an analog wave imparts
a defect to the picture, cable TV has had to develop extremely low loss
technologies. Although most current cable systems function at much lower
signal-to-noise ratios, measured logarithmically, a cable TV plant can potentially
function at nearly 50 decibels, or at a signal-to-noise power ratio of almost
100,000-to-one.<BR>
<BR>
Necessary to transmit high-quality analog video, between 10,000- and 100,000-to-1
signal-to-noise ratios are vast overkill for the relatively crude on-off
codes of digital communications, which can function at 17 decibels or less.
Therefore, the one- gigahertz coax lines can carry many more than one bit
per hertz. Craig Tanner, vice-president of advanced TV projects at Cablelabs,
the industry's research arm in Louisville, Colo., estimates that by wiggling
every wave in readable patterns using a modulation scheme called 256 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation), cable systems can transmit as many as
seven bits per hertz. This means that the one-gigahertz bandwidth of an
existing cable line might potentially carry between six and eight gigabits
per second, or more than three gigabits per second each way. These potential
links to homes are more capacious than the current telephone fiber lines
that accommodate tens of thousands of phone calls among telco central offices.<BR>
<BR>
This bandwidth represents the real potential of cable coax. For the next
decade much of the cable plant will still be devoted to analog TV broadcasts
or to digital renditions of pay-per-view movies. Time Warner's Orlando project,
however, envisions devoting the top 350 megahertz of its system to two-way
digital communications, including 100 megahertz for the personal communications
services of wireless telephony and 150 megahertz for digital two-way data
flows. At a very conservative estimate of two bits per hertz, Time Warner
projects a total of 300 megabits per second from these digital channels.
At these levels a computer could download a full movie of two-and-a-half
hours in about one minute. 
<PRE>
<B>
Cable's Real Potential is Not TV</B></PRE>
Abandonment of the Malone model by Malone and the rest of the cable industry
ultimately requires that cable TV magnates develop a new grasp of the dynamics
of the microcosm: the exponential growth of computer power and connections.
Accustomed to the role of propagating mass entertainment, cable leaders
have long downplayed the potential market in computer communications.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually growing throughout TCI, Time Warner, Continental Cablevision,
Jones Intercable and other cable firms, however, is a recognition that the
real future of cable is in computers rather than TVs. As David Fellows of
Continental declared in launching his pioneering new Internet access system
in Boston In late February, &quot;The market for computer communications
is huge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, during the next decade the cable companies are going to discover
that the computer market for their services is far more important than the
television market. The computer industry, hardware and software, is already
some 60 percent larger than the television and movie industries put together
and is growing six times as fast. On-line networked computer services, such
as Prodigy, CompuServe, Delphi and America Online, are collectively growing
at a pace of close to 100 percent per year. When on-line services can exchange
video and audio files as readily as they transfer text today, these computer
networks will be able to outperform any television system. Against all their
expectations and plans, cable executives are going to find themselves a
central part of the computer networking industry.<BR>
<BR>
As Fellows explains, &quot;Cable and computer network topologies go together
perfectly. Both provide shared bandwidth. Ethernet over cable is a natural.&quot;
In both networks all the data flow by every terminal. The receiver tunes
into the desired channel. For computers, cable offers the dumb bandwidth
that is increasingly needed as terminals gain near-supercomputer powers.
In the past networks had to be smart in order to provide needed services
to the dumb terminals on their periphery, whether phones, computers or TVs.
Dumb terminals could tolerate narrowband connections. In the future, however,
all terminals will command supercomputer powers.<BR>
<BR>
When terminals are smart, the intelligence in networks flows to the fringes.
When terminals are smart, networks must be broad and dumb. There is no way
that an intelligent switching fabric can anticipate the constantly evolving
technology emerging from a computer industry in a frenzied process of change.
There is no way that John Malone's satellite farm outside Denver will be
able to satisfy the demands for programming and communications of 100 million
networked teleputers. While the telephone business struggles with the increasing
problems of intelligent central switches with some 25 million lines of software
code, the cable industry is creating dumb networks in tune with the explosive
growth of supersmart machines in every home and office.<BR>
<BR>
The movement of computer networks onto cable need not await the development
of advanced broadband systems such as those planned by Time Warner in Orlando.
Already several companies are supplying moderns that allow computers to
link directly to cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith provided the first system, HomeWorks, operating at a rate of 500
kilobits per second. It is being used by Cox Cable to deliver Prodigy service
in San Diego at a rate 52 times faster than existing 9,600-baud phone modems.
Also using HomeWorks is Jones Intercable for Internet services in Alexandria,
Va., Continental Cablevision and CompuServe in Exeter, N.H., and TCI for
a distance learning test in Provo, Utah.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith is adding a system called ChannelMizer that can offer full Ethernet
capability of 10 megabits per second over a 15-mile radius. Intel, General
Instrument and Hybrid Technologies have announced an asymmetrical system
that runs upstream from the home at 256 kilobits per second and downstream
at 10 megabits per second, the Ethernet rate run in most office networks.<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering in the field for several years has been Digital Equipment Corp.
under the leadership of James Albrycht. Adapting equipment developed by
LANcity, DEC's ChannelWorks offers the functionality needed for true information
highway on-ramps. Extending a two-way Ethernet transparently from the office
to the home by a full 70 miles, the ChannelWorks frequency-agile modem allows
the use of all 83 cable frequency channels. Cable managers can send digital
information over any underused part of the coax bandwidth. Currently deployed
chiefly by telecommuting Digital employees, the system is under evaluation
by a variety of hospitals, libraries, schools and other institutions favored
by Vice-President Gore.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely crucial to the development of the broadband superhighway, however,
is not only the merger of the two networks but also access to the capital
of the telephone industry. Creation of high-bandwidth cable connections
to homes will be far cheaper than laying new coax. But they still will require
expensive upgrades to existing cable plant.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos already invest more money every year--some $ 24 billion--than
the total revenues of the cable industry. But even the telcos will not be
able to create information superhighways if they also have to duplicate
the broadband connections to homes already offered by the cable industry.
Similarly, the cable industry alone cannot attract sufficient funds to duplicate
the broadband fiber networks already commanded by the telcos, while the
telcos move in to skim off the best pay-per-view movie markets. Particularly
in an adverse regulatory climate neither industry is capable of building
broadband networks. With relatively narrowband networks, the Malone model
necessarily thrives. In the name of fighting monsters the administration
is in fact pursuing what amounts to a monster-protection policy.<BR>
<BR>
If this policy continues, innovation once more will follow its course toward
the least-regulated arenas. Cable and telco firms will install their best
technologies overseas. In the U.S. the computer networking industry will
build the information superhighways. To Gore's bitter regret, only business
and the wealthy will be able to afford access. Until the early decades of
the next century, much of the rest of the nation will be left to the mercies
of the Malone model for video entertainment and other cable programming.
Interactivity will tend to take the form of games and pay-per-view TV.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with the increasing movement of activity from big cities, corporate
headquarters, hospitals, schools and other centralized institutions to homes
and small cities, the demand for broadband computer connections is sure
to soar. Most current congressional legislation that imposes mandates on
businesses relating to everything from health care reform to parental leave
tends to drive work away from corporations to contractual outsources. The
market for &quot;interactive TV&quot; is likely to grow far more slowly
than the market for computer connections over cable.<BR>
<BR>
Both political parties are far behind the public in comprehending these
developments. But the reversal of the earlier forces of conurbation and
centralized industry responds to the most profound laws of new technology.
It is the most important movement in America today. If the administration
continues to strangle new technology with new regulation and red tape, a
new coalition of liberals and conservatives alike will rise up against it
and grasp the future. Al Gore may eventually wish he had never heard of
broadband networks.

Imagine it is 1971 and you are chair of the new Federal Computer Commission.
This commission has been established to regulate the natural monopoly of
computer technology as summed up in the famous Grosch's Law. In 1956 IBM
engineer Herbert Grosch proved that computer power rises by the square of
its cost and thus necessarily gravitates to the most costly machines. According
to a famous IBM projection, the entire world could use some 55 mainframes,
time-sharing from dumb terminals and keypunch machines. The owners of these
machines would rule the world of information in an ascendant information
age. By the Orwellian dawn of 1984, Big Bre'r IBM would establish a new
digital tyranny, with a new elite of the data-rich dominating the data-poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As head of the computer commission, you launch a bold program to forestall
this grim outcome. Under a congressional mandate to promote competition
for IBM and ensure the principle of universal computer service, you ordain
the creation of some 2,500 mainframe licenses to be auctioned to the highest
bidders (with special licenses reserved for minorities, women and farmers).
To ensure widespread competition across all of America, you establish seven
licenses in each metropolitan Major Trading Area and seven in every rural
Basic Trading Area as defined by Rand McNally. To guarantee universal service,
you mandate the free distribution of keypunch machines to all businesses
and households so that they can access the local computer centers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In establishing this auction in 1971, you had no reason at all to notice
that a tiny company in Mountain View, Calif., called Intel was about to
announce three new technologies together with some hype about &quot;a new
era of integrated electronics.&quot; After all, these technologies--the
microprocessor; erasable, programmable read-only memory (EPROM); and a one-kilobit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM)--were far too primitive to even compare
with IBM's massive machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The likely results of such a Federal Computer Commission policy are not
merely matters of conjecture. France pretty much did it when it distributed
free Minitel terminals to its citizens to provide them access to government
mainframes. While the United States made personal computers nearly ubiquitous
buying perhaps 100 million since the launch of the Minitel in the late 1970s
the French chatted through central databases and ended up with one-quarter
as many computers per capita as this country, and one-tenth the number of
computer networks. Today, PC networks are leading the US economy to world
dominance while Europe founders without a single major computer company,
software firm or semiconductor manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT IS NOW 1994, and Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, is indeed about to hold an auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than selling exclusive mainframe licenses, the current FCC is going
to sell exclusive ten-year licenses to about 2,500 shards of the radio spectrum.
Meanwhile, a tiny company called Steinbrecher Corp. of Burlington, Mass.,
is introducing the new microprocessor of the radio business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the world of radio waves ruled by the Federal Communications Commission,
the Steinbrecher MiniCell is even more revolutionary than the microprocessor
was in the world of computing. While Intel put an entire computer on a single
chip, Steinbrecher has put an entire cellular base station--now requiring
some 1,000 square feet and costing $ 1.5 million--in a box the size of a
briefcase that costs $ 100,000 today. Based on a unique invention by Donald
Steinbrecher and on the sweeping advance of computer technology, the MiniCell
represents a far bigger leap forward beyond the current state of the art
than the microprocessor did. What's more, this MiniCell is in fact much
superior to existing cellular base stations. Unlike the 416 hard-wired radio
transceivers (transmitter-receivers) in existing base stations, the MiniCell
contains a single digital broadband radio and is fully programmable. It
can accommodate scores of different kind of cellular handsets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important, the MiniCell benefits from the same technology as the microprocessor.
Making possible the creation of this broadband digital radio is the tidal
onrush of Moore's Law. In an antithesis of Grosch's Law, Gordon Moore of
Intel showed that the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology doubles
every 18 months. This insight suggested the Law of the Microcosm-- that
computing power gravitates not to the costliest but to the cheapest machines.
Costing $ 100,000 today, the MiniCell will predictably cost some $10,000
before the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In time, these digital MiniCells will have an impact similar to that of
the PC. They will drive the creation of a cornucopia of new mobile services--from
plain old telephony to wireless video conferencing--based on ubiquitous
client/server networks in the air. Endowing Americans with universal mobile
access to information superhighways, these MiniCells can spearhead another
generation of computer-led growth in the US economy. Eventually, the implications
of Steinbrecher's machines and other major innovations in wireless will
crash In on the legalistic scene of the FCC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning of the story.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on the block In May will be 160 megahertz (millions of cycles per
second) of the radio frequency spectrum, divided into seven sections of
between 10 and 30 megahertz In each of 543 areas of the country, and devoted
to enhanced Personal Communications Services (PCS).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Existing cellular systems operate in a total spectrum space of 50 megahertz
in two frequency bands near the 800 megahertz level. By contrast, PCS will
take four times that space in a frequency band near two gigahertz (billions
of cycles per second). Became higher frequencies allow use of lower-power
radios with smaller antennas and longer-lasting batteries, PCS offers the
possibility of a drastically improved wireless system. Unfortunately, the
major obstacle to the promise of PCS is the auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amid the spectrum fever aroused by the bidding, however, new radio technologies
are emerging that devastate its most basic assumptions. At a time when the
world is about to take to information superhighways In the sky--plied by
low-powered, pollution-free computer phones--the FCC is in danger of building
a legal infrastructure and protectionist program for information smokestacks
and gas guzzlers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used to describe the auction betrays its fallacies. With
real estate imagery, analysts depict spectrum as &quot;beachfront property&quot;
and the auction as a &quot;land rash.&quot; They assume that radio frequencies
are like analog telephone circuit: no two users can occupy the same spot
of spectrum at the same time. Whether large 50-kilowatt broadcast stations
booming Rush Limbaugh's voice across the nation or milliwatt cellular phones
beaming love murmurs to a nearby base station, radio transmitters are assumed
to be infectious, high-powered and blind. If one is on the highway, everyone
else has to clear out. Both the prevailing wisdom and the entrenched technology
dictate that every transmitter be quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, innovations from such companies as Steinbrecher and Qualcomm Inc.
of San Diego overthrow this paradigm. Not only can numerous radios operate
at non-interfering levels in the same frequency band, they can also see
other users' signals and move to avoid them. In baseball jargon, the new
radios can hit 'em where they ain't; in football idiom, they run for daylight.
If appropriately handled, these technologies can render spectrum not scarce
but abundant.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These developments make it retrograde to assign exclusive spectrum rights
to anyone or to foster technologies that require exclusivity. Spectrum no
longer shares any features of beachfront property. A wave would be a better
analogy. 
<PRE><B>
The New Rules Of Waves</B></PRE>
In the early decades of this century, radio was king. Electronics hackers
played in the waves with a variety of ham, citizens band and short-wave
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Experimenting with crystal sets, they innocently entered the domain of solid-state
devices and acquired some of the skills that fueled the electronic revolution
in the United States and the radar revolution that won World War II. The
first point-contact transistor, created by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
at Bell Labs in 1948, functioned like a crystal radio. The first major solid-state
product was a 1954 Texas Instruments pocket radio with six germanium transistors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the following decades, the radio became a mass commodity. There are
now some 230 million radios in the United States alone, not even including
more than 16 million cellular phones (which are in fact portable two-way
radios). Radios roll off Asian assembly lines at a rate that might be meaningfully
measured in hertz (cycles per second), and they come in sizes fit for pockets,
belts, watches and ears. But the romance of radio has died and given way
to the romance of computers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today it is PC technology that engages the youthful energies previously
invested in radio technology. The press trumpets a coming convergence between
computers and TVs and games and films. But no one talks much about radios.
For many years, we have been taking radios for granted.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the foundation of wireless communications, however, radio--no less than
TV or films--will burst into a new technoscape as a result of a convergence
with computers. The hackers of the '50s and '60s are joining forces with
the hackers of the '80s and '90s to create a new industry. Moore's Law is
about to overran the world of radio.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You double anything every 18 months and pretty soon you find yourself with
a monster. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moore's Law overturned the established
order in the computer industry and spawned some 100 million personal computers
that are as powerful as million-dollar mainframes were when the revolution
began. In the current decade, Moore's Law is upending the telephone and
television industries with interactive teleputers that will be able to send,
receive, shape and store interactive full-motion video. And during the next
five years, Moore's Law is going to transform exotic and costly radio equipment
once consigned to the military and outer space into the basic communications
access routes for the new world economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To understand this new world of radio, however, you must forget much of
what you learned about the old world of radio. For example, these new radios
differ radically from the radios of the past in the way they use spectrum,
the way they interfere with one another and the way they are built.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For some 15 years, a hacker of the 1950s named Don Steinbrecher and a small
group of students and associates have been making the world's most powerful
and aerobatic radios. Steinbrecher radio gear can soar to spectrum altitudes
as high as 94 gigahertz to provide radar &quot;eyes&quot; for smart bombs
and pies, plunge down to the cellular band at 800 megahertz to listen in
on phone calls or drop discretely to 30 megahertz--waves that bounce off
the ionosphere--for remote over-the-horizon radar work identifying cocaine
traffickers flying in low from Latin America. At the same time, some of
these radios may soon command enough dynamic ranges of accurate broadband
reception--rumored to be as high as 120 decibels (one trillion-to-one)--to
detect a pin drop at a heavy-metal rock concert without missing a high-fidelity
note or twang.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like every radio transceiver, a Steinbrecher radio must have four key components:
an antenna, a tuner, a modem and a mixer. The antenna part is easy; for
many purposes, your metal shirt hanger will do the trick (backyard wire
fences collect millions of frequencies). But without tuners, modems and
mixers, nothing reaches its final destination--the human ear.<BR>
<BR>
A tuner selects a desired carrier frequency, usually by exploiting the science
of resonant circuits. A modem is a modulator-demodulator. In transmitting
it applies information to the carrier frequency by wiggling the waves in
a pattern, called a modulation scheme, such as AM or FM. In receiving the
modem strips out (demodulates) the information tom the carrier wave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to Steinbrecher radios is the broadband mixer. It surmounts what
was long seen as an impossible challenge: moving a large array of the relatively
high career frequencies on the antenna down to a so-called baseband level
where they can be used without losing any of the information or adding spurious
information in the process. Compared to FM carrier frequencies of 100 megahertz
or even PCS frequencies of two gigahertz, baseband audio frequencies run
between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mixers were the basic Steinbrecher product, and in 1978 and 1980, Steinbrecher
acquired patents on a unique broadband mixer with high range and sensitivity
called the Paramixer. Even to its expected military customers, the Paramixer
was a hard sell because other radio components were unable to keep pace
with its performance. Today, however, the Paramixer is the foundation of
the Steinbrecher radio in the MiniCell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the old world of radio, transceivers integrated all of these components--antenna,
tuner, modem and mixer--into one analog hardware system. Because the radio
is analog and hard-wired, its functions must be standardized. Each radio
can receive or transmit only a very limited set of frequencies bearing information
coded in a specific modulation scheme and exclusively occupying a specific
spectrum space at a particular power range. If you are in the radio business--whether
as an equipment manufacturer such as Motorola or Ericsson, a provider of
services, such as McCaw or Comsat, or a broadcaster, such as NBC or Turner--you
care deeply about these hard-wired specifications, frequencies and modulation
schemes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprising the &quot;air standard,&quot; these issues embroil businesses,
politicians, standards bodies and regulators in constant warfare. For everything
from High Definition Television to digital cellular and cordless telephony,
standards bodies are wrangling over frequencies and modulation schemes.
<PRE><B>

How Digital Radios Can End The Spectrum Wars</B></PRE>
To the people at Steinbrecher Corp., all these wrangles seem utterly unnecessary.
With antennas, tuners, modems and mixers, wideband digital radios perform
all the same functions as ordinary radios. Only the antenna and mixer are
in hardware, and these are generic; they don't care any more about air standards
than your shirt hanger does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Steinbrecher radios, all of the frequency tuning, all of the modulating
and demodulating, all of the channelization, all of the coding and decoding
that so embroil the politicians are performed by programmable digital signal
processors and can be changed at a base station in real time. Strictly speaking,
the tuner and modem are not part of the base station radio at all. The broadband
radio in a Steinbrecher base station can send or receive signals to or from
any handset or mobile unit operating within its bandwidth (in current cellular
systems the full 12.5 megahertz of the band; in PCS, still larger bands
of as much as 30 megahertz).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the processing of codes, frequencies, channels and modulations, as well
as all special mobile services, can move onto computers attached to the
network. Steinbrecher technology thus can open up the spectrum for open
and programmable client/server systems like those that now dominate the
computer industry. Moore's Law, in fact, is changing radios into portable
digital computers. The most pervasive personal computer of the next decade
will be a digital cellular phone operating at least 40 MIPS (millions of
instructions per second).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the performance of analog-to-digital converters defines the limits
of Steinbrecher radios. Even if the mixers are perfect, the system's performance
can be no better than the accuracy of the A/D processors that transform
the output of the mixers into a digital bit stream for the DSPs. Steinbrecher
estimates that better broadband A/D converters--which can sample wave forms
more accurately at high frequencies--could increase the performance ofSteinbrecher
systems by an amazing factor of 10. Pushed by demands and designs from Steinbrecher,
Analog Devices and other suppliers are advancing converter technology nearly
at a pace with Moore's Law, and Steinbrecher's broadband digital radios
are rapidly approaching the ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Don Steinbrecher puts it, broadband A/D and DSP have changed wireless
&quot;turn a radio business to a computer business.&quot; At first, the
computer portion of a broadband radio was very expensive. Until the early
1980s, military customers performed advanced broadband analog-to-digital
conversion and digital signal processing on million-dollar custom supercomputers.
In 1986, an advanced DSP system for graphics at Bell Labs entailed the use
of 82 AT&T DSP32 chips and supporting devices in a custom computer that
cost some $ 130,000. Today, these same functions are performed on an Apple
Quadra 84o AV using an AT&T 3210 running at 33 megaflops (million floating-point
operations per second) and 17 MIPS for under $ 20 in volume. This rising
tide of advances in digital technology, propelled by Moore's Law, is about
to sweep Steinbrecher's recondite radio company into the midst of a mass
market in cellular telephony.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the entire cellular and PCS industries will be beating a path to Steinbrecher's
door. Just as millions of people today have learned the meaning of MIPS
and megabytes, millions of people around the world, believe it or not, are
going to come to understand the meaning of &quot;spurious-free dynamic range.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a very rough analogy, imagine cranking the volume of your radio as high
as possible without marring the desired signal with static and distortion.
The spurious-free dynamic range of your radio would measure the distance
between the lowest and the highest volumes with a clear signal. In more
technical terms, spurious-free dynamic range is defined as the range of
signal amplitudes that can simultaneously be processed without distortion
or be resolved by a receiver without the emergence of spurious signals above
the noise floor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In building broadband radios with high dynamic range, however, Steinbrecher
faced a fundamental technical problem. As a general rule, bandwidth is inversely
proportional to dynamic range. You can have one or the other, but you can't
have both. The broader the band, the more difficult it is to capture all
of its contents with full accuracy and sensitivity or with full spurious-free
dynamic range. An ordinary radio may command a high dynamic range of volumes
because it is narrowband.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Steinbrecher radio does not begin by tuning to one frequency alone;
it gasps every frequency in a particular swath of spectrum. In some extreme
Paramixer applications (94-gigahertz radar, for example), the bandwidth
could be 10 gigahertz--larger than the entire range of spectrum commonly
used in the air, from submarine communications at 60 hertz to C band satellite
at 6 gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most Steinbrecher applications that require high dynamic range, however,
the bandwidth runs between a few megahertz and hundreds of megahertz (compared
to 30 kilohertz in a cellular phone). Unless all of the frequencies captured
by the broadband radio are really present in the band rather than as artifacts
of the equipment--in technical jargon, unless the signals are spurious-free--the
radio user cannot tell what is going on, cannot distinguish between spurs
and signals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher has devoted much of his career to the graft of spurious-free
dynamic range. Soon after he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in September 1961 to pursue work on device physics, he moved into the school's
new Radio Astronomy Lab. The radio astronomers were using millimeter waves
at 75 gigahertz to probe remote galaxies and pour through evidence of a
big bang at the beginning of time. Because the return reflections from outer
space were infinitesimal, the radio telescopes had to command a bandwidth
of at least two gigahertz, a spurious-free dynamic range of more than 100
decibels (tens of billions-, or even trillions-to-one) and noise levels
of less than 10 decibels (millionths of a watt).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telescope signals turned out not to be spurious-free. More than 90 percent
of the receiver noise--the spurious signals--originated in the frequency
converter or mixer, which translated the 75-gigahertz millimeter waves in
cascading analog stages of diodes and transistors, fed by tunable local
oscillators, down to baseband levels that could be usefully analyzed. This
impelled Steinbrecher's obsession with spurious-free dynamic range in mixers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve high dynamic range in broadband mixers, Steinbrecher discovered,
was chiefly a problem of the basic physics of diodes. At the University
of Florida, at ECI Corp. and at MIT, Steinbrecher had pursued studies in
device physics focusing on the theory of PIN junctions--the positive-negative
interfaces that create the active regions in diodes and transistors. How
cleanly and abruptly they switch from on to off--how fully these switches
avoid transitional effects--determines how well they can translate one frequency
to another without spurs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From this experience, Steinbrecher concluded in 1968 that receivers could
be built with at least a thousand times more dynamic range than was currently
believed possible. He assigned his student Robert Snyder to investigate
the issue mathematically, integrating the possible performance of each component
into the performance of a mixer. Snyder's results stunningly continued Steinbrecher's
hypothesis. They predicted that in principle--with unlimited time and effort--the
linearity and dynamic range of a radio could be improved to any arbitrary
standard. In a key invention, Steinbrecher figured out how to create a diode
circuit that could produce a perfect square wave, creating a diode with
essentially zero switching time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher then proceeded to put his theory into practice by developing
the crucial diode and field-effect transistor arrays, mixers, amplifiers
and other components necessary to build a working system of unparalleled
dynamic range. Most of their advances required detailed knowledge of the
behavior of P/N junctions. To this day, the performance of Steinbrecher's
equipment depends on adjustment to unexpected nonlinearities and noise sources
that were discovered as part of Robert Snyder's work but are still not integrated
into the prevailing models of diode behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond radio astronomy, the people who were interested in analyzing signals
of unknown frequencies, rather than tuning into preset frequencies, were
in the field of military intelligence. Enemies did not normally announce
in advance the frequencies they planned to use or how they would modulate
them. Steinbrecher Corp.'s first major contract came in the early 1980s
for remote over-the-horizon radar (ROTHR) systems used to detect planes
carrying drugs from Latin America. Steinbrecher also won contracts to supply
MILSTAR satellite transceivers and 94-gigahertz &quot;eyes&quot; for smart
munitions and jet aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 these large potential businesses began to attract venture capitalists,
including EG&G venture partners, The Venture Capital Fund of New England
and Raytheon. As often happens, the venture capitalists sought professional
management. They pushed Steinbrecher upstairs to chairman and summoned a
Stanford EE graduate named Douglas Shute to manage the company's move from
a manufacturer of hard-sell mixers Into a producer of revolutionary digital
radios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still, Steinbrecher Corp. long remained a tiny firm occupying a dingy one-story
building in a Woburn, Mass., industrial park, where it rarely pulled in
more than $ 5 million in revenues. Not until the early 1990s, when its technology
converged with Moore's Law, did the company begin to escape its niche. 
<PRE><B>
Collision With Texas Instruments' DSP</B></PRE>
Indeed, strictly speaking even Moore's Law was not enough to make this Pentagon
turkey fly. Crucial was Texas Instruments' mid-1980s campaign to remake
the digital signal processor into a commodity device comparable to Intel's
microprocessor. Creating development systems and software tools, TI transformed
the DSP from an exotic and expensive printed circuit board full of integrated
circuits into a single programmable microchip manufactured in volume on
the same factory floor the company used to produce hundreds of millions
of dynamic random access memories. The results exceeded all expectations.
Outpacing Moore's Law by a factor of nearly four for some eight years so
far, DSP cost-effectiveness began soaring tenfold every two years. Pricing
the devices for digital radios, Douglas Shute saw that the wideband digital
radio had &quot;moved onto the map as a commercial product.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also in 1989, a secret contractor asked the company if its radios could
snoop on calls in the cellular band. After gigahertz explorations in radio
astronomy and military projects, the 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth
seemed a piece of cake. Although this national security application never
came through, the idea galvanized the company. If it should need a commercial
market, cellular telephony was a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pull of opportunity, however, is usually less potent than the push of
catastrophe--which is the key reason for socialism's failure. Insulating
the economy from failure, it also removes a key spur for success. For all
the bureaucratic rigmarole of military procurement, producers for the Pentagon
live in a relatively comfortable socialist world of cost plus contracts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Steinbrecher
began to get clear signals from Washington that the market for his products
was about to collapse. MILSTAR remained an experimental program; the ROTHR
system was halted after the creation of just four stations with 1,600 mixers;
and suddenly the cellular opportunity was not merely an attractive option--it
was crucial for survival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Shute and Steinbrecher viewed the cellular scene in the United States,
however, they became increasingly disdainful. These radio companies had
no more idea of what was possible in radio technology than had the MIT engineering
lab when he arrived in 1961. Indeed, Steinbrecher Corp.'s first potential
customer--a wireless colossus--refused even to meet with Shute: The chief
technologist said he had investigated digital radios several years before
and determined they were unable to achieve the requisite dynamic range.
Moreover, at scores of thousands of dollars apiece, digital signal processors
were far too expensive. Most cellular executives, along with their Washington
regulators, seemed stuck in a 1970s time warp when analog still ruled and
DSP was a supercomputer. 
<PRE><B>
Importing Obsolescence</B></PRE>
As a result, the entire industry was convulsed by what Shute and Steinbrecher
saw as a retrograde war over standards. Because Europe in general lagged
far behind the United States in adopting analog cellular technology, the
EEC had sponsored a multinational drive to leapfrog the United States by
adopting a digital standard, which could then be exported to America. The
standard they chose was called GSM (global services mobile), a time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) scheme that exceeded analog capacity by breaking
each channel into three digital time slots. Racing to catch up, the American
industry adopted a similar TDMA approach that also increased the current
system's capacity by a factor of three. With McCaw Cellular in the lead,
American firms quickly committed themselves to deploy TDMA as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in 1991, Qualcomm unleashed a bombshell Exploiting the increasing power
of DSPs to process digital codes, the company demonstrated a spread-spectrum,
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) modulation scheme that not only increased
capacity some twentyfold over analog but also allowed use of the entire
11.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth in every cell. To prevent interference
between adjoining cells, analog and TDMA systems could use a frequency in
only one cell out of seven.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of the industry seemed paralyzed by fear of choosing the wrong system.
To Shute and Steinbrecher, however, these fears seemed entirely reckless.
Using wideband digital radios, companies could accommodate any array of
frequencies and modulation schemes they desired TDMA, CDMA, voice, data
and eventually even video. Shute resolved to adapt Steinbrecher's advanced
radio technology to these new markets. In mid-1991, Shute rushed ahead with
a program to create a prototype cellular transceiver that could process
all 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth and convert it to a digital
bit stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first major customer for the radios turned out to be ADC-Kentrox, a
designer of analog cell extenders designed to overcome &quot;dead zones&quot;
caused by large buildings in urban areas. This system was limited in reach
to the few hundred meters the signals could be sent over analog wires without
deterioration. By converting the signals to digital at the remote site,
the Steinbrecher radio extended this distance from hundreds of meters to
scores of kilometers and allowed the price of the product to remain at $
100,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these gains concealed the potential impact and meaning of the Steinbrecher
technology. Once again, the Steinbrecher radios are being used to complement
the existing system rather than overthrow it. In a similar way, McCaw plans
to buy some $ 30 million worth of Steinbrecher machines to carry through
its cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network. To be provided to 95 percent
of McCaw's regions by the end of 1995, CDPD is a data overlay of the existing
cellular system, which allows users of the current analog system to send
digital data at a rate of 19.2 kilobits per second, compared to the 9.6-kilobit-per-second
rate offered by most modems over twisted-pair wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher radio can survey any existing swath of spectrum in real
time and determine almost instantly which channels are in use and which
are free. It is this capability that convinced McCaw to buy Steinbrecher
data cells despite the commitment of McCaw's putative owner, AT&amp;T, to
sell narrowband units made by Cirrus Logics' subsidiary Pacific Communications
Sciences Inc. (PCSI), which have to scan through channels one at a time.
McCaw is using the Steinbrecher radios as sniffers that constantly survey
the cellular band and direct data bursts to those channels that are not
being used at a particular time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the immediate needs of the marketplace alone justify the adoption
of Steinbrecher data cells. With modems and antennas increasingly available
and even moving sometime next year to PCMCIA slots the size of a credit
card, demand for wireless data is likely to soar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PCSI is now shipping a quintuple-threat communicator that fits into the
floppy bay of an advanced IBM ThinkPad notebook or an Apple PowerBook, enabling
them to send and receive faxes, make wireless or wire-line phone calls,
dispatch data files across the existing cellular network or send CDPD packets
at 19.2 kilobits per second. Speech recognition capabilities from IBM and
Dragon Systems will come next year to personal digital assistants, permitting
them to read or receive E-mail by voice. Although the first Newtons and
Zoomers have disappointed their sponsors, the market will ignite over the
next two years as vendors adopt the essential form factor of a digital cellular
phone with computer functions rather than providing a kluge computer with
a vaporware phone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, McCaw has more on its mind with Steinbrecher than merely gaining
a second source for CDPD sniffers. By simultaneously purchasing some 10
percent of the company and putting chief technical officer Nicholas Kauser
on the Steinbrecher board, McCaw is signaling not a tactical move but a
major strategic thrust. The Steinbrecher rollout in fact represents McCaw's
stealth deployment of broadband digital capability.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the rival CDPD equipment from PCSI, Hughes and AT&T all can be made
to perform CDPD communications as an overly to the existing cellular phone
system. However, only the Steinbrecher systems can be upgraded to perform
all of the functions of a base station and more, for voice, data and video.
Only Steinbrecher allows the replacement of 416 radio transceivers, one
for each channel, with one broadband radio and some digital signal processing
chips. Only Steinbrecher can replace a $ 1.5 million, 1,000 square foot
cellular base station with a box the size of a briefcase costing some $
100,000 but, thanks to Moore's Law, racing toward $ 10,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen only whether McCaw will have the guts to follow through
on this initiative by completely rebuilding its network to accommodate the
wideband radio being installed at its heart. Self-cannibalization is the
rule of success in information technology. Intel and Microsoft, for example,
lead the way in constantly attacking their own products. But this mode of
life is deeply alien to the telephone business--even an entrepreneurial
outfit like McCaw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With new software and a simple upgrade to a MiniCell, the Steinbrecher DataCell
will allow the McCaw system to handle all modulation schemes simultaneously--AMPS,
TDMA, CDMA and future methods such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access--obviating the need for hybrid phones. The multiprotocol and aerobatic
capabilities of broadband digital radios could enable McCaw to roll out
a cornucopia of PCS services--for everything from monitoring vending machines
or remote power stations to tracking tracks and packages, and linking laptops
and PDAs--while the rest of the industry is still paralyzed by wrangles
over incumbent users, regulatory procedures, frequency access and radio
standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Making channel sizes a variable rather than a fixed function of radios,
Steinbrecher systems offer the possibility of bandwidth on demand. They
could open up the entire spectrum as one gigantic broadband pipe into which
we would be able to insert packets in any empty space--dark fiber in the
air. 
<PRE>
<B>So Stop The Auction</B></PRE>
<BR>
So what does this have to do with the impending spectrum auction? Almost
everything. Strictly speaking, the FCC is leasing 10 year exclusive rights
to radiate electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies to deliver PCS.
This entire auction concept is tied to thousands of exclusive frequency
licenses. It has no place for broadband radios that treat all frequencies
alike and offer bandwidth on demand. It has no place for modulation schemes
that do not need exclusive spectrum space. Continuing to use interference
standards based on analog transmissions that are affected by every passing
spray of radiation, FCC rules fail to grasp the far more robust nature of
digital on-off codes with error correction. By the time the FCC gets around
to selling its 1,500 shards of air, the air will have been radically changed
by new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum. You buy or
lease spectrum as you would a spread of land. Once you have your license,
you can use it any way you want as long as you don't unduly disturb the
neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher system, by contrast, suggests a model not of a beach but
of an ocean. You can no more lease electromagnetic waves than you can lease
ocean waves. Enabled by new technology, this new model is suitable for an
information superhighway in the sky. You can use the spectrum as much as
you want as long as you don't collide with anyone else or pollute it with
high-powered noise or other nuisances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Steinbrecher model, you employ the spectrum as you use any public
right of way. You are responsible for keeping your eyes open and avoiding
others. You cannot just buy a 10 year lease and then barge blindly all over
the air in a high-powered vessel, depending on the government to keep everyone
else off your territory and out of your way. The spectrum is no longer dark.
The Steinbrecher broadband radio supplies you with lights as you travel
the information superhighway. You can see other travelers and avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if Steinbrecher radios did not exist, however, the assumptions of the
auction are collapsing in the face of innovations by Qualcomm and other
spread-spectrum companies. Like Steinbrecher radios, CDMA modulation schemes
allow you to use spectrum without interfering with others. To auditors without
the code, calls seem indistinguishable from noise. But radios with the code
can dig up signals from under the noise floor. Up to the point of traffic
congestion where the quality of the signal begins to degrade gracefully,
numerous users can employ the same frequencies at the same time.<BR>
<BR>

This property of CDMA has been tested in Qualcomm's CDMA Omnitracs position
locator and two-way communications system. Mainly used by trucking companies,
it is now being extended to cars, boats, trains and other mobile equipment.
Based on geosynchronous satellites, it operates all across the country,
with some 60,000 units, under a secondary license that forbids Qualcomm
to interfere with the primary license-holders of the same frequencies. Qualcomm's
transceivers on the tops of trucks use a small antenna that issues a beam
six to 10 degrees in width. Because satellites are just two degrees apart,
the Qualcomm beam can blanket several satellites. Other users, however,
are entirely unconscious of the presence of the CDMA signal. Omnitracs has
operated for some six years and has not interfered with anyone yet. 
<PRE>
<B>No More Blind Drivers On The Information Superhighway</B></PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing array of low-interference technologies available, the
FCC should not give exclusive rights to anyone. Instead, it should impose
a heavy burden of proof on any service providers with blind or high-powered
systems that maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license,
that want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.
In particular, the FCC should make all the proponents of TDMA, whether in
the American or European GSM systems, explain why the government should
wall off spectrum. The wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth
on demand and send their packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm and Steinbrecher also radically attack
the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the auction is based. Steinbrecher's
radio makes it possible to manufacture new spectrum nearly at will. By putting
one of his MiniCells on every telephone pole and down every alley and in
every elevator shaft, the cellular industry can exponentially multiply the
total number of calls it can handle. At some $ 100,000 apiece and dropping
in price, these MiniCells can operate at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz
just as well as at the two-gigahertz range being auctioned by the government.
It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning off beachfront property, with a long
list of codicils and regulations and restrictive covenants, while the tide
pours in around him and creates new surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, the wideband capability
of the Steinbrecher radio joins CDMA in allowing the use of huge spans of
spectrum that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The Steinbrecher radio
can survey the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services,
UHF television and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions.
For example, the prime territory between 225 megahertz and 400 megahertz,
consisting of some 3,0130 25-kilohertz channels, is entirely occupied by
government and air force communications. But most of the channels are largely
unused. A Steinbrecher radio could sit on those frequencies and direct calls
to empty slots.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An ideal system would combine Steinbrecher broadband machines with Qualcomm's
modulation schemes. Steinbrecher supplies the lights and eyes to find space
in already licensed spectrum bands; CDMA allows the noninvasive entry Into
spans of spectrum that are in active use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Steinbrecher system changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot;
or rental. Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, Steinbrecher
radios can reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any
unoccupied territory. As Steinbrecher radios become the dominant technology,
the notion of spectrum assignments allotted in 2,500 specific shards becomes
a technological absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street is beginning to catch on. When Steinbrecher announced in January
a private placement through Alex. Brown, the company wanted to raise some
$ 20 million. The response was overwhelming, and hundreds of frustrated
Investors were left wringing their hands as the new radio left the station.
The sole proprietorship of the mid-1980s with revenues of $ 5 million or
less was moving into sleek new headquarters off Route 198 in Burlington.
Steinbrecher Corp. was becoming yet another of the Moore's Law monsters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the issue for Washington emerges starkly. Do we want a strategy
for MiniCells or for Minitels?

<PRE></PRE>
The perennial question of all suitors of fate and fortune now whispers and
resounds through conference resorts, executive retreats and consulting sessions
across the land as business leaders from Hollywood to Wall Street pose with
pundits and ponder the new world of converging technologies. Symbolized
in a famous mandala by MIT's Media Lab, this grand fondue of information
tools_to be served la carte on a flat-panel screen_is foreseen to be a $3.5
trillion feast for American business sometime early next century. Few would
guess that crucial to the emerging mediamorphosis_as king of the flat panel_will
be a slight, graying, bearded man with some 30 teddy bears, Roger Fidler.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler coined the term mediamorphosis as the title of his forthcoming book.
His office in Boulder, Colo., looks out on the panorama of a picturesque
downtown of red brick and neo-Gothic, surrounded by the Rocky Mountain foothills
and sepia sandstone buildings of a mile-high Silicon Valley. Down the hall
is an Apple Computer media center which is developing graphical forms of
AppleLink, the company's on-line network. Down the block is Cablelabs, John
Malone's research arm, which is designing the future of the cable industry.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Fidler, though, is a newspaperman, a veteran of some 32 years in a
business little known for technology. Beginning as an 11-year-old paperboy
in Eugene, Oreg., Fidler went on to serve as a reporter, science columnist
and art director before launching what is now Knight-Ridder Tribune Graphics.
A multimillion-dollar business and reliable profit center, this venture
provides digital graphics for newspapers and video animations for TV stations
across the country over a dedicated network called PressLink, also launched
by Fidler. Now Fidler and his allies working in Knight-Ridder's Information
Design Laboratory are concocting an audacious plan to make the lowly newspaper
the spearhead of the information economy.<BR>
<BR>
Most information companies and executives are betting on him to fail. Barry
Diller, the former ruler of 20th Century Fox, recently circled the planet
of technology on a celebrated pilgrimage from Hollywood to find where the
money would be made in the new information economy. Shunning Fidler's little
lab, he arrived at nearby Cablelabs and resolved on home shopping through
cable TV. He bought into QVC for some $20 million and went into business
with John Malone. After a more corporate investigation, featuring polls
and customer surveys, Robert Allen of AT&T settled to a remarkable degree
on the $14 billion market in electronic games. Since launching an alliance
with Sega, AT&T has been collecting game companies as compulsively as your
kid collects games. It has bought shares of Sierra Online, 3DO, Spectrum
HoloByte and PF Magic.<BR>
<BR>
Moving toward the news trade is IBM. But rather than collaborating with
one of the thousands of newspapers that use its equipment, the computer
giant is trysting with General Electric's NBC in a kind of elephants' waltz
into the sunset of old broadcast media.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these leaders in the new gold rush toward multimedia are getting
it wrong. Fixated by market surveys that map demand for existing video,
they are plunging down dead ends and cul-de-sacs with their eyes firmly
focused on the luminous visions in their rearview mirrors. Blockbuster,
Nintendo and other game and video vendors have good businesses, for the
moment, but they are ballast from the past.

News In The Microcosm

</B></PRE>
The leader who best comprehends the promise of the next phase in information
technology may be Fidler of Knight-Ridder. A student of electronic technology,
he has grasped an amazing and rather obscure fact: of all the information
providers, only newspapers are fully in tune with the law of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the constant rise in the computing power of individual microchips
relative to systems of chips, the law of the microcosm dictates that power
will continually devolve from centralized institutions, bureaucracies, computer
architectures and databases into distributed systems. On the most obvious
level, it caused the fall of the mainframe computer and the companies that
depended upon it, and assured the ascent of personal computers and workstations.
In the next decade, the law of the microcosm will assure the displacement
of analog television, with its centralized networks and broadcast stations,
by computer networks with no center at all. While offering a cornucopia
of interactivity, computer networks can perform all the functions of TV.<BR>
<BR>
With the cost-effectiveness of chips still doubling every 18 months, the
law of the microcosm is not going away. Now it dictates that of all the
many rivals to harvest the fruits of the information revolution, newspapers
and magazines will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
The secret of the success of the newspaper, grasped by Roger Fidler, is
that it is in practice a personal medium, used very differently by each
customer. Newspapers rely on the intelligence of the reader. Although the
editors select and shape the matter to be delivered, readers choose, peruse,
sort, queue and quaff the news and advertising copy at their own pace and
volition.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, newspapers differ from television stations in much the way
automobiles differ from trains. With the train (and the TV), you go to the
station at the scheduled time and travel to the destinations determined
from above. With the car (and the newspaper), you get in and go pretty much
where you want when you want. Putting the decisionmaking power into the
hands of the reader, the newspaper accords with the microcosmic model far
better than TV does. Newspaper readers are not couch potatoes; they interact
with the product, shaping it to their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
Computers will soon blow away the broadcast television industry, but they
pose no such threat to newspapers. Indeed, the computer is a perfect complement
to the newspaper. It enables the existing news industry to deliver its product
in real time. It hugely increases the quantity of information that can be
made available, including archives, maps, charts and other supporting material.
It opens the way to upgrading the news with full-screen photographs and
videos. While hugely enhancing the richness and timeliness of the news,
however, it empowers readers to use the &quot;paper&quot; in the same way
they do today_to browse and select stories and advertisements at their own
time and pace.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, the expense of computers restricted this complementarity
to newsrooms and pressrooms. The news today is collected, edited, laid out
and prepared for the press by advanced digital equipment. Reporters capture
and remit their data in digital form. But the actual printing and distribution
of the paper remain in the hands of printers and truckers.<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm has reduced the price of personal computers
below the tag on a high-end TV and made them nearly coextensive with newspapers.
Newspapers and computers are converging, while computers and televisions
still represent radically different modes. It is the newspaper, therefore,
not the TV, that is best fitted for the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
Newspapers can be built on foundations of sand_the silicon and silica of
microchips and telecom. Not only does the computer industry generate nearly
three times the annual revenues of television but computer hardware sales
are growing some eight times faster than the sales of television sets. By
riding the tides of personal computer sales and usage, newspapers can shape
the future of multimedia.<BR>
<BR>
High-definition PC displays will benefit text far more than images. The
resolution of current NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) analog
television_62 dots per inch_is actually ample for most images, particularly
the studio-quality forms that can be converted for digital delivery over
fiber-optic lines. Even the conventional interlaced TV screen_in which alternate
lines are filled in every second_easily fools the eye for video. But for
fully readable text you need the 200 to 300 dots per inch of a laser printer
or super-high-resolution screen. Such screens are now being developed. Overkill
for most images, they could supply the first display tablets with screens
as readable as paper.

Fat Panel's Digital Newspaper

</B></PRE>
After the &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; panorama, the first thing you
see in Roger Fidler's office is a more modest tableau. At a round table
in the corner is a huge teddy bear he calls Fat Panel. Fat Panel is poised
to read a tablet that looks very much like a newspaper, but in fact is a
flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high and a half-inch thick.
Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your
local newspaper, this device_call it a newspanel_might contain a trove of
news, graphics, audio and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday
papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links, it might connect to databases
of news and entertainment from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of this tablet is something that looks a lot like the page of
a newspaper. It contains headlines for featured stories followed by their
first few paragraphs and a jump to an inner page. The jump, unlike that
in your usual newspaper, is electronic and immediate. You click an arrow
with a pen or a mouse_or in the near future, say the word_and the rest of
the story almost instantly appears. If your eyes are otherwise engaged,
you can click on an audio icon and have the story read aloud to you.<BR>
<BR>
Discreetly placed on the bottom of the panel are three sample ads. Since
ads currently supply some 80 percent of the revenues of many newspapers
and magazines, the entire system will rise and fall on the effectiveness
of the ads. However, electronics promises a more total revolution in advertising
than in any other facet of the newspaper outside of printing. This change
comes none too soon. As shown by a general drop in margins from 30 percent
in the mid-1980s to close to 10 percent last year, newspapers are suffering
a sharp decline in conventional advertising revenues, only partly compensated
for by an influx of funds from blow-in coupons and inserts.<BR>
<BR>
In a 1988 prophecy at the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., Fidler
envisaged electronic newspanel ads in the year 2000: &quot;When you touch
most ads, they suddenly come alive. More importantly, advertisers can deliver
a variety of targeted messages that can be matched to each personal profile.
An airline ad offering discount fares to South America attracts me with
the haunting music of an Andean flute. I'm planning to take some vacation
time in Peru next month [Fidler's wife is a Peruvian recording artist],
so I touch the ad to get more information. Before I quit, I'll check the
ad indexes to see if any other airlines are offering discount fares. With
the built-in communicator, I can even make my reservations directly from
the tablet if I choose. The airline's reservation telephone number is embedded
in the ad, and my credit card numbers and other essential data are maintained
in the tablet, so all I would have to do is write in the dates and times
that I want to travel and touch a button on the screen. The information
is encrypted as well as voice-print protected, so there is no risk of someone
else placing orders with my tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the usual notion, the electronic newspaper will be a far more
effective advertising medium than current newspapers, television or home
shopping schemes. Rather than trying to trick the reader into watching the
ad, the newspaper will merely present the ad in a part of the paper frequented
by likely customers. Viewers who are seriously interested in the advertised
item can click on it and open up a more detailed presentation, or they can
advertise their own desire to buy a product of particular specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In deference to Fidler, who currently combs the world looking for the best
flat-panel screens, Fat Panel appears to be perusing a story on field emission
displays (FEDs). Even cathode ray tubes with VGA graphics command only 72
dots per inch of resolution. This has been shown to slow down reading by
some 25 percent compared with paper. Readers of Voyager Co.'s tomes on Mac
PowerBooks quickly discover that even Susan Faludi's breezy Backlash or
Michael Crichton's compulsive Jurassic Park or James Gleick's normally riveting
biography of Richard Feynman bog down in subtle but insidious typographical
fuzz. A newspaper with more than one item on the screen would be worse.
The age of electronic text entirely depends on the development of screens
with the definition of a laser printer. For this purpose, FEDs offer great
long-term promise.<BR>
<BR>
While the prevailing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) merely reflect or channel
light, FEDs emit light like a cathode ray tube. Indeed, as currently envisaged
by a Micron Display Technology process, FEDs will array millions of tiny
cathode light emitters that allow bright displays with high resolution and
full-motion video. Although today's FEDs require too much power for full
portability with current battery technology, they represent an inviting
option for newspaper tablets at the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Usable tablets, however, will arrive long before then. At the August Siggraph
show, Xerox demonstrated a 13-inch-diagonal liquid crystal display with
a record 6.3 million pixels, delivering 279 dots per inch of resolution.
The 279 dots per inch provide some three times more definition than the
screen of a Sun workstation_the current desktop graphics workhorse_and negligibly
short of the 300-dot resolution of a laser printer.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond resolution, the key to the newspaper tablet is portability. Portability
means low power. Active-matrix LCDs are inherently a high-power, low-transmissive
medium. The crystals absorb light; the polarizer wastes half the light;
the transistors at each pixel squander power. For high contrast, backlighting
is essential. That sinks another 20 to 30 watts. The higher the resolution,
the worse all these problems become.
<PRE>


<B>


Full-Motion Images Or Full-Motion Users?

</B></PRE>
According to the Fidler vision, the U.S. should stop emulating the Japanese,
who boldly invested some $12 billion in manufacturing capacity for power-hungry
liquid crystal displays used on notebook computers and flat-screen TVs.
Urged by the Clinton administration, this U.S. industrial policy is based
on a strategy of &quot;catch up and copy,&quot; and it will fail. Rather
than chase the Japanese by achieving high resolution at high power to compete
with cathode ray tubes, the U.S. should target high resolution at low power
to compete with paper.<BR>
<BR>
As in semiconductor electronics, the winners will follow a strategy of low
and slow. The law of the microcosm ordains exponential performance gains
from slower and lower-powered transistors packed ever closer together on
individual microchips. Throughout the history of semiconductors_from the
first transistor to the latest microprocessor_the industry has succeeded
by following this law: replacing faster and higher-powered components with
smaller, slower and lower-powered devices. When you pack enough of the slow
and low transistors close enough together, your system may end up operating
faster than a supercomputer based on the highest-powered and fastest discrete
transistors. And it will definitely be more efficient in MIPS per dollar.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm has not been suspended for displays. The Japanese
have been focusing on high-powered screens capable of reproducing the features
of low-end CRTs: full-motion color video. Rather than favoring full-motion
video, however, the U.S. should foster full-motion readers through low-
powered and slow components. It is the people rather than the pixels that
should be able to move. Speed will come in due course.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrating the first prototype of such a system is Zvi Yaniv of Advanced
Technology Incubator (ATI) of Farmington Hills, Mich. Long among the most
inventive figures in America's eternally embryonic flat-panel industry,
Yaniv was a founder of Optical Imaging Systems, currently the leading U.S.-based
producer, with well under one-percent global market share.<BR>
<BR>
For his tablet, Yaniv uses a material invented at Kent State University
in Ohio called Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Texture (PSCT). On it he inscribes
pixels in the form of helical liquid crystal devices. The helices are chemically
doped to give them a specific reflectivity: showing all wavelengths or colors
of light that do not match the resonant wavelengths in the helix.<BR>
<BR>
So far ATI has demonstrated images in black and white and in 16 levels of
gray scale. Color, according to Yaniv, poses no theoretical problems. Based
on current experimental successes, it will be achieved within the next two
years. For the first newspanels, however, color is less important than the
high-resolution text capability, which ATI delivers at a breakthrough price.<BR>
<BR>
This technology offers four key advantages over the active-matrix LCD: no
transistors, no polarizers, no color filters, no backlighting. Without these
power-and space-hungry features, Yaniv's screens can achieve higher density
of pixels at far lower energy use. This adds up to far higher resolution
at milliwatts of power (rather than 20 watts) and at far higher manufacturing
yields, and thus far lower cost. Yaniv predicts screens with laser-printer
resolution and with contrast higher than paper, costing between $1 and $2
per square inch (compared with around $10 for current active-matrix devices).
That means 8-1/2-by-11-inch tablets for $100 to $200 in manufacturing cost,
well under Fidler's target price.<BR>
<BR>
Still an R&D project in an intensely competitive industry, ATI may not have
all the answers, but it points the way to a solution. Within the next three
or four years, a portable tablet with laser-printer resolution and contrast
and with hundreds of megabytes of solid-state or hard disk memory will be
purchasable for an acceptable price. Fat Panel's tablet is not merely a
toy; it is the token of a technology that will sweep the world.

News On The Net

</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, precusor solutions are being rolled out on personal computers,
Newtons, Zoomers and other personal digital assistants. Already collecting
and transmitting copy in digital form, reporters and editors could just
as well provide digital content to all the other platforms that are emerging
in the 1990s, from tiny portable personal communications services to supercomputer
knowledge bases.<BR>
<BR>
Also empowering the newspaper industry will be the exploding new world of
boundless bandwidth or communications power in both the atmosphere and the
fibersphere (see Forbes ASAP, December 7, 1992, and March 29, 1993). One
of the most difficult concepts for many business planners to grasp is the
onset of bandwidth abundance: the idea that the electromagnetic spectrum
is not scarce but nearly limitless. The text of a daily newspaper takes
up about a megabyte; a hundred or so black-and-white photographs take up
about 100 megabytes; 25 color photos could run another 100 megabytes, or
even a gigabyte, depending on resolution. Video clips would take about 100
megabytes apiece. With just 500 megabytes, you could throw in the entire
&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summing it all up, the total bit-cost of a paper, including video-rich ads,
might be comparable to that of a two-hour movie_perhaps two gigabytes with
compression. Two gigabytes can be transmitted in a second down fiber-optic
lines, in perhaps 10 seconds down a gigahertz cable connection, and in perhaps
a matter of three or four minutes down a twisted-pair copper line equipped
with Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) technology, Amati Corp.'s
amazing new phone-company access system. From Digital Equipment Corp. and
Zenith to Hybrid Technologies and Continental Cablevision, several firms
are demonstrating impressive ways to use cable lines for two-way digital
data transmission at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more, which would
fill up a two-gigabyte newspanel in just over three minutes. Electrical
power companies also are laying fiber along with their power lines. All
these pipes are little used for long hours of the night and could be employed
to deliver newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Complementing this web of wires will be wireless methods of delivery. Cellular
technology is moving toward a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol
that allows use of the entire spectrum every mile or so, and toward millimeter
wave frequencies that offer gigahertz of capacity. Again, access to these
systems might be expensive on a demand basis, but a newspaper can be sent
whenever space or time is available. Delivery of the basic paper through
wires and fiber and delivery of short updates and extras via the air would
be optimal. Whatever electronic or photonic techniques are used, the laws
of the microcosm and telecosm ordain that distribution of newspapers will
become vastly cheaper, more efficient and more timely than their present
methods: trucks and bicycles.
<PRE>


<B>


The &quot;Domonetics&quot; Of The Word

</B></PRE>
The future of newspapers will not depend on technology alone, however. The
ultimate strength of the &quot;press&quot; comes not from its machinery
but from its &quot;domonetics&quot;_a word that describes an institution's
cultural sources and effects.<BR>
<BR>
Judeo-Christian scripture declares that in the beginning was the word. There
is no mention of the image. Today in information technology, the word still
widely prevails. In 1992, trade publications, newspapers and magazines alone
generated some $73 billion in sales, compared with television revenues of
$57 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In general, images are valuable as an enhancement to words. As Robert Lucky
of Bellcore has pointed out, images are not in themselves usually an efficient
mode of communication. In his definitive work &quot;Silicon Dreams,&quot;
just released in a new paperback edition, Lucky writes that after an evening
of television, &quot;we sink into bed, bloated with pictorial bits, starved
for information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
People who gush that a picture is worth a thousand words usually fail to
point out that it may well take a million computer &quot;words&quot; to
send or store it. Written words are a form of compression that has evolved
over thousands of years of civilization. In a multimedia encyclopedia, such
as Microsoft's Encarta, some 10,000 images take up 90 percent of the bits,
but supply perhaps one-100th of the information. With the pictures alone,
the encyclopedia is nearly worthless; with the words alone, you still have
a valuable encyclopedia. Most of the work and the worth are in the words.
Supremely the masters of words, newspapers can add cosmetic pictures, sounds
and video clips far more easily than TV or game machines can add reporting
depth, expertise, research and cogent opinion.<BR>
<BR>
More profoundly, the domonetics of the new technologies strongly favors
text-based communications. Video is most effective in conveying shocks and
sensations and appealing to prurient interests of large miscellaneous audiences.
Images easily excel in blasting through to the glandular substrates of the
human community; there's nothing like a body naked or bloody or both to
arrest the eye and forestall the TV zapper.<BR>
<BR>
TV news succeeds because of timeliness and vividness. Compared with TV imagery,
news photos tend to be late and lame. Nonetheless, for all its power and
influence, broadcast television news is a dead medium, awaiting early burial
by newspapers using new technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The TV news problem is summed up by the two-minute rule_the usual requirement
that, short of earthquake or war, no story take more than two minutes to
tell. This rule even applies to the epitome of broadcast news_CNN. It is
entirely a negative rule. The reason for it is not that the audience desires
no more than two minutes of coverage of stories of interest. On any matter
deeply interesting to the viewer, two minutes is much too little.<BR>
<BR>
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that the viewer will not tolerate
more than two minutes of an unwanted story. Its only function is to forestall
the zapper, but its effect is to frustrate any viewer with more than a superficial
interest in a story. Increasingly it reduces TV news to a kaleidoscope of
shocks and sensations, portents and propaganda, gossip and titillation.<BR>
<BR>
The new technologies, however, put individual customers in command. Making
their own first choices among scores of thousands of possibilities, individuals
eschew the hair-trigger poise of the channel surfer. Narrowcasting allows
appeal to the special interests and ambitions, the hobbies and curiosities,
the career pursuits and learning needs of particular individuals. Thus,
the new media open up domonetic vistas entirely missed by mass media.<BR>
<BR>
At the domonetic elevation of newspapers, images are supplementary, not
primary. The new technologies thus favor text over pure video because text_enhanced
by graphics where needed_is by far the best (and digitally most efficient)
way to convey most information and ideas. Where graphics are overwhelmingly
more efficient than alphanumerics_as in visualization of huge bodies of
data or statistics_the newspanel can supply true computer graphics and simulations.
Interactivity, after all, is the computer's forte.

The $700 Million Incentive

</B></PRE>
As early as 1981, Fidler saw and predicted that computer technology using
flat-panel screens would allow the newspaper business to eliminate much
of its centralized manufacturing and printing plant and much of its distribution
expenses, and deliver the product directly to the customer at half the cost.
He saw that this process would jeopardize neither the branded identity nor
the editing functions nor the essential character of the paper. The distribution
of intelligence would simply permit the customer rather than the newspaper
to supply the display and the printer. This microcosmic shift would drastically
simplify and improve the accessibility and worth of the information, enhancing
the value of newspaper archives and other resources. This step could theoretically
save Fidler's employer, Knight-Ridder, some $700 million, or between half
and two-thirds of its current costs.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler's vision is just as promising for magazines. In effect, his concept
allows newspapers to combine the best features of daily journalism with
the best qualities of specialty magazines. The front pages and shallower
levels of the system will still function like a streamlined newspaper, which
readers can browse, search and explore as they do a conventional paper without
thrashing about through the pages. The deeper levels will function like
magazines, focusing on business, technology, lifestyles, sports, religion
or art. Indeed, to exalt their offerings into an ever richer cornucopia,
news systems will want to collaborate with magazines, just as they often
distribute magazines today with their Sunday papers.
<PRE>

The Soul Of The New Medium

</B></PRE>
In addition, electronic magazines can excel newspapers in providing a sense
of community through interaction with other readers and authors in new kinds
of dynamic letters, bulletin boards and classified sections. In a sense,
the news panel never ends. Beyond its offering of news, articles and archives,
it opens into new dimensions of interactivity.<BR>
<BR>
As Stephen Case puts it: &quot;Everybody will become information providers
as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities
that marry information and communications_thereby creating an interactive,
participatory medium. This community aspect is crucial--it is the soul of
the new medium.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most practical current vessel for this expansion of the press is Case's
own company, America Online, a supplier of an icon-based interface and gateway
to scores of &quot;infobases&quot; and bulletin boards in Vienna, Va., outside
the District of Columbia. Ten percent owned by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
eight percent controlled by Apple, allied with Knight-Ridder and providing
access to such journals as the New Republic, National Geographic, Time and
Macworld, America Online has uniquely focused on the vital center of the
new market: the point of convergence of newspapers, magazines and computers
in new communities of interest and interaction.<BR>
<BR>
Following this strategy, America Online has invested just $20 million (one-100th
the capital of Prodigy) and devoted half the time, to achieve nearly one-third
the customer base and generate strong profits, in contrast to huge estimated
losses on the part of IBM and Sears. Prodigy is now paying AOL the high
tribute of imitation, making deals with Cox Enterprises Inc. and its 17
newspapers, and with Times-Mirror. Perhaps most audacious in pursuing this
vision, however, is Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., which recently purchased
Delphi Internet Services Corp., the only on-line service with full Internet
access to home PC users. Delphi already offers an array of news programs
and special-interest conferences, including a popular computer news show
led by moderator Jerry Pournelle that provides interactive dialogs on everything
from abstruse computer features to science fiction. Pournelle and some 300
other conference moderators can function like editors in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
Internet is the global agglomeration of data networks that has emerged from
the original Pentagon research network called ARPANET. Growing at some 15
percent a month for several years to a current level of 10 to 20 million
users, Internet has bifurcated into linked commercial and research nonprofit
divisions. As John Evans, president of News Corp.'s Electronic Data, puts
it, explaining the Delphi purchase: &quot;Internet is like a giant jellyfish.
You can't step on it. You can't go around it. You've got to go through it.&quot;
Delphi now plans to go through it using much quicker access systems, including
cable.<BR>
<BR>
Evans declares that these new collaborations between News Corp. and Internet
will &quot;put the 'me' back into media.&quot; His concept, also shared
by Nicholas Negroponte's Media Lab and Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator,
is an automated news database ultimately supplying the customer with a personal
paper filtered from floods of daily information by an agent programmed to
pursue your own interests. In Fidler's view, however, these digital papers
will succeed only to the extent that they transcend this vision of the Daily
Me.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler prefers the vision of a Daily Us, shaped by human editors rather
than by electronic agents or filters. According to Fidler, the law of the
microcosm will put so much intelligence and storage in the tablet that the
individual can personalize the &quot;paper&quot; every day in a different
way. If, as Case puts it, the soul of the new medium is community, the reader
will want to begin in a particular context, a specially favored &quot;place&quot;
in the world of information, a place with a brand name and identity: a newspaper.

The Computer Imperative

</B></PRE>
Above all, the key to the special advantage of newspapers in the new era
is their great good fortune in being forced to focus on computers. It should
be evident by now to everyone in the information business that the energy,
the creativity, the drive, the gusto, the pulse, the catalyst of this industry
is computers. The magic is in the microcosm of solid-state electronics (doubling
the density of components on a chip every 18 months) and in the concentric
circles of enterprise and invention that surge outward from this creative
core: the some 5,000 software firms, the thousands of manufacturers of chips,
peripherals, printed circuit boards and add-on cards; the double-digit annual
expansion in the armies of computer scientists and software engineers; the
ever growing millions of PC owners devoting their creative energies and
passions to this intoxicating machine.<BR>
<BR>
What the Model T was to the industrial era-the teenage training board, the
tinkerer's love and laboratory, the technological epitome-the PC is to the
Information Age. Just as people who rode the wave of automobile technology-from
tiremakers to fast-food franchisers-prevailed in the industrial era, so
the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer
community will predominate in the information era.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, are so many apparently ambitious and visionary executives shrinking
from the central arena to play around on the fringes with TVs and game machines?
Why are American computer executives standing silently aside while the so-called
U.S. Grand Alliance for the Future of Advanced Television, so-called digital
HDTV, adopts an interlaced screen technology that is fundamentally hostile
to computers?<BR>
<BR>
For images, the human eye cannot tell the difference between interlaced
and progressively scanned displays. But interlace poses endless problems
for text and multimedia. Apart from Zenith, the American leaders in the
Grand Alliance are AT&amp;T, General Instrument Corp., MIT, Sarnoff Laboratories
and GE-NBC. All but MIT capitulated to pressure from foreign TV interests
such as Sony, Thomson Corp. and Philips Electronics to betray the American
computer and newspaper industries by adopting a display scheme unsuited
for the multimedia and text programs central to the next computer revolution.<BR>
<BR>
Without text and multimedia capabilities, high-resolution images can open
virtually no markets not already served by current &quot;digitally enhanced&quot;
improved-definition television displays. Limiting the teleconferencing market,
for example, is not the resolution of the screens but the bandwidth of the
network. Without computer capabilities, digital TV is likely to be a large
disappointment.<BR>
<BR>
Claiming to set a standard that can survive deep into the next century,
the Grand Alliance is focusing on short-term economies for manufacturing
TVs tomorrow. These executives are all missing the point and the promise
of the era in which they live. The Information Age is not chiefly about
kicks and thrills, offering games for kids and so-called dildonics for &quot;adults.&quot;
Markets for educational programs and on-line information services are already
growing much faster than game markets. In 1992 in the computer business,
according to the Software Publishers Association, entertainment software
revenues rose some 29 percent to a level of $342 million. Educational software
for the home rose some 47 percent to $146 million. Meanwhile, sales of computers
with modems are rising at about 1,000 percent a year, hugely faster than
the sales of TVs. Online services like America Online and Prodigy have been
growing almost 500 percent per year since 1988. According to current projections
based on microprocessor CPU sales, some 50 million PCs may be sold over
the next 12 months, and perhaps three-quarters of them will contain either
on-board modems or networking systems.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate reason that the newspapers will prevail in the Information
Age is that they are better than anyone else at collecting, editing, filtering
and presenting real information, and they are allying with the computer
juggernaut to do it. The newspapers are pursuing the fastest expanding current
markets rather than rearview markets. They are targeting adults with real
interests and ambitions that generate buying power rather than distracting
children from more edifying pursuits. In the computer age, follow the microcosm
and you will find the money, too.

</H3>
The world of networks breaks into two polar paradigms. Most familiar is
the Public Switched Telephone Network. From the tiniest transistor flip-flop
on a modem chip through labyrinthine layers of rising complexity on up to
a 4ESS supercomputer switch linking 107,520 telephone trunk lines (itself
consisting of millions of interconnected transistors), the public network
is a vast, deterministic web of wires and switches. Once you are connected
in the public network, your message is guaranteed to get through.<BR>
<BR>
In the public network, bandwidth constantly expands as you rise in the hierarchy.
At the bottom are the twisted-pair copper wires of your telephone that function
at four kilohertz (thousands of cycles per second). At the top are fiber-optic
trunk lines that function at rates close to the 2.9-gigahertz speeds of
the electronic transistors that feed the glass wires. In The Geodesic Network,
writer Peter Huber has described the five tiers of the telephone switching
system as a structure with &quot;the solidity, permanence and inflexibility
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, which on paper it resembled.&quot; Although
the pyramid has suffered erosion and change in recent years, it remains
mostly in place today: the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
That is one network paradigm. The other paradigm is Robert Metcalfe's. It
germinated in his mind in 1970 as he read a paper by Norman Abramson of
the University of Hawaii given at a computer conference that year. Abramson
told of another paradigm. He called it Aloha. With Aloha, there were no
guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
AlohaNet was a packet radio system used for data communications among the
Hawaiian Islands. Packets are collections of bits led by a header, which
is a smaller collection of bits, bearing an address; they proceed through
a communications system rather like envelopes through a postal system. The
key feature of AlohaNet was that anyone could send packets to anyone else
at any time. You just began transmitting. If you didn't get an acknowledgment
back, you knew the message had failed to get through. Presumably your packets
had collided with others. In Metcalfe's words, &quot;They were lost in the
ether.&quot; At that point, you would simply wait a random period (to avoid
a repeat collision as both parties returned to the channel at once). Then
you would retransmit your message.<BR>
<BR>
To Metcalfe, AlohaNet seemed a beautifully simple network. But Abramson
showed that, because of collisions and other problems, it could exploit
only 17 percent of its potential capacity. A student of computer science
searching for thesis ideas, Metcalfe believed that by using a form of advanced
mathematics called queuing theory he could drastically improve the performance
of AlohaNet without damaging its essential elegance and simplicity. What
Metcalfe, then a graduate student at Harvard, eventually discovered would
bring such networks up toward 90 percent of capacity and make the Aloha
concept a serious threat to the entire structure of the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's discovery is known as Ethernet. Twenty years later, Ethernet
is the world's dominant local area network and, at 47, Metcalfe is known
and celebrated as its inventor. He was also founder in 1981 of 3Com Corp.
of Santa Clara, Calif., the leading producer of Ethernet adapter cards and
a major communications products company. In this era of networking, he is
the author of what I will call Metcalfe's law of the telecosm, showing the
magic of interconnections: connect any number, &quot;n,&quot; of machines
- whether computers, phones or even cars - and you get &quot;n&quot; squared
potential value. Think of phones without networks or cars without roads.
Conversely, imagine the benefits of linking up tens of millions of computers
and sense the exponential power of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the power of the telecosm reproduces on a larger scale - by interconnecting
computers - the exponential yield of the microcosm, a law describing the
near magical effect of interconnecting transistors on chips of silicon:
As increasing numbers of transistors are packed ever closer together, the
transistors run faster, cooler, cheaper and better. Metcalfe's law suggests
that a similar spiral of gains is available in the telecosm of computer
communications.<BR>
<BR>
Already the world economy is beginning to reap these gains. Ethernet now
links more than half of the world's 40 million networked computers, extending
Metcalfe's paradigm and his law. Indeed, the law would suggest that in addition
to his some $20 million of personal net worth from 3Com, Metcalfe's concept
has fostered scores of billions of dollars in global wealth. Led by Novell
Inc., with an equity capitalization of more than $8 billion, the top 15
publicly traded computer networking companies have a total market value
of some $22 billion. Add to that sum the productivity value derived from
the world's 100 million computers as they are increasingly linked in networks,
and you may sense the power of the Metcalfe paradigm.<BR>
<BR>
Today, 20 years after Metcalfe conceived it at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, Ethernet is still gathering momentum, gaining market share and generating
innovations. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of America's computers
on LANs rose from less than 10 to more than 60, and most of these gains
were in Ethernets.

Ether Moves to Cable
</B></PRE>
The telecosm's powers could end up saving the American economy from itself.
In an era when the new payroll taxes and regulations of Clintonomics could
end up driving millions of mind workers back into their homes, Digital Equipment
Corp. is now extending Ethernet's range from its current two-mile limit
to some 70 miles. Called Channelworks, the DEC system can run Ethernet on
the some 50 million miles of cable television coax. This will enable potential
scores of millions of telecommuters to access their familiar office LAN,
tap their company E-mail and their corporate databases, and generally make
themselves feel at work while at home. Deployed at a profit and extended
to customers at a flat monthly rate, Ethernet in the neighborhood could
become a massive growth business for the cable industry over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
As Ethernet spreads and faces the challenge of remote work teams using digital
images, simulations, maps, computer-assisted design schematics, visualizations,
high-fidelity sounds and other exotic forms of data, the system is constantly
adapting. From 3Com spin-offs Grand Junction Networks and LAN Media Corp.
to smart hubmaker David Systems, from Kalpana to Synernetics, from National
Semiconductor to Hewlett Packard, from Cabletron to SynOptics, from AT&T even
to Token Ring leader IBM, scores of companies are pushing Ethernet into
new functions and performance levels. It is emerging in full-duplex, multimedia,
fast, fiber- optic, shielded, unshielded, twisted, thin, thick, hubbed,
collapsed, vertebrate, invertebrate, baseband, broadband, pair, quartet,
coaxial and wireless versions. It now can run at 2.9, 10, 20 and 100 megabits
per second. It has moved from 2.9 megabits per second to 100 megabits per
second and from a few hundred to several million users in some 10 years.
At its present pace of progress, Ethernet will someday run isochronous (real-time)
gigabits per second on linguine.

Aloha ATM, Gushing Cash
</B></PRE>
So why is its boyish-looking inventor - over Metcalfe's anguished protests,
think of Ted Kennedy some 10 years ago - giving up on his baby just as it
enters its roaring 20s? Why is he ready to abandon his basic paradigm in
favor of a return to the public network vision of massive, intelligent switching
systems? Why is he now talking of Ethernet as a &quot;legacy LAN&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Discoursing this summer from a deck chair on his yacht (a converted lobster
boat) as he breezed down from his Maine retreat to a dock on the Charles
River for his 25th MIT reunion, Metcalfe has the air of an elder statesman.
Though humbly grateful for the benisons of Ethernet, he has seen the future
in a poll of experts prophesying the universal triumph of a powerful new
switching system called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). &quot;I have found,&quot;
Metcalfe solemnly intones, &quot;an amazing consensus among both telephone
industry and computer networking experts that ATM is the future of LANs.&quot;
Aloha, ATM.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe is not alone among Ethernet pioneers flocking back to Ma Bell's
pyramid of switches. Also leaving Ethernet behind is his onetime nemesis,
Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA, a leading guru of gigabit networks who helped
define the mathematical limits of Ethernet, and is given credit (or is it
blame?) for naming its Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
protocol (CSMA/CD). Preparing to defect to ATM is Ronald Schmidt, the brilliantly
ebullient technical director of SynOptics, who created the latest Ethernet
rage - sending the signals over telephone wire under the 10baseT standard
(10 megabits of baseband data over twisted pair).<BR>
<BR>
There has not been such a stampede to a new standard since the global rush
to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the early 1980s. Offering
digital phone lines at 144 kilobits per second, ISDN is just now coming
on-line in time to be aced by the megabits per second of Ethernet over cable.<BR>
<BR>
In a prophetic memo launching the concept in 1973, Metcalfe foreshadowed
the secret of Ethernet's success. He wrote: &quot;While we may end up using
coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise
to talk in terms of an ether, rather than `the cable'.... Who knows what
other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network: maybe
radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring, or frequency-multiplexed cable
TV or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof. The essential
feature of our medium - the ether - is that it carries transmissions, propagates
bits to all stations.&quot; In other words, it is the stations, rather than
the network, that have to sort out and &quot;switch&quot; the messages.<BR>
<BR>
The word Ethernet may be capitalized to signify the official standard of
CSMA/CD. Or it may be lowercased to suggest a medium without switches, routers
and other intelligence. In either case, the word &quot;ether&quot; conveys
the essence of the ethernet. An ether is a passive, omnipresent, homogeneous
medium. Long believed essential for the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
the literal existence of an ether was disproven in the late 19th century
by the famous experiments of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. But the
concept of a figurative ether - a dumb medium of propagation - survives
in modern communications.<BR>
<BR>
The enduring magic of ethernets stems from the law of the microcosm, favoring
distributed terminals over centralized hierarchies, peer networks of PCs
over mainframe pyramids. The microcosm's relentless price/performance gains
on chips have endowed Metcalfe's peer-to-peer scheme with ever more powerful
peers, at ever lower prices. Medium-independent from the outset, the Metcalfe
systems do not require central switching. In an ethernet system the intelligence
is entirely in the terminals, not in the network itself, and most of the
bandwidth is local (where some 80 percent of traffic resides).<BR>
<BR>
Although this ATM is expected to gush jackpots of cash for gaggles of network
companies and investors, it is unrelated to its acronymic twin, automatic
teller machines. Think of ATM rather as an automated postal center that
takes messages (of any size or addressing scheme), chops them up, puts them
into standardized little envelopes and figures the best routes to their
destinations in billionths of a second. The magic of ATM comes from restricting
its services to those uniform envelopes (called cells) of 53 bytes apiece
(including a five-byte address) and creating for each envelope what is called
a virtual circuit through the network. These features make it unnecessary
for intermediate switches in the network to check the address; the cell
flashes through the system on a precomputed course.<BR>
<BR>
A compromise defined by phone companies as the longest packet size that
can handle voice in real time, 53-byte cells are also short enough to be
entirely routed and switched in cheap hardware; i.e., microchips. This means
that the ATM postal center can function at speeds of up to 155 megabits
per second or even higher. Perhaps most attractive of all, ATM can handle
multimedia data, such as digital movies or teleconferences, with voice,
text and video that must arrive together at the same time in perfect sync.
As the world moves toward multimedia, the industry is flocking toward ATM,
the innovation that can make it possible. 
<PRE><B>


Ethernet: A Legacy LAN?
</B></PRE>
By contrast, Ethernet seems old and slow: the vacuum tube of computer communications.
Think of it, crudely, as a system where all the messages are cast into the
ocean and picked up by terminals on the beach which scan the tides for letters
addressed to them. Obviously, this system would work only if the beach terminals
could suck up and filter tremendous quantities of sea water. The magic of
ethernet comes from the ever growing power of computer terminals. The microcosm
supplies sufficiently powerful filtering chips - chiefly digital signal
processors improving their powers some tenfold every two years - to sort
mail and messages in the vasty deep. This is quite a trick. To the experts,
it seems unlikely to prevail for long against the fabulously swift switching
of ATM.<BR>
<BR>
True, there is some confusion about just how, where and when this miracle
cure will arrive. The industry's leading intellectual, Robert Lucky of Bellcore
- a paragon of long- distance networks - predicts that ATM will come first
in local area networks, while Metcalfe, of local area network fame, thinks
it will come first in wide area networks. James Chiddix of Time- Warner
Cable is probably right in predicting digital cable pay- per-view as the
first big ATM customer, using it for broadcasting films in his 500-channel
digital cable TV project in Orlando. But most experts agree that one way
or another ATM will blow away Ethernet during the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as usual, conventional wisdom is wrong. Ethernet is quietly
preparing for a new era of hegemony in the marketplace for computer connections.<BR>
<BR>
The reason Ethernet prevailed in the first place is that, in the words of
Ronald Schmidt, &quot;it was incredibly simple and elegant and robust.&quot;
In other words, it is cheap and simple for the user. Customers can preserve
their installed base of equipment while the network companies innovate with
new transmission media. When the network moves to new kinds of copper wires
or from one mode of fiber optics to another, Ethernet still looks essentially
the same to the computers attached to it. Most of the processing - connecting
the user to the network, sensing a carrier frequency on the wire and detecting
collisions - can be done on one Ethernet controller chip that costs a few
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe described the conception of this technology in 1981, &quot;I
explored the advantages of moving the transceiver down out of the ceiling
onto the adapter board in the host computer. I had seen many actual Ethernet
installations in which our brick transceivers were not up in the ceiling
tapping into the ether cable, as they were supposed to be...but instead
were on floors behind computers, dropped in the centers of neatly coiled
transceiver cables.... We were discovering that the people buying personal
computers and workstations in those days were not generally the same kind
of people who were allowed to remove ceiling tiles and string cables through
conduits.... The personal computer revolution was taking place in organizations
from the bottom up.... It was time for Ethernet to be re- invented for bottom-up
proliferation among the personal computer work group revolutionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using &quot;silicon compiler&quot; design tools to radically reduce the
time to market, Seeq Technology created an Ethernet chip for PCs in time
for a single-board version of the interface unit. Putting the transceiver
on the adapter board eliminated a special transceiver cable and drastically
simplified the system. There is no bulky connection between the coding device
preparing information for the network and the transceiver sending or receiving
the signals on the net. All this processing is done in the computer, on
one printed circuit board, now reduced to the size of a credit card. While
its rival from IBM - Token Ring - requires a mostly proprietary array of
token-passing managers, clocking assignments and other complexities, Ethernet
is an open system. Relative to the alternatives, it offers the possibility
of something near plug-and-play. So advantaged, Ethernet has overcome IBM's
Token Ring, 20 million nodes to 8 million in installed base.<BR>
<BR>
But this does not persuade Ethernet pioneers Bob Metcalfe, Leonard Kleinrock
and Ronald Schmidt. Because ATM can handle all kinds of data fast, Metcalfe
sees it as the &quot;grand unifier&quot; bringing together WANs and LANs
and effecting a convergence of television, telephony and computing in turbulent
multimedia bit streams bursting into our lives early next century. &quot;And
of all the variations of multimedia,&quot; he writes in Infoworld - Metcalfe
is now its publisher - &quot;the one that will drive ATM is personal computer
video conferencing - interactive, two-way, real-time, integrated digital
voice, video and data.&quot; Although Ethernet will persist as a &quot;legacy
LAN,&quot; he says, it cannot compete with ATM in these crucial new roles.
Schmidt makes the same essential case, stressing the need for switch-based
architectures in a world of exotic new media.

Kleinrock's Formula
</B></PRE>
Why the pessimism on Ethernet? Bringing mathematics to bear on the argument,
Kleinrock declares that the collision-detecting functions of Ethernet bog
down with large bandwidths, short packets and long distances. Thus, the
system must fail with the onset of fiber highways across the land. The oceans
of Ethernet will simply grow too large to allow efficient detection of collisions
in its depths. With large bandwidths, more packets can be pumped into the
wire or glass before a collision is detected; by that time, most of the
transmission is finished. When the distances get too long, collisions can
occur far from the transmitting computer and take longer to be detected.
The shorter the packets, the worse these problems become.<BR>
<BR>
As Kleinrock computes these factors, the efficiency of Ethernet is roughly
a function (a), computed as five times the length of the line in kilometers
times the capacity of the system in megabits per second, divided by the
packet size in bits. When a exceeds a certain level (Kleinrock sets it at
0.05), Ethernet's efficiency plummets.<BR>
<BR>
With ATM packet sizes needed for voice traffic - or even at the minimum
Ethernet packet size of 72 bytes - any Ethernet with a capacity much higher
than 10 megabits per second exceeds this tipping point. Therefore, high-speed
Ethernets must either use packets too long for voice or shrink in extent
to far less than three kilometers. This is what Howard Charney's Grand Junction
and its rival LAN Media propose with Fast Ethernet. Noticing that 10baseT
hubs have reduced the length of Ethernet connections by a factor of 10,
Ron Crane, founder of LAN Media, suggests that this change allows acceleration
of the system by an equal amount: to 100 megabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
But this seems a one-time fix that fails to address the multigigabit world
of fiber optics. At some point, Kleinrock, Schmidt and Metcalfe agree, ad
hoc fixes will begin to fail and ATM (or possibly some other system) will
begin to prevail. Using Kleinrock's formula, that point is here today, with
100-megabit- per-second Ethernet lines.<BR>
<BR>
As an increasing share of network traffic takes the form of pictures, sounds,
simulations, three-dimensional visualizations, collaborative work sessions,
video teleconferences and high- resolution medical images, the Ethernet
model already seems to be foundering, according to many expert projections.
The triumph of ATM, so it would seem, is just a matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
Time, however, is precisely what is absent from all these projections. Ethernet
is a system based on the intelligence of terminals; ATM is a system based
on the intelligence of switches and networks. All the arguments for ATM
miss the law of the microcosm: the near annual doubling of chip densities,
the spiraling increase of computer power surging on the fringes of all networks
as transistor sizes plummet over the next decade. 
<PRE>
<B>

The Power of Exponents
</B></PRE>
Amazingly, most technology prophets fail to come to terms with the power
of exponents. You double anything annually for long - whether deforestation
in ecological nightmares or transistors on silicon in the awesome routine
of microchip progress - and you soon can ignite a sudden moment of metamorphosis:
a denuded world or a silicon brain.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the year 2000, semiconductor companies will begin manufacturing
microchips with more than a billion transistors on them - first as memories,
and soon after as processors. A billion transistors could accommodate the
central processing units of 1,000 Sun workstations or 16 Cray supercomputers.
This means roughly a millionfold rise in the cost-effectiveness of computing
hardware over the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Intelligence in terminals is a substitute for intelligence in networks;
switching and routing functions migrate from the center of the web to the
increasingly powerful computers on its fringe. Looming intelligence on the
edge of the network will relieve all the current problems attributed to
ethernets and will render the neatly calculated optimizations of ATM irrelevant.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the law of the telecosm is launching a similar spiral of performance
in transmission media, ultimately increasing their bandwidth, also by a
factor of millions. Bandwidth is a replacement for switches. If you can
put enough detailed addressing, routing, prioritization and other information
on the packets, you don't have to worry about channeling the data through
ATM switches. The emergence of dumb, passive all-optical networks with bandwidths
some ten- thousandfold larger than existing fiber optics will obviate much
of the pressure on switches. Combining microcosm and telecosm in explosive
convergence makes it nothing short of ridiculous to expect a system optimized
for 1995 chip densities and fiber capacities to remain optimal in 2013,
when Metcalfe foresees the final triumph of ATM, or even in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, ATM will be useful in various applications before then. Sun and
SynOptics envisage putting ATM ports in future workstations where ISDN ports
mostly languish today. AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Wiltel will incorporate
ATM switches in their long- distance networks. Time-Warner may indeed use
them for distributing movies. In general, however, companies that rely on
an apparent trend toward centralized switches will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Cable firms will do better by sticking to the ethernet paradigm of dumb
bandwidth that has made them the envy of all in the emerging era of digital
video. IBM and other computer firms with powerful ethernet and fiber technologies
should not rush to adopt the public network paradigm. Telephone companies
in particular should maintain an acute interest in their ongoing experiments
with all-optical networks and other passive optical technologies. Any near-term
successes of ATM, afflicted with the many glitches and growing pains of
any new technology, are likely to come too slowly to deflect the continuing
onrush of ethernets.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet prevails because it is dumb. In the old world of dumb terminals
- whether phones, IBM displays or boob tubes - a network had to be smart.
There was time even to put human operators into the loop, and a need to
concentrate programming at one central location. But in the emerging world
of supercomputers in your pocket or living room, networks will have to be
dumb bandwidth pipes. What the coming array of desktop supercomputers and
cheap massively parallel servers will need is passive dark fiber, mostly
unlit by switching intelligence. Dark fiber can allow for the huge variety
of data forms and functions, protocols and modulation schemes that is emerging
in the new era of convergence between phones and computers.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet is the protocol for a dumb pipe, a passive ether. That is why it
fits so well on a cable TV line and why it will fit even into the multigigabit
world of a multimedia future. 
<PRE><B>


The Return of Aloha
</B></PRE>
The dumb networks of the fibersphere will be ethernets. These all-optical
links that have been made possible by the creation of erbium-doped amplifiers
and other passive devices give access to the full 25,000-gigahertz bandwidth
of fiber optics (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; December 7, 1992).
In these networks, fiber changes from a substitute for copper to a substitute
for air. Just as the microcosm put entire computer systems on single slivers
of silicon, the telecosm will put entire communications systems on seamless
webs of silica. Terminals will tune into the infrared colors of the fibersphere
like radios tuning into the frequencies of AM or FM.<BR>
<BR>
As chips and fiber are hugely expanding their performance and bandwidth,
information traffic is rapidly migrating from the wires to the air. Although
many experts contend that the radio frequencies in the air - the electromagnetic
spectrum - are running out, communications systems now use only a tiny sliver
of spectrum, well under one percent of the usable span. As shown by Cellular
Vision's success in sending cable TV signals over the air at 28 gigahertz,
it is now possible to move up the spectrum into the vast domains of microwaves;
other experiments show that network traffic in these portions of the spectrum
can be accommodated with error rates of less than one in a billion, enough
to avoid extensive error correcting.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the replacement of today's 30-mile cells with tomorrow's
closely packed microcells means an exponential rise in available spectrum
and an exponential reduction in power usage. The replacement of analog systems
with digital systems using code division multiple access (CDMA) will allow
the reuse of all frequencies in every cell, thus further expanding available
spectrum (see &quot;New Rules of Wireless,&quot; March 29, 1993). A company
called ArrayCom in Santa Clara, Calif., is developing a new system, called
spatial division multiple access (SDMA), based on smart antennas that can
follow an individual communicator as it moves through a cell. This technology
would allow the use of all the available spectrum by each &quot;phone.&quot;
<PRE>
<B>

Back to the Real &quot;Ether&quot; Net
</B></PRE>
Inspired by a radio network, ethernet is well adapted for this new world
of wireless. The increasing movement of data communications into the air
- the real ether - will give new life to Metcalfe's media-independent system.
Cellular systems already operate with protocols similar to CSMA/CD. As microcells
fill up with digital wireless traffic, all networks will increasingly resemble
the most popular computer networks. In the ether, links will resemble ethernets
far more than ATMs.<BR>
<BR>
The coming age of bandwidth abundance in glass and in air converges with
an era of supercomputer powers in the sand of microchips. We should build
our systems of the future - the cathedrals of the Information Age - on this
foundation of sand. It will not disappoint us.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in glass or in air, the basic protection of Ethernet is not smarts
but statistics. Ethernet is a probabilistic system. This fact has caused
endless confusion. Because a probabilistic system cannot guarantee delivery
of data on a specific schedule, or at all, many experts have concluded that
Ethernet is unsuited for critical functions, or for isochronous data inherent
in multimedia - with voice and video that must arrive in real time. When
and whether anything arrives is a stochastic matter.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, if there is enough bandwidth for the application, ethernets
work just as reliably and well as their deterministic rivals, even for advanced
video traffic. As Kleinrock observes, for many image applications, very
long packets can be as effective as very short ones. The long packets become
a virtual circuit connection, somewhat like a phone call. It is likely that
perhaps 80 percent of all multimedia will be sent in burst mode, with a
store-and-forward protocol, rather than isochronously in real time. Broadband
ethernets will be better for burst mode than ATM's short packets.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, the combination of intelligence at the terminals and statistics
in the network is more robust than the mechanistic reliability of Token
Rings or ATM switches. As Metcalfe points out in explaining the triumph
of his vision over Token Ring, Ethernet is a simple system that is stabilized
by its own failures. The CSMA/CD algorithm uses collision detection in a
negative feedback loop that delays retransmission in exponential proportion
to the number of collisions, which is a reliable index of the level of traffic.
Thus thriving on a worst- case assumption of frequent failure, Ethernet
has outpaced all rivals that guarantee perfect performance and depend on
it. 
<PRE><B>


Metcalfe's Law: Transcending His Own Doubts
</B></PRE>
Now, in ATM, Ethernet is faced with a new paragon of determinism offering
high speeds and rigorous guarantees, a new version of the public network
paradigm, a new pyramid of switching power. But Metcalfe's law and legacy
may well win again, in spite of his own defection.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe explains, &quot;Ethernet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;
The same could be said of all the devices of the microcosm and telecosm.
Both of the supreme sciences that sustain computer and communications technology
- quantum theory and information theory - are based on probabilistic rather
than deterministic models. They offer the underpinnings for an age of individual
freedom and entrepreneurial creativity.<BR>
<BR>
Humankind's constant search for deterministic assurance defies the ascendant
science of the era, which finds nature itself as probabilistic. To Einstein's
disappointment, God apparently does throw dice. But chance is the measure
of human ignorance and the mark of divine knowledge. Chance thus is the
paradoxical root of both fate and freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Nations and networks can win by shunning determinism and finding stability
in a constant shuffle of collisions and contentions in ever expanding arenas
of liberty.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an acceptance of setbacks, capitalist markets are more robust
than socialist systems that plan for perfection. In the same way, successful
people and companies have more failures than failures do. The successes
use their faults and collisions as sources of new knowledge. Companies that
try to banish chance by relying on market research and focus groups do less
well than companies that freely make mistakes and learn from them.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an ability to absorb shocks, stochastic systems in general are
more stable than deterministic ones. Listening to the technology, we find
that ethernets resonate to the deepest hymns and harmonies of our age.

The following article, ISSAQUAH MIRACLE, was first published in Forbes ASAP,
June 7, 1993.</H5>

</H3>
<HR>In the spring of 1989 when Michael Bookey first visited the Middle School
in Issaquah, Wash., to help the school system with its computers, he was
reminded of his early ventures into Communist China. After 20 years of working
with computer networks, to enter Issaquah seemed to me like encountering
an exotic tribe of primitives untouched by the modern world.<BR>
<BR>
The only sign of modern technology was a forlorn computer room full of Radio
Shack TRS-80 machines, most of which had broken down. Then he learned that
as a remedy for this problem, the district had recently voted a levy of
$2.7 million for outlays on high technology.<BR>
<BR>
Lacking any better ideas, the school system had decided to distribute the
money equally among the teachers, to spend as they wanted. What they wanted
turned out to be VCRs, incompatible CD- ROM drives and a random selection
of computers, printers and other gear to be scattered through the schools
under the influence of a flock of computer salespeople attracted to the
site by the pool of mandated money.<BR>
<BR>
To Bookey, this remedy seemed worse than the disease. It meant that the
bulk of the money would be wasted, further estranging both taxpayers and
students from the most powerful technologies of their era. Bookey wanted
school officials to know that the most powerful technology is not computers,
but computers joined in networks.<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the magic of networks, Bookey asks you to imagine a car plumped
down in the jungle. Checking it out, you might find it a very useful piece
of equipment indeed. A multipurpose wonder, it would supply lights, bedding,
radio communications, tape player, heat, air conditioning, a shield against
arrows and bullets, and a loud horn to frighten away fierce animals. In
awe of the features of this machine, you might never realize that the real
magic of a car comes in conjunction with asphalt.<BR>
<BR>
For the first 10 years of the personal computer era, according to Bookey,
we have used our computers like cars in the jungle. We have plumbed their
powers for processing words and numbers. All too often, home computers have
ended up in the closet unused. We have often failed to recognize that most
of the magic of computing stems from the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, the interconnections come on individual chips, as ever
smaller transistors crammed ever closer together work faster, cooler and
cheaper, enhancing both the capability and the speed of the processor. The
microcosm strewed some 100 million personal computers around the world and
endowed individuals at workstations with the creative power of factory owners
of the Industrial Age.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the microcosm generates exponential gains from increasing connections
on chips, the telecosm generates exponential gains by increasing connections
between chips, powerful microcomputers in themselves. These links between
increasingly potent microchips will soon dominate the world of communications.<BR>
<BR>
The networking industry therefore faces a drastic transition from a people-to-people
regime to computer-to-computer. This change is so radical that it resembles
a mutation that creates a new species. People communicate in domains of
time and space entirely alien to the world of computers. To a person, a
one- second delay on a voice line seems hardly noticeable; to a computer,
one second may mean a billion computations that would take hundreds of human
lifetimes to accomplish by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, people can transmit or receive only a small stream of information
at a time. They want relatively narrow bandwidth connections for a relatively
long period, a 64-kilobit- per-second voice link, for example, for a 10-minute
phone call.<BR>
<BR>
Computers, on the other hand, can handle hundreds of millions or even billions
of bits a second. They often need many millions of bits of bandwidth for
a short time fractions of seconds. As industry shifts from a human scale
of time and space to a computer scale, the systems and structures in existing
telephone and broadcast networks become almost irrelevant. Essentially,
all other forms of networks: voice, text, video and sound, are rapidly giving
way to various new forms of multimedia computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Driving this overwhelming force of change is the alchemy of interconnections,
working in the telecosm with the same logic and feedback loops as connections
in the microcosm. hile dumb terminals such as phones and TVs use up bandwidth
without giving anything back, computers are contributors to bandwidth, not
consumers of it.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the more computers, the more bandwidth. Not only is the network
a resource for each new computer attached to it, but each new computer is
also a resource for the network. Each new computer expands the potential
switching and processing capacity of the system by a large multiple of the
increasing demands it makes on other switches and processors.<BR>
<BR>
As ever more powerful computers are linked ever more closely, whether in
digital cellular microcells or in webs of fiber and coaxial cable, usable
bandwidth expands explosively. Governing the expansion of networks, the
law of the telecosm is just as potent as the law of the microcosm. Indeed,
in enhancing the productivity of organizations, the telecosm consummates
the microcosmic miracle.

Microsoft Windows for Jungle Cars</B></PRE>
The creator in the early 1970s of what may have been the world's first fully
functioning system of corporate electronic mail, Bookey was quick to foresee
this radical shift from person- to-person to computer-to-computer communications.
Pursuing his vision of networks, Bookey in 1982 spurned a possible job at
Microsoft on the grounds that the company was outfitting cars for the jungle,
a decision that probably cost him several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he joined Seafirst Bank in Seattle, where he made history (in the
form of a reference in John Sculley's autobiography, Odyssey) by pushing
the purchase of a thousand Macintosh computers for bank networks at a crucial
time for Apple.<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 Bookey left the bank to join Doelz Co., a startup in Irvine, Calif.,
that built advanced computer network equipment that he had used at Seafirst.
For Doelz, Bookey designed software and spearheaded marketing. A so-called
cell-based network, the Doelz system broke up a stream of data into short,
equal-sized packets, each with its own address, to be sent through the nodes
of the net in nanoseconds, like letters accelerated a trillionfold through
the branches of the post office.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey was not necessarily wrong in choosing this technology over Microsoft's.
In the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems, this essential
approach, based on short, uniform packets that can be switched at gigabit
speeds in hardware, is now the rage of planners in the computer networking
industry.<BR>
<BR>
ATM is seen as the crucial enabler for digital networks combining voice,
data and video in so-called multimedia applications. Bill Gates now calls
multimedia the future of his industry. Although many observers still see
ATM as a futuristic technology, Bookey believes its future is nearly now.
From the humblest personal digital phone to the most advanced supercomputer,
computer-to-computer links will dominate the entire universe of telecommunications,
and ATM will dominate network switching.<BR>
<BR>
Doelz, however, was ahead of its time and failed to survive a tangled legal
imbroglio with AT&T in 1988. So Bookey took a big profit on his California
residence and returned with his wife Robin and daughter Erin to Seattle,
where he had grown up and set records in the mile on the track at the University
of Washington. He bought his dream house on the top of Cougar Mountain in
Issaquah, with a view of the very Twin Peaks made famous in the television
series and put out his shingle as a network consultant under the name Digital
Network Architects (DNA). Almost as an afterthought, the Bookeys sent Erin
to Issaquah Middle School.<BR>
<BR>
Having designed networks around the world, Bookey had often seen their powerful
impact on business organizations, such as banks. Bookey believed that networks
could have a similar revitalizing impact on schools. Like banks, schools
are essentially information systems that have brought their Industrial Age
hierarchy into the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Creating networks in schools, however, posed many special problems. Most
school systems, like Issaquah, were largely unaccustomed to managing technology.
The system would need to create a large MIS (management information services)
organization just to keep the network functioning. Then, as the teachers
at Issaquah hastened to point out to Bookey, there was the problem of students.
Impulsive, mischievous and messy, they in no way resembled the disciplined
employees of a corporation. Speaking from grim experience, some of the teachers
told Bookey that his network plans would succeed only if the computers were
reserved exclusively for teachers and if students were barred entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey, however, thought there had to be a way to bring the magic of networks
to America's increasingly troubled school systems. The secret would be to
recognize that, just as computers are not consumers of but contributors
to bandwidth, students should be seen not as a problem, but as a precious
resource in launching the networks that inform the Information Age.

Networks as Productivity Engines</B></PRE>
Ever since Adam Smith first maintained that the division of labor, the spread
of specialization, is the catalyst of the wealth of nations, economists
have seen the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and specialties as
the driver of efficiency and growth. The key force expanding specialization
in the contemporary capitalist economy is networks. Indeed, networks, by
their nature and purpose, refine the division of labor.<BR>
<BR>
In the financial industry, for example, networks allowed the proliferation
of specialized institutions. In the ever-shifting kaleidoscopes of American
finance, some institutions went local, some global. Some managed car loans,
credit cards or other consumer services; some handled mortgages, mutual
funds or real estate trusts; still others stressed computer leases, junk
bonds, venture capital or large corporate accounts.<BR>
<BR>
The pell-mell fragmentation of American finance during the 1980s into an
ever more refined division of labor enabled the U.S. to lead the world in
levels of capital efficiency, with more economic growth per dollar of savings
than any other country. Each financial business did not have to repeat all
the work of all the rest, and each became more efficient at a particular
task.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey believes that networks can have a similar effect on that other great
information-processing industry: education. Why should every school have
an all-purpose library and a French teacher and a calculus scholar and a
health center and an administrative office? Why should every school have
an entire complement of buildings?<BR>
<BR>
With all the schools on networks, individual schools could specialize in
particular subjects, functions and resources, as financial companies do.
Education would not have to happen exclusively, or even mostly, in schools.
The explosive spread of networks is now the prime mover of the U.S. economy,
allowing all industries to break down into patterns of specialization unbound
by place and time. And now the government wants to get into the act.

Superhighways in the Sky</B></PRE>
Zoom through tax-hike tollgates and glide out onto data superhighways; this
is the new mantra of American industrial policy. Add the further fillip
of investment for educational infrastructure and you can sweep up the ramp
toward the federal treasury and drive out with a bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
In this new era of the big bands, there are now some 10 bills before Congress
to foster vast new networks with large bandwidth, or communications capacity.
Some $2 billion has already been authorized and $765 million appropriated
this year for various programs related to a National Research and Educational
Network (NREN).<BR>
<BR>
Candidate Bill Clinton presented the concept of NREN as Ra national information
network to link every home, business, lab, classroom and library by the
year 2015. President Bill Clinton, vice-president Albert Gore and a raft
of advisors all celebrate the highway as the metaphor for the future information
economy. Gore points out that his father was a leader in building the Interstate
Highway System in the early 1950s; Albert Jr., wants to play a key role
in building the information highways of the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, data superhighways would seem to be the fulfillment of the fibersphere;
the way to create the vast new infrastructure of fiber-optic lines that
will bring the full promise of digital video and multimedia communications
to all citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, is Mike Bookey so worried? He would seem to be the perfect NREN
champion. Bookey has pursued networks through most of his career and now
is focusing on networks for education. In explaining the importance of computer
connections, he has even long used Gore's favored highway metaphor. Bookey
thinks that the federal superhighwaymen do not grasp the nature of networks
and how they grow. In systems work we have a rule: You design top down,
but you build bottom up.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey sees the creation of networks as an organic process, driven by public
demand, shaped by human needs and rooted in a moral universe of growth through
sharing. It is the experience of building the network that creates the expertise
to maintain and use it. In all these processes, big government is nearly
irrelevant.

None of the Above</B></PRE>
For the past 10 years, Washington, D.C. experts have been wringing their
hands over the supposedly unbearable costs of building broadband networks
and the urgent need for large federal funding. Analysts have been ruminating
over the question of who would spearhead the creation of broadband nets;
the phone companies, the cable television companies or the government.<BR>
<BR>
Before any of these forces could act, however, it became clear that the
answer would be none of the above. The hardest part of the job was accomplished,
with astonishing speed, by computer and networking companies. The rest of
the work is well under way, as cable and phone companies adopt the computer
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
As recently as 1989, only seven percent of America's personal computers
were connected to local area networks. By 1991 45 percent were connected,
and by 1993, close to two-thirds were linked to LANs. Growing even faster
than LANs is the internetworking business: the interconnection of existing
local area nets in wide area networks.<BR>
<BR>
Building internetworking gear or accessories, such companies as Cisco Systems,
Cabletron, Wellfleet, 3Com and SynOptics are among the highest flyers in
the technology stock market boom. Cisco, for example, is growing some 50
percent a year and commands a market value of almost $6 billion, comparable
to that of Digital Equipment Corp. Cabletron has hiked its revenues some
16-fold in the last five years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these connections run at some 10 megabits per second, enough for
high-resolution digital video, but inadequate for the more exotic traffic
in images predicted for use later in the decade. Increasingly, however,
the connections are fiber- optic lines or are broadband coax, which is nearly
as good as fiber for short-distance transport. The potential of fiber is
almost unlimited (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; Forbes ASAP, December
7, 1992).<BR>
<BR>
Although moving more slowly than the computer firms, telephone and cable
companies are rushing to lay fiber ever deeper into the nation's neighborhoods.
Spending some $2 billion (as much as NREN), Telecommunications Inc. (TCI)
vows, according to CEO John Malone, to have 90 percent of its subscriber
households served by fiber to the curb by 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing fiber into the local loop at a slower pace, the telephone companies,
led by Bell Atlantic, also are forging ahead with ingenious new ways to
make their twisted-pair copper connections carry as much as six megabits
per second of digital information. Wireless technology is also moving into
the local loop for video delivery (see &quot;The New Rule of Wireless,&quot;
Forbes ASAP, March 29, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. networking industry is not in need of fixing. The U.S. currently
commands some three-fourths of all the world's LANs and perhaps 85 percent
of its internetworks. Although Gore and others justify their industrial
policies by referring to the imperious plans of Japan, the U.S. currently
commands about three times the computer power per capita as Japan, some
10 times as many computers attached to networks, and an installed base of
broadband fiber and cable nearly 10 times as large. The remarkable thing
is that the U.S. government is so eager to fix a fabulously flourishing
system that is the envy of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The electronic and photonic networking industries actually resemble highways
in only the most superficial way. The highway construction trade has not
advanced substantially in 50 years. By contrast, the networking trade is
the fastest-moving part of the ever-accelerating computer industry and doubles
its cost- effectiveness every year. Although interconnecting government
laboratories, contractors and supercomputer centers with fiber is desirable,
a massive government network is not. Issaquah offers better guidance for
the future.... But first it will be necessary to deal with the abiding menace
of the student problem. 
<PRE>


<B>


Overcoming the Student Problem</B></PRE>
&quot;What do you think you are doing? Answer me,&quot; the voice insisted
with the I've-got-you-squirming-now confidence of a teacher who has caught
a pupil red-handed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just lookin' around,&quot; grumbled Lee Dumas, the red-headed 13-
year-old, trying to sound natural. Glimpsing a telltale red screen of network
management among the array of blue displays used in the keyboarding class,
the teacher had walked up silently behind Dumas as he broke into the student
lists, software programs and grades, and was on the verge of entering the
administrative server.<BR>
<BR>
Dumas was a bad kid. No one at Maywood Middle School (one of the 16 campuses
in Issaquah) doubted that. His teachers called him &quot;obnoxious&quot;
or even &quot;brain-dead.&quot; He set what he believes was an all-time
record at Maywood by being detained after class some 60 times for insubordination.
Using the approved psychobabble, he says, &quot;I had problems with authority.
I couldn't accept teachers ordering me around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After being caught breaking into the computer system, Dumas was dragged
up to the principal's office. Neither the teacher nor the principal could
figure out the nature of the crime or judge its seriousness. For help, they
summoned Don Robertson, the administrator assigned to Issaquah's Technology
Information Project (TIP). He considered the situation gravely and recommended
severe punishment. Toward the end of the meeting, however, he turned to
Dumas and said, &quot;With your talent, you should become the sheriff rather
than the outlaw. Why don't you come down and join TIP?&quot; Since no one
had previously detected any talent in Dumas, this comment made a sharp impression.<BR>
<BR>
About a week later, he showed up sheepishly at Robertson's door. To school
administrators, kids like Dumas might be a problem, but to Bookey, Issaquah's
9,000 students seemed a wonderfully cheap resource. By training the students
to build and maintain the networks, he could make the $2.7 million the foundation
of an enduring educational resource.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the Issaquah network was almost entirely built by students between
the ages of 12 and 17. Using students to solve the problems of network maintenance
and support and thus reduce the real costs by some 80 percent was Mike Bookey's
solution to the perplexing problem of computers in schools.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the Issaquah networking venture, in the spring of 1990,
cost no money and arose from pure necessity. Just as in businesses across
the country, the initial motive for networking was the arrival of laser
printers from Hewlett Packard. Bookey began by giving his 10-person TIP
team a pile of manuals and having them install a basic network connecting
two PCs, an Apple II and a Macintosh to a laser printer. This step enhanced
the value of all the computers at a small fraction of the cost of buying
new dot-matrix printers for each. Four of the ten students managed to cobble
together the network in about a month. They learned the intricacies of pulling
twisted-pair wiring for 10baseT Ethernet computer connections running at
the standard rate of 10 million bits (megabits) per second.<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to add a hard disk containing school files and software
programs. Using both Apples and IBM PCs, the Issaquah network from the beginning,
had to handle a variety of communications protocols. If the network was
to connect to anything outside itself to the school's administration building
or the school system's libraries, for example, Issaquah would have to install
equipment that could sort out messages from different computers. This meant
Issaquah joined the market for multiprotocol routers. A router is a device
that sits on a computer network and reads the addresses on all the message
packets that pass by. If the address is on another network with a different
protocol, the router creates a new envelope for the packet and sends it
to the other network.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with all their routers and Ethernet wiring, the Issaquah networks
slowed to a crawl as soon as they had to connect outside a building. There,
they had to depend on what is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network,
where everything turns to analog and drowses down to some 2,400 bits per
second.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey demonstrated that the school could save money on its voice communications
by buying a digital T-1 line that multiplexes 24 phone circuits onto a 1.544-megabit-per-second
system. Since 12 of the 24 circuits would be enough to satisfy the school's
internal voice needs, the rest of the T-1 line, some 760 kilobits per second,
could be devoted to the data communications needs created by the school's
new Ethernets. Thus, while getting a cheaper solution for its voice traffic,
the school increased its data bandwidth by some sevenfold for free.<BR>
<BR>
Once these connections were in place, the students acquired a Microsoft
Mail program to incorporate E-mail in the system. Soon, this became the
heart of the network, with both students and teachers using it constantly
to handle papers, consult teachers in other schools in the system, make
reports to the state and interact with parents and students. E-mail became
so central to the functioning of Issaquah that when the computers were down
teachers would talk of canceling classes.<BR>
<BR>
To E-mail were added connections to Internet, the global research and education
network launched some 33 years ago as DARPA Net (the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency). Since Internet was civilianized in 1983,
adopting the TCP/IP networking standard, it has been expanding its traffic
at a pace of some 15 percent per month. Between 1981 and 1992 the number
of computers connected to Internet rose from 281 to 1.1 million. Through
Internet, the students could search through a variety of databases for material
for a paper or connect to Japan for help in learning Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Along with several other Issaquah students, Aaron Woodman, Jr., a burly
boy with his long blonde hair in a ponytail, became so adept at using Internet
that he now gives speeches to national conferences on the subject. The speechmaking
needs that grew out of the Issaquah project have imparted valuable lessons
in English communications for the students.<BR>
<BR>
All these developments did not occur without administrative resistance.
But the administration eventually became a prime beneficiary. Soon, the
computer networks in the Issaquah system were connected by a T-1 line to
the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative (WSIPC) 20 miles
north in Redmond, where attendance and other student records were kept for
the entire state.<BR>
<BR>
To make these WSIPC services more readily available to schools across the
state, Bookey proposed the creation of a statewide educational network running
on T-3 lines (45 megabits per second), now known as WEDNET. This provides
links all over Washington, from Shaw Island and Stehekin to Seattle and
Issaquah, with a rogue line down to Portland, Oreg.<BR>
<BR>
As for Lee Dumas, according to his mother, his situation has changed completely,
&quot;both in his attitude toward school and in the school's attitude toward
him.&quot; After joining TIP, Dumas became one of its most active and enthusiastic
members. Last summer, he got a job at the Computer Store in Seattle teaching
the Macintosh HyperCard program to a student body consisting, yes, of public
school teachers. According to Dumas, they had no problem accepting his authority
as a fledgling computer guru.<BR>
<BR>
No longer one of the outlaws, Dumas became an official beta tester for the
new Microsoft DOS 6.0 and Windows NT operating systems, specializing in
their security procedures. Following the path of another student who found
the &quot;Issaquah bug&quot; in Microsoft's LAN Manager program, Dumas believes
he found three or four bugs in NT.<BR>
<BR>
Having just finished his sophomore year, Dumas has gone to work this summer
at Microsoft for the company's network development chief, Brian Valentine,
who regards this once brain- dead punk as a valued employee with high promise
for the future. This student who floundered in the usual educational system
flourished when his individual specialization was discovered. The Issaquah
economy released his energies, just as the national economy releases its
own energies through the specialization and division of labor in computer
networks.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are millions of Lee Dumases in the schools of America, many
of them being given up for lost by analysts such as Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, because they are not adept at the usual curriculum for &quot;symbolic
analysts,&quot; Dumas' redemption by technology bears crucial lessons. The
lessons are Bookey's: Students are a resource, not a rabble; specialized
practical experience is more edifying than most textbook learning; networks
are the critical technology both for economic growth and for educational
renewal.<BR>
<BR>
To these insights should be added Lewis Perelman's view, in his book &quot;School's
Out&quot; (1992, Morrow), that teachers should increasingly abandon their
role as a &quot;sage on the stage&quot; in favor of service as a &quot;guide
on the side,&quot; steering their students through a global cornucopia of
educational resources. 
<PRE>


<B>


Education as a Network Driver</B></PRE>
It may seem peculiar that Bookey, a network guru for large corporations
like U.S. West, should focus his attentions on such problems as interconnecting
school children in Issaquah with libraries in Bellevue, parents on Squaw
Mountain, teachers across town and administrators at the Washington State
Information Processing Cooperative. Yet Bookey believes that the educational
application may well drive the creation of a true national infrastructure
of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The networking problems of schools closely resemble the networking problems
of a nation full of diverse systems. To achieve their full promise, school
networks must link computers of many varieties owned by parents, students
and teachers, to administrative servers owned by state and local governments,
to printers, libraries and databases. School networks must connect LANs
to IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture) links, to a variety of telephone
technologies, from T-1 lines of 1.5 megabits per second to T-3 lines at
45 megabits per second and, soon, to ATM switches and other potential gigabit
systems. In all its dimensions, including an acute financial constraint,
this challenge is altogether as difficult as interconnecting supercomputers
over fiber in an NREN.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey relished this challenge at Issaquah. Advocates of NREN might disparage
Issaquah as a relatively low-grade network. After all, it currently has
no fiber outside of the fiber links in the telephone network that it uses.
Without fiber, the network will not be able to accommodate collaborative
learning in multimedia forms across the country. Bookey demurs. Buying a
fiber-optic network before personal computer technology can manage broadband
flows of data is premature. In five years, fiber-optic links will probably
cost about one-fifth of what they cost today. When the network is needed,
Issaquah will be able to purchase it and, more important, also use it. Moreover,
TCI recently offered to install fiber throughout the Issaquah school system
for nothing as part of its general program of fiber to the curb.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that big-band technology will come to Issaquah in due course,
with or without NREN money. Critics, of course, will carp that Issaquah
is a special case &quot;a relatively rich community&quot; that could afford
to levy $2.7 million for technology. Yet the Issaquah example is galvanizing
schools across the state of Washington and even in California and Arkansas,
where Bookey and his colleague Mason Conner have been consulting with education
officials. Emulating Issaquah, other districts in Washington have since
raised some $140 million for network ventures. 
<PRE>


<B>


Glass Ceiling for Networks?</B></PRE>
The lesson of Issaquah is that data highways and superhighways, driven by
the convergence of microcosm and telecosm, are indeed emerging in America,
and at an astonishing pace. They already are revitalizing the economy and
society, and are helping to reform the system of education. The only federal
initiatives that will significantly assist the process are lower taxes,
accommodation of Internet growth and use, and further deregulation of telecommunications.
Communication must begin locally, with access to the community. From these
local roots can emerge the great branching systems that can interconnect
an information economy.<BR>
<BR>
By starting from the top, the government risks paving over the pullulating
fabric of networking enterprise with a glass ceiling of expensive and misplaced
fiber. In 1993 an estimated 37 million personal computers will be sold worldwide.
The same forces that impelled the networks of Issaquah will drive the owners
of these new PCs to interconnect them to other networks and will induce
the owners of the networks to link them together.<BR>
<BR>
As the centrifugal force of the microcosm, multiplying and distributing
intelligence through the world, converges with the integrating power of
the telecosm, the exponential miracles of specialization and growth will
gain new momentum. How far can this spiral reach? Internet will soon approach
some interesting limits. According to International Data Group, the number
of users has risen from 9,800 in 1986, all in the United States, to 4.7
million around the world today.<BR>
<BR>
At this pace, Internet will embrace the entire world population by the year
2001. That's one limit. As the system's trunking backbone rises to 45 megabits
per second on T-3 lines and above, the sky is the limit for the amount of
message traffic. In the first month after the enlargement to T-3 lines in
October 1992, usage rose from 3.5 trillion bytes to 4 trillion bytes. All
these networks are dominated by text and still pictures. But the miracles
of Internet and Issaquah are about to be joined with a new miracle of growth
in digital video connections in the local loop. 
<PRE>


<B>


Bombshell from Time-Warner</B></PRE>
How soon can this happen? Advocates of NREN speak of this technology being
consummated in 2015. But to most politicians and businessmen, a projected
date more than five years ahead is essentially a synonym for never-never
land; a way of saying, &quot;Forget about it. I'll be retired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that a widespread system of two-way broadband networks reaching
most American homes, schools and offices is less than five years away. All
U.S. business planners must come to terms with this transforming reality.
Announcements this spring from leading cable, telephone and computer companies;
from TCI and U.S. West to IBM and Silicon Graphics; bring the shape of this
network into clear focus.<BR>
<BR>
Exemplary among plans announced by a variety of firms is Time-Warner's projected
system in Orlando. As described by Jim Chiddix, the company's college-dropout
technical guru, the Time- Warner showcase venture will be a giant client/server
computer network, suggestive of the arrangements now ubiquitous in corporate
computing. The wires will be a combination of fiber to the curb and coax
to the home. Much of the system's hardware and software will be supplied
by computer companies (allegedly including IBM and Silicon Graphics). The
&quot;client&quot; computers will be digitized TVs or teleputers linked
to powerful database computers that use a parallel-processing architecture
to access hierarchical memory systems, from DRAM caches to optical disk
archives. These memories will contain terabytes (trillions of bytes) of
digital video movies, games, educational software and other programming.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most dramatic breakthrough, though, will come in the switches.
While much of the computer and telephone world continues to dither about
the future of ATM (many consigning it to the pits of 2015), Time-Warner
is committed to installing ATM switches, built by AT&amp;T, beginning next
year in Orlando. The ATM system will allow Time-Warner to offer telephone,
teleputer and multimedia services together, as soon as the regulators allow
it. Chiddix predicts that ATM will soon gravitate to local area networks
and ultimately become ubiquitous.<BR>
<BR>
But the most portentous announcements of all have come from the telephone
companies, who have the most to lose from this cable-oriented network design.
Both U.S. West and Pacific Bell have disclosed that they are adopting a
combination architecture of fiber and coaxial cable closely resembling the
Time-Warner and TCI projects. This unexpected action by two leading Baby
Bells, of turning their backs on their millions of miles of twisted-pair
copper wires shows both the boldness of the new telephone company leadership
and the imperious power of this digital technology.<BR>
<BR>
From all sides the telecommunications and computer industries are converging
on one essential configuration of advanced parallel-processing hardware,
client/server database software and ATM switching. As microcosm and telecosm
converge in the living room, with interactive digital video and supercomputer
image processing, the leading edge of the digital revolution moves from
millions of offices toward billions of homes. Just as Michael Milken, then
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the late William McGowan of MCI in 1983 rescued
long-distance fiber optics from the never-never lands of the year 2015 to
which AT&amp;T had consigned it, John Malone of TCI, Gerald M. Levin of
Time-Warner and Richard D. McCormick of U.S. West in 1993 have burst open
the floodgates for fiber and ATM in the local loop.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the force behind this revolutionary development was fierce business
and technical rivalry in the marketplace. In the real world the ruling principle
of network development is not imposed standardization by government but
spontaneous order. It springs from the interplay of human creativity and
entrepreneurship with the inexorable laws of physics and technology.<BR>
<BR>
These dynamics of interconnection in the Information Age will continue well
into the next century. The microcosm will yield chips containing billions
of transistors, equivalent to scores of supercomputers on single slivers
of silicon. The telecosm will yield bandwidth exploding into the terahertz
of all- optical networks and the gigahertz of millimeter waves in the air.<BR>
<BR>
Provided that rulers and regulators do not stifle this spiral of opportunity,
the human spirit &quot;emancipated and thus allowed to reach its rarest
talents and aspirations&quot; will continue to amaze the world with heroic
surprises. The Issaquah miracle of Mike Bookey and Lee Dumas and all the
others, and the continuing miracle of American networks, which was entirely
unexpected by the world, will repeat themselves again and again in new forms
of entrepreneurship and technology.

<HR>At first glance, Vahak Hovnanian, a homebuilding tycoon in New Jersey,
would<B> </B>seem an unlikely sort to be chasing rainbows. Yet in the converging
realms of computers and communications that we call the telecosm, rainbows
are less a matter of hue and weather than they are a metaphor for electromagnetism:
the spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies used to build businesses in
the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
An Armenian Christian from Iraq, Hovnanian ran a business building high-quality
&quot;affordable&quot; housing. His first coup came on Labor Day in 1958
when, together with his three older brothers, he bought an apparently undesirable
property near the waterfront in Tom's River for $20,000. From this modest
beginning has arisen not only one of the nation's largest homebuilding enterprises
(divided among the four immigrant brothers), but also a shattering breakthrough
on some seemingly bleak frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum. Together
with maverick inventor Bernard Bossard, Hovnanian has launched a wireless
cellular TV business in frequencies once thought usable only in outer space.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the reason Hovnanian feels comfortable today pioneering on the shores
of the telecosm is that some 35 years ago he was an engineer at Philco Semiconductor
following in the theoretical steps of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories titan William
Shockley. Shockley led the team that plunged into the microcosm of solid-state
physics and invented the transistor. At the heart of all-digital electronics,
this invention still reverberates through the world economy and imposes
its centrifugal rules of enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
This law of the microcosm dictates exponential rises in computer efficiency
as transistors become smaller. It is this law that drives the bulk of the
world's computations to ever- cheaper machines and pushes intelligence from
the center to the fringes of all networks. Today the microcosm is converging
with the telecosm and igniting a new series of industrial shocks and surprises.<BR>
<BR>
The convergence of microcosm and telecosm in an array of multimedia industries
- from personal intelligent communicators to video teleputers to digital
films and publishing - is now the driving force of world economic growth.
John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple Computer, has projected that by
2002 there will be a global business in multimedia totaling some $3.5 trillion
- close to the size of the entire U.S. economy in the early 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
This new world of computer communications will break down into two domains
- the fibersphere and the atmosphere. The fibersphere is the domain of all-optical
networks, with both communications power - bandwidth - and error rate improving
by factors in the millions. In &quot;Into the Fibersphere&quot; (Forbes
ASAP, December 7, 1992), we saw that the potential capacity for communications
in the fibersphere is 1,000 times greater than all the currently used frequencies
in the air - and so radically error-free that it mandates an entirely new
model of wired telecommunications. Now we will discover that the atmosphere
will offer links as mobile and ubiquitous as human beings are. It thus will
force the creation of an entirely new model of wireless networks.<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Sculley's $3 5 trillion dream can be seen as the pot of gold
at the end of Maxwell's rainbow. In 1865, in a visionary coup that the late
Richard Feynman said would leave the American Civil War of the same decade
as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by comparison, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. Encompassing
nearly all the technologies imagined by Sculley, Maxwell's rainbow reaches
from the extremely low frequencies (and gigantic wavelengths) used to communicate
with submarines all the way through the frequencies used in radio, television
and cellular phones, on up to the frequencies of infrared used in TV remotes
and fiber optics, and beyond that to visible and ultraviolet light and X-
rays. In a fabulous feat of unification, Maxwell reduced the entire spectrum
to just four equations in vector calculus. He showed that all such radiations
move at the speed of light - in other words, the wavelength times the frequency
equals the speed of light. These equations pulse at the heart of the information
economy today.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all electromagnetic radiation can bear information, and the higher
the frequencies, the more room they provide for bearing information. As
a practical matter, however, communications engineers have aimed low, thronging
the frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum, comprising far less than
one percent of the total span.<BR>
<BR>
The vast expansion of wireless communications forecast by Sculley, however,
will require the use of higher frequencies far up Maxwell's rainbow. This
means a return to the insights of another great man who walked the halls
of Bell Labs in the late 1940s at the same time as future Nobel laureate
William Shockley, and who left the world transformed in his wake.<BR>
<BR>
In 1948, the same year that Shockley invented the transistor, Claude Shannon
invented the information theory that underlies all modern communications.
At first encounter, information theory is difficult for nonmathematicians,
but computer and telecom executives need focus on only a few key themes.
In defining how much information can be sent down a noisy channel, Shannon
showed that engineers can choose between narrowband high-powered solutions
and broadband low-powered solutions. 
<PRE>


<B>


From Long & Strong to Wide & Weak
</B></PRE>
Assuming that usable bandwidth is scarce and expensive, most wireless engineers
have strived to economize on it. Just as you can get your message through
in a crowded room by talking louder, you can overcome a noisy channel with
more powerful signals. Engineers therefore have pursued a strategy of long
and strong: long wavelengths and powerful transmissions with the scarce
radio frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
Economizing on spectrum, scientists created mostly analog systems such as
AM radios and televisions. Using every point on the wave to convey information
and using high power to overcome noise and extend the range of signals,
the long and strong approach seemed hugely more efficient than digital systems
requiring complex manipulation of long strings of on-off bits.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, however, the long and strong policy of economizing on spectrum
led to using it all up. When everyone talks louder, no one can hear very
well. Today, the favored regions at the bottom of the spectrum are so full
of spectrum- hogging radios, pagers, phones, television, long-distance,
point- to-point, aerospace and other uses that heavy-breathing experts speak
of running out of &quot;air.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's theories reveal the way out of this problem. In a counterintuitive
and initially baffling redefinition of the nature of noise in a communications
channel, Shannon showed that a flow of signals conveys information only
to the extent that it provides unexpected data - only to the extent that
it adds to what you already know. Another name for a stream of unexpected
bits is noise. Termed Gaussian, or white, noise, such a transmission resembles
random &quot;white&quot; light, which cloaks the entire rainbow of colors
in a bright blur. Shannon showed that the more a transmission resembles
this form of noise, the more information it can hold.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's alternative to long and strong is wide and weak: not fighting
noise with electrical power but joining it with noiselike information, not
talking louder but talking softer in more elaborate codes using more bandwidth.
For example, in transmitting 40 megabits per second - the requirement for
truly high-resolution images and sounds - Shannon showed some 45 years ago
that using more bandwidth can lower the needed signal-to- noise ratio from
a level of one million to one to a ratio of 30.6 to one. This huge gain
comes merely from increasing the bandwidth of the signal from two megahertz
(millions of cycles per second) to eight megahertz. That means a 33,000-fold
increase in communications efficiency in exchange for just a fourfold increase
in bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Such an explosion of efficiency radically limits the need to waste watts
in order to overcome noise. More communications power comes from less electrical
power. Thus, Shannon shows the way to fulfill Sculley's vision of universal
low-powered wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
This vision of wide and weak is at the heart of the most promising technologies
of today, from the advanced digital teleputer sets of American HDTV to ubiquitous
mobile phones and computers in so-called personal communications networks
(PCNs). Shannon's theories of the telecosm provide the basic science behind
both Sculley's dream and Hovnanian's video spectrum breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's world, however, is not nirvana, and there is no free lunch. Compensating
for the exponential rise in communications power is an exponential rise
in complexity. Larger bandwidths mean larger, more complex codes and exponentially
rising burdens of computation for the decoding and error-correcting of messages.
In previous decades, handling 40 megabits per second was simply out of the
question with existing computer technology. For the last 30 years, this
electronic bottleneck has blocked the vistas of efficient communication
opened by Shannon's research.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1990s, however, the problem of soaring complexity has met its match
- and then some - in exponential gains of computer efficiency. Not only
has the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology been doubling every 18
months but the pace of advance has been accelerating into the 1990s. Moreover,
the chips central to digital communications - error correction, compression,
coding and decoding - are digital signal processors. As we have seen, the
cost-effectiveness of DSPs has been increasing - in millions of computer
instructions per second (MIPS) per dollar - some tenfold every two years.<BR>
<BR>
This wild rush in DSPs will eventually converge with the precipitous plunge
in price-performance ratios of general-purpose microprocessors. Led by Silicon
Graphics' impending new TFP Cray supercomputer on a chip, Digital Equipment's
Alpha AXP device and Hewlett Packard's Precision Architecture 7100, micros
are moving beyond 100-megahertz clock rates. They are shifting from a regime
of processing 32-bit words at a time to a regime of processing 64-bit words.
This expands the total addressable memory by a factor of four billion. Together
with increasing use of massively parallel DSP architectures, these gains
will keep computers well ahead of the complexity problem in broadband communications.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that while complexity rises exponentially with bandwidth,
computer efficiencies are rising even faster. The result is to open new
vistas of spectrum in the atmosphere as dramatic as the gains of spectrum
so far achieved in the fibersphere.

Attacking Through the Air
</B></PRE>
Hovnanian's campaign into the spectrum began when a cable company announced
one day in 1985 that under the Cable Act of 1984 and franchise rights granted
by local governments, it had the right to wire one of his housing developments
then under construction. Until that day, Hovnanian's own company could package
cable with his homes through what are called satellite master antenna TV
systems. In essence, each Hovnanian development had its own cable head end
where programs are collected and sent out to subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
When the cable company, now Monmouth Cable Vision, went to court and its
claim was upheld by a judge, Hovnanian sought alternatives. First he flirted
with the idea of having the phone company deliver compressed video to his
homes. In 1986, in the era before FCC Commissioner Alfred Sikes, that was
both illegal and impractical. Then he met Bernard Bossard and decided to
attack through the air. An early pioneer in microchips who had launched
a semiconductor firm and eventually sold it to M/A COM, Bossard was familiar
with both the soaring power of computers and the murky problems of broadband
noise that have long restricted the air to a small number of broadcast AM
TV stations.<BR>
<BR>
Air delivery of cable television programming had long seemed unpromising.
Not only was there too little spectrum available to compete with cable,
but what spectrum there was, was guarded by the FCC and state public utilities
commissions. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s &quot;wireless cable&quot;
did become a niche market, led by Microband Wireless Cable and rivals and
imitators across the land. Using fragments of a frequency band between 2.5
and 2.7 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), Microband, after some
financial turmoil, now profitably broadcasts some 16 channels to 35,000
New York City homes in line of sight from the top of the Empire State Building.
As long as they are restricted to a possible maximum of 200 megahertz and
use AM, however, wireless firms will not long be able to compete with the
cable industry. Cable companies offer an installed base of potential gigahertz
connections and near universal coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Having spent much of his life working with microwaves for satellites and
the military, Bossard had a better idea. He claimed he could move up the
spectrum and pioneer on frontiers of frequency between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz,
previously used chiefly in outer space. That would mean he could command
in the air some half a million times the communications power, or bandwidth,
of typical copper telephone links, some ten times the bandwidth of existing
wireless cable, some four times the bandwidth of the average cable industry
coaxial connection, and twice the bandwidth of the most advanced cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional wisdom was that these microwaves (above about 12 gigahertz)
are useless for anything but point-to-point transmissions and are doubtful
even for these. For radio communication, the prevailing folklore preferred
frequencies that are cheap to transmit long distances and that can penetrate
buildings and tunnels, bounce off the ionosphere or scuttle across continents
along the surface of the earth. The higher the frequency, the less it can
perform these feats essential to all broadcasting - and the less it can
be sent long distances at all.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it was believed, these millimeter-sized microwaves not only would
fail to penetrate structures and other obstacles but would reflect off them
and off particles in the air in a way that would cause hopeless mazes of
multipath. Multipath would be translated into several images, i.e., ghosts,
on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there was the real show-stopper. Everyone knew that these frequencies
are microwaves. The key property of microwaves, as demonstrated in the now
ubiquitous ovens, is absorption by water. Microwaves cook by exciting water
molecules to a boil. Microwave towers are said to kill birds by irradiating
their fluids. Microwave radar systems won't work in the rain. Mention microwaves
as a possible solution to the spectrum shortage, and everyone - from editors
at Forbes to gurus at Microsoft, from cable executives to Bell Labs researchers
- laughs and tells you about the moisture problem.<BR>
<BR>
So it was no surprise that when in 1986 Bossard went to M/A COM and other
companies and financiers with his idea of TV broadcasting at 28 gigahertz,
he was turned down flat. Amid much talk of potential &quot;violations of
the laws of physics,&quot; jokes about broiling pigeons and warnings of
likely resistance from the FCC, he was spurned by all. In fairness to his
detractors, Bossard had no license, patent or prototype at the time. But
these holes in his plan did not deter Vahak Hovnanian and his son Shant
from investing many millions of dollars in the project. It could be the
best investment the Hovnanian tycoons ever made.

New Rule of Radio
</B></PRE>
For 35 years, the wireless communications industry has been inching up the
spectrum, shifting slowly from long and strong wavelengths toward wide and
weak bands of shorter wavelengths. Mobile phone services have moved from
the 1950s radio systems using low FM frequencies near 100 megahertz, to
the 1960s spectrum band of 450 megahertz, to the current cellular band of
900 megahertz accommodating more than 10 million cellular subscribers in
the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1990s, this trend will accelerate sharply. Accommodating hundreds
of millions of users around the world, cellular communications will turn
digital, leap up the spectrum and even move into video. Shannon's laws show
that this will impel vast increases in the cost-effectiveness of communications.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the new rule of radio is the shorter the transmission path,
the better the system. Like transistors on semiconductor chips, transmitters
are more efficient the more closely they are packed together. As Peter Huber
writes in his masterly new book, The Geodesic Network 2, the new regime
favors &quot;geodesic networks,&quot; with radios intimately linked in tiny
microcells. As in the law of the microcosm, the less the space, the more
the room.<BR>
<BR>
This rule turns the conventional wisdom of microwaves upside down. For example,
it is true that microwaves don't travel far in the atmosphere. You don't
want to use them to transmit 50,000 watts of Rush Limbaugh over 10 midwestern
states, but to accommodate 200 million two-way communicators will require
small cells; you don't want the waves to travel far. It is true that microwaves
will not penetrate most buildings and other obstacles, but with lots of
small cells, you don't want the waves to penetrate walls to adjacent offices.<BR>
<BR>
Microwaves require high-power systems to transmit, but only if you want
to send them long distances. Wattage at the receiver drops off in proportion
to the fourth power of the distance from the transmitter. Reducing cell
sizes as you move up the spectrum lowers power needs far more than higher
frequencies increase them. Just as important, mobile systems must be small
and light. The higher the frequency, the smaller the antenna and the lighter
the system can be.<BR>
<BR>
All this high-frequency gear once was prohibitively expensive. Any functions
over two gigahertz require gallium arsenide chips, which are complex and
costly. Yet the cost of gallium arsenide devices is dropping every day as
their market expands. Meanwhile, laboratory teams are now tweaking microwaves
out of silicon. In the world of electronics - where prices drop by a third
with every doubling of accumulated sales - any ubiquitous product will soon
be cheap.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm dictates that the higher the frequency, the shorter
the wavelength, the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the antenna, the slimmer
the cell and ultimately, the cheaper and better the communication. The working
of this law will render obsolete the entire idea of scarce spectrum and
launch an era of advances in telecommunications comparable to the recent
gains in computing. Transforming the computer and phone industries, the
converging spirits of Maxwell, Shannon and Shockley even pose a serious
challenge to the current revolutionaries in cellular telephony.

The New PC Revolution: PCN
</B></PRE>
Many observers herald the huge coming impact of wireless on the computer
industry, and they are right. But this impact will be dwarfed by the impact
of computers on wireless.<BR>
<BR>
In personal communications networks (PCN), the cellular industry today is
about to experience its own personal computer revolution. Just as the personal
computer led to systems thousands of times more efficient in MIPS per dollar
than the mainframes and minicomputers that preceded it, PCNs will bring
an exponential plunge of costs. These networks will be based on microcells
often measured in hundreds of meters rather than in tens of miles and will
interlink smart digital appliances, draining power in milliwatts rather
than dumb phones using watts. When the convulsion ends later this decade,
this new digital cellular phone will stand as the world's most pervasive
PC. As mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet, these PICOs will recognize
speech, navigate streets, take notes, keep schedules, collect mail, manage
money, open the door and start the car, among other computer functions we
cannot imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
Like the computer establishment before it, current cellular providers often
seem unprepared for this next computer revolution. They still live in a
world of long and strong - high- powered systems at relatively low frequencies
and with short- lived batteries - rather than in a PCN world of low-power
systems at microwave frequencies and with batteries that last for days.<BR>
<BR>
Ready or not, though, the revolution will happen anyway, and it will transform
the landscape over the next five years. We can guess the pattern by considering
the precedents. In computers, the revolution took 10 years. It began in
1977 when large centralized systems with attached dumb terminals commanded
nearly 100 percent of the world's computer power and ended in 1987 with
such large systems commanding less than one percent of the world's computer
power. The pace of progress in digital electronics has accelerated sharply
since the early 1980s. Remember yesterday, when digital signal processing
(DSP) - the use of specialized computers to convert, compress, shape and
shuffle digital signals in real time - constituted an exorbitant million-dollar
obstacle to all-digital communications? Many current attitudes toward wireless
stem from that time, which was some five years ago. Today, digital signal
processors are the fastest-moving technology in all computing. Made on single
chips or multichip modules, DSPs are increasing their cost- effectiveness
tenfold every two years. As radio pioneer Donald Steinbrecher says, &quot;That
changes wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thus, we can expect the cellular telephone establishment to reach a crisis
more quickly than the mainframe establishment did. The existing cellular
infrastructure will persist for vehicular use.<BR>
<BR>
As the intelligence in networks migrates to microcells, the networks themselves
must become dumb. A complex network, loaded up with millions of lines of
software code, cannot keep up with the efflorescent diversity and creativity
among ever more intelligent digital devices on its periphery. This rule
is true for the broadband wire links of fiber optics, as intelligent switching
systems give way to passive all-optical networks. It is also true of cellular
systems.<BR>
<BR>
Nick Kauser, McCaw Cellular Communications' executive vice- president and
chief of technology, faced this problem early in 1991 when the company decided
to create a North American Cellular Network for transparent roaming throughout
the regions of Cellular One. &quot;The manufacturers always want to sell
switches that do more and more. But complex switches take so long to program
that you end up doing less and less,&quot; says Wayne Perry, McCaw vice-chairman.
Each time Kauser tried to change software code in one of McCaw's Ericsson
switches, it might have taken six months. Each time he wanted to add customer
names above a 64,000 limit, Ericsson tried to persuade him to buy a new
switch. The Ericsson switches, commented one McCaw engineer, offer a huge
engine but a tiny gas tank. The problem is not peculiar to Ericsson, however;
it is basic to the very idea of complex switch- based services on any supplier's
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
When McCaw voiced frustration, one of the regional Bell operating companies
offered to take over the entire problem at a cost of some $200 million.
Instead, Kauser created a Signaling System 7 (SS-7) network plus an intelligent
database on four Tandem fault-tolerant computers, for some $15 million.
Kauser maintains that the current services offered by North American Cellular
could not be duplicated for 10 times that amount, if at all, in a switch-based
system. Creating a dumb network and off- loading the intelligence on computer
servers saved McCaw hundreds of millions of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm is a centrifuge, inexorably pushing intelligence
to the edges of networks. Telecom equipment suppliers can no more trap it
in the central switch than IBM could monopolize it in mainframes.<BR>
<BR>
Kauser should recognize that this rule applies to McCaw no less than to
Ericsson. His large standardized systems with 30- mile cells and relatively
dumb, high-powered phones resemble big proprietary mainframe networks. In
the computer industry, these standardized architectures gave way to a mad
proliferation of diverse personal computer nets restricted to small areas
and interlinked by hubs and routers. The same pattern will develop in cellular.
<PRE>


<B>


Could &quot;Charles&quot; Upend McCaw?
</B></PRE>
Together with GTE and the regional Bell operating company cellular divisions,
McCaw is now in the position of DEC in 1977. With its new ally, AT&amp;T,
McCaw is brilliantly attacking the mainframe establishment of the wire-line
phone companies. But the mainframe establishment of wires is not McCaw's
real competition. Not stopping at central switches, the law of the microcosm
is about to subvert the foundations of conventional cellular technology
as well. Unless McCaw and the other cellular providers come to terms with
the new PC networks that go by the name of PCNs, they will soon suffer the
fate of the minicomputer firms of the last decade. McCaw could well be upended
by its founder's original vision of his company - a PICO he called &quot;Charles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just as in the computer industry in the late 1970s, the fight for the future
is already under way. Complicating the conflict is the influence of European
and Japanese forces protecting the past in the name of progress. Under pressure
from EEC industrial politicians working with the guidance of engineers from
Ericsson, the Europeans have adopted a new digital cellular system called
Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) after the commission that conceived it.<BR>
<BR>
GSM is a very conservative digital system that multiplies the number of
users in each cellular channel by a factor of three. GSM uses an access
method called time-division multiple access (TDMA). Suggestive of the time-sharing
methods used by minicomputers and mainframes to accommodate large numbers
of users on centralized computers, TDMA stems from the time-division multiplexing
employed by phone companies around the world to put more than one phone
call on each digital line. Thus, both the telephone and the computer establishments
are comfortable with time division.<BR>
<BR>
Under pressure from European firms eager to sell equipment in America, the
U.S. Telephone Industry Association two years ago adopted a TDMA standard
similar to the European GSM. Rather than creating a wholly new system exploiting
the distributed powers of the computer revolution, the TIA favored a TDMA
overlay on the existing analog infrastructure. Under the influence of Ericsson,
McCaw and some of the RBOCs took the TDMA bait.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it was in the name of competitiveness and technological progress,
and of keeping up with the Europeans and Japanese, that the U.S. moved to
embrace an obsolescent cellular system. It made no difference that the Europeans
and Japanese were technologically well in our wake. Just as in the earlier
case of analog HDTV, however, the entrepreneurial creativity of the U.S.
digital electronics industry is launching an array of compelling alternatives
just in time.<BR>
<BR>
Infusing cellular telephony with the full powers of wide and weak - combining
Shannon's vision with computer advances - are two groups of engineers from
MIT who spun out to launch new companies. Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, is
led by former professor Irwin Jacobs and telecom pioneer Andrew Viterbi.
A Shannon disciple whose eponymous algorithm is widely used in digital wire-line
telephony, Viterbi now is leading an effort to transform digital wireless
telephony. The other firm, Steinbrecher Corp. of Woburn, Mass., is led by
an inventor from the MIT Radio Astronomy Lab named Donald Steinbrecher.<BR>
<BR>
Like Bernie Bossard and Vahak Hovnanian, the leaders of Qualcomm and Steinbrecher
received the ultimate accolade for an innovator: They were all told their
breakthroughs were impossible. Indeed, the leaders at Qualcomm were still
contending that Steinbrecher's system would not work just weeks ago when
PacTel pushed the two firms together. Now they provide the foundations for
a radical new regime in distributed wireless computer telephony. 
<PRE>


<B>


Signals in Pseudonoise
</B></PRE>
Ten years ago at Linkabit, the current leaders of Qualcomm conceived and
patented the TDMA technology adopted as the U.S. standard by the Telephone
Industry Association. Like analog HDTV, it was a powerful advance for its
time. But even then, Viterbi and Jacobs were experimenting with a Shannonesque
technology.<BR>
<BR>
A classic example of the efficacy of wide and weak, CDMA exploits the resemblance
between noise and information. The system began in the military as an effort
to avoid jamming or air- tapping of combat messages. Qualcomm brings CDMA
to the challenge of communications on the battlefronts of big-city cellular.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than compressing each call into between three and 10 tiny TDMA time
slots in a 30-kilohertz cellular channel, Qualcomm's CDMA spreads a signal
across a comparatively huge 1. 25-megahertz swath of the cellular spectrum.
This allows many users to share the same spectrum space at one time. Each
phone is programmed with a specific pseudonoise code, which is used to stretch
a low-powered signal over a wide frequency band. The base station uses the
same code in inverted form to &quot;despread&quot; and reconstitute the
original signal. All other codes remain spread out, indistinguishable from
background noise.<BR>
<BR>
Jacobs compares TDMA and CDMA to different strategies of communication at
a cocktail party. In the TDMA analogy, each person would restrict his or
her talk to a specific time slot while everyone else remains silent. This
system would work well as long as the party was managed by a dictator who
controlled all conversations by complex rules and a rigid clock. In CDMA,
on the other hand, everyone can talk at once but in different languages.
Each person listens for messages in his or her own language or code and
ignores all other sounds as background noise. Although this system allows
each person to speak freely, it requires constant control of the volume
of the speakers. A speaker who begins yelling can drown out surrounding
messages and drastically reduce the total number of conversations that can
be sustained.<BR>
<BR>
For years, this problem of the stentorian guest crippled CDMA as a method
of increasing the capacity of cellular systems. Spread spectrum had many
military uses because its unlocalized signal and cryptic codes made it very
difficult to jam or overhear. In a cellular environment, however, where
cars continually move in and out from behind trucks, buildings and other
obstacles, causing huge variations in power, CDMA systems would be regularly
swamped by stentorian guests. Similarly, nearby cars would tend to dominate
faraway vehicles. This was termed the near-far problem. When you compound
this challenge with a static of multipath signals causing hundreds of 10,000-to-
1 gyrations in power for every foot traveled by the mobile unit - so-called
Rayleigh interference pits and spikes - you can comprehend the general incredulity
toward CDMA among cellular cognoscenti. Indeed, as recently as 1991, leading
experts at Bell Labs, Stanford University and Bellcore confidently told
me the problem was a show-stopper; it could not be overcome.<BR>
<BR>
Radio experts, however, underestimate the power of the microcosm. Using
digital signal processing, error correction and other microcosmic tools,
wattage spikes and pits 100 times a second can be regulated by electronic
circuitry that adjusts the power at a rate of more than 800 times a second.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this result, Qualcomm uses two layers of controls. First is a
relatively crude top layer that employs the automatic gain control device
on handsets to constantly adjust the power sent by the handset to the level
of power received by it from the base station. This rough adjustment does
not come near to solving the problem, but it brings a solution into reach
by using more complex and refined techniques.<BR>
<BR>
In the second power-control step, the base station measures the handset's
signal-to-noise and bit-error ratios once every 1.25 milliseconds (800 times
a second). Depending on whether these ratios are above or below a constantly
recomputed threshold, the base station sends a positive or negative pulse,
either raising or lowering the power some 25 percent. 
<PRE>


<B>


Dynamic Cells
</B></PRE>
Passing elaborate field tests with flying colors, this power- control mechanism
has the further effect of dynamically changing the size of cells. In a congested
cell, the power of all phones rises to overcome mutual interference. On
the margin, these high- powered transmissions overflow into neighboring
cells where they may be picked up by adjacent base station equipment. In
a quiet cell, power is so low that the cell effectively shrinks, transmitting
no interference at all to neighboring cells and improving their performance.
This kind of dynamic adjustment of cell sizes is impossible in a TDMA system,
where adjacent cells use completely different frequencies and fringe handsets
may begin to chirp like Elmer Fudd.<BR>
<BR>
Once the stentorian voice could be instantly abated, power control changed
from a crippling weakness of CDMA into a commanding asset. Power usage is
a major obstacle to the PCN future. All market tests show that either heavy
or short-lived batteries greatly reduce the attractiveness of the system.
Because the Qualcomm feedback system keeps power always at the lowest feasible
level, batteries in CDMA phones actually are lasting far longer than in
TDMA phones. CDMA phones transmit at an average of two milliwatts, compared
with 600 milliwatts and higher for most other cellular systems.<BR>
<BR>
A further advantage of wide and weak comes in handling multipath signals,
which bounce off obstacles and arrive at different times at the receiver.
Multipath just adds to the accuracy of CDMA. The Qualcomm system combines
the three strongest signals into one. Called a rake receiver and co- invented
by Paul Green, currently at IBM and author of Fiber Optic Networks (Prentice
Hall, 1992), this combining function works even on signals from different
cells and thus facilitates hand-offs. In TDMA, signals arriving at the wrong
time are pure interference in someone else's time slot; in CDMA, they strengthen
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, CDMA allows simple and soft hand-offs. Because all the phones are
using the same spectrum space, moving from one cell to another is easy.
CDMA avoids all the frequency juggling of TDMA systems as they shuffle calls
among cells and time slots. As the era of PCN microcells approaches, this
advantage will become increasingly crucial. Cellular systems that spurn
Qualcomm today may find themselves in a quagmire of TDMA microcells tomorrow.
Together, all the gains from CDMA bring about a tenfold increase over current
analog capacity. In wireless telephony above all, wide and weak will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Like any obsolescent scheme challenged by a real innovation - and like minicomputers
and mainframes challenged by the PC - TDMA is being sharply improved by
its proponents. The inheritors of the Linkabit TDMA patents at Hughes and
International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMMC) have introduced extended TDMA,
claiming a 19-fold advance over current analog capacity. Showing a conventional
cellular outlook, however, E-TDMA fatally adopts the idea of increasing
capacity by lowering speech quality. This moves in exactly the wrong direction.
PCN will not triumph through compromises based on a scarce-spectrum mentality.
PCN will multiply bandwidth to make the acoustics of digital cellular even
better than the acoustics of wire-line phones, just as the acoustics of
digital CDs far excel the acoustics of analog records.<BR>
<BR>
Riding the microcosmic gains of digital signal processing, CDMA inherently
offers greater room for improvement than TDMA does. Bringing the computer
revolution to cellular telephony, CDMA at its essence replaces frequency
shuffling with digital intelligence. Supplanting the multiple radios of
TDMA - each with a fixed frequency - are digital-signal-processing chips
that find a particular message across a wide spectrum swath captured by
one broadband radio.<BR>
<BR>
With the advance in digital electronics, the advantage of CDMA continually
increases. As the most compute-intensive system, CDMA gains most from the
onrushing increases in the cost- effectiveness of semiconductor electronics.
Qualcomm recently announced that it has reduced all the digital signal processing
for CDMA into one application-specific chip.<BR>
<BR>
For all the indispensable advances of CDMA, however, Qualcomm cannot prevail
alone. It brilliantly executes the move to digital codes, but proprietary
mainframe computer networks are digital, too. As presently conceived, CDMA
still aspires to be a cellular standard using the same mainframe architecture
of mobile telephone switching offices that now serve the analog cellular
system. In itself the Qualcomm solution does little to move cellular toward
the ever cheaper, smaller and more open architectures that now dominate
network computing and will shape PCN.

Hearing Feathers Crash Amid Heavy Metal
</B></PRE>
Consummating the PCN revolution - with its millions of microcells around
the globe and its myriad digital devices and frequencies - will require
a fundamental breakthrough in cellular radio technology. In the new Steinbrecher
minicell introduced early this month at the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association show, that breakthrough is at hand. The first true PC server
for PCN, this small box ultimately costing a few thousand dollars will both
replace and far outperform a 1,000-square-foot base station costing more
than a million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, in an entrepreneurial economy, crucial innovations come as an
utter surprise to all the experts in the field. Donald Steinbrecher began
in the Radio Astronomy Lab at MIT in the 1960s and early 1970s, creating
receivers that could resolve a random cosmic ray among a mass of electromagnetic
noise. This required radios with huge dynamic range - radios that could
hear a feather drop at a heavy metal rock concert. He and his students solved
this intractable problem by creating unique high-performance receivers and
frequency &quot;Mixers.&quot; These could process huge spans of spectrum
with immense variations of power and translate them without loss into intermediate
frequencies. Then, computer systems convert the signals from analog to digital
and analyze them with digital signal processors.<BR>
<BR>
Moving out to begin his own company in 1973, Steinbrecher and his colleagues
made several inventions in the fields of radar and digital signal analysis.
At first, most of their customers were national security contractors in
the intelligence field. For example, Steinbrecher supplied the radios for
the ROTHR (remote over the horizon radar) systems that became famous for
their role in the war against airborne drug traffic. Then in 1986, the company
was asked if its equipment could work in the cellular band.<BR>
<BR>
After cosmic rays and battlefield radar, the cellular band was easy. When
he saw that the digital signal processors at the heart of his systems were
dropping in price tenfold every two years, Steinbrecher knew that his esoteric
radios could become a consumer product.<BR>
<BR>
Translated to cellular, this technology opens entire new frontiers for wireless
telephony. Rather than tuning into one fixed frequency as current cellular
radios do, Steinbrecher's cells can use a high-dynamic-range digital radio
to down-convert and digitize the entire cellular band. TDMA, CDMA, near
or far, analog cellular, video, voice or data, in any combination, it makes
no difference to the Steinbrecher system. His minicell converts them all
at once to a digital bit stream. The DSPs take over from there, sorting
out the TDMA and CDMA signals from the analog signals and reducing each
to digital voice. To the extent the Steinbrecher system prevails, it would
end the need for hybrid phones and make possible a phased shift to PCN or
a variety of other digital services.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping to use Qualcomm chipsets and other technology, Steinbrecher could
facilitate the acceptance of CDMA. For CDMA, the minicell provides a new,
far cheaper radio front end that offers further relief to the near-far problem
and is open to the diverse codes and fast-moving technologies of PCN. For
the current cellular architecture, however, Steinbrecher offers only creative
destruction, doing for large base stations what the integrated circuit did
for racks of vacuum tubes in old telephone switches.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the new minicell replaces a rigid structure of giant analog
mainframes with a system of wireless local area networks. Reconciling a
variety of codes and technologies, the Steinbrecher devices resemble the
smart hubs and routers from SynOptics Communications and Cisco Systems that
are transforming the world of wired computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Best of all, at a time when the computer industry is preparing a massive
invasion of the air, these wide and weak radios can handle voice, data and
even video at the same time. Further, by cheaply accommodating a move from
scores of large base stations to scores of thousands of minicells per city
- on poles, down alleys or in elevator shafts - the system fulfills the
promise of the computer revolution as a spectrum multiplier. Since each
new minicell can use all the frequencies currently used by a large cell
site, the multiplication of cells achieves a similar multiplication of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Steinbrecher receivers can accommodate the coming move into
higher frequencies. Banishing once and for all the concept of spectrum scarcity,
these high-dynamic-range receivers can already handle frequencies up to
the &quot;W band&quot; of 90 gigahertz and more.

Boundless Bandwidth
</B></PRE>
The future of wireless communications is boundless bandwidth, accomplished
through the Shannon strategy of wide and weak signals, moving to ever smaller
cells with lower power at higher frequencies. The PCN systems made possible
by Qualcomm and Steinbrecher apply this approach chiefly to voice and data.
Recent announcements by Bossard and Hovnanian extend the concept to television
video as well. Last December, they disclosed that their company, Cellular
Vision, was already wirelessly delivering 49 cable television channels to
350 homes near Brighton Beach, Long Island, in the 28-gigahertz band. They
declared a plan to soon sign up some 5,000 new customers a month all over
New York.<BR>
<BR>
Among engineers in cellular and cable firms, Cellular Vision evokes the
same responses of incredulity and denial familiar at Qualcomm and Steinbrecher.
Like them, Bossard is resolutely on the right side of the Shannon and Shockley
divide. In answer to the multitude of qualms and objections and demurrals,
all three companies cite the huge benefits of more bandwidth. Qualcomm can
assign some 416 times as much bandwidth to each call as a current cellular
or TDMA system. Steinbrecher's minicell receivers can process 4,160 times
as much bandwidth as an analog cell site or TDMA radio.<BR>
<BR>
Hovnanian achieves some 300 times the bandwidth of a broadcast TV station
and some three times the bandwidth of even a typical cable head end. For
Hovnanian's so-called multipoint local distribution system, the FCC has
allocated a total of two gigahertz between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz - one
gigahertz for TV and one gigahertz for experimental data and phone service.
This large swath of spectrum allows Cellular Vision to substitute bandwidth
for power. Using FM rather than the AM system of cable, Cellular Vision
gains the same kind of increased fidelity familiar in FM radio. Assigning
20 megahertz to each channel - three times the six megahertz of an analog
system - Cellular Vision proves the potency of wide and weak by getting
20 decibels - some 10 times - more signal quality. These extra decibels
come in handy in the rain.<BR>
<BR>
With a radius of three miles, Cellular Vision cells are about 100 times
smaller than telephone cells. Transmitting only 10 milliwatts per channel
over a three-mile radius, the system gets far better signal-to-noise ratios
than the three-watt radios of cellular phones or the multikilowatt systems
of AM radio or television broadcasts. The millimeter wavelengths at 28 gigahertz
allow narrowband high-gain antennas that lock onto the right signal and
isolate it from neighboring cells. At 28 gigahertz, small antennas command
the performance of much larger ones (for example, a six-inch antenna at
28 gigahertz is equivalent to a three-foot antenna at 4 gigahertz or a 300-foot
antenna at broadcast television frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
In Brighton Beach the receiving antennas, using a fixed- phased-array technology,
are just four inches square, and the transmitting antennas deliver 49 channels
from a one-inch omnidirectional device on a box the size of a suitcase.
Between cells, these transmitters can send programming and other information
through a conventional point-to-point microwave link.

Singing in the Rain
</B></PRE>
So what happens in the rain? Well, it seems that Cellular Vision does better
than conventional cable. When you have small cells in geodesic low-power
wireless networks using the full computational resources of modern microchips,
you have plenty of extra decibels in your signal-to-noise budget to endure
the most violent storms. Indeed, the 350 Brighton Beach customers of Cellular
Vision received continuous service during the November 1992 near hurricane
in New York, which brought floods that interrupted many cable networks for
hours. One competitive advantage of Cellular Vision over cable seems to
be less vulnerability to water.<BR>
<BR>
Moving television radically toward the regime of wide and weak, Bossard
and the Hovnanians have changed the dimensions of the air. However, they
cannot escape the usual burdens of the innovator. Any drastic innovation
must be some 10 times as good as what it replaces. Otherwise, the installed
base, engineering momentum and customer loyalty of the incumbents will prevail
against it.<BR>
<BR>
Cellular Vision faces a wired cable system with some $18 billion in installed
base. Already deploying fiber at a fast pace, cable companies plan to move
within the next year toward digital compression schemes that increase capacity
or resolution by a factor of between six and 10 (depending on the character
of the programming). That means some 500 digital channels or more. TCI,
the leading cable company, has ordered some one million cable converter
and decompression boxes from General Instruments' Jerrold subsidiary for
delivery late in 1993. In the U.S. cable industry, Hovnanian faces an aggressively
moving target. Most cable experts doubt he can make much of a dent.<BR>
<BR>
This view may be shortsighted. Clearly, Cellular Vision - and its likely
imitators - can compete in the many areas with incompetent cable systems,
in areas yet unreached by cable or in new projects launched by developers
such as the Hovnanians. In the rest of the world, cable systems are rare.
Cellular Vision is finding rich opportunities abroad, from Latvia to New
Zealand. Most of all, as time passes, Cellular Vision might find itself
increasingly well positioned for a world of untethered digital devices.<BR>
<BR>
Such a cellular system could be adapted to mobile telephone or computer
services. With a bit-error rate of one in 10 billion, it could theoretically
transmit computer data without error correction. With one gigahertz of bandwidth,
the system could function easily as a backbone for PCN applications, collecting
calls from handsets operating at lower frequencies and passing them on to
telephone or cellular central offices or to intelligent network facilities
of the local phone companies.<BR>
<BR>
The future local loop will combine telephone, teleputer and digital video
services, together with speech recognition and other complex features, in
patterns that will differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Easily customizable
from cell to cell, a system like Bossard's might well offer powerful advantages.<BR>
<BR>
In an era of bandwidth abundance, the Negroponte switch - with voice pushed
to the air and video onto wires - may well give way to this division between
fibersphere and atmosphere. With the fibersphere offering virtually unlimited
bandwidth for fixed communications over long distances, the local loop will
be the bottleneck, thronged with millions of wireless devices. Under these
conditions, a move to high-frequency cellular systems is imperative to carry
the increasing floods of digital video overflowing from the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, led by Qualcomm, Steinbrecher and Cellular Vision, a new generation
of companies is emerging to challenge the assumptions and structures of
the existing information economy. All these companies are recent startups,
with innovations entirely unexpected by international standards bodies,
university experts and government officials. They are the fruit of an entrepreneurial
America, guided by the marketplace into the microcosm and telecosm.

Why Imitate European Failures?
</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, the European and Japanese experiences with government-guided
strategies should give pause to proponents of similar policies here. Thirty
years of expensive industrial policy targeting computers has left the Europeans
with no significant computer firms at all. The Japanese have done better,
but even they have been losing market share across the board to the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
In the converging crescendos of advance in digital wireless telephony and
computing, progress is surging far beyond all the regulatory maps and guidebooks
of previous years. If the entire capacity of the 28-gigahertz band, renewed
every three miles, is open to telephony and video, bandwidth will be scarcely
more limiting in wireless than it is in glass.<BR>
<BR>
In this emerging world of boundless bandwidth, companies will prevail only
by transcending the folklore of scarcity and embracing the full promise
of the digital dawn. In an era of accelerating transition, the rule of success
will be self- cannibalization. Wire-line phone companies are not truly profitable
today; their reported earnings all spring from slow depreciation of installed
plant and equipment that are fast becoming worthless. As George Calhoun
of IMMC demonstrates in his superb new book, Wireless Access and the Local
Telephone Network (Artech, 1992), new digital wireless connections are already
less than one-third the cost of installing wire-line phones. For the RBOCs,
aggressively attacking their own obsolescent enterprises is their only hope
of prosperity.<BR>
<BR>
As Joseph Schlosser of Coopers & Lybrand observes, self- cannibalization
will not appear to be in the financial interests of the established firms;
it will not prove out in net-present- value terms. There will be no studies
to guarantee its success. Executives will have to earn their pay by going
with their gut. As semiconductor and computer companies have already learned,
phone and cable companies will discover that self-cannibalization is the
only way to succeed in this era - the only way to stop others from capturing
the heart of your business.<BR>
<BR>
This is the lesson of the last decade. When Craig McCaw sold his cable properties
and plunged into cellular telephony and $2 billion of Michael Milken's junk
bond debt, there was no way to prove him right. Today AT&T is preparing
to launch him as a rival to Bill Gates as the nation's richest man. Yet
McCaw cannot rest on his laurels; the hour of the cannibal is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
In theory, the transition should not be difficult for this resourceful and
ingenious entrepreneur, who has long been a leading prophet of ubiquitous
wireless phones and computers - his predicted personal digital assistant,
&quot;Charles.&quot; But a company that has paid billions for its 25-megahertz
national swath of long and strong frequencies faces especially acute dilemmas
in moving toward a regime of wide and weak. As a man - and company - that
has made such transitions before, McCaw is favored by history and by AT&amp;T.
As a giant pillar of the new establishment, though, McCaw may find it as
difficult to shift gears as did the computer establishment before him. The
stakes are even higher. The next decade will see the emergence of fortunes
in ever- changing transmutations of PCN, digital video, multimedia and wireless
computers that dwarf the yields of cable and cellular. The window of opportunity
opens wide and weak.

Philip Hope, divisional vice president for engineering systems of EDS,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has an IQ problem. His chief client and owner, General Motors, wants to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
interconnect thousands of 3-D graphics and computer aided engineering (CAE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
workstations with mainframes and supercomputers at Headquarters, with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
automated assembly equipment at factories in Lordstown, Indiana, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Detroit, with other powerful processors at their technical center in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren, Michigan, with their Opel plant in Ruesselheim, Germany, and with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their design center outside San Diego. On behalf of another client, Hope<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wants to link multimedia stations for remote diagnostics, X-ray analysis,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and pharmaceutical modeling in hospitals and universities across the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any function involving 3-D graphics, CAE, supercomputer visualization,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lossless diagnostic imaging, and advanced medical simulations demands large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth or communications power. Graphics workstations often operate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
screens with a million picture elements (pixels), and use progressive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
scanning at 60 frames or images a second. Each pixel may entail 24 bits
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
color. That adds up fast to billions of bits (gigabits) a second. And<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that's for last year's technology in a computer industry that is doubling<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
its powers and cost effectiveness every year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope needs is bandwidth and connections. The leading bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and connections people have always been the telephone companies. But when<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope goes to the telephone companies, they want to tell him about<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligence: their Advanced Intelligent Network which will be coming on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
line over the next decade or so and will solve all his problems. For now,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they have what they call DS-3 services available in many areas, operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T-3 lines at 45 megabits (million bits) a second. These facilities are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ample for most computer uses and working together with several different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Hope should be able to acquire<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
these services in time for a General Motors takeover by Toyota.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope has been through this before. In the early 1980s, he actually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wanted D-3 services. Then he was interconnecting facilities in Southeast,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michigan, with plants in Indiana and Ohio. But Michigan Bell could not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply the lines in time. EDS had to build a network of microwave towers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to bear the 45 megabit traffic. Later in the decade, the phone companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have even offered him higher capacity fiber optic lines, with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
requirement that the optical bits be slowed down and run periodically<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through an electronic interface so the telco could count the number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;equivalent channels&quot; being used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope and others in the systems integration business need is not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligent networks tomorrow but dumb bandwidth that they can deliver to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their customers flexibly, cheaply, and now. To prepare for future demand,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they want the network to use fiber optics. It so happens that America's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies have some two million miles of mostly unused fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines in the ground today, kept as redundant capacity for future needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope would like to be able to tap into this &quot;dark fiber&quot; for his
own<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the rapidly expanding field of computer services, EDS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
epitomizes the needs of an information economy. With a backlog of 22<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollars in already contracted business, EDS is currently a seven<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollar company growing revenues at an annual rate of 15 percent,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some three times as fast as the phone companies. EDS will add a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollars or so in new sales in 1992 alone. If the company is to continue
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply leading edge services to its customers, it must command leading edge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications. To EDS, that means dumb and dark networks.<BR>

The &quot;Dark Fiber&quot; Case<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That need has driven EDS into an active role as an ex parte pleader in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Case 911416, currently bogging down in the District of Columbia<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Court of Appeals as the so-called &quot;dark fiber&quot; case. On
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
surface, the case, known as Southwestern Bell et al versus the Federal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department, pits four<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell telephone companies against the FCC. But the legal maneuvers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
actually reflect a rising conflict between the Bells and several large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
corporate clients over the future of communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond all the legal posturing, the question at issue is whether fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks should be dumb and dark, and cheap, the way EDS and other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers like them. Or whether they should be bright and smart, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;strategically&quot; priced, the way the telephone companies want them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the side of intelligence and light are the phone companies;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southwestern Bell, U.S. West, Bell South, and Bell Atlantic. The forces
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
darkness include key officials at the FCC and such companies as Shell Oil,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the information services arm of McDonald Douglas, long distance network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider Wiltel, as well as EDS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For most of the four year course of the struggle, it has passed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unnoticed by the media. In summary, the issue may not seem portentous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The large corporate customers want dark fiber; the FCC mandates that it
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplied; the Bells want out of the business. But for all their obscurity,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the proceedings raise what for the next twenty years will be the central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
issue in communications law and technology. The issue, if not the possible<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trial itself, will shape the future of both the computer and telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries during a period when they are merging to form the spearhead of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dark fiber&quot; is simply a glass fiber optic thread with nothing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
attached to it, (ie. no light being sent through it). In this &quot;unlit&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
condition, it is available for use without the intermediation of phone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company electronics or intelligent services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, the Bells leased some of their dark fiber lines to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
several large corporations on an individual case basis. These companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
learned to love dark fiber. But when they tried to renew their leases with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the Bells, the Bells clanged no! Why don't you leave the interconnections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and protocols to us? Why don't you use our marvellous smart network with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the acronyms and intelligent services? Why don't you let us meter your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
use of the fiber and send you a convenient monthly bill for each packet
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bits you send?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EDS and the other firms rejected the offer; they preferred that dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber to the intelligent network. When the Bells persisted in an effort
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
deny new leases, the companies went to the FCC to require the Bells, as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
regulated &quot;common carrier&quot; telephone companies, to continue supplying
dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the fall of 1990, the FCC ruled that the phone companies would have<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to offer dark fiber to all comers under the rules of common carriage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than accept this new burden, the phone companies petitioned to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
withdraw from the business entirely under what is called a rule 214<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
application. Since the FCC has not acted on this petition, the Bells are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
preparing to go to court to force the issue. Their corporate customers are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ready to litigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is safe to say that none of the participants fully comprehend the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
significance of their courthouse confrontation. To the Bells, after all
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
said and done, the key problem is probably the price. Under the existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
tariff, they are required to offer this service to anyone who wants it for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an average price of approximately $150 per strand of fiber per month. As<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an offering that competes with their T-3 45 megabit (millions of bits) a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second lines and other forthcoming marvels, dark fiber threatens to gobble<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up their future as vendors of broadband communications to offices, even
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cable TV preempts them as broadband providers to homes. Since the Bells'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
profits on data are growing some 10 times as fast as their profits on voice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephony, they see dark fiber as a menace to their most promising markets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The technological portents, however, are far more significant even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than the legal and business issues. The coming triumph of dark fiber will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mean not only the end of the telephone industry as we know it but also the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
end of the telephone industry as they plan it: a vast intelligent fabric<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of sophisticated information services. It also could mean a thoroughgoing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restructuring of a computer industry increasingly dedicated to supplying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;smart networks.&quot; Indeed, for most of the world's communications
companies,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
professors of communications theory, and designers of new computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, the triumph of dark and dumb means &quot;back to the drawing board,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
if not back to the dark ages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the new dark ages cannot be held back.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Springing out the depths of IBM's huge Watson Laboratories is a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powerful new invention: the all optical network, that will soon relegate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all bright and smart executives to the Troglodyte file and make dumb and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dark the winning rule in communications.<BR>

The Wringer Effect<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the structure of nations and economies goes through<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a technological wringer. A new invention radically reduces the price of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
key factor of production and precipitates an industrial revolution. Before<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
long, every competitive business in the economy must wring out the residue<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the old costs and customs from all its products and practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The steam engine, for example, drastically reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
physical force. Power once wreaked at great expense from human and animal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
muscle pulsed cheaply and tirelessly from machines burning coal and oil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the world, dominance inexorably shifted to businesses and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nations that reorganized themselves to exploit the suddenly cheap resource.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually every human industry and activity, from agriculture and sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transport to printing and war, had to centralize and capitalize itself to<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Putting the world through the technological wringer over the last<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
three decades has been the integrated circuit, the IC. Invented by Robert<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Noyce of Intel and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1959, the IC put<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire systems of tiny transistor switches, capacitors, resistors, diodes,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and other once costly electronic devices on one tiny microchip. Made<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chiefly of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, three of the most common<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
substances on earth, the microchip eventually reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic circuitry by a factor of a million.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As industry guru Andrew Rappaport has pointed out, electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
designers now treat transistors as virtually free. Indeed, on memory<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chips, they cost some 400 millionths of a cent. To waste time or battery<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power or radio frequencies may be culpable acts, but to waste transistors<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is the essence of thrift. Today you use millions of them slightly to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enhance your TV picture or to play a game of solitaire or to fax Doonsbury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to Grandma. If you do not use transistors in your cars, your offices, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone systems, your design centers, your factories, your farm gear,
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your missiles, you go out of business. If you don't waste transistors,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your cost structure will cripple you. Your product will be either too<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive, too slow, too late, or too low in quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Endowing every information age engineer or PC hacker with the creative<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
potential of a factory owner of the industrial age, the microchip reversed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the centralizing thrust of the previous era. All nations and businesses<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had to adapt to the centrifugal law of the microcosm, flattening<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hierarchies, outsourcing services, liberating engineers, shedding middle<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
management. If you did not adapt your business systems to the new regime,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you would no longer be a factor in the world balance of economic and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
military power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the next decade or so, industry will go through a new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology wringer and submit to a new law: the law of the telecosm. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new wringer, the new integrated circuit, is called the all optical network.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a communications system that runs entirely in glass. Unlike existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optic networks, which convert light signals to electronic form in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
order to amplify or switch them, the all optical network is entirely<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
photonic. From the first conversion of the signal from your phone or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer to the final conversion to voice or data at the destination, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
message flies through glass on wings of light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the old integrated circuit put entire electronic systems on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single slivers of silicon, the new IC will put entire communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems on seamless webs of silica. Wrought in threads as thin as a human<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hair, this silica is so pure that you could see through a window of it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seventy miles thick. But what makes the new wringer roll with all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
force of the microchip revolution before it is not the purity but the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
price. Just as the old IC made transistor power virtually free, the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, the all optical network, will make communications power virtually free.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another word for communications power is bandwidth. Just as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire world had to learn to waste transistors, the entire world will now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to learn how to waste bandwidth. In the 1990s and beyond, every<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry and economy will go through the wringer again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The impact on the organization of companies and economies, however,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has yet to become clear. What is the law of the telecosm? Will the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology reverse the centrifugal force of the microchip revolution...or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
consummate it? To understand the message of the new regime, we must follow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the rule of microcosmic prophet Carver Mead of Caltech: &quot;Listen to
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology...and find out what it is telling us.&quot;<BR>

The Shannon-Shockley Regime<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
The father of the all-optical-network, the man who coined the phrase,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
built the first fully functional system, and wrote the definitive book on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the subject, is Paul E. Green, Jr. of Watson Laboratory at IBM. Now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
standing directly in the path of Green's wringer is Robert Lucky, who some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seven years ago at a conference at Cornell first gave Green the idea that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an all optical network might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The leading intellectual in telephony, Lucky recently shocked the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry by shifting from AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, where he was executive director<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of research, to Bellcore, the laboratory of the Regional Bell Operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies (RBOCs). There he will soon have to confront the implications
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's innovation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplating the new technology, Lucky recalls a course on data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks that he used to teach many years ago with Green. As a computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
man, Green relished the contrast between the onrushing efficiencies in his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology and the relative dormancy in communications. Indeed, for some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twenty five years, while computer powers rose a millionfold, network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacities increased about a thousandfold. It was not until the late 1980s<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that most long distance data networks much surpassed the Pentagon's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ARPANET&quot; running at 50 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second
since the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mid sixties.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was the era dominated by the powerful mathematic visions and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
theories of Claude Shannon of MIT and Bell Labs. Shannon was the reclusive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
genius who invented Information Theory to ascertain the absolute carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity of any communications channel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether wire or air, channels were assumed to be narrow and noisy, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way God made them (sometimes with help from AT&amp;T). Typical were the
copper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone lines that still link every household to the telephone network and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the air waves that still bear radio and television signals and static.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all-purpose remedy for these narrow, noisy channels was powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Invented at Bell Laboratories by a team headed by William<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shockley and then developed by Robert Noyce and other Shockley proteges
in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley, silicon transistors and integrated circuits engendered a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
constant exponential upsurge of computing power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throwing ever more millions of ever faster and cheaper transistors at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every problem, engineers created fast computers, multiplexors, and switches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that seemed to surmount and outsmart every limit of bandwidth or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restriction of wire. This process continues today with heroic new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression tools that allow the creation of full video conferences over
64<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilobit telephone connections. Scientists at Bellcore are now even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
proposing new ways of using the Motion Picture Engineering Group (MPEG)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression standard to send full motion movies at 1.5 megabits a second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
over the 4 kilohertz twisted pair copper wires to the home. Using ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
faster computers, the telephone company is saying it can give you pay-per-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
view movies without installing fiber, or even coaxial cable, to the home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Shannon-Shockley era, the communications might be noisy and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
error prone, but smart electronics could encode and decode messages in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
complex ways that allowed efficient identification and correction of all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
errors. The Shannon channel might be narrow, but fast multiplexors allowed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it to be divided into time slots accommodating a large number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simultaneous users in a system called time division multiplexing. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
channel might clog up when large numbers of users attempted to communicate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with each other at once, but collision detectors or token passers could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sort it all out in nanoseconds. Graphics and video might impose immense<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods of bits on the system, but compression technology could reduce the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods to a manageable trickle with little or no loss of picture quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If all else failed, powerful electronic switches could compensate for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
almost any bandwidth limitations. Switching could make up for the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inadequate bandwidth at the terminals by relieving the network of the need<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to broadcast all signals to every destination. Instead, the central switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could receive all signals and then route them to their appropriate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, this is the essential strategy of the telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies: compensate for narrow noisy bandwidth with ever more powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and intelligent digital electronics. Their &quot;core competence,&quot;
the Bells<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hasten to tell you, is switching. They make up for the shortcomings of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
copper wires by providing smart, powerful digital switches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Their vision for the future is to join the computer business all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way, making these switches the entering wedge for ever more elaborate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information services. Switches will grow smarter and more sophisticated<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
until they provide an ever growing cornucopia of intelligent voice and fax<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
features, from caller ID and voice mail to personal communications systems<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that follow you and your number around the world from your car commute to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your vacation beach hideaway. In the end, these intelligent networks could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply virtually all the world's information needs, from movies, games and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
traffic updates to data libraries, financial services, news programs, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
weather reports, all climaxing with yellow pages that exfoliate into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigantic global mall of full motion video where your fingers walk (or your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
voice commands echo) from Harrods, to Jardines, to Akihabara, to Century
21<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
without you leaving the couch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the time when Green and Lucky taught their course, this strategy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for the future was only a glimmer in the minds of telephone visionaries.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the essence of it was already in place. As Green pointed out,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies' response to sluggishness in communications was to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enter the computer industry, where progress was faster. The creativity of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
digital electronics would save the telephone industry from technical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stagnation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky, however, protested to Green that it was unjust to compare the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two fields. Computers and telecom, as Lucky explained it, operate on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entirely different scales. Computers work in the microscale world of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, putting ever more thousands of wires and switches on single slivers
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
silicon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, telecommunications functions in the macroworld, laying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
out wires and switches across mostly silicon landscapes and seabeds. It<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
necessarily entails a continental, or even intercontinental stretch of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cables, microwave towers, switches, and poles. &quot;How was it possible,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky asked, &quot;to make such a large scale system inexpensive?&quot;
Inherent in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the structure and even the physics of computers and telecommunications,
so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it seemed to Lucky two decades ago, was a communications bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Lucky remembers it, Green was never satisfied with Lucky's point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green believed that someday communications could achieve miracles<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to the integrated circuit in computing....<BR>

<BR>
The Bandwidth Scandal<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, as Lucky was the first to announce, fiber optics has utterly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
overthrown the previous relationship between fast computers and slow wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it is computer technology that imposes the bottleneck on the vast<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vistas of dark fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A silicon transistor can change its state some 2.5 billion times a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second in response to light pulses (bundles of photons) hitting a photo-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
detector. Since it would take a human being a thousand years or so of 10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hour workdays even to count to two billion, two billion cycles in a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second (two gigahertz) might seem a sprightly pace. But in the world of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optics running at the speed and frequencies of light, even a rate
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two billion cycles a second is a humbling bow to the slothful pace of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Since optical signals still have to be routed to their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
destinations through computer switches, communications now suffers from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what is known as the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is this electronic bottleneck, the entire Bell edifice of Shannon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and Shockley, that Paul Green plans to blow away with his all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks. Green is targeting what is a secret scandal of modern<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecommunications: the huge gap between the real capacity of fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and the actual speed of telephone communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In communications systems, the number of waves per second (or hertz)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
represents a rough measure of its potential bandwidth or ultimate carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity. The bandwidth of a radio system, for example, is determined by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the frequency of each station or channel and by the number of stations that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
can fit within the band. Your AM dial, for example, runs from around 535<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand hertz (kilohertz) to 1705 kilohertz and each station uses some
10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilohertz. With an ideal receiver, the AM passband might carry 117<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some 25 thousand gigahertz in each of three groups of frequencies (three<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands) through which fiber can transmit light over long distances. At<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a gigahertz per terminal, this bandwidth might accommodate some 25,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supercomputer &quot;stations&quot; (or 2.5 billion AM stations). Using what
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
called dispersion shifted fiber, it may be possible to use two of these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands at once: a total of some 40 or 50 thousand gigahertz. For<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparison, consider all the radio frequencies currently used in the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for radio, television, microwave, and satellite communications and multiply<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by two thousand. The bandwidth of one fiber thread could carry more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two thousand times as much information as all these radio and microwave<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies that currently comprise the &quot;air.&quot; One fiber thread
could bear<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twice the traffic on the phone network during the peak hour of Mothers'
Day<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in the U.S. (the heaviest load currently managed by the phone system).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet even for point-to-point long distance links, let alone connections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to homes, telephone and computer network engineers now turn their backs
on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
this immense capacity and use perhaps one or two fifty thousandths it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deferring to the electronic bottleneck, the telephone industry uses fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
merely as a superior replacement for the copper wires, coaxial cables,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
satellite links, and microwave towers that connected the local central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
office switches to one another for long distance calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last 15 years, the Bell Laboratory record for fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication has run from 10 megabits per second over a one kilometer span<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to some 10 gigabits per second over nearly one thousand kilometers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the heroic advances in point-to-point links between central offices<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
continued to use essentially one frequency on a fiber thread, while<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoring its intrinsic power to accommodate thousands of useful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In a world of all optical networks, this strategy is bankrupt. No<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
longer will it be possible to throw more transistors, however cheap and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fast, at the switching problem. Electronic speeds have become an<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
insuperable bottleneck obstructing the vast vistas of dark fiber beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So called gigabit networks planned by the telephone and computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies will not do. What is needed is not a gigabit spread among many<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals, but a large network functioning at a gigabit per second per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demands of EDS offer a hint of the most urgent business needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Added to them will be consumer demands. True high definition television,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to movies in resolution, requires close to gigabit-a-second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, particularly if the program is dispatched to the viewer in burst<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mode all at once in a few seconds down the fiber, or if the user is given
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chance to shape the picture, choose a vantage point, window several images<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at once, or experience three dimensions. When true broadband channels<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
become available, there will be a flood of new applications comparable to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the thousands of new uses of the IC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No foreseeable progress in electronics can overcome the electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bottleneck. To do that, we need an entirely new communications regime. In<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the form of the all optical network, this regime is now at hand.<BR>

Law Of The Telecosm: Networks Dumb As A Stone<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime will use fiber not as a replacement for copper wires<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but as a new form of far more capacious and error-free air. Through a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
system called wavelength division multiplexing and access, computers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephones will tune into desired messages in the fibersphere the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios now tune into desired signals in the atmosphere. The fibersphere<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be intrinsically as dumb and dark as the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime overcomes the electronic bottleneck by altogether<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
banishing electronics from the network. But, ask the telcos in unison,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what about the switches? As long as the network is switched, it must be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
partly electronic. Unless the network is switched, it is not a true any-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to-any network. It is a broadcast system. It may offer a cornucopia of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services. But it cannot serve as a common carrier like the phone network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
allowing any party to reach any other. Without intelligent switching it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cannot provide personal communications nets that can follow you wherever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you go. Without intelligent switching, the all optical network, so they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
say, is just a glorified cable system.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

These critics fail to grasp a central rule of the telecosm: bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is a nearly perfect substitute for switching. With sufficient physical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it is possible to simulate any kind of logical switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
whatsoever. Bandwidth allows creation of virtual switches that to the user<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seem to function exactly the way physical switches do. You can send all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
messages everywhere in the network, include all needed codes and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
instructions for correcting, decrypting, and reading them, and allow each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength, just like
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two-way radio. When the terminals are smart enough and the bandwidth great<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enough, your all optical network can be as dumb as a stone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last several years, all optical network experiments have been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conducted around the world, from Bellcore in New Jersey to NTT at Yokosuka,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Japan. British Telecom has used wavelength division multiplexing to link<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
four telephone central offices in London. Columbia's Telecom Center has<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launched a &quot;Teranet&quot; that lacks tunable lasers or receivers but
can<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
logically simulate them. Bell Laboratories has generated most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology but as a long distance specialist has focussed on the project
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sending gigabits of information thousands of miles without amplifiers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only fully functional system is the Rainbow created by Paul Green at IBM.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As happens so often in this a world of technical disciplines sliced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
into arbitrary fortes and fields, the large advances come from the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrators. Paul Green is neither a laser physicist, nor an optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
engineer, nor a telecommunications theorist. At IBM, his work has ranged<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
from overseeing speech recognition projects at Watson Labs to shaping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company strategy at corporate headquarters in Armonk. His most recent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
success was supervising development of the new APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Network) protocol. According to an IBM announcement in March, APPN will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
replace the venerable SNA (systems network architecture) that has been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
synonymous with IBM networking for more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green took some pride in this announcement, but by that time, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
project was long in his past. He was finishing the copy editing on his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
magisterial tome on Fiber Optic Networks (published this summer by Prentice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hall). And he was moving on to more advanced versions of the Rainbow which<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
he and his team had introduced in December 1991 at the Telecom 91<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Conference in Geneva and which has been installed between the various<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
branches of Watson Laboratories in Westchester County, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker points out, a new technology cannot displace an old<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
one unless it is proven at least 10 times better. Otherwise the billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of installed base and thousands of engineers committed
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
improving the old technology will suffice to block the new one. The job
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Green's 15 man team at IBM is to meet that tenfold test.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's all optical network creates a fibersphere as neutral and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passive as the atmosphere. It can be addressed by computers the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios and television sets connect to the air. Consisting entirely of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unpowered glass and passive spitters and couplers, the fibersphere is dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dumb. Any variety of terminals can interconnect across it at the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time using any protocols they choose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as radios in the atmosphere, computer receivers connected to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere do not find a series of bits in a message; they tune into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wavelength or frequency. Because available Fabry Perot tunable filters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
today have larger bandwidth than tunable lasers, Green chose to locate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rainbow's tuning at the receiver and have transmitters each operate at a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fixed wavelength. But future networks can use any combination of tunable<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
equipment at either end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Green began the project in 1987, the industry stood in the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
general position as the pioneers of radio in the early years of that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry. They had seemingly unlimited bandwidth before them, but lacked<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters and receivers powerful enough to use it effectively. Radio<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters suffered &quot;splitting losses&quot; as they broadcast their
signals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
across the countryside. Green's optical messages lose power everytime they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are split off to be sent to another terminal or are tapped by a receiver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The radio industry solved this problem by the development of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
audion triode amplifier. Green needed an all optical amplifier to replace<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the optoelectronic repeaters that now constitute the most widespread<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic bottleneck in fiber. Amplifiers in current fiber networks first<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert the optical signal to an electronic signal, enhance it, and then<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert it back to photons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the pioneers of radio, Green soon had his amplifier in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following concepts pioneered by David Payne at the University of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southhampton in England, a Bell Laboratories group led by Emmanuel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Desurvire and Randy Giles developed a workable all optical device. They<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
showed that a short stretch of fiber doped with erbium, a rare earth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mineral, and excited by a cheap laser diode, can function as a powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier over the entire wavelength range of a 25,000 gigahertz system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today such photonic amplifiers enhance signals in a working system of links<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between Naples and Pomezia on the west coast of Italy. Manufactured in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
packages between two and three cubic inches in size, these amplifiers fit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
anywhere in an optical network for enhancing signals without electronics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This invention overcame the most fundamental disadvantage of optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks compared to electronic networks. You can tap into an electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
network as often as desired without weakening the voltage signal. Although<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
resistance and capacitance will weaken the current, there are no splitting<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
losses in a voltage divider. Photonic signals, by contrast, suffer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
splitting losses every time they are tapped; they lose photons until<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
eventually there are none left. The cheap and compact all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier solves this problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Not only did Green and his IBM colleagues create working all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, they also reduced the interface optoelectronics to a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microchannel plug-in card that can fit in any IBM PS/2 level personal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer or R6000 workstation. Using off-the-shelf components costing a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
total of $16,000 per station, Rainbow achieved a capacity more than 90<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
times greater than FDDI at an initial cost merely four times as much.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Jack Kilby's first ICs were not better than previous adders<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and oscillators, the Rainbow I is not better in some respects than rival<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks based on electronics. At present it connects only 32 computers
at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a speed of some 300 megabits per second, for a total bandwidth of 9.5<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigabits. This rate is huge compared to most other networks, but it is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
still well below the target of a system that provides gigabit rates for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A more serious limitation is the lack of packet switching. Rather<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than communicating down a dedicated connection between two parties, like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phones do, computer networks send data in small batches, called packets,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
each bearing its own address. This requires switching back and forth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between packets millions of times a second. Neither the current Rainbow's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lasers nor its filters can tune from one message to another more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of times a second. This limitation is a serious problem for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
links to mainframes and supercomputers that may do many tasks at once in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
different windows on the screen and with connections to several other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Green shows, however, all these problems are well on the way to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
solution. A tide of new interest in all optical systems is sweeping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the world's optical laboratories. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a program for all optical networking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Green installed as the new President of the IEEE Communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Society, the technical journals are full of articles on new wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division technology. Every few months brings new reports of a faster laser<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with a broader bandwidth, or filter with faster tuning, or an ingenious
new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way to use bandwidth to simulate packet switching. Today lasers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
receivers can switch fast enough but they still lack the ability to cover<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the entire bandwidth needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key point, however, is that as demonstrated both in Geneva and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armonk, the Green system showed the potential efficiency of all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Even in their initial forms they are more cost effective in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth per dollar than any other network technology. Scheduled for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
introduction within the next two years, Rainbow III will comprise a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand stations operating at a gigabit a second, with the increasingly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
likely hope of fast packet switching capability. At that point, the system<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be a compelling commercial product at least hundreds of times more<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost effective than the competition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Without access to dark fiber, however, these networks will be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
worthless. If the telephone companies fail to supply it, they risk losing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
most of the fastest growing parts of their business: the data traffic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
which already contributes some 50 percent of their profits. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
also a possibility that they will lose much of their potential consumer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
business as well: the planned profits in pay-per-view films and electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yellow pages. This is the message of a second great prophet of dark fiber,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will Hicks of Southbridge, Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A venerable inventor of scores of optical products, Hicks believes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that Green's view of the future of fiber is too limited. Using wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division, Hicks can see the way to deliver some 500 megahertz two-way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
connections to all the homes in America for some $400 per home. That is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fifty times the 10 megahertz total capacity of an Ethernet (with no one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
else using it) for some 20 percent of the cost. That is capacity in each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
home for twenty digital two-way HDTV channels at once at perhaps half the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost of new telephone connections. Then, after a large consumer market<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
emerges for fiber optics, Hicks believes, Green's sophisticated computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services will follow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The consumer market, Hicks maintains, is the key to lowering the cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the components to a level where they can be widely used in office<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks as well. He cites the example of the compact disk laser diode.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once lasers were large and complex devices, chilled with liquid nitrogen,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and costing thousands of dollars; now they are as small as a grain of salt,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cheap as a box of cereal, and more numerous than phonograph needles. An<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
executive at Hitachi told Hicks that Hitachi could work a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation on laser diodes and amplifiers for all optical networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just tell me what price you want to pay and I'll tell you how many
you<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to buy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The divergence of views between the IBM executive and the wildcat<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inventor, however, is far less significant than their common vision of dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber as the future of communications. By the power of ever cheaper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it will transform all industries of the coming information age<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
just as radically as the power of cheaper transistors transformed the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries of the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the telephone companies, the age of ever smarter terminals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mandates the emergence of ever dumber networks. This is a major strategic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge; it takes a smart man to build a dumb network. But the telcos<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have the best laboratories and have already developed nearly all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
components of the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Telephone companies may complain of the large costs of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation of their system, but they command capital budgets as large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as the total revenues of the cable industry. Telcos may recoil in horror<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at the idea of dark fiber, but they command webs of the stuff ten times<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
larger than any other industry. Dumb and dark networks may not fit the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company self-image or advertising posture. But they promise larger<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
markets than the current phone company plan to choke off their future in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the labyrinthine nets of an &quot;intelligent switching fabric&quot; always
behind<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
schedule and full of software bugs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telephone companies cannot expect to impose a uniform network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
governed by universal protocols. The proliferation of digital protocols<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and interfaces is an inevitable effect of the promethean creativity of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer industry. Green explains, &quot;You cannot fix the protocol zoo.
You<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
must use bandwidth to accommodate the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Robert Pokress, a former switch designer at Bell Labs now head of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unifi Corporation, points out, telephone switches (now 80 percent software)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are already too complex to keep pace with the efflorescence of relatively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simple computer technology on their periphery. While computers become ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more lean and mean, turning to reduced instruction set processors, networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
need to adopt reduced instruction set architectures. The ultimate in dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dark is the fibersphere now incubating in their magnificent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The entrepreneurial folk in the computer industry may view this<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wrenching phone company adjustment with some satisfaction. But the fact
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that computer companies face a strategic reorientation as radical as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telcos do. In a world where ever smarter terminals require ever dumber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications, computer networks are as gorged and glutted with smarts
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company networks and even less capacious. The nation's most<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
brilliant nerds, commanding the 200 MIPS Silicon Graphics superstations
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mac Quadra multimedia power plants, humbly kneel before the 50 kilobit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines of the Internet and beseech the telcos to upgrade to 64 kilobit basic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ISDN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now addicted to the use of transistors to solve the problems of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limited bandwidth, the computer industry must use transistors to exploit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the opportunities of nearly unlimited bandwidth. When home-based machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are optimized for manipulating high resolution digital video at high<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speeds, they will necessarily command what are now called supercomputer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powers. This will mean that the dominant computer technology will emerge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
first not in the office market but in the consumer market. The major<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge for the computer industry is to change its focus from a few<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hundred million offices already full of computer technology to a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
living rooms now nearly devoid of it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies possess the advantage of already owning dumb networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
based on the essentials of the all optical model of broadcast and select--<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of customers seeking wavelengths or frequencies rather than switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
circuits. Cable companies already provide all the programs to all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals and allow them to tune in to the desired messages. Uniquely in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the world, U.S. cable firms already offer a broadband pipe to ninety<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
percent of American homes. These coaxial cables, operating at one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigahertz for several hundred feet, provide the basis for two way broadband<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services today. But the cable industry cannot become a full service<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplier of telecommunications until it changes its self-image from a cheap<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider of one way entertainment services into a common carrier of two
way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Above all, the cable industry cannot succeed in the digital<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
age if it continues to regard the personal computer as an alien and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
irrelevant machine.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Analogous to the integrated circuit in its economic power, the all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optical network is analogous to the massively parallel computer in its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technical paradigm. In the late 1980s in computers, the effort to make one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor function ever faster on a serial stream of data reached a point<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of diminishing returns. Superpipelining and superscalar gains hit their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limits. Despite experiments with Josephson Junctions, high electron<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mobility, and cryogenics, usable transistors simply could not made to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
switch much faster than a few gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Computer architects responded by creating machines with multiple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processors operating in parallel on multiple streams of data. While each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor worked more slowly than the fastest serial processors, thousands<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of slow processors in parallel could far outperform the fastest serial<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Measured by cost effectiveness, the massively parallel machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dwarfed the performance of conventional supercomputers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same pattern arose in communications and for many of the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
reasons. In the early 1990s the effort to increase the number of bits that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could be time division multiplexed down a fiber on a single frequency band<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had reached a point of diminishing returns. Again the switching speed of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transistors was the show stopper. The architects of all optical networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
responded by creating systems which can use not one wavelength or frequency<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but potentially thousands in parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the new systems could not outperform time division multiplexing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
on one frequency. But all optical networks opened up a vast vista of some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
75 thousand gigahertz of frequencies potentially usable for communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That immense potential of massively parallel frequencies left all methods<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of putting more bits on a single set of frequencies look as promising as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launching computers into the chill of outer space in order to accelerate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their switching speeds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the law of the microcosm made all terminals smart,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
distributing intelligence from the center to the edges of the network, so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the law of the telecosm creates a network dumb enough to accommodate the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
incredible onrush of intelligence on its periphery. Indeed, with the one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chip supercomputer on the way, manufacturable for under a hundred dollars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
toward the end of the decade, the law of the microcosm is still gaining<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
momentum. The fibersphere complements the promise of ubiquitous computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power with equally ubiquitous communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What happens, however, when not only transistors but also wires are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nearly free? As Robert Lucky observes in his forward to Paul Green's book,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of us have been conditioned to think that transmission is inherently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive; that we should use switching and processing wherever possible
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
minimize transmission.&quot; This is the law of the microcosm. But as Lucky<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speculates, &quot;The limitless bandwidth of fiber optics changes these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assumptions. Perhaps we should transmit signals thousands of miles to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
avoid even the simplest processing function.&quot; This is the law of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecosm: use bandwidth to simplify everything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Hillis of Thinking Machines Corporation offers a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vision, adding to Lucky's insight the further assertion that massively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
parallel computer architectures are so efficient that they can overthrow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the personal computer revolution. Hillis envisages a powerplant computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
model, with huge Thinking Machines at the center tapped by millions of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively dumb terminals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these speculations assume that the Law of the Telecosm usurps the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Law of the Microcosm. But in fact the two concepts function in different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ways in different domains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transistors use electrons to control, amplify, or switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons. But photonics differ radically from electronics. Because<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moving photons do not affect one another on contact, they cannot readily
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
used to control, amplify, or switch each other. Compared to electrons,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moreover, photons are huge: infrared photons at 1550 or 1300 nanometers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are larger than a micron across. They resist the miniaturization of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microcosm. For computing, photons are far inferior to electrons. With<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single electron electronics now in view, electrons will keep their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
advantage. For the foreseeable future, computers will be made with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are crippling flaws for photonic computing, however, are huge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assets for communicating. Because moving photons do not collide with each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
other or respond to electronic charges, they are inherently a two way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
medium. They are immune to lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrical power surges that destroy electronic equipment. Virtually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
noiseless and massless pulses of radiation, they move as fast and silently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Listening to the technology, as Caltech prophet Carver Mead<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
recommends, one sees a natural division of labor between photonics and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Photonics will dominate communications and electronics will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dominate computing. The two technologies do not compete; they are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
beautiful complements of each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm makes distributed computers (smart terminals)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more efficient regardless of the cost of linking them together. The law
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the telecosm makes dumb and dark networks more efficient regardless of how<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
numerous and smart are the terminals. Working together, however, these two<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laws of wires and switches impel ever more widely distributed information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the narrow bandwidth of current phone company connections that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
explains the persistence of centralized computing in a world of distributed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Narrowband connections require smart interfaces and complex<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
protocols and expensive data. Thus you get your online information from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only a few databases set up to accommodate queries over the phone lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You limit television broadcasting to a few local stations. Using the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively narrowband phone network or television system, it pays to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
concentrate memory and processing at one point and tap into the hub from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of remote locations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Using a broadband fiber system, by contrast, it will pay to distribute<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
memory and services to all points on the network. Broadband links will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
foster specialization. If the costs of communications are low, databases,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
libraries, and information services can specialize and be readily reached<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by customers from anywhere. On line services lose the economies of scale<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that lead a firm such as Dialog to attempt to concentrate most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
world's information in one set of giant archives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By making bandwidth nearly free, the new integrated circuit of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere will radically change the environment of all information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries and technologies. In all eras, companies tend to prevail by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maximizing the use of the cheapest resources. In the age of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere, they will use the huge intrinsic bandwidth of fiber, all 25<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand gigahertz or more, to replace nearly all the hundreds of billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of switches, bridges, routers, converters, codecs,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compressors, error correctors, and other devices, together with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trillions of lines of software code, that pervade the intelligent switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fabric of both telephone and computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The makers of all this equipment will resist mightily. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
no chance that the old regime can prevail by fighting cheap and simple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optics with costly and complex electronics and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical network will triumph for the same reason that the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrated circuit triumphed: it is incomparably cheaper than the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competition. Today, measured by the admittedly rough metric of MIPS per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollar, a personal computer is more than one thousand times more cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
effective than a mainframe. Within 10 years, the all optical network will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
be millions of times more cost effective than electronic networks. Just
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the electron rules in computers, the photon will rule the waves of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical ideal will not immediately usurp other technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Vacuum tubes reached their highest sales in the late 1970s. But just as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the IC inexorably exerted its influence on all industries, the all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology will impart constant pressure on all other communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Every competing system will have to adapt to its cost structure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, almost all electronic communications will go through the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wringer and emerge in glass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is the real portent of the dark fiber case wending its way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the courts. The future of the information age depends on the rise<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dumb and dark networks to accommodate the onrush of ever smarter<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Ultimately at stake is nothing less than the future of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer and communications infrastructure of the U.S. economy, its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competitiveness in world markets, and the consummation of the age of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Although the phone companies do not want to believe it, their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
future will be dark.

<HR><BR>
The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one huge fact: Without
immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a world power. Without immigration,
the U.S. could not have produced the computerized weapons that induced the
Soviet Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the U.S.
could not have built the atomic bomb during World War II, or the hydrogen
bomb in the early 1950s, or the MIRVs in the 1970s or the cruise missiles
for the Gulf War in the 1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military projects but
also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures in an information age economy.
No less than military superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance
and high standards of living today depend on outsiders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every high-technology company, big or small is like a Manhattan Project.
All must mobilize the personnel best trained and most able to perform a
specific function, and deliver a product within a window of opportunity
as fateful and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to the
small elite of human beings in the world capable of pioneering these new
scientific and engineering frontiers. For many specialized high-technology
tasks, the pool of potential talent around the world numbers about 10 people,
or even fewer. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
The Right People </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are running such a technology company, you will quickly discover
that the majority of this cognitive elite are not citizens of your country.
Unless you can find the right people wherever they may be, you will not
be able to launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless you
can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any other jobs at
all, and your country will forgo the cycle of new products, skills, and
businesses that sustain a world-leading standard of living. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their followers are
beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the movement of cabbage pickers and au
pair girls and the possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like
hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex crouching behind
them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as George Borjas of the University
of California, San Diego, and artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude
that the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or negligible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the evidence in overwhelming and undeniable; it is all around us,
in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from microwaves and air
bags to digital cable and satellite television, from home computers and
air conditioners to cellular phones and life saving pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. Without immigration over the last 50 years, I would estimate
that the U.S. real living standards would be at least 40% lower. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems from a basic
flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail to account for the indispensable
qualitative effects of genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability
to generate unique products and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses
are literally thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We
all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify or predict, except
in retrospect. But judging from the very rough metric of awards of mathematical
doctorates and other rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes,
patents, and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. are
foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of immigrants. A third of
all American Nobel Prize winners, for example were born overseas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A stellar example of these elates in action is Silicon Valley in California.
Silicon Valley companies have reduced the price of computer MIPs and memory
bits by a factor of some 10,000 in 2 1/2 decades. Although mainstream economists
neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these innovations, most of
the new value in the world economy over the last decade has stemmed, directly
or indirectly, from the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware
and software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel
developed the basic processes of microchip manufacture and created dynamic
and static random access memory. In other words, Intel laid the foundations
for the personal computer revolution and scores of other chip-bases industries
that employ the vast bulk of U.S. engineers today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two American born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were key founders
of Fairchild and Intel. But their achievements would have been impossible
without the help of Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-Benchkowski,
inventor of electrically erasable programmable ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor
of silicon gate technology and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi
Shima, layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course Andrew
Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved several intractable problems
of the metal oxide silicon technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All
these Intel engineers - and hundreds of other key contributors - were immigrants.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon Valley, from National
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic,
Actel, Atmel, Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the outset heavily depended on immigrants
in the laboratories and on engineering work benches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel,
Xicor, and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully one-third
of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. economy, with
Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even Alleys being hopefully launched
from Manhattan to Oregon, immigration becomes ever more vital to the future
of the U.S. economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the foundation
of silicon have arisen world-leading software and medical equipment industries
almost equally dependent on immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing
U.S. industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted jobs
in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still must turn to immigrants
for 5% of its domestic work force, despite the difficult and expensive legal
procedures required to import an alien. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
Freedom of Enterprise </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a Microsoft attorney,
declared that immigration bars could jeopardize the 58% of its revenue generated
overseas, threaten American dominance of advance &quot;client-server&quot;
business applications, and render &quot;stillborn&quot; the information
superhighway. In particular, Corning and other producers of fiber-optic
technology have faced a severe shortage of native engineers equipped to
pursue this specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning mathematics and the
hard sciences, America is the global technology and economic leader in spite
of, not because of , any properties of the American gene pool or dominant
culture. America prevails only because it offers the freedom of enterprise
and innovation to people from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress is contemplating,
is a decision to wreck the key element of the American technological miracle.
After botching the issues of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction,
and wasting a year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget,
the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body blow to the
intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must not cripple the new Manhattan
Projects of the U.S. economy in order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic
dream of ethnic purity and autarky.

<H1><CENTER>The Roots of Black Poverty </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by<BR>
<I><A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder </A></I></CENTER>
</H3>
<H5><A HREF="dispfthr.html">Read a response to this article by <BR>
Washington Post columnist William Raspberry</A></H5>
<BR>
<HR>Dinesh D'Souza is currently the perplexed benificiary and victim of
an uproar over his book <I>&quot;The End of Racism,&quot;</I> which emerged
in the midst of a momentous furor over the centrality of race in America.
Except for the always bravely Olympian sage Thomas Sowell, even conservative
blacks have fiercely renounced much of his argument along with his intemperate
language. How can anyone deny the power of racism in the face of the taped
ruminations of Mark Fuhrman, the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan the indignant
voices at the Million Man March, the radical split between the races reacting
to the acquittal of O.J. Simpson? <BR>
<BR>
I know how Mr. D'Souza feels. In 1979, I published a book called <I>&quot;Visible
Man: A True Story of Post Racist American.&quot;</I> Now this book is being
republished by the ICS Press in San Francisco. <I><A HREF="visible.html">&quot;Visible
Man&quot;</A></I> showed that white racism was not a significant problem
for American blacks in the late 1970's. If white racism was not much of
a problem in 1978, it is manifestly not a problem in 1995. <BR>
<H4>Black Achievement </H4>
<BR>
Neither I nor Mr. D'Souza denies the existence of racial feelings in America
and throughout the world. But far from being hostile to black achievement,
American whites celebrate blacks at every opportunity. In the truest test,
governed by messive voluntary choices in the marketplace, Americans have
made the National Basketball Association, 80% black, the most popular sports
league, Whitney Houston the most popular and richest American singer, Bill
Cosby the most popular and richest comedian, and Oprah Winfrey the most
prosperous entertainer. Far from showing racism, American employers, mostly
white, have given black women higher earnings, on average, than comparable
white women. Between 1973 and 1994, the current-dollar revenues of the top
100 black owned industrial companies, as listed by <I>Black Enterprise</I>
magazine, rose from $473 million to $6.7 billion, plus $4.9 billion in revenues
from auto dealerships. Blacks in America have far outperformed blacks in
any other society with a substantial black population. <BR>
<BR>
In my view, the most important finding in <I>&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;</I>
by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray was that after controlling for
age, IQ and gender, the average full-time worker actually out-earns the
average white by 1%. Let the IQ number stand for real educational attainment
(as opposed to degrees in easier subjects and from less rigorous institutions),
and it is clear that racial discrimination no longer limits black earnings.
A more appropriate standard, though, would include a correction for marital
status, since married men of all races earn some 30% more than single men
of the same age and credentials. Correcting the Murray figures for marital
status gives black men a dramatic edge in earnings over white men. Although
such comparisons are full of pitfalls, it is safe to say that black men
in the U.S. today earn more, not less, than truly comparable whites. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than admit this reality, the intelligentsia, black and white, would
rather pusue fantasies of racial hatred. As I discovered during appearances
related to the original publication of <I>&quot;Visible Man,&quot;</I> and
as Mr. D'Souza is now learning, denial of racism today is widely seen as
evidence of it. In the face of the fury of the charges of bigotry, whites
find it easier to go along than to tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Public opinion polls, for example, show that the beating of Rodney King
galvanized a newly intense feeling of alienation among blacks in America.
Yet anyone, regardless of race, who took the police on an eight- mile, high-speed
chase, and then charged at them at the end, should be grateful if he is
not shot (rather than beaten). Sensible people learn not to defy or insult
police officers who are performing an inevitably messy and treacherous job
under tremendous strain. Yet the white media almost unanimously confirmed
the black outrage. Today whites indulge the idea of reasonable doubt in
the Simpson trial, as if it were possible that a team of policemen would
or could contrive an instant frame-up of a supremely popular black athelete.
<BR>
<BR>
In effect, all America treats blacks as children who cannot be told the
truth. From Harvard Law School deans to ghetto social workers; from the
chairman of the New York Times to the editors of Time magazine, to the steady
drumbeat of three broadcast networks, eminent whites are constantly confirming
blacks in the crippling comfort of their belief in white racism. <BR>
<BR>
If racism explains next to nothing about black poverty and crime, what does
explain it? What is the real cause, so unspeakably unwelcome that it drives
opinion toward almost any other explanation, however false or unsavory?
The chief cause of black poverty is welfare state feminism. Thirty years
of affirmative action programs have artificially elevated black women into
economic power over black men. <BR>
<BR>
This regime prevailed from the highest levels of the economy, where black
female college graduates with five years on the job significantly outearned
black men in 1991, to the underclass, where a typical package of welfare
benefits produced disposable income 28% above a typical job in 1994. It
prevailed on college campuses, where more than 60% of the blacks are women.
It dominated government job training programs, where girls are found to
benefit far more than boys. It even invaded such male bastions as the cockpits
of fighter planes, police squad cars, fire stations, construction sites
and university athletic teams. In a grotesque abuse of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, judges have interpreted Title IX of the 1972 amendments as
requiring academic institutions, in effect, to retrench scholarships and
opportunities for superior black male athletes to advance the careers of
measurably inferior female athletes, white and black, soley on the basis
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
It is an unpopular fact of life that in all societies and in all races monogamous
marriage is based on patriarchal sex roles, with men the dominant provider.
Welfare state feminism destroyed black families by ravaging the male role
of provider. <BR>
<BR>
Some observers claim that black communities benefit from matriarchal institutions.
Looking more closely, however, you will find inner cities implacably ruled
by gangs of young men, with the &quot;matriarchs&quot; cowering in their
triple bolted apartments in fear of them. <BR>
<BR>
Men either dominate as providers or predators. There is hardly any other
option. The key problem of the underclass - the crucible of crime, the source
of violence, the root of poverty - is the utter failure of socialization
of young men through marriage. The problem resides in the nexus of men and
marriage. Yet nearly all the attention, subsidies, training opportunities
and therapies of the welfare state focus on helping women function without
marriage. The welfare state attacks the problem of the absence of husbands
by rendering husbands as entirely superfluous. &quot;Welfare reform&quot;
continues the policy giving welfare mothers new training and child care
benefits and further obviating marriage by pursuing unmarried fathers with
deadbeat dad campaigns. <BR>
<BR>
Today, in large American cities, fully 40% of young black men between the
ages of 17 and 35 are in prison, on probation, or on the lam; and some 40%
of young black women say they have been forced into unwanted sexual activity.
To fear young black males has become a mandate for survival on the streets
of many American cities. This unspeakable social tragedy - with all its
infuriating reverberations on law-abiding balck citizens - is the inevitavble
harvest of government policy. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>The Great Fiasco </H4>
<BR>
Even Margaret Mead recognized that in all cultures family values depend
on religious supports and male providers. The effort to unculcate ethical
behavior and sustain marriage without religious faith is the great fiasco
of the modern age. In order to relieve the pain of the poor, our soicety
must come to recognize that their problem is not lack of jobs or lack of
money but moral anarchy originating with the establishment and most sorely
victimizing blacks. <BR>
<BR>
With both the black and white establishments and even the leading Christian
churches succumbing to the siren appeal of unisex policy, what could be
more predictable than the emergence of patriarchal religion - however offensive
in some ways - as a galvanizing force among black men. If Mr. Farrakhan
is deeply culpable for his ethnic fanaticism, surely the entire U.S. establishment
is equally culpable for its fanatical assault on family roles. For all races,
patriarchal religion has played a central role in human civilization. Patriarchal
black churches, from Father Divines' mid-century movement to Christian fundamentalists
and Black muslims today - have served more as part of the solution than
as part of the problem of black poverty. <BR>
<BR>
These lessons have become increasingly relevant to whites who imagine that
they can sustain a civilization based on secular liberation from monogamous
sex roles. As the white illegitimacy rate moves toward the level reached
by blacks at the time of the Moynihan Report - and decisively surpasses
it in Britain - the events of recent weeks should ring a tocsin for all
Americans. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
What's wrong with welfare? Here's an answer you haven't heard: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key problem of the welfare culture is not unemployed women with
illegitimate children. It is the women's skewed and traumatic relationships
with men and boys. In a reversal of the usual pattern in civilized socieitie,
the women have the income and the ties to government authority and support.
The men are economically and socially subordinate.... This balance of power
virtually prohibits marriage which is everywhere based on the provider role
of men counterbalancing the sexual and domestic superiority of women.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I almost don't want to mention the source of this arresting notion - conservative
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> writing in the conservative American
Spectator (June 1995) - for fear that the name and affiliation might lead
some readers to suspend thought. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You see, of course, where Gilder is headed: Men, he believes, are the key
to strong families. And they are, the more successful welfare is - even
if it leads women to jobs, child care and improved earnings - the worse
it will be for families, because it will &quot;render the men still more
optional, desperate, feral, and single.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does any of this make sense? How would I feel, hearing this indispensable-man
argument, if I were female - especially if I were a single mother? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Already there has been a stream of books and articles (several of the latter
by me) arguing the negative effects of absent fathers on children and on
communities, or contending that the breakdown of marriage is the leading
indicator of social pathology, or otherwise calling for reclamation of men
and boys as the means of rescuing society. The Million Man March only underscored
the notion. Women must be wondering what makes us think men are God's primary
gift? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Gilder isn't quite saying we are. What he is saying is that children
need their fathers, too - and so do their mothers - and that welfare almost
calculatedly drives the men away, perpetuating both the worst effects of
welfare and the need for it. Listen: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire welfare state - from Donna Shalala to Bob Dole's Senate
offices - is relentlessly feminist, mandating preferences for women on construction
sites, in police cruisers, in Air Force jets and in athletic scholarships.
These programs necessarily concentrate their job incentives, training benefits,
and subsidies on women rather than on men because, in general, it is only
the mothers who are on welfare. The fathers use the apartments and take
the money of a series of welfare mothers, usually without joining the dole.
Thus the recipients of welfare-related work will mainly be women. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we know from reams of studies and centuries of experience that
only fathers can satisfactorily sustain families, reliably discipline teen-age
boys, and lift a community from poverty. The idea that welfare mothers can
do it while the government raises their children is incredibly naive....
The very idea that women with small children should work outside the home
is perverse. The welfare state has already deprived these children of fathers.
The workfare state proposes to take away the mothers as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Implicit in Gilder's analysis is his thesis of woman as civilizer of naturally
predatory man. How does she do it? By demanding commitment (which she needs)
in exchange for sex (his priority). Welfare eliminates the economic basis
for the commitment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unless they are tamed by marriage and the provider role,&quot; he
says, &quot;men become enemies of civilization and revert to their primordial
role as predators.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this blame-shifting drivel, as some surely will contend? Or has Gilder
found the virus that is killing our families and our communities? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He says it too harshly and too categorically, perhaps, but I think he is
on to something. The natural promiscuity of men combined with the increasing
unnecessity of men (except for sex) produces a breed frighteningly close
to Gilder's description of &quot;optional, desperate, feral and single.&quot;
We have to make men necessary again. <BR>

    <TITLE>The Network as Computer</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
From NORTEL<I> The Next Century: Perspectives on the Information Age<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Network as Computer</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><EM>by George Gilder <BR>
<BR>
</EM><IMG SRC="videonoise-purple.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>In the oceanic sweep of the information age, the once separate streams
of computers and telecom are converging into new digital floods of innovation
that shift as inexorably as the tides of the sea. As we rush toward a millennial
crest of invention, a new tidal shift is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of this shift is not the computer industry, which has long
ruled supreme, but the telecom equipment industry. Because average citizens
have always preferred communicating to computing, the shift from computers
to networks will transform the fruits of progress - once chiefly accessible
from the lofty reaches of the elite - to an everyday harvest as popular
and ubiquitous as the phone.<BR>
<BR>
The latest cycles began in the years following the Second World War, when
the telecommunications industry spearheaded research that brought such key
advances as the transistor and the laser. Over the last forty years, the
computer industry has ridden the transistor to dominance in the information
economy. New laser-based breakthroughs in fiber optics, however, now promise
to turn the tide again toward telephony. While the computer will still be
king, the network will become the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The siege of computer progress has been sustained over the last twenty years
by Moore's Law, based on the famous prophecy by Intel founder Gordon Moore
in 1978 that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every
eighteen months. Implicit in Moore's Law is a similar doubling every eighteen
months in computer power: the number of millions of instructions per second
(MIPS) that a single microprocessor or personal computer could perform.<BR>
<BR>
But the epoch of Moore's Law dominance is now ending. The silicon microcosm
- the physical source of innovation in microchips and computers - is giving
way to the optical telecosm and its even more rapid pace of advance in communications
power.<BR>
<BR>
Signaling the transition from microcosm to telecosm is one key metric: the
performance of publicly available networks compared to the performance of
the internal computer buses that connect microprocessor central processing
units (CPUs) to memories, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors. Today, new
fiber optics and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems being launched
by leading telco suppliers are overthrowing the key foundations of computer
industry supremacy on the leading edges of innovation. Now in view, as early
as next year, is a bandwidth crossover point where the communications power
of widely available telephone networks will surpass for the first time the
communications power of the internal buses of personal computers.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, while telecom bandwidth apparently stagnated, North American
phone companies installed some ten million miles of optical fiber - in effect,
a new bandwidth infrastructure in North America. So far, less than one-millionth
of the potential communications power of this fiber has been delivered to
customers.<BR>
<BR>
Now this potential bandwidth is about to erupt as a kinetic force of change
in the information economy. Telephone companies plan to increase the maximum
bandwidth of corporate services from the current 2.4 gigabits per second
to 40 gigabits per second in 1997. They will quadruple capacity, and quadruple
it again within the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
The explosion of bandwidth, however, will not transform the information
economy until it is delivered to people's homes. Delivery of the new tides
of bandwidth requires that telcos commanding advanced fiber and switch capabilities
collaborate with cable companies possessing broadband lines to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term bandwidth expander is ATM. It radically simplifies
the switching problem by putting all information in uniform 53-byte cells
that can be processed entirely in silicon chips without time-consuming access
to memory and software. With guaranteed delivery of cells on a fixed schedule
soon to reach a pace of 2.4 gigabits a second, ATM can manage multimedia
voice, data, and video all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
These new technologies can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and a remote archive or digital library. PCs will be able to
tap databases and libraries across the world as readily as they can reach
their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of telecom equipment, this new architecture provides huge
opportunities to launch new ATM systems on every scale, new network hardware
and software, and new optical communications equipment. The companies that
truly grasp that the network is the computer, and invest in the infrastructure
of the new networked economy, will dominate the decade.<BR>
<BR>
However, amid these torrents of bandwidth abundance, the greatest rewards
will accrue to people around the globe, joining the ever-expanding circles
of prosperity in an age of information.<BR>
<BR>
Many skeptics suggest that the new technologies will chiefly favor the already
prosperous and powerful in the industrialized countries. But the first beneficiaries
of the new age are Asian nations, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia and
China. Trapped in Third World poverty as recently as two decades ago, they
are now supplying crucial components to major telecom and computer companies
and leading the world in rates of economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade, digital networks will provide a new central nervous
system for the world economy. Transformed by convergence and computerization,
TV will burst forth in a new flowering of choice and empowerment. An abundance
of multimedia choices can remedy and reverse the cultural debacle of mass
market television. Transcending the current programming of the lowest common
denominator, video culture will effloresce into a plethora of products as
rich and various as books and magazines.<BR>
<BR>
Great cities will give up their current role as hives of industry and emerge
as havens of social activity and entertainment. On the network, an inner-city
child in public housing can pursue a curriculum far richer in learning resources
and far better adapted to personal needs and aptitudes than the program
of an elite suburban school today. Equipped with ATM and fiber-optic links,
small towns will become creative centers in the information economy. Productive
citizens will retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets
and communities. Hollywood and Wall Street will become historic curiosities
as their businesses diffuse to all points of the continent and the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Perfectly targeted to the most acute problems of the era, the new technologies
can reverse the spirals of decay afflicting many institutions and communities.
Traffic and pollution, ignorance and waste, can all give way to worldwide
webs of glass and light. <BR>
<BR>
The home will re-emerge as an industrial center, with marriages gaining
new roles and meanings around the evolving silicon hearths of a new cottage
economy, thus strengthening family values.<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the costs and raising the effectiveness of medical care will be
the on-line house call, sharing scarce diagnostic tools, tapping remote
specialists, and bringing busy doctors back to the patients' bedsides in
targeted teleconferences.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all these changes, one theme will triumph: the empowerment of
individual families and customers against remote and irresponsible organizations.
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or at the mall or in the local corporate center. Instead, they
will seek out and command their first choices in jobs, culture, entertainment,
and religion.<BR>
<BR>
Ranging across continents to find the best colleagues for every major project,
workers will scale new pinnacles of productivity and wealth. A culture of
first choices will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward
the mediocre, the vulgar, or the vicious.<BR>
<BR>
The age of mass manufacturing, mass marketing, and mass media brought capital
and labor together in vast pyramidal corporations, tying workers to the
machine and the tube. The explosive centrifuge of the telecosm will burst
these chains of industrial concentration. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and machine-age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth abundance not only fuels the advance of electronics; it also galvanizes
the growth of economies. The new media extend the webs of news and interconnection
that nourish markets and expand opportunity. <BR>
<BR>
Lavishing the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly
productive tools, and unleasing creativity with increasingly fertile and
targeted capital, the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope
to the masses of people who the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than giving millions of viewers access to five hundred channels of
one-way TV, the new technology will give all users two-way teleconferencing
with colleagues regardless of where they are - reading documents and books,
sharing multimedia experiences, consulting with specialists on your rare
disease at the Mayo Clinic or Columbia, touring Venice and Vancouver the
same day, dallying simultaneously at the Louvre and the London Museum, designing
a new building with an architect in Israel or a new dress with a couturier
in Paris or a new chip with a guru in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Through these channels, the poorest citizens will gain access to new worlds
of education, employment, entertainment, medical care, and communication
now commanded only by elites - a true transfer of power to the people everywhere.<BR>

<PRE>
What will happen over the next several years is that the external 
bandwidth of most computers--that is, the bandwidth of the 
asynchronous transfer mode networks that are being developed by 
some 600 companies and that are being deployed at an increasing 
pace--will be bigger than the internal bandwidth. And that will mean 
that computers will be able to tap remote databases and educational 
possibilities as readily as they tap their internal disk drives and CD-
ROMs. This means that, in a sense, the computer will hollow out, and 
the network will become the computer in a way that has never been 
true before. 


And the effect of this is that the Law of the Microcosm will join the 
Law of the Telecosm. The Law of the Microcosm says that if you take 
any number n transistors and put them on a single sliver of silicon, 
you get n-squared performance and value (thats one of the key 
exponentials that drive this era). The Law of the Telecosm says that 
if you take any number n computers and put them on a network you 
get n-squared performance and value, because each computer uses 
the network as a resource and is also a potential resource for the 
network.
	

And so the value of the network exponentially increases as the 
number of computers connected to it increases. And I think its the 
convergence of these two laws, both of which are central to the 
evolution of the computer industry, that will really shape the future. 
Its not going to be Hollywood executives who are going to be the 
chief drivers of the new age; they in fact will be victims of the new 
age. The chief drivers and the real winners are the computer and 
computer networking industries, as they interconnect Americas 
schools and colleges and homes into a truly new World Wide Web of 
glass and light. That is the real promise of the next era, and its going 
to happen faster than people expect, not more slowly. 


Theres still an optical illusion at the communications cliff at LANs 
end, but that can be quickly overcome by the use of cable 
technology--the coaxial that is already in the ground and connecting 
American homes, and particularly connecting to all the homes with 
computers. Last year there were some 26 million PCs in American 
homes, and 24 million of those homes had cable connections, and 
these cable connections are fully adequate to open the way for this 
transformation of the computer--the hollowing out of the computer, 
the moving of the computer onto the network, and the 
transformation of computer network architecture over the next 
decade.
	

So I think its a sure thing that education will be a much bigger 
market than entertainment. This is almost a certainty. Because 
education fits with computer technology, which is the driving force of 
this industry. But its not just the computer technology thats 
important, its the culture of the computer industry. Its the power of 
the commitment of increasing millions of citizens to this technology 
as a key channel for their creation of wealth and their advancement 
of learning.
	

And so its not just a technological issue, its a cultural issue, and 
the computer as a learning tool is a generator of wealth that will 
absorb an increasing share of our energies and creativity in the 
information age and will continue to expand its domain; whereas 
television will always be a disappointment because its essentially a 
diversion. It doesnt edify, it doesnt add to the national endowment, it 
tends to subtract from it. Its not the idiot box that will lead the U.S. 
into a new information age.


I think that the past years well-publicized efforts at convergence 
were really misconceived. US West and Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
turning to Hollywood talent agent Mike Ovitz is really rather 
pathetic, because when you think about it, if youre Mike Ovitz and 
you make a movie you really want it to go on everybodys conduit, 
whereas if youre Bell Atlantic and you run a network you want 
everybodys movies on that network. In other words, theres no 
benefit anymore from combining content and conduit in an era of 
truly broadband network. The exponential thrust comes from 
combining conduit with conduit, and allowing the people on the 
network to supply their own content to a great extent, in an 
entrepreneurial process thats almost entirely unpredictable.
	

But I think you can tell the general shape of the multimedia 
market that will emerge. It wont resemble Hollywood and it wont 
resemble broadcast television: It will resemble the book industry. 
There are about 80,000 books published every year in the United 
States, and the stores that are gaining share are the stores that offer 
the most choice. The key to the book industry is when a customer 
goes into a book store the customer gets his or her first choice. You 
get the book you want rather than a book thats been scheduled for 
you.
  

I think that same idea also gives us the key to finding the real 
opportunity in education in the information age. Students will get 
their first choice rather than some choice thats defined for them by 
some remote hierarchy. The power is migrating to the customer and 
that will be the driving force of the economy in the next decade, and 
it will be an exciting time.</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>An information technology visionary who writes compellingly about the 
relationship between technology and economics, George Gilder is the 
author of Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology 
(1989), Wealth and Poverty (1981), and numerous other works. His 1990 
book Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and 
American Life is now being issued by W.W. Norton Co. in a revised 
paperback edition with five new chapters.

	Gilder has been a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard and is currently a senior fellow of the Discovery 
Institute in Seattle. He lectures widely across the Country and around 
the world and will be a featured speaker at the Educom'94 conference 
this fall in San Antonio. Educom Review caught up with him just as he 
was about to leave for Europe to present a speech at Cambridge 
University.

Educom Review: You've used &quot;A Convergence of Corpses&quot; as the title for 
the prologue to Life after Television, and you've said that mergers such 
as the one recently attempted by Bell Atlantic and TCI &quot;mostly miss the 
point of the digital age.&quot; Who are all these corpses, and how are all 
these mergers missing the point?

<B>GILDER</B>: The real driving force of all this information technology is the 
triumph of the computer. Just as the personal computer essentially 
displaced the mainframe over the past ten years, over the next ten years 
the personal computer will displace the television set, the telephone, 
and an array of other appliances. So companies that attempt to exploit 
the opportunities of convergence by converging with TV sets, for 
example, tend to fail, as 3DO seems already to have failed, precisely 
because of that mistake. Meanwhile, Creative Labs was based on a less 
exciting technology--a soundboard for the PC--but has become an enormous 
company riding the tremendous ascendancy of 
personal computing.

<B>ER</B>: So your advice to 3DO would have been . . . ?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, my advice at the time was that they had better get 
connected to computers and regard computers as the interactive 
appliance. If they focused on the TV set, they would lose. And that's 
what seems to have been happening.
Other errors are being made by companies that target the set-top box and 
devote an enormous amount of design effort to squeezing computing power 
into the price point and form factor of a consumer electronics set-top 
box. 

<B>ER</B>: Why did 3DO ignore your advice?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I guess they were just infatuated with television. They'd 
come from founding MTV, and they imagined TV as an instrument with a 
future that somehow commands larger markets than the personal computer. 

But personal computers in homes are increasing ten times faster than 
television sets, and PC owners spend fifteen hundred bucks for the 
device itself and then another fifteen hundred bucks on software and 
peripherals, and within that price point you can accomplish anything 
that a set-top box or game machine can accomplish. And if you have 
broadband connections, for example, over cable lines through a cable 
modem, the PC can do anything the TV can do and do it just as well. 

That's the key limitation today: bandwidth. As Andy Grove says, infinite 
processing power will get you only so far with limited bandwidth. The 
key to the next generation of computer development is coupling the 
personal computer with broadband networks. 

Today, the personal computer is crippled by its need to devote most of 
its MIPs [million instructions per second], or a large portion of them, 
to compressing and decompressing any images that it uses. Thus 
teleconferencing, for example, and video telephones are so drastically 
unsatisfactory because all the computer MIPs are devoted to compressing 
and decompressing rather than to real computer functions. 

Once the PC is connected to broadband networks, it will really ascend to 
its dominant level in homes as well as offices. And that will be the 
crucial opportunity for educational materials as well.

<B>ER</B>: You say in Life after Television that &quot;TV ignores the reality that 
people are not inherently couch potatoes; given a chance they talk back 
and interact.&quot; Then how do you explain some of the disappointments of 
interactivity, such as GTE's Cerritos project, or the US West/TCI 
project in Denver, neither of which seemed to gain much loyalty from its 
subscribers?

<B>GILDER</B>: The explanation is that they all use the TV, and the TV is 
inherently a couch potato device, which is particularly lame at 
presenting text. Yet text is a crucial part of multimedia communications 
and interactivity. Those projects made the same error that 3DO made: 
they converged with a corpse. Unless you're a necrophiliac, that's not 
particularly gratifying.

<B>ER</B>: Alan Kay used the phrase &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; to express the concern 
that the new media would be mass communications oriented and that 
literacy would fall apart.

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, any instrument that creates &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; is going to 
fail, because it's going to make people poorer. Markets expand in the 
long run only if they are absolutely central industries in the economy--
if they're creating capital rather than depleting it. TV in general 
dissipates and deflates human capital, and game machines are 
distractions that fail to edify their users. 

The people who use PCs generate wealth with them rather than merely 
distract themselves, so they're willing to invest a lot more effort into 
their PCs. They're willing to master the intricacies of use, and they're 
also willing to contribute to the development of further applications. 
In contrast, all these consumer electronics devices are mostly self-
limiting, because they don't contribute to wealth creation, but instead 
actually distract people from their career and their higher pursuits.

<B>ER</B>: By emphasizing the extent to which people are different, don't you 
run the risk of ignoring how much they are actually the same, that is, 
of ignoring what we might uncharitably call the herd instinct that 
dictates a lot of fashion, a lot of politics, and a lot of life?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think that people are the same in relatively lower-level 
ways, so if you have a medium that appeals chiefly to the way people are 
the same, they're going to gravitate increasingly to prurient interests, 
morbid fears and anxieties, and shocks and sensations. If you do that, 
the whole culture will become depraved--and I think that's what happened 
with the TV--whereas I think that if you appeal to people's special 
curiosities and hobbies and career interests and other ambitions--if you 
appeal to people's first choices rather than their lowest-common-
denominator choices--then the culture gravitates toward excellence 
rather than toward mediocrity, toward distinction rather than prurient 
interest and titillation.

<B>ER</B>: So what becomes of the herd instinct? Does it go away?
GILDER: There will always be certain things that people still want to do 
in large numbers, but in general it's people as individuals or as 
members of homes and families that can cement to more edifying 
disciplines. A mob can just say yes or no, whereas an individual can 
articulate, can express subtle and complex ideas, can respond to art, 
can aspire toward God. 

Rather than encouraging the mass tendencies of the population, we should 
be trying to counteract them and to educate the population. Education is 
a fulfillment of individual distinction and excellence; it shouldn't be 
a pandering to mass taste and appetites. And to the extent that schools 
do try to cater to their students rather than to teach them, the schools 
will fail and will contribute to the general deterioration of learning.

<B>ER</B>: If we think of life before television as the age of the amateur 
(with social life focused on the family piano, on amateur theater 
groups, on sandlot baseball games), and life during television as the 
age of the professional (with social life organized around boob tube 
performances by millionaire actors, comedians, athletes, and 
politicians), how should we think about the quality of life after 
television? Will it help us back to the idyllic past of the amateur? Or 
will it be better than our past as well our present?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think it will be better. I think the culture will take a form 
more resembling the book culture than the TV culture. There are 55,000 
books published in the United States every year. There's a religious 
book market as big as the trade book market, and each of those markets 
amount to about $2.5 billion. There are a huge number of successful 
technical books and career books, and there's a wide diversity of 
literature. I think the book market is a much better reflection of 
American culture than the TV market, which I think is a perversion of 
American culture. 

In general, the interactive media culture will resemble book culture and 
literary culture more than it will the current mass culture. You know, 
the people who produce mass culture are the ultimate elitists. I've 
often debated with them, and they'll say to me, &quot;You don't understand, 
George, the reason that the boob tube is an idiot box is that people 
really are boobs. We've done market research. We know they're boobs.&quot;

 Well, I think they just don't understand the business. Of course, 
confronted with the boob tube, we're all boobs; when I get into a hotel 
room at night and start clicking through channels, I get distracted by 
the shocks and sensations just as anyone else would. The critical fact 
is that a mass medium is no good whatsoever at conveying educated ideas; 
if it happens to convey a sophisticated idea, that's just an accident. 

I think the French were perfectly right in trying to exclude U.S. 
television programs, because for the most part such programs are the 
ultimate realization of mass taste, and they are depraved and 
destructive. They are deeply destructive to American society, 
particularly to any effort to educate anyone in it. And yet the schools 
increasingly try to simulate the TV culture, which is their worst 
betrayal!

<B>ER</B>: Simulate TV culture in what way?

<B>GILDER</B>: By having students read dumb books that seem to be simulations 
of TV sensibility. By avoiding anything difficult. By trying to pander 
to the kids, to entertain them rather than teach them.

<B>ER</B>: Compare two serious approaches to television: PBS and C-SPAN. Some 
people have said that C-SPAN is what public television ought to be. What 
do you think?

<B>GILDER</B>: C-SPAN now exists without the aid of public TV, and PBS works at 
all only because of the garbage that's on all the other channels. Just 
by being explicitly elitist, PBS can shine luminously in the darkness. 
But beyond that, I just don't really believe any of these channels or 
networks have a future. And, particularly, I don't think TV news has any 
future at all. So I believe that although within the existing regime of 
thirty channels or whatever, C-SPAN and PBS are better than the others, 
it's all still a vast wasteland. A channel like C-SPAN will still have a 
place in a world where you have one channel and it's yours, but 
enterprises like PBS and CNN are resources only for a world in which 
there are few channels and no control over them.

<B>ER</B>: Why is there no future for TV news?

<B>GILDER</B>: Because TV news is all governed by the two-minute rule, which 
says that you can't devote more than two minutes to a story unless it's 
a war or something. But the reason for that is not that people have any 
particular desire for two-minute stories; to the contrary, people want 
much more than two minutes on any story that actually interests them.
TV's two-minute rule exists because people will zap any story longer 
than two minutes that doesn't interest them. And so network news is 
guided entirely by that negative constraint, and within the two-minute 
limit, it necessarily has to go for sensational images and crashes and 
fires and murders and whatever. 

News is getting worse and worse that way, and the only reason TV news 
now succeeds is its timeliness and its ability to present video, but 
newspapers will shortly be able to present video and pictures and 
everything else in just as timely a way as television does; moreover, 
the newspaper of the future will be able to give you access to archives 
and to advertisements that actually step you through to the transaction 
itself, a process that requires text.

<B>ER</B>: You've pointed out in Life after Television that some 70 percent of 
the costs of a film go for distribution and advertising, saying, &quot;In 
every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key impact of the 
computer-networking revolution is to collapse the costs of distribution 
and remove the middlemen.&quot; What's the future of the middlemen in 
educational systems? Do you agree with Lew Perelman's thesis in School's 
Out that hyperlearning will replace, rather than merely reform, 
conventional education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Yeah, I agree mostly with Lew. I don't think that things change 
so abruptly as he implies they will, but it's clear that because schools 
are centralized and dominated by these educationist elites, they're 
ineffective in teaching children. And so I think in the same way as the 
computer has tended to break down all existing hierarchies, monopolies, 
pyramids, and power grids of established industrial society, it will 
break down centralized educational institutions as well. There is no 
correlation--period--between spending per student and performance per 
student, adjusted for education and income of parents. But there is a 
very statistically significant negative correlation between the amount 
of bureaucracy per student and the performance of the student. 

So it's clear that the middlemen in education are not merely dead wood, 
they are also a  destructive force, and they actually prevent education. 
It's teachers that are needed, and teachers don't need much supervision. 

The computer essentially replaces vertically organized institutions with 
horizontally organized institutions. It distributes intelligence and 
power rather than concentrates them; it endows teachers with authority 
and responsibility rather than reducing teachers to being instruments of 
some educational bureaucracy. And the reason teachers don't care about 
anything but money as far as their organizations are concerned is that 
the bureaucrats have destroyed the experience of teaching and the 
gratification of teaching. This is why the schools are such perverse 
institutions. As Lew Perelman says, academia is a socialist bureaucracy 
as big as the Soviet government at its height, and it is going to fail 
just about as cataclysmically.

<B>ER</B>: Do your observations apply from top to bottom? Do they also apply to 
higher education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there's greater diversity in higher education--
quite a lot of diversity--and that the schools people think are good are 
mostly bad, and some of the schools people think are bad are in fact 
quite good. For example, I think about 70 percent of the courses at 
Harvard are useless. You know less when you finish than when you 
started. All those endless sociology courses and social science courses 
and social psychology and political science courses, and the endless 
efforts to retrieve some inkling of truth from Marxism!  
You know, it's as though they were still teaching some pre-Copernican 
astronomy--they're really obscurantists in those institutions. It 
reflects the collapse of the elite culture in the United States, but I 
think there are a lot of other cultures out there, and a lot of schools 
that people don't pay attention to are in fact a lot better. Schools 
like Hillsdale, schools like Thomas Aquinas.

There are also schools like CalTech and Harvey Mudd--schools that are 
excellent in science and technology. These are the best schools in the 
country, because the one thing this culture does well is science and 
technology. One of the real jokes is when you find MIT increasingly 
trying to teach students the humanities. I think the humanities as 
taught in existing universities are mostly perverse: Nihilist, 
relativist, feminist, and Marxist. Marxism is just a completely 
worthless mode of study, and yet it's pursued intently at a great many 
elite universities as though there's something still in it.

<B>ER</B>: What would you recommend to a 17-year-old?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there are two possibilities. One is, if such 17-
year-old boys or girls really have their act together, have strong 
convictions, and know what they want to study, then it would be 
interesting to attend one of the elite universities and be kind of a 
counterforce there and create an adversarial culture. Publications like 
the Dartmouth Review, the Salient at Harvard, and the Prospect at 
Princeton are part of a whole series of conservative publications across 
the country that are kinds of centers of resistance and rebellion on 
these corrupt campuses, and that's probably a pretty good education, to 
pursue that course. In general, however, I'd recommend getting a 
technical or scientific education, because I don't think the schools are 
teaching anything else.

<B>ER</B>: Granting that technological advances will have a great impact on the 
general culture, don't you fear that money will have an even greater 
impact? Are cities with thirty trashy radio stations better served than 
towns with only two, and are they not the victims of investors who are 
chasing maximum ad revenues? Have the 55,000 trade books published last 
year in the United States produced a better general culture? Or has the 
culture been affected mainly by the small number of books--and movies 
and television shows--that were hyped into best-seller-dom?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think that America is still the world's leading economy and it 
produces a tremendous amount of art and literature that elude the elite 
media and elite institutions and elite critical vessels. If American 
culture were really summed up by TV culture, there would be no leading 
software company, no world-leading 
scientific/educational enterprise, no globally ascendant computing 
industry. Bioengineering wouldn't be centered in the United States, and 
so forth.

So I really don't think this elite mass culture--and I believe it is 
elitist, contrived by elites to pander to mass prurience and anxiety--
can generate anything worthwhile, and I don't think it does. The actual 
success of the United States does not stem from what the media generally 
treat--in other words, phenomena like the personal computer that are 
incomparably more important than phenomena like Madonna.

<B>ER</B>:  What is the hardest part of your ideas for people to comprehend? 
I'm sure that many of the people in charge of the converging corpses of 
Hollywood, TV, cable, and publishing have read your books or heard you 
speak. Why do you think they can't get the message?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think a lot of them do get the message, and the ones who 
do are actually doing well. The ones who are pursuing the PC incurred 
nothing but upside surprises last year. At the beginning of the year it 
was predicted by Bill Gates and Andy Grove--the world's leading experts 
on the subject--that between 34 and 37 million personal computers would 
be sold in 1993; the actual number turned out to be almost 50 million 
computers--about 30 or 40 percent more than expected. 

And all the people who produce software and peripherals for personal 
computers and personal computer networks prospered. The computer 
industry grew 20 percent or so last year, while consumer electronics was 
stagnant. A lot of people developed CD-ROMs, which were a $5-billion 
business last year, up from virtually nothing a few years ago. 

The cable industry, which I consulted with a lot and which I think I 
influenced a lot, recently launched a wide array of products to connect 
computers over the cable network, and those products are going to be 
very important and valuable. I predict that during the next five years 
or so the computer industry will yield more products for cable companies 
than the TV industry does.

<B>ER</B>: What advice would you give to the president of a college or 
university?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think a kind of organizing principle, such as St. John's Great 
Books Program or St. Thomas Aquinas's orientation toward the Catholic 
worldview, can animate an educational experience, whereas trying to be a 
smorgasbord of secular social theory is going to result in both a bad 
experience for students and failure as an educational institution. 
You've got to be willing to teach some specific thing. You can't adopt 
some relativist posture, because that will mean that fanatics will 
dominate the institution, and most of these institutions are dominated 
by propagandists rather than by teachers.

<B>ER</B>: And what would you advise college and university presidents to do 
with regard to information technology?

<B>GILDER</B>: They should digitize their libraries and make them available 
from student rooms over computer networks. They should in general not 
restrict the resources of the college to the classrooms in it, but reach 
out from their own classrooms to students around the world who want to 
take courses with the excellent teachers available, while at the same 
time allowing the students on campus to reach out around the world. In 
other words, make your educational institution one that summons the best 
from universities everywhere, rather than focusing on the faculty and 
students that happen to be assembled at your particular location.</PRE>

<H1><CENTER>The Dark Fiber Interview with George Gilder </CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Gilder mixes high technology and social politics.
His best-selling book, <I>Wealth and Poverty</I>, practically outlined our
loving embrace of high- tech entrepreneurs in the 1980s. Research for that
book led him deeper into the physics of silicon microchips. He emerged with
<I>Microcosm</I>, a book about how silicon-chip technology causes matter
to &quot;collapse&quot; into a microcosm where the usual economies of scale
are reversed: Small is better. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of decentralized telecommunications prompted his monograph <I>Life
After Television</I>, which is in some ways a warm-up for the book he is
working on now - <I>Telecosm</I> - a study of how the telecomputer will
enhance individual liberty. In this interview with Wired's Executive Editor
Kevin Kelley, Gilder expounds on society's current great work: wiring the
planet. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>KK</B>: Your book, Microcosm, begins with a quote from physicist Carver
Mead, who said, &quot;Listen to technology; find out what it's telling you.&quot;
I was wondering, what is the current technology of modems, packet-switching,
and fiber optics telling you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
GG</B>: It's telling me that today we're at the same general point that
we were with integrated circuits in about 1970. In 1970, people didn't anticipate
that transistors would be virtually free by today. Today you can buy a transistor
for 4,000-millionths of a cent. I think the same thing is on its way in
fiber optics. We're going to gain access to the 25,000 gigahertz of capacity
that's in each of the three windows in infrared spectrum that work with
fiber optics. With 25,000 gigahertz, you get the equivalent to the number
of phone calls in America during the peak moment on Mother's Day. Or take
all the radio spectrum currently used for communications, from AM radio
to KU-band satellite. It's 1,000 times that, on one thread of glass the
width of a human hair. I don't think people have come to terms with what
fiber really means. You can simulate any kind of switching configuration
you want. All of a sudden this huge apparatus of electronic switching that
dominates our current communications becomes unnecessary. Suddenly, you're
going to find that just as the integrated circuit rendered transistors -
and hence mips and bits - virtually free, fiber optics is going to render
bandwidth and hertz virtually free. This world is quite different from the
world that assumes bandwidth scarcity. A dearth of spectrum has to be regulated
and parceled out carefully by sensitive federal bureaucrats beset by tens
of thousands of lawyers. That whole apparatus, both the technology of it
- the huge switching fabric of the phone companies - and the legislative
apparatus and all its bureaucracies and legal accessories, are going to
be rendered almost worthless over the next ten years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Every time I hear the phrase &quot;virtually free&quot; I think
of the claim about nuclear power: &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot; It's almost
utopian. I find myself not believing it, as much as I want to go along with
the idea. Am I too skeptical? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yep. It's just that when things become free you ignore them.
Transistors that used to be seven bucks apiece now cost about a millionth
of a cent. That means that you can regard them as insignificant, just as
they're becoming ubiquitous and thus determining the whole atmosphere of
enterprise. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, you could say that aluminum - by the atom - has become
virtually free, but that doesn't mean aluminum in any useful amount is free.
As long as we have storage devices, we'll find things to fill them up with,
so there will always be a demand for more. That means no matter how cheap
storage becomes, it won't be free. It seems to me that the appetite for
bandwidth is equally insatiable, so people will always want more than they
have. It has to cost something. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Of course it will. The point is that in every industrial revolution,
some key factor of production is drastically reduced in cost. Relative to
the pervious cost to achieve that function, the new factor is virtually
free compared to its expense when it derived from animal muscle power and
human muscle power. Suddenly you could do things you could not afford to
do before. You could make a factory work 24 hours a day churning out products
in a way that was just incomprehensible before the industrial era. It really
did mean that physical force became virtually free in a sense. The whole
economy had to reorganize itself to exploit this physical force. You had
to &quot;waste&quot; the power of the steam engine and its derivatives in
order to prevail, whether in war or in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last 30 years, we've seen transistors (or switching power) move
from being expensive, crafted vacuum tubes to being virtually free. So today,
the prime rule of thrift in business is &quot;waste transistors.&quot; We
&quot;waste&quot; them to correct our spelling to play solitaire, to do
anything. As a matter of fact, you've got to waste transistors in order
to succeed in business these days. My thesis is that bandwidth is going
to be virtually free in the next era in the same way that transistors are
in this era. It doesn't mean there won't be expensive technologies associated
with the exploitation of bandwidth - just as there are expensive computers
employing transistors; but it does mean that people will have to use this
bandwidth, they'll have to waste bandwidth rather than economize on bandwidth.
The wasters of bandwidth will win rather than the people who are developing
exquisite new compression tools and all these other devices designed to
exploit some limited bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
One of the key ways you economize on bandwidth is switching. Switching has
been the whole foundation of our communications systems. You run narrow-band
wires to some switch and then switch the data to its destination in order
to avoid using lots of bandwidth to broadcast signals to every terminal.
It seems to me that we're going to start using fiber the way we currently
address air. Instead of switching, we'll broadcast on fiber optic. We'll
be tuning in rather than processing all the bits. And instead of using a
lot of switching intelligence in order to economize on bandwidth, we're
going to use bandwidth in order to economize on intelligence. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Okay. In a world where physical force, switching, and computation
are almost free, we now add almost-free bandwidth. What becomes expensive?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The scarce resource is the human mind. People will be more valuable.
People will get paid better. We need people to provide the software, the
interfaces, the standards, and the protocols to all these systems that make
it possible to exploit these increasingly cheap resources. So it's the human
mind that you ultimately have to economize on. That's the reason I think
it's utter garbage to say that our grandchildren won't live as well as we
do. People who say this just don't see the technology. They live in this
bizarre world of thermodynamics, where entropy rules, and we're dominated
by our waste products. it is very short-sighted. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: It take it then that as a believer in the human mind as sort
of the ultimate repository of wealth and power, that you're not a believer
in artificial intelligence as an attainable thing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Artificial intelligence is obviously attainable, it just won't
be human intelligence. It's a different function. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Do you think there's a downside to having everything connected
to everything else? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I don't see any. There must be a downside to the telephone, but
I can't remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, when you're in the middle of supper and some solicitor
is calling you, you'll probably remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, that's the downside. But that's the downside all this stuff
overcomes. When you can have intelligence in you telephone it can defer
the calls you don't want to voice mail and still take emergency calls. It
can be adapted to your needs. So, the chief effect of these technologies
is to put you in command again. The trouble with top-down centralized technologies,
which the telephone and television represent, is that they're dumb equipment
attached to complex switching systems and broadcasting technologies. On
the other hand, the chief virtue of distributed intelligence is that the
network can be dumb and the control of it can be distributed to smart users.
That means that technologies are much more servants than rulers of your
life. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: When I look at networks I see counter-intuitive behavior. Distributed
networks have a remarkable ability to be slightly out of anyone's control.
They possess an organic out-of-control quality. Does that concern you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I think it's good. The Internet, for instance, is an exciting
kind of metaphor for spontaneous order. It shows that in order to have a
very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control.
When there's a lot of intelligence at the fringes everywhere, the actual
network itself can be fairly simple. The future is dumb networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Dumb networks? Why not smart networks? We put smartness into
everything else. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There's smartness all around the network, but the actual network
should be essentially dumb glass. The fiberspace, as I call it. I think
the mistake that the phone companies sometimes make is to think that they
can keep up with the computer. What they call &quot;network intelligence&quot;
will usually appear as a bottleneck to a computer industry that's rapidly
rushing forward into new possibilities. So what you really want is dumb
networks where all intelligence is on the fringes. You'll have intelligent
devices of various sorts that are easily reachable from the network but
aren't part of the actual fabric of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What is the fabric of the network? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Photons. Electronics are not good for communications. Photons
- optical computing - are. What makes photons so great for communication
is they don't interfere with each other. They collide and pass on unaffected.
You can send them two-way, and they are not subject to electromagnetic disruption.
Many signals can flow through one fiber. But the fact that photons don't
affect each other means they are cumbersome for computing, since you want
interactions in computing. You need to have the charges affect one another
- that's the heart of computing. The heart of the transistor function is
that you can control a bigger force with a smaller force. But photons don't
control each other. So for computing functions I still think that electronics
will prevail; but for communications, photonics will prevail. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: One would think that there is wealth to be made in the interface
then between photons and electrons. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, there is. Opto-electronics is very important. However,
opto- electronics should not be in the middle of the network, it should
be one the edges of the network where it links the computing functions to
the communications functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There are some advocates who claim that we can get a lot of what
we want in fiber optic by using the existing copper wires beefed up with
the ISDN communication protocol. Do you go along with the idea of implementing
(and paying for ) ISDN right now? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yes. The phone companies should do ISDN. We might as well get
as much out of the existing copper switch system as we can. ISDN is already
installed in all the new switches; it's more a matter of getting the tariffs
right so they can charge some reasonable amount for it is use. There's no
excuse not to do ISDN today. It won't detract from the fibersphere. But
while they do ISDN, all-optical networks are going to be launched all over
the place by different companies. Some people have this vision that either
we devote our resources to ISDN, or we devote them to creating this fabulously
expensive fiber network. My belief is that fiber network is going to get
rapidly cheaper, so that we're going to be able to do both it and ISDN perfectly
well. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What role do you think the US government should play in laying
data highways? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The role for the US government is to make government as efficient
as possible. Government operates leviathan laboratories, hospitals, universities,
bureaucracies, and post offices, and they all should be interconnected with
fiber. The government always discovers technology after its moment is passing.
If you're a winner, you don't go to the government. You're too busy. You've
got too many customers. It's the people with no customers who end up besieging
the government. There are all these wise-asses in Washington who really
think that they can choose technologies. They think they know better. They
get bowled over by every earnest representative of IBM who comes up to talk
to them. <BR>
<BR>
Just now the US government thinks that HDTV is absolutely the future of
the world because all the old farts at Zenith, and the broadcasting moguls
who aren't really making it with the new computer technologies, are converging
on Washington. it's always going to be that way. It's not going to change
with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out
like poodles. The politician is always the dogs best friend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There is a myth, a utopian hope, that all these electronic connections
(what I call the &quot;advent of the net&quot;) are going to eliminate hierarchy.
The belief is that we will come into a peer world, where everything is on
a peer-to- peer level. All the experimental work that I have seen shows
that that's probably not very likely. On the contrary, anything complex
self-organizes into nested hierarchies, just in order to manage itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Right. The complexity of digital systems requires a hierarchical
organization. It's the only way to deal with the kind of combinatorial explosions
that attend interlinking of billions of nodes, all functioning in parallel.
You need nested hierarchies, but the real miracle of micro- electronics
is that these extraordinarily complex hierarchies can be incorporated into
individual silicon chips, with virtual supercomputer power capabilities.
This fabulous supercomputer power can be ubiquitously distributed, which
renders them an egalitarian force. <BR>
<BR>
When everybody commands a supercomputer, you give the average owner of a
work station the power that an industrial tycoon commanded in the industrial
era, or that a TV station owner commands in the age of broadcasting. In
other words, the hierarchy is in the silicon rather than in the human organization.
So you have this incredible distribution of power. This is a period of transition
that resembles the transition between railroads and automobiles. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: How's that? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: When you ride a train you go to the railway station at a scheduled
time, you travel with the people that happen to be on the train, you go
to preset destinations. This is what the current television world is like.
You tune into the stations that have been prescribed through some collaboration
between advertisers and TV executives in New York and Hollywood. Moving
from broadcast model to the teleputer is like moving from a railroad model
to automobiles. Automobiles are essentially egalitarian transportation systems.
They aren't organized - like the Internet. A Ferrari, say, and a Toyota
Tercel look like radically different machines, but the fact is that any
car endows the average person with more freedom than any railroad. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: You are a tireless champion of small business. For the last 20
years or so, really big projects have been considered arrogant, incapable
of working because they are big. Now there is talk of Motorola's global
satellite project Iridium. Do you think that the fibersphere gives us permission
to think big again. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There are going to be a lot of big fiber projects in the next
decade. They're already coming right now. I'm sort of worried that they're
going to think too small. I hope that the government, with its National
Research and Education Network (NREN) doesn't end up buying a lot of obsolescent
telephone company fiber systems that make networks with a total power of
a gigabit rather than a gigabit per terminal. The fibersphere is a big project,
and it will take scores of thousands of small companies to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What about big companies? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Sure. Laboratories where lots of people work on their own special
visions, with the luxury of very long-term goals, are very valuable. Such
places are usually supported by relatively big companies and consortia of
companies. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Bell Labs developed most of the component
for all optical networks. When you're producing millions of something it
becomes a commodity, and almost by definition you have a big company. MS-DOS
and Windows are commodity products, so Microsoft is a big company. <BR>
<BR>
There are cycles in which companies get big exploiting commodity products
with wide distribution, which then mature and then are displaced by new
products. It's relatively rare that the company that's triumphant in the
commodity phase. Insurrections are ordinarily led by entrepreneurs. I don't
see any likelihood that will change anytime soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What else is the technology telling you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: What the technology tells me is that, among other things, Clinton's
going to get a bonanza. He doesn't know what's coming, but technology's
just going to be breaking out all over. Bush did virtually everything that
Clinton promises to do, and because Bush has done it already it doesn't
leave Clinton much room except to play cock-a-doodle-do. He'll get up on
the post and crow as the marvelous sunrise technologies come blindingly
to the fore during his administration. They're going to have 50,000 technology
programs and behold, a million technologies will bloom and they will take
credit for it all. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>By George Gilder<BR>

</CENTER>
</H2>
Once upon a time in a distant mountainous land there was a young and beautiful
princess who loved to wander in the woods. The forest was deep below the
snowcapped peaks and the valleys were quiet and safe. She could go freely
without care or fear. She could saunter along the trails that took local
merchants and messengers toward the passes to neighboring lands and brought
them back laden with news and commerce. She could watch for birds radiant
among the leaves and sometimes glimpse a deer dancing through the brush.
In summer she could swim in the brooks that hurtled down the mountains and
gathered in pools in the crevices. She was carefree and gay, at ease with
nature and the world.<BR>
<BR>
Then one year trouble struck this halcyon land. A barbarian moved into a
cave somewhere in the woods and began to prey on the merchants and messengers
making their way through the mountain passes. Although groups of young men
formed posses to pursue him, he was so strong and swift and so resourceful
in the ways of the woods and canyons that no one could catch him. Commerce
slowed and the kingdom grew steadily poorer. Merchants could travel only
in large groups protected by warriors. The king and queen bade the princess
to halt her wanderings and stay in the castle night and day. Someday, they
said, she would be queen, but until then she would have to learn the ways
of the palace. She pined for her dark and secret places among the trees,
but she did not disobey.<BR>
<BR>
One night, however, her sleep was beset with dreams of serpents. She woke
in fear as shadowy shapes lurched on her walls and sinister sounds whirred
outside her window. She went to the sill, parted the curtains, and gasped
at the wild beauty beyond. Through the trees, waving their arms in the night
winds and glistening in the moonlight, she could see deep into the forest
that she longed to explore. She yearned to run along the sylvan paths and
feel the pine needles under her bare feet and the breezes against her face
and in her hair. She longed to spy on the creatures of the night. Surely,
no one would notice or care if she should steal down the stone stairs and
step out on the moonlit path.<BR>
<BR>
As it happened, that same evening the barbarian, also restless in the night
season, set forth into the lunar darkness down the path that led toward
the castle. He walked quietly, like a cat slinking through the woods, until,
startled by the sound of steps, he slid behind a huge oak. At first he thought
he had heard some animal and raised his club. Then he sensed a human rhythm
in the paces and steeled himself for a robbery. When the princess finally
came into view, he gasped at the sight of her- -a beautiful girl garbed
only in a silken gown--gliding barefoot along the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Never before had a vision moved him so powerfully. The luminous night and
the woman alone, the shape and the shadows, reached in beyond his bearded
face and bristling chest and touched his sinuous heart. He stepped forward
and asked her if he might walk with her a while. She screamed and fled.
He pursued her, caught her, and pulled her to the ground, ripping her gown.
Then he seized her flailing arms and shook her to silence.<BR>
<BR>
Soon, however, he sensed that he wanted less to overpower than to please
her. Entranced by the wonders of her strong young body, he pleaded with
her to stop struggling--he meant her no harm. She told him to go ahead and
kill her if he wanted her, but to do it quickly and mercifully. He insisted
he had no desire to have her dead. He wanted her alive; he wished to hold
her body against his in the night. She said she would die first.<BR>
<BR>
He then changed his approach and asked her again if she would walk with
him for a while in the woods. She consented; it was a way to gain release
from his grasp. But as they strolled along, his gruff voice softened. With
quiet authority he described his life in the woods among the fierce animals
that threatened his survival and that he sometimes had to kill to escape.
She listened and marveled as he told her fantastic tales of the barbarian
life. She had never before heard of the struggle for life in the wilds beyond
the castle walls. They walked together until the glow of dawn shocked her
to her senses and she said she had to run back to the castle. The great
barbarian slumped in helpless anguish. She assured him she would be back
the next week to learn more. But to the barbarian, a week seemed an eternity.<BR>
<BR>
The next week she once more sneaked away from her bed after midnight and
walked in the woods with the barbarian. When the sun rose he lunged for
her, and she delicately slipped aside, saying she would be back again in
another seven days. The next week they once again walked and talked for
hours in the night. Finally he asked her to come back to see the etchings
on the walls of his cave.<BR>
<BR>
She said no, she would never go back to his lair until he halted his attacks
upon the merchants and messengers of the realm. He said robbery was his
way of life; all men robbed in one way or another; the king's entire territory
had been stolen from the barbarian's forebears, the natives of the land.
She told him severely that he had better find another way of living if he
expected her ever to visit him in his cave. He should make a clearing, build
a cabin, and grow a garden in the woods. He could collect nuts and berries
and hunt small game. With all his knowledge of the wilderness he could live
well, and she would come weekly to hear his tales of the night wood.<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian was heartbroken. The idea of a different life frightened and
repelled him. He was a nomadic predator, born to run in the forest and prey
on the weak. But finally he saw that he had no choice. To avoid losing the
princess, he recognized at last that he would have to give up the barbarian
life and get to work. And so he did. By the time he met her seven days hence,
he had cleared a large space among the trees. Within six months he had planted
a garden and built a cabin.<BR>
<BR>
During that time no robberies were reported on the road. Commerce with neighboring
kingdoms expanded rapidly as travel grew safer and merchants could go through
the mountain passes without an expensive guard of young warriors. With the
country growing richer, the barbarian did well selling wood and nuts to
the people. At last one day, after showing her his trove of produce, his
cabin enlarged with an octagonal wing, and his large gardens and herds of
goats, he asked the princess to marry him. Joyfully she said yes and brought
him back to the castle to meet her father and mother, the king and queen.<BR>
<BR>
At first the king declared that the barbarian's background made him entirely
unsuitable to be the mate of his precious daughter. But the queen replied
with a smile that he too had been something of a barbarian in his day and
he had to confess that this was true. The barbarian was certainly a refreshing
change from the unctuous courtiers who had previously pursued the princess.
The king and queen soon welcomed the youth as a strong and resourceful husband
for their daughter and an asset to the realm.<BR>
<BR>
The wedding brought a huge celebration throughout the kingdom. After a nostalgic
honeymoon in the cabin in the woods, the couple moved into the castle. Freed
from the ravages of the barbarian, the land continued to prosper. After
the princess's parents died, the barbarian himself became king and expanded
his domains deep into the mountains and the forest. In the course of time
the new queen bore a daughter and the daughter too grew into a beautiful
young princess, who, like her mother, hearkened to the call of the wild.<BR>
<BR>
As the realm grew ever richer, the king and queen invited famous wise men
from a neighboring kingdom to entertain at court. These men told of seductive
new ideas. They chilled the king and queen with tales of the death of God
and the eclipse of law, and excited them with accounts of the joys of libertine
sex. They brought books and art celebrating the new freedoms that followed
the breakdown of traditional morality and religion. They told of a city
called New York where everything indeed was new and free.<BR>
<BR>
The young princess listened avidly. Poring over the books, she learned of
the powers that princesses held in other nations. She learned to disdain
the stodgy, hardworking life of her parents' kingdom and to long for a land
where happiness was the only goal. As time passed these ideas gnawed at
her nocturnal thoughts. Like her mother she found her sleep disturbed by
serpentine dreams, and she would walk in the woods to quell the disquieting
desires that flooded her young body.<BR>
<BR>
Then a crisis struck the country. Another barbarian--as young and strong,
ruthless and resourceful as his predecessor--moved into the forest and began
preying on the commerce between the kingdom and the neighboring realm. Once
again the land became poor, and this princess too was forbidden to walk
in the woods. The princess, however, rebelled against her parents and continued
her excursions.<BR>
<BR>
One night she found herself suddenly confronted by the young barbarian.
She was even more beautiful than her mother, and the barbarian surged with
admiration and desire. He asked her if she minded if he walked with her
for a while. Deeply bored by her life in the castle, she agreed. They sauntered
along the path discussing the flaws of the king and the oppressive rules
within the walls. Shortly he put his arm around her shoulders and she pulled
away and said please, not yet. He asked her if she would return with him
to see the etchings in his cave. She suggested they first walk longer and
get to know one another better. But eventually they visited his cave together.
When she left at dawn, she promised to return the next week. &quot;Wow,&quot;
she exclaimed, &quot;you're good!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the next several months she visited with the barbarian every week and
they reveled in the cave. Then one day, a king arrived from the progressive
country of the wise men to visit with the father of the princess. This foreign
king was the most charming and cosmopolitan man the princess had ever seen.
He told her of the great riches and romantic forests of his land, of the
advanced universities and museums, of the flourishing commerce and art.
And after everyone went to bed, there was a knock on the door of the princess's
chamber.<BR>
<BR>
The princess opened the door and saw the foreign king outside, garbed in
a robe of purple velour. He asked to come in. He stayed until dawn, and
as the morning light suffused the room, along with the royal aroma of his
Paco Rabanne, he asked her to return with him to his kingdom. He would divorce
his queen and marry her. They had &quot;drifted apart,&quot; he said, and
his marriage &quot;was no longer a growthful experience.&quot; His wife
needed &quot;more space,&quot; and in his progressive views and liberated
lifestyle, he discovered he had far more in common with youth than with
his own generation. The princess agreed joyfully. Banishing the barbarian
in the woods from her thoughts, she returned the next day with the king
to her new land.<BR>
<BR>
Each week the barbarian waited in the forest for his princess. But she never
came. After a while he gave up waiting and angrily escalated his attacks
on the commerce between the two nations. As time passed, the mood of license
fostered by the wise men induced many young men to join the barbarian in
the woods. The nation fell into ruin and the forest became a jungle, ruled
by barbarians, where no princess ever dared to tread.

<H2>WHY WE NEED TO OVERHAUL<BR>
OUR ADVERSARIAL LEGAL SYSTEM
</H2>
<H4><I>By Roberta R. Katz<BR>
(Copyright 1996 by Roberta R. Katz)</I>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's a great honor for me to be standing up here today. I've spent several
years now thinking, and then writing, about legal reform, but this is the
<B>first </B>time I have publicly shared some of my thoughts with such a
large audience of businesspeople.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's a short preview of what I will spend the next 20 minutes talking
about. I intend to show you why legal reform issues are deadly serious for
this country, why the adversary system of justice is no longer a fully functional
system, and why you -- whoever you are -- need to get personally involved
in the resolution of these legal refon-n issues.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My own interest in this topic goes back to my law-firm days, when the anthropologist
in me began to sense some kind of shift taking place. It was not just that
clients had become so vocal about high legal costs. Or that lawyers were
now the butt of so many jokes and cartoons. Or even that many of my fellow
lawyers had become so aggressive and crude in how they practiced law. No,
what I was sensing was far more troubling to me. It was an awareness that
an increasing amount of the high-priced work we lawyers were doing was just
about process, and not about substance. In other words, the clients were
paying for more and more icing, and less and less cake.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken me several years to figure out the real cause of this problem.
The easy answer would have been to say that it's all the fault of greedy
lawyers. During the 1980s, when the money was rolling into the law fin-ns,
a relative few lawyers did get greedy. I'm sure you've read articles about
lawyers who prolonged cases, padded bills, exploited the system and otherwise
adopted dishonest means of bilking their clients and society. But contrary
to the popular view, in my experience the majority of lawyers are honest
and hardworking. And they are as confused and troubled as nonlawyers over
what is happening to their profession.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Confused and troubled. That could describe just about everyone these days.
And this is because we are living in revolutionary times. Remember in your
student days, when you learned about the Industrial Revolution? The move
off the farms, the break-up of extended families, the grimy factories, the
blight of the cifies? This history generally evoked pity for our forebears,
and relief that we were living in more stable times. But the fact is, that
with the dawning of the Information Age we are going through just as much,
if not more, change in our lives as were those troubled souls in the early
19th century. Because we are living it, putting one foot in front of the
other each day as we try to raise our children and do our jobs, it's hard
to put our individual problems in the broader context. This is big-time
social change we are experiencing, but big-time social change, when you
are living it rather than reading about it, necessarily comes slowly, in
stages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently there has been an acknowledgment of the need for fundamental changes
in many of our social institutions. Our businesses were the first place
these fundamental changes were accepted. Following the widespread introduction
of computing technology into private businesses, it became clear that we
needed to organize workers differently. Teams began to replace top-down
management structures. Bosses began to come out of their offices and manage
by walking around. Restructuring and reengineering became the norin rather
than the exception.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it's also become clear to most people that our schools need fundamental
changes. It no longer sounds radical to speak about individualized learning
using the computer, or about changing the classroom setting to have greater
focus on teamwork, and less focus on the teacher as the only source of learning.
These organizational changes in the educational context, like the organizational
changes pervading businesses, are directly the result of our bigger move
as a culture from a factory-based mindset to an infonnation-based mindset.<BR>
<BR>
So what kind of similar organizational changes are happening in the legal
context? Very, very few. It seems that while we can accept major change
in our businesses and our schools, we consider our legal system to be more
sacrosanct. The courts are, after all, a key part of the bedrock foundation
of our society. Fundamental organizational change in our legal system feels
like it could threaten the core of our democratic ways.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But here's the irony. It's actually our refusal to implement fundamental
change in our legal system that could bring down the whole house. Let me
explain why.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this decade, I think most Americans considered their courts to be
places where justice would generally be served. There was a basic belief
that if a wrong had occurred, our court system would redress that wrong
and restore a balance. In the popular media, Perry Mason was the personification
of that faith in our court system. We believed that through incisive questioning,
a good lawyer could ferret out the truth, expose the bad guy, reward the
good guy, and serve justice. Yes, sometimes there were mistakes, but by
and large, for most people the system worked.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, today, a growing number of people believe that our justice
system is unreliable at best and a total farce at worst. Moreover, among
those who are con-fing to share that belief are people who see the system
from the inside: lawyers, judges, and legal scholars. For example, two years
ago, Bill Ide, who was then the President of the American Bar Association,
said this to the ABA membership (and I quote):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Legal institutions created many years ago weren't designed to handle
the complex issues and burdensome caseloads we routinely see in our courtrooms.
What is needed today is nothing short of a revolution in our administration
of justice.... We must remember that it is the existence of and public confidence
in the legal system that has kept our nation at peace with itself. ... Should
the public confidence be lost in the government to be fair and equitable
through our justice system, we will only be sowing and nurturing the seeds
of a real revolution that no one wants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Those were strong words stated over two years ago from an influential person.
And yet, as far as I can tell, they have inspired virtually nothing in the
way of &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in our legal system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a cultural anthropologist whose research focussed on social change, I
have observed that serious social change issues typically smolder quietly
until there is an unexpected event that sparks a bigger fire that results
in change. It may well be that the O.J. Simpson trial has been that event
as applied to changes in our legal system. If nothing else, that trial allowed
a wide spectrum of Americans to see what life inside our court system is
like today. And many of those who watched were appalled, not necessarily
by the outcome but by the process. The endless bickering. The game playing.
The withholding of important infon-nation from the jury. It just didn't
seem right, when all was said and done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, as ABA-President Ide realized, is that when people no longer
believe that their justice system will reliably dispense justice, they take
matters into their own hands. And that is exactly what is beginning to happen
today. At one end of the spectrum, we have the growth of what is called
&quot;alternative dispute resolution,&quot; or &quot;ADR&quot; for short.
ADR is basically a private justice system. Under ADR, two disputing parties
will agree to avoid the courts and go to a private decisionmaker to end
their dispute. It is growing dramatically in popularity, especially in the
business context.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the other end of the spectrum, however, a more frightening event is occurring.
Some groups, such as the militias, have simply written off our established
justice system and substituted their own &quot;peoples' courts.&quot; Similarly,
even within our established courts, a growing number of j@es are simply
ignoring the confusing evidence presented to them and making their decisions
on bases that have little or nothing to do with the facts of the case.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate cure for this problem is not easy. In my view, to cure the
problem in our legal system we will have to do a substantial overhaul of
the adversary system. Yes, I said overhaul. I know this sounds bold, maybe
even heretical, but stop to think about it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The adversary system is about two sides of a dispute being able to tell
their respective stories to a jury. In other words, it's all about information.
That's why we haveinterrogatories, depositions, and testimony at trial --
the purpose is to get information to the decision-makers so that they can
make an infon-ned decision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the adversary system in practice today is remarkably similar to the
adversary system that was created in England at the dawning of the Industrial
era. (And let me add here that the adversary system was itself the result
of a legal reform movement that occurred in response to abuses occurring
in pre-Industrial England, when defendants were not allowed to testify in
their own defense.) Now, as then, there were a plaintiff and defendant,
each <B>with </B>their lawyers, a judge, and jury, and the various rules
of procedure and of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But think how different the rest of our lives are. When the adversary system
was bom, information was simple and relatively sparse. This was before the
time of widespread publishing or broadcasting, before the time we became
specialized into so many different types of business endeavors. This was
also a time when communities were small and relatively cohesive, unlike
today, when we often don't even know the names of our next-door neighbors.
It was certainly before the days of technical expert witnesses (especially
hired technical expert witnesses), laboratory tests, statistical analyses,
and all the other exhaustive and exhausting paraphernalia of modem trials.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To our collective credit, I believe the adversary system served us fairly
well throughout the Industrial era. But now that we are well into the Information
Age, now that we are participating in a global economy fueled by high tech,
that system is clogging up. That's why we now find interrogatories over
100 pages long, and jurors that are hopelessly lost in the face of highly
technical evidence, and depositions that last for weeks, and trials that
are delayed for years. That's why we have come to a point that our legal
processes, far from serving justice, are actually thwarting justice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please don't misunderstand me. My criticism in this respect is not directed
at the new technologies. Far from it -- as you might guess from my present
employment, I am genuinely excited about the changes that the Information
Age is bringing us. Rather, my point is that the legal system is not employing
the new technologies in an intelligent maimer. Just because we now have
word processors and copying machines instead of typewriters and carbon paper
doesn't mean that it is wise for us to be drafting 100 page legal documents.
An excess of information, especially when that excess leads to manipulation,
is every bit as harmful to justice as is a lack of information.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How might we overhaul the adversary system? Here are a few examples that
would apply with respect to civil disputes. First, let's make sure that
civil disputes involving highly technical information are decided by jurors
who themselves are experts. This would avoid the junk science and battles
of the experts that today thoroughly confuse lay jurors.<BR>
Second, let's create more systems that are designed to resolve certain harms
without any adversarial process -- much like we treat workers' compensation
and no-fault insurance claims today.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And, third, let's acknowledge that in the age of specialization, our courts
of general jurisdiction are inefficient. We need more specialized courts,
which will be staffed by judges and administrators who are knowledgeable
in the court's subject matter. Today we have the Tax and Bankruptcy Courts.
Why not create a Business Court? Or a Personal Injury Court? Or an Environmental
Court? For lawyers, the era of the general practitioner ended at least 10
years ago, and today the bar is divided into well over 20 different areas
of expertise. If law and lawyers have had to specialize to reflect our society's
broader reality, why haven't we demanded that our courts and our legal procedures
make the same adaptation?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I know that overhauling the adversary system is not something to be undertaken
lightly. The effort must begin at the highest levels of our state and federal
judiciaries, and constitutional principles must be protected. This is a
most serious job for our courts, but I believe that there is no choice.
To ignore the ugly realities of our present-day legal system is to assure
the ultimate breakdown of that system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To cure our problems, it is also high time to rethink the professional role
of lawyers if lawyers are going to be useful to our society in the Information
age. We need to dramatically revise our law school curricula, starting right
now, in order to teach our young lawyers to be problem solvers rather than
problem creators. In a world of diverse cultures, which is where we inevitably
will be spending more and more of our time in the future, an adversarial
mindset is a liability, not an asset. We need to teach our lawyers how to
facilitate communication, and we need to stop teaching them that human affairs
are always win/lose. In the Information age, we will need our best thinkers,
many of whom are lawyers, to be focussing on how to create win/win solutions
to problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's where each of you also comes in. Don't forget: as paying customers
of lawyers, you have a right to make things better. And I think you also
have a responsibility to make make things better. Are you using the legal
system as a competitive tool, sort of for blackmail, trying to defeat your
foes through weak legal claims? Do you assume that the only way to solve
your problems is through your lawyers, or do you try to solve things more
creatively, without threatening a lawsuit? Do you instruct your lawyers
to be aggressive and overreaching or do you urge them to be pragmatic and
cooperative on your behalf? Most importantly, do you stay involved when
you use a lawyer's services, or do you just let the lawyer dictate the outcome
of your case?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My point here is that lawyers don't operate in a vacuum. They work for you,
and not vice versa. As the client, it is your interests, not your lawyer's,
that are at stake. And every time you misuse -- or condone the misuse --
of the legal system, every time you take advantage of the sorry state of
our adversary system today, you exacerbate the problem. So take this as
a reminder that there are often many better -- and cheaper -- ways to solve
problems than through lawyers and courts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I also urge you to support legal reform efforts. The securities-abuse legislation
that was recently passed over President Clinton's veto is one exwnple, but
there are many other tort-reform bills still before our federal and state
legislators. The media has positioned these bills as business-versus-consumer,
but this misses the whole point. These bills are about stopping some of
the procedural excesses I talked about before. In that respect, they are
only temporary fixes to the adversary-system problems, but they are fixes
nonetheless. Until we can overhaul this old, tired adversary system to meet
the needs of the Information Age, the best we can do is put some temporary
fixes in place. Without them, our faith in our legal system to deliver justice
will surely be further eroded. So these are the ideas I am working on in
my project at Discovery Institute. These are the marching orders I think
we need to give our society if we are to change the adversarial system before
it self-destructs and takes us with it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To judges: participate in streamlining the adversary system. We need a major
overhaul of our procedures, all the way down to revamping the way our courts
of general jurisdiction are organized.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To legislators: set up new incentives in law to promote prompt and more
just resolution of disputes, including through passage of tort reform legislation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To law schools: revise the law school curricula, so that the emphasis is
placed on dispute resolution rather than on adversarial combat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To lawyers: recognize that these changes are necessary if the profession
is going to play any kind of useful role in the Information Age. One reason
so many lawyers are unhappy today is that even they are already questioning
the value of what they do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And to all of us in general: take personal responsibility for helping to
restore justice and balance to our legal system. Stop condoning the use
of the system for extortion and abuse, and participate in the transition
that is ahead of us. Legal reform is not something to fear; it is something
to welcome. Given the legal system's foundation role in our culture, there
is simply no way to have profound technological and social change occurring
all around us and not change the legal system to adapt to those other changes.
Our mutual goal is to make that change as painless as possible.<BR>

</H3>
Lewis Perelman, a Senior Fellow of Discovery Institute, is one of the nation's
top authorities on education and training. His advocacy of high technology
in the restructuring of what he has called <B>The Learning Enterprise</B>
is expressed in his book, <A HREF="schlsout.html"><B><I>School's Out: Hyperlearning,
the New Technology and the End of Education</I> </B></A>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman, president of Kanbrain Institute, has provided strategic consulting
advice since 1983 to public and private policymakers concerned with technology,
institutional change, human resource, and economic development issues. His
private consulting clients have included IBM, Apple Computer, National Computer
Systems, Hay Group, Ashton-Tate, L.F. Rothschild, National Education Corp.,
the Edison Electric Institute, and other companies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman is the author of the best-selling book <I>School's Out</I> (William
Morrow &amp; Co., 1992; Avon Books, 1993) a study of restructuring education
and training sponsored by twelve U.S. corporations and foundations. He has
produced several other publications on training and education, including
the widely discussed Briefing Papers, <I>&quot;Closing Education's Technology
Gap&quot;</I> (November 1989) and <I>The Acanemia' Deception</I> (April
1990). His report for Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 project, <I>The
American Learning Enterprise in Transition</I>, was published by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (1990). <BR>
<BR>
Perelman coined the phrase <B>The Learning Enterprise</B> to describe the
total universe of education and training in a report with that title published
by the Council of State Planning Agencies in 1985. And his study for the
Western Governors' Association, Human Capital Investment for State Economic
Development (1989), was the first attempt to chart the entire &quot;portfolio&quot;
of a state's many investments in human resource development. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's work in education, training, technology, and economic policy
has been widely discussed in the national press, cited in legislative testimony,
and used in university courses. He has made speeches and presentations of
his work before numerous audiences throughout the United States and in Europe
and Pacific Asia, both live and on radio and television broadcasts. He also
has testified before Congressional, state, and local legislative committees
as well as executive boards and commissions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently an adjunct fellow of the Discovery Institute, from 1981 to 1983
Perelman was a director in the corporate planning department of Holiday
Corp. in Memphis. From 1979 to 1981, he was a senior scientist in the Social
Systems Group at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he was a visiting
scientist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Previously
he held positions at the federal Solar Energy Research Institute, and at
the Colorado Highway Department. He taught physics and mathematics in public
schools in New York and California, and has taught graduate courses at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the George Mason University School
of Business Administration. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's first book, <I>The Global Mind</I> (Mason/Charter, 1976), was
cited one of the year's best scientific-technical books by the Library Journal.
Perelman's writing has appeared in such major publications as <I>Business
Week, Forbes ASAP, WIRED, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Success, Insight, </I>and
the <I>French magazine ACTUEL, a</I>s well as professional journals such
as <I>TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, New Management, Strategic
Planning Management, Planning Review, Human Capital, and Ethics</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman earned his doctorate in administration, planning, and social policy
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He graduated cum laude with
a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York, where he was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in space and atmospheric physics
and applied mathematics at the Goddard Institute and at the Harvard Division
of Engineering and Applied Physics. Perelman resides and works in Washington,
DC. <BR>

<H3>Discovery Institute's name and logo derive in part from the British
explorer sloop &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on the Thames River in 1789.
Ninetynine feet long and 340 tons, the Discovery sailed the world and explored
the Pacific Northwest and Puget Sound region in the Spring of 1792 under
the command of Captain George Vancouver and 134 sailors. The picture below
is from a drawing by Northwest Marine artist and historian, Hewlitt Jackson.</H3>

<P>&quot;We disapprove of the measures adopted by a certain party, styling
themselves the Christian party in politics,&quot; declared the petition
from a citizens' group. The document went on to indict Christian political
activists for advocating policies that were &quot;infusing a spirit of religious
intolerance and persecution into the political institute of the country,
and which, unless opposed, will result in a union of church and statte.
...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Given present controversies, the petition could have been written last week.
Instead, it was issued in 1831. Those who believe that religion in politics
is somehow a recent phenomenon in America should re-examine their history
books. Religion has been an integral part of the nation's politics from
the early years of the republic. This book tries to explain why. It also
seeks to illuminate both the opportunities and the dangers religion poses
for politics in a representative democracy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a political scientist interested in current affairs, I initially considered
writing about contemporary conflicts over faith and politics in America.
The more I studied the early years of the United States, however, the more
I realized that present controversies are simply a continuation of arguments
that have been going on since the nation began. The questions debated during
the early years of America are hauntingly familiar: Does religion have a
political role, and if so, what should it be? What are the advantages of
religion in politics? What are the dangers? And how can people of faith
bring their religious beliefs to bear on public issues without dividing
citizens along religious lines and infringing on the liberty of conscience
of those who do not share their religious views? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Exploring how these questions were answered in the past can help clarify
what is at stake at present. Indeed, examining the debate over religion
and politics more than a century-and-a-half ago may provide more illumination
than looking at current conflicts over abortion, school prayer, gay rights,
or any number of other issues. Contemporary controversies often cloud our
judgment because we have a direct interest in their outcome. When we are
able to examine the same fundamental disputes at a distance, however, we
are more likely to grapple with the real merits of the respective arguments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what I hope can happen here, for there is much we all can learn
from the way religion became involved in politics in the early United States.
Those who criticize the role of faith in politics today might gain a better
understanding of how and why religion can play a beneficial role in our
politics; and those who champion religion's political role might gain a
deeper appreciation of the dangers as well as the possibilities of religious
political activism. Finally, evangelical Christians might rediscover part
of their heritage, for much of the book is the story of how their forebears
first became involved in politics in America. Politically-active evangelicals
of today might profit from both the mistakes and the successes of their
nineteenth-century predecessors. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Evangelical political activisim in America has a long history
behind it, and present-day evangelicals might learn much from both the triumphs
and the failures of those who came before them. For example, evangelicals
in the early 19th century -- like their counterparts today -- were harshly
criticized for mixing religion and politics. In response, they appealed
to the twin ideas of religious libe4rty and common moral standards articulated
by America's founders. The purpose of this project is to reacquaint today's
evangelical reformers with the wisdom of their forebears. The project includes
public onferences, books, and an historical reprint series of classics of
American evangelical political thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current welfare debate revolves almost exclusively around the
question of how to motivate young women to get off, or stay off, the dole.
Completely ignored are the young men in their lives, except as they are
identified as candidates for child support. Yet establishing the conditions
that will encourage young men to marry the women who bear their children-and
for young women to accept them as husbands-is the central challenge of social
policy today, according to Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder.<BR>
<BR>
Current laws and regulations are biased against family formation and have
created a blighted underclass, Gilder says. However, even today's reformers
continue to think the problem is simply one of impelling young mothers to
forgo child-bearing or to get a job if they already have children.<BR>
Fortunately, Gilder's view is about to re-enter the debate through publication
of a revised version of <I>Visible Man, </I>his 1978 book edited by Midge
Decter. The book<I> </I>tells the true story of Sam, a black youth of the
Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. In a tribute to Ralph
Ellison's classic <I>Invisible Man</I>, Gilder portrays the Sams-the <I>Visible
Men</I> of the American inner city - as the all-too conspicuous victims
of government policy, as well as the frequent victimizers of society. Black
males' income is actually below that of black females', so is educational
attainment, and black males are the only demographic group in American to
suffer a declining life expectancy rate in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The problem, Gilder insists, is not racism, but a failure of government
policy at all levels to reward family life and to discourage deviations
from it.<BR>
The tragedy of Sam is compounded by the passage of time, Gilder notes in
his new introduction to the book. A young man with several illegitimate
offspring when he appears in <I>Visible Man</I>, Sam is now, 17 years later
most likely a grandfather.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Visible Man, </I>billed as a &quot;true story of post-racist America,&quot;
originally sold only 800 copies, though it has become a kind of cult book
for close Gilder readers. Its insights helped inform Gilder's following
book, <I>Wealth and </I>Poverty, which became a world-wide best seller (500,000
copies) and, in revised form, is still in print from ICS Press. (Copies
are available through Discovery's office.)<BR>
This spring Discovery plans to co-publish <I>Visible Man </I>with ICS Press,
placing the original Sam in the context of all that has been learned-and
all that politicians, academics, journalists and philanthropists have failed
to learn-since the first version. </BLOCKQUOTE>

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If members of Congress are not already up to their armpits in
alligators, they soon will be (along with California gnatcatchers, spotted
owls and burying beetles), for the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) is coming
up for the first serious review since the controversial bill was passed
a generation ago. And suddenly gliding deep into the political maelstrom
is <I>Noah's Choice: The </I>Future of Endangered Species (Knopf, N. Y.),
the powerful new book by Discovery Senior Fellow Mark L. Plummer and Charles
C. Mann.<BR>
<BR>
Publication date is February 25, but the book already is attracting eager
interest. &quot;Must read&quot; is the pre-publication judgment of the <I>Kirkus
Review</I>, a journal used by bookstore owners and newspapers assignment
editors, while <I>Publisher's Weekly</I> calls the book &quot;timely, provocative
and reasonable.&quot; Sen. Slade Gorton, who read the book immediately after
his re-election campaign and is a leader on the endangered species debate
nationally, says<I> Noah's </I>Choice is &quot;written with the drama and
emotional impact of a novel. It will make a wonderful contribution to the
debate over how best to steward our natural heritage,&quot; he wrote for
a dust jacket endorsement. &quot;It shows, compassionately and wisely, how
we should weigh values when none can be met in their entirety.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Word apparently is travelling, because other Congressional offices and journalists
have begun asking for advance copies of the book. An article derived in
part from the book graces the cover of the current <I>Audubon</I> magazine,
and other pieces will appear shortly in <I>Science</I> and <I>The Atlantic
</I>Monthly. Discovery Institute and the publishers, Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, will introduce the book in Washington at a press conference and reception,
tentatively scheduled for February 28. A later book party will be held in
Seattle, and the two authors will make appearances in various other cities.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Noah's Choice</I> has been in preparation for three years, with research
taking the authors coast to coast, from limestone caves to sand dunes. During
the last year and a half Discovery Institute has built several conferences,
seminars and dinner forums around the endangered species topic, with attendees
ranging from members of Friends of the Earth to the Wise Use movement, with
government and industry representation as well. Besides Mark Plummer, participating
Discovery Fellows have included former Congressman John R. Miller, whose
<I>Policy Review </I>article on the topic has been widely disseminated,
and Albert Gidari, Jr., author of several scholarly legal monographs on
the constitutional difficulties of the ESA. (See article in box.)<BR>
<BR>
One reason for the broad appeal of <I>Noah's Choice</I> is its manifestly
even-handed account of endangered species and of human beings forced to
deal with the consequences of the draconian Endangered Species Act. More
controversial are sure to be the book's stern prescriptions, which entail
a major rewriting of the act - to share the burden of conservation more
equitably between individual land owners and society at large and to shift
the law's focus from punitive legal sanctions to voluntary incentives.<BR>
<BR>
Nobel prize winning economist Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., reviewing the book,
praised it as &quot;knowledgable, thoughtful and sympathetic.&quot; He expressed
hope that &quot;it may help keep rationality from becoming an endangered
species too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Plummer and Mann collaborated on an earlier book, <I>Aspirin Wars</I>, and
have been personal freinds since a childhood shared in Bellevue, WA. Mann,
a contributing editor of <I>The Atlantic</I>, now lives in Western Massachusetts,
while Plummer resides in Seattle. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Summary</I> </H4>
America needs passenger rail service as an economical and ecological alternative
to endless road and airport construction. Unfortunately, Amtrak cannot (and
probably should not) survive as it is presently structured and funded. Perpetuating
the status quo will burden America with a lame, government-run passenger
operation, limping along on the nation's freight rail rights-of-way, operating
under outdated federal rules from its 1970 authorization, and surviving
on Congressional handouts. <BR>
<BR>
But, the solution is not to throw Amtrak on the market, accepting whatever
happens. What would happen is, Amtrak would die. The proper course is to
reorganize the system, privatizing whatever can be privatized, building
new public-private alliances and compacts around the set of rail corridors
that link cities 100-500 miles apart-which is the functional core of the
national system-and then reconnecting this reorganized nation system to
other forms of transportation to create a true intermodal passenger network.
<BR>
<BR>
But before dealing with Amtrak, we need to understand its true circumstances.
Since its birth in 1971, Amtrak has been a neglected stepchild. The government
had no interest in its success. Neither did the freight railroads, over
whose tracks it ran. Labor made certain Congress burdened it with uneconomical
work rules; politicians picked the routes; bureaucrats ran the place like,
well, a bureaucracy. In retrospect, the wonder is that Amtrak succeeded
as well as it did. <BR>
<BR>
Amtrak's 1994 fiscal crisis coincided with the rise of budget cutting as
a national political priority. Following the election of the new Republican
Congress in November 1994, Amtrak's new president, Tom Downs, tried to adjust
to this priority, cutting 22% of its train miles and 1500 employees and
developing new, flexible strategic business units. Unable by themselves
to save the system, these measures did help reduce the financial crisis,
while improved marketing and a few new routes actually led to a small increase
in ridership. The cuts also alerted ordinary people to the value of passenger
train service. As a consequence, a number of states have offered subsidies
or have committed revenues to help save local service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently, the unwillingness of many Congressmen to buck the opposition
to reform from the rail labor unions, the trial lawyers and commuter rail
states led Rep. Bud Shuster, Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure to declare, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot; His pronouncement
may prove to be prophetic, but it is premature. Amtrak's continuing financial
crisis still can be turned into an opportunity if the public's interest
is sustained and if a government reform process can be formalized. Toward
that end, Discovery Institute proposes the following measures: &#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Approve three years of interim Amtrak operating support, tied to a
firm schedule for transition to a new system. &#183; 
  <LI>Pass a comprehensive Amtrak Privatization and Revitalization Act that
gives management power to eliminate all costs that do not improve service.
This will lift prohibitions against contracting out services, repeal excessive
labor provisions and resolve the legal liability questions between freight
and passenger rail.. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a public-private commission to develop a new national system.
This Rail Alliance for Passenger Services (RAPS) will analyze proposals
for privatizing various corridors. These proposals should come from compacts
among local and state governments, private entrepreneurs, and the freight
railroads over whose tracks the passenger trains run. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is vital that the freights become stakeholders in passenger service.
RAPS will seek ways to upgrade passenger service, infrastructure, technology
and safety. And, RAPS will study development of a truly intermodal passenger
system, closely linking rail to bus service, airports, ferries and other
modes of transportation, with coordinated ticketing. At the end of this
period RAPS will recommend which corridors become part of the new National
Passenger Rail System, and will preside over the transition. <BR>
<BR>
The new National Passenger Rail System will be composed of corridors in
every region of the country, with a national organization setting safety
and service standards. To help justify the cost of long distance trains
that make the national system truly national and which assure service to
rural areas where air service is often lacking, passenger trains should
be allowed to carry mail and packages once more. Further, as in the National
Highway System, there should be a Federal commitment to provide infrastructure
capital-possibly through states and interstate compacts. After all, the
government provides the roads and airports over which the trucking and air
transport industries operate. Indeed, given the congestion in many parts
of the country and the ecological harm inherent in road and airport expansion,
passenger rail may turn out to be one of the bigger transportation bargains
in the federal budget. Why are we in this situation? 
<H4><I>A Little History </I></H4>
<BR>
The United States has not always neglected its railroads. Far from it. In
the 19th century, railroads were closely allied with the government. Land
grants, state loan programs, and other subsidies facilitated rapid expansion.
By the 1890s, indeed, the so-called Rail Barons had achieved incredible
influence and wealth, and some railroads employed more people and took in
more money that the government itself. But power and arrogance triggered
trust-busting and aggressive regulation. The railroads found themselves
fighting against an intermittently irate government, while the press and
populist politicians inflamed voters. <BR>
<BR>
Once the railroads' servile ally, government eventually became their effective
enemy in an era of social experimentation, imposing stifling regulation
and unnecessarily costly labor rules. All rates, routes and service were
under the rigid control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Shippers
became a privileged class in commerce. Railroad workers received a special
Federal retirement program, a Federal unemployment program, and a Federal
tort-based workers compensation program. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, railroads often headquartered in far-away cities saw their rights-of-way
become targets for ever-increasing taxation revenues by state and local
governments. <BR>
<BR>
But even as government presided over the slow strangulation of the railroads,
it began starry-eyed love affairs with the automobile and the airplane.
Upon creation of the Highway Trust Fund and under the general guidance of
the Bureau of Roads in Washington, DC, a great bureaucratic auto constituency
was built in the states. The motor industry and its allies saw the government
as a potential partner, and one of the most powerful lobbies in history
was created. General Motors, the trucking industry, asphalt producers, road
contractors, dealerships, and the American Automobile Association (AAA)
became the &quot;Road Gang&quot; that worked effectively through the Association
of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and the Congress. A similar combination
of &quot;Airmen&quot; pressed for airports in every community and for a
fail-safe air traffic control system. <BR>
<BR>
A bi-partisan political team transformed America. Many of the results benefited
the average citizen and community, but rail transportation was left out
of the new dispensation. Private railroad operators found that cars, buses,
trucks and airplanes operating over government-funded superhighways and
aviation infrastructure became virtually unbeatable. The economic and social
effects were tremendous as cities emptied and people and industry moved
to the suburbs. Freight and passengers were increasingly diverted from the
rail beds to the interstate freeways and the airports. <BR>
<BR>
By 1980, the competition seemed to be over. Much of the railroad industry
was insolvent. Salvaging passenger rail was beyond the capabilities of private
companies. Led by the once mighty Penn Central, Northeast railroads tumbled
into receivership one after the other, followed in the Midwest by the Rock
Island and the Milwaukee Road. At the low point, 25% of America's railroads
were bankrupt, with the Chicago North Western, Illinois Central and Southern
Pacific nearly so. Rail market share continued to fall; debt was staggering,
the physical system was breaking down. A national system failure was probable.
Liquidation or nationalization were serious alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
From the beginning, saving the freight lines received top priority. Passenger
service was an afterthought. The first step toward recovery came in 1971
when Congress created Amtrak as a relief measure for freight railroads.
In 1973, Congress authorized a Northeast rail restructuring process and
a rebuilding of the freight infrastructure that produced Conrail. Congress
then authorized some repayable loans directed primarily at rebuilding midwest
freight lines. The Staggers Act of 1980 eliminated decades of over-regulation
and freed the freights to compete. Profitability soon followed. Unfortunately,
over in the new public sector, service did not fare as well. <BR>
<BR>
It need not have been this way. Although passenger service had been deteriorating
for a half century, experiments in the depths of the Great Depression had
demonstrated that revival was possible. In 1930, Ralph Budd, president of
the Burlington Railroad and his ally, railcar maker Edward Budd (no relation),
committed massive capital to high-speed, light-weight, state-of-the-art
rail technology. In a few years, modern diesel engines were pulling art-deco,
air-conditioned cars at over 100 miles per hour. Consumer response was enthusiastic
and profitable. American passenger trains, such as the California Zephyr
and the Santa Fe Chief, were the best in the world. During World War II,
passenger and freight railroading boomed. <BR>
<BR>
At war's end, the country had a great opportunity to create a balanced transportation
system that included rail. But the government chose to subsidize rail's
air and automobile competitors. Perhaps no one fully understood the long-term
implications for America. Western Europe and Japan, on the other hand, committed
to balanced systems and today enjoy high speed and, in some cases, profit-making
passenger rail operations. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971, the U.S. government finally committed to maintaining passenger
rail. In an exceedingly thoughtless law, no attention was given to restoring
American rail passenger service to a world standard. While Europe and Japan
invested billions in passenger rail to create true modal balance, Congress
directed Amtrak to become a self-sufficient, independent passenger operation.
Government funding was always minimal and no long-term capital commitment
was planned. The results of this policy are now apparent. <BR>
<BR>
The Amtrak Act created several counter-productive conditions. A government-owned
(and ill-financed) passenger system now operated over privately-owned tracks
and infrastructure-the exact opposite of the air and automobile and trucking
systems, where privately owned vehicles utilize government-provided facilities.
Further, the freights had no self-interest in seeing Amtrak succeed, since
the government paid them less-than-market rents for the use of their facilities.
Amtrak trains interfered with the freights' own operations and created unwelcome
insurance and liability problems. They agreed to the arrangement only as
a way of getting passenger service off their backs. Since the establishment
of Conrail, the freights have concentrated on their own core businesses.
<BR>
<BR>
Amtrak never really had a chance. The government didn't care and the private
entrepreneurs were out of the game. And, from the beginning, the Amtrak
Board was dominated by the Department of Transportation. Increasingly, Amtrak
behaved like a government bureaucracy. Middle management, with no incentives
and salaries capped by Congress, became rigid. There was continuous rancor
between management and the 16 rail labor unions, making highest quality
service impossible. The Washington, D.C.-based bureaucracy was nearly blind
to potential state and local community efforts for rail improvement. Further,
Amtrak inherited an ancient fleet and received little capital for modernization.
<BR>
<BR>
Both the Reagan and Bush administrations thought that Amtrak should be zero-funded.
In fact, Amtrak survived largely because senators and congressmen protected
trains running through their districts, enabling Amtrak President Graham
Claytor to maintain limited subsidies. Unfortunately, this meant that Congress
effectively controlled the national route system, which it froze in place
regardless of growing route losses. Congress became a de facto Board of
Directors, albeit a Board that paid attention to Amtrak's business only
sporadically. Statutory labor protection continued to guarantee Amtrak employees
up to six years' salary if they were moved more than thirty miles because
of a route change. Contracting car maintenance or any element of the passenger
operation to lower cost providers was forbidden by Federal law and union
contract. <BR>
<BR>
Under the circumstances, it is remarkable that, for many years under Claytor,
Amtrak arrived as well as it did. A good system was built in the Northeast
Corridor, and new rail cars were acquired. For a period, ridership improved,
creating an illusion that all was well. But decline could not be staved
off forever. By 1994, with a recession and fare wars in the airline industry,
ridership fell, while costs and capital needs increased. By fall, Amtrak
was confronting a cash crisis. In November, Americans went to the polls
and elected the first Republican Congress in 40 years. &quot;Deficit reduction&quot;
became the political battle cry. For Amtrak, the crisis had ripened at the
worst possible moment. <BR>
<BR>
American political debate in the aftermath of the 1994 elections set the
tone of a pseudo-debate. Aggressive freshman and senior budget-cutting Republicans
suggested that Amtrak has no modern function in an age of planes and automobiles.
They proposed &quot;Zeroing Amtrak&quot; in the Budget. Amtrak did make
cuts. But, then, from around the Nation, complaints of those affected quickly
found their way to mayors, governors and Capitol Hill. <BR>
<BR>
The crisis, however, created new interest in Amtrak. Several states, especially
Wisconsin and Vermont, offered subsidies to preserve threatened services.
Amtrak, Washington State, Oregon and British Columbia began incremental
development of high speed rail service along the Cascadia Corridor from
Eugene and Portland, through Seattle to Vancouver, BC. Initial ridership
has been higher than expected and a recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted
the new service and its special emphasis on regional cuisine. North Carolina
inaugurated its new Piedmont Service. Florida and California have committed
revenue streams to high-speed rail development. Amtrak, New York State and
the Federal Railroad Administration developed an experimental 125 mph turbine
train retrofit which is now in service between Albany and NYC; the state
is studying the re manufacture of additional trains to establish a fleet
capable of regular 125 mph service. At the suggestion of Senator Trent Lott,
Amtrak conducted a series of outreach meetings throughout the country. These
meetings produced broad recommendations and also demonstrated popular and
local government support for passenger rail. Passengers have increased four
percent so far in 1995. Maybe, then, passenger rail has a future. 
<H4><I>The Role of Congress </I></H4>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has called for a continued Amtrak and has pushed
for labor provisions to be negotiated through collective bargaining. But
the Administrationcannot or will not advocate immediate cost savings that
cross the rail labor unions. Key Republican Representatives and Senators,
however, have made a clear that substantial savings must come from such
reforms. Further, they insist, Amtrak must have total flexibility to contract
operational functions to low cost, sometimes non-union, providers. To the
Republican leadership, these changes are a pre-condition for continuing
subsidies, even for an interim period. <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of the 104th Congress, veteran Pennsylvania Congressman
Bud Shuster was named chairman of the newly organized Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure (T&amp;I), and that committee and its Rail Subcommittee,
chaired by Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, New York, were
given authority of Amtrak. In the Senate, jurisdiction stayed with the Senate
Commerce Committee where Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota is Chairman.
The Subcommittee Chairman is Trent Lott of Mississippi. Lott also serves
as Majority Whip of the Senate, putting him in a powerful position within
the Leadership. All four key chairmen have expressed support for saving
Amtrak-if it can be reformed. <BR>
<BR>
Hearings began in Congress in the Spring. The popular outcry resulting from
service cutbacks brought new focus. The Committees took a hard look at the
real problems of Amtrak, and of passenger rail in general. First came the
battle of the budget. It was a solid win for proponents of a national rail
passenger service-at least in the short term. During a transition period
through fiscal year 1998, the combined capital, operating and other payments
can total $712 million a year under the Republican-passed budget. <BR>
<BR>
However, Representatives Shuster and Molinari also promised the budget hawks
on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees that they would wring
maximum savings out of the existing system in exchange for these relatively
generous appropriations. Whereas current law prohibits any contracting by
Amtrak, other than for food service, the Shuster/Molinari bill (the Amtrak
Reform and Privatization Act, H.R. 1788) would repeal all anti-contract
law and permit subcontracting of all rail operating functions. H.R. 1788
reduces labor protection payments from 6 years to 6 months for an employee
whose job is eliminated. In addition, the bill places stringent limits on
liability exposure for freight and passenger carriers in intercity (including
high speed) and raises the rent for commuter passenger rail in the Northeast
Corridor. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of these proposed House reforms, rail labor mounted an intensive
lobbying campaign to overturn the contracting and labor protection amendments
which are the heart of the bill. Trial lawyers mounted an effort to remove
the liability limitations, while commuter rail states fought the move to
increase rental rates. When, June 14, the full T&I Committee markup on the
Shuster/Molinari bill was held, opponents caught the bill's backers off-guard,
prevailing on two vital reform votes. Chairman Shuster adjourned the Committee
mark-up without &quot;reporting out&quot; the bill to the House of Representatives.
It was the next day that he announced in the press, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Action moved to the Senate. On June 16, the Senate Commerce Committee held
a substantive hearing on Amtrak. Interest for the next few months has shifted
to this Committee, where it will remain unless the House deadlock can be
broken. <BR>
<BR>
Prospects are certainly unclear. Amtrak has a large enough base in Congress
that is likely to receive some level of financial support for the coming
year-if it is tied to significant reforms. But the base is now more fragile
than in some time. And it is not realistic, in any event, to expect federal
subsidies adequate to restore or improve service over the longer term. But,
the need for inter-city and regional rail is still conspicuous. This means
that now is the time to establish a long-term comprehensive strategy for
our national rail passenger system. 
<H3><CENTER>Making Rail Passenger Service a Success<BR>
The Discovery Proposal </CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361661" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
1: </I>Cut All Administrative Costs Permitted by Law </H4>
Amtrak must take all necessary steps within existing law to cut costs. Under
Tom Downs' leadership, remarkable progress has been made in a short time.
Business-oriented operating units have been established. Service on major
routes has been reduced while reinvigorated marketing has prevented a matching
decline in ridership. In fact, passenger revenues are 4% ahead of last year.
If passenger rail service is to be saved, more can be done within the existing
Amtrak framework. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361901" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
2:</I> Cut All Extra Costs Imposed by Law </H4>
The contracting and labor reforms, as well as liability provisions of Shuster/Molinari,
must be adopted to give the system any real chance of survival. Second,
Railroad Retirement, the worker liability statute known as FELA, and all
of the other costly and non-productive Federal mandates that are unique
to railroads (described earlier) should be ended, or at least sharply reduced.
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio363876" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
3:</I> Maximize Resources </H4>
There are several laws which allow funding for elements of intercity passenger
service. The Swift High Speed Rail Act authorizes grants for development
of high speed rail technologies and corridor planning. The massive Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) allows limited funds for technology
development (section 1036) and grade crossing protection in emerging rail
passenger corridors (section 1010). All of these provisions should be integrated
into a comprehensive intercity rail program. This is a good job for the
Federal Railroad Administration. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio364695" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
4:</I> Design a National System Plan</H4>
<BR>
A blue ribbon federal commission should be charged with development of an
overall passenger system analysis, leading to a new national system plan.
The commission, which, for convenience, we shall call the Rail Alliance
for Passenger Service (RAPS), also should be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the plan. While Amtrak should be represented on RAPS,
membership should be heavily represented by the rights-of-way owners, states
and communities, the general business and labor communities and consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
Some believe that Amtrak itself could take on the functions of RAPS, obviating
the need for a new entity. However, Amtrak never has had a planning capability
and, as a bureaucratic organization with rail operating responsibility,
has a corporate culture and an altogther understandable urge for self-preservation,
that might complicate its performance of the role envisioned for RAPS. <BR>
<BR>
RAPS should be charged with market-driven development of a National Rail
Passenger System that provides incentives for Amtrak and other operators
to make money. Once the new national system is in place, the Amtrak monopoly
for providing intercity passenger service will pass to RAPS. Operations
over the new national system then will be re-distributed to Amtrak or other
qualified passenger rail operators. <BR>
<BR>
<B>RAPS will: </B>&#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Analyze corridors as candidates for inclusion in the National Rail
System. It will contract with a major accounting firm to review Amtrak's
financial and operating records and make findings as to the fully distributed
cost of each Amtrak route. That firm also will make findings about the most
likely shortfalls between revenue and cost on each route. &#183; 
  <LI>Make a special study of the unique Northeast Corridor (NEC) between
Washington and Boston to determine its role in the National System. The
NEC has taken a large share of Amtrak's federally provided capital and is
presently faces an estimated five billion dollars of needed repairs. Amtrak
owns the tracks (which are also used by many commuter trains) and must maintain
the NEC to an exact standard to achieve high speeds. Yet the NEC is a popular
service and the only rail corridor where Amtrak is competitive with airlines.
RAPS would investigate transferring ownership to an interstate compact.
Privatization options, as well as Congress might well designate the Corridor
as a highly controlled &quot;interstate highway,&quot; making it eligible
for trust fund spending, with private users paying a fee to operate high
speed rail service over its lines. &#183; 
  <LI>Analyze the cost and feasibility of upgrading designated routes throughout
the national corridor system to 125 mph. Swift Act planning funds and ISTEA
section 1010 funds will be used to hire engineering firm consultants for
this purpose. Freight/passenger interface problems will be addressed as
will estimates of infrastructure improvement costs. RAPS, further, will
analyze potential funding sources and cost-benefits. &#183; 
  <LI>Over an 18 month period, solicit proposals from multi-party compacts
for corridor route operations and intermodal connections. These pacts should
be composed of: an entrepreneur who proposes to operate the trains, the
host railroads (who may choose to operate the trains themselves), the states
and communities served, and possibly other private stakeholders. Transition
employee interests must be considered. Proposals should include both a realistic
operating budget and financial plan, identify specific funding sources and
ways of overcoming financial shortfalls. Although it is probable that some
long-term federal financial support for infrastructure will be necessary,
each plan should be based on realistic assumptions-not on the hope of a
bottomless well of federal money. 
  <LI>See to it that issues involving host freight railroads are resolved
in compact negotiations. These issues include: grade crossing protection;
liability; operational interface; rent for use of track; and financing capital
improvements (such as higher rail speeds) for passenger operations. Through
the RAPS corridor, the freight owners in each will have a long-term role
in the governance of the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Recommend the specific routes that will become elements of the National
Passenger Rail System and approve the operating plan. This concept assumes
that there will be competition for the right to operate these routes. Different
contractors, freight carriers, and/or state/local authorities may operate
trains on different routes, so long as they meet RAPS' standards,which must
be approved by the Federal Railroad Administration and the track owners
for safety and operating compatibility. &#183; 
  <LI>Permit Amtrak itself and its employees, if they so decide, to privatize
and compete as a member of compact coalitions. In the interim, a residual
&quot;public Amtrak&quot; will need to operate during five-year analysis-and-transition
period. This public Amtrak will continue to operate the existing basic system
but with complete flexibility to achieve cost savings provided in the Shuster/Molinari
legislation. &#183; 
  <LI>Address in this planning process the distribution and ownership of
Amtrak passenger equipment. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a plan for a national intermodal surface passenger system.
This will include a national system of reservations and ticketing, with
links to bus and even air. Intermodal bus/rail stations will be encouraged.
RAPS will set standards and principles of service, including equipment design
and compatibility for the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Provide a permanent residual national authority for oversight and
coordination with the National Passenger System. The RAPS Board will provide
for arbitration of disputes and administration of whatever federal funding
is ultimately authorized. It also will serve as residual holder of the right
to provide passenger service as a part of the National Rail Passenger System.
The RAPS Board will ultimately be privatized. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Funding for the plan Funding for the implementation of the National Rail
Passenger System envisioned in this proposal will be provided in three parts.
<BR>
<BR>
First, Amtrak will be given a general fund operating subsidy for the &quot;interim&quot;
planning period of three to five years. (The 1996 Congressional Budget allows
adequate funding for 3 years.) <BR>
<BR>
Second, the states will be given flexibility to commit discretionary ISTEA
trust funding to &quot;National Rail Plan&quot; rail projects. Currently,
states may not use highway trust fund money for rail. However, in considering
a highway bill recently, the Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen.
Anthony Roth (R.-Delaware) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Delaware) to provide
some highway trust fund flexibility for Amtrak projects. The vote was a
persuasive 64 to 36. Coincidentally, a recent national poll indicated that
63% of the public support the concept of committing gas tax revenues to
Amtrak projects. Nevertheless, Roth-Biden has fierce opposition from the
highway lobby and will face great difficulties in the House of Representatives.
The opponents, unfortunately, include Transportation and Infrastructure
Chairman Bud Shuster. However, if Roth-Biden becomes law, chances for a
passenger rail revival will become greatly improved. At the very least,
it will quickly become clear how much priority the states are willing to
give passenger rail when confronted with a real choice. Besides, in many
corridors, federal capital improvements mean highway/rail grade separation
and improve port access, which benefit community safety, trucking and sea/air
traffic. <BR>
<BR>
The National Rail Plan adopted by RAPS for transmission to Congress will
include a statement as to whether any additional Federal funding is necessary
on a temporary or permanent basis. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, the more detailed the plans developed by RAPS, and the
more solid the state and local commitments, the easier it will be for Congress
to respond with long-term capital funding. Government has traditionally
provided infrastructure investment capital when public benefits are substantial.
For example, on congested or higher speed routes that are shared with freight
trains, double tracking, passing tracks, and state-of-the-art signal and
separation systems (as well as fencing), may prove necessary. Once a rational
planning process has been completed, the Congress will have a solid foundation
on which to allocate national transportation dollars to competing intermodal
priorities. 
<H4><I>Creating a National System </I></H4>
<BR>
A large issue will be how to deal with the long distance overnight trains
that make up much of the current national system. Nostalgia and romantic
names out of the past have political appeal. The question is whether they
make economic sense. Should the Sunset Limited ride into the sunset? Or
can such new (and old) ideas as combined passenger and mail service help
make the longer runs viable? Perhaps states and communities at location
stops along the route could maintain stations and underwrite part of the
cost of service. The answers must come out in the factual analysis and should
not prejudiced at the beginning of the process. <BR>
<BR>
Under this Discovery Institute proposal, the National Passenger Rail System
will be based on the building blocks of corridors in every region of the
country. Only after the corridor compacts have been submitted, analyzed,
and implemented-and costs are known-will it become clear whether national
connectivity should be a system goal. No doubt, the entrepreneurial imagination
of rail and bus operators will see opportunities where bureaucratic thinking
has seen only problems. 
<H4><I>Conclusion</I> </H4>
It is possible and desirable for this country to have a world-class passenger
rail system once again. But what priority will Congress and the people give
to saving and exploiting this asset? There must be a serious debate in Congress-a
debate informed, not just by political pressures from constituents and economic
interests, but by proof of cost-effective readiness to enter new partnerships
and try new arrangements. <BR>
<BR>
Today's new federalist philosophy seeks to return decision-making power
to the people. It seeks to give resourceful, customer-oriented capitalism
a chance. Saving passenger rail falls into this overall challenge. Privatization
is not a magic answer, but it can be a key part of a successful long-term
solution. <BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Coming Jewish Conservatism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><I>From The Washington Times Tuesday, September 26, 1995:</I><H1><CENTER><BR>The Coming Jewish Conservatism </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Adam Pruzan </I></CENTER></H3><IMG SRC="rainbow.gif" WIDTH="793" HEIGHT="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom><BR><BR>For most of this century, American Jews, liberalism and the Democratic Partyhave gone together like bagels, lox and cream cheese. At the present, wecan expect this cozy relationship to continue. However, to borrow PresidentClinton's favorite word, Jewish liberals will increasingly have to contendwith change - and it will not be an easy task. <BR><BR>Liberalism has already changed. From a broad national consensus, in favorof equal opportunity, individual rights, popular sovereignty and economicgrowth, modern liberalism has become a minority ideology, supporting equalityof income, groups rights, the rule of the elite, and redistributionist economics.<BR><BR>Judaism continues to change. The Orthodox community, the largest potentialsource of Jewish conservatives, remains relatively small, but it is growingand vibrant. At the same time, the liberal denominations (including Reformand Conservative Judaism - the latter not to be confused with Jewish conservatism)have sadly become little more than comfortable exit doors through whichgrandchildren, if not the kids themselves, leave the faith. With intermarriagerates over 50 percent we can readily understand Rabbi Alexander Schindler,leader of the Reform movement, when he calls for proselytizing - the firstsuch appeal in Jewish history. <BR><BR>And, of course, the Democratic Party has changed. Others have chronciledand catalogued those changes far better than I could do; for our presentpurpose, it will suffice simply to restate the post-November bottom line:minority party. While our liberal coreligionists deal with these changes,Jewish conservatives should be prepared for an eventual shift within ourfaith that will mirror what has already occurred in the country as a whole.Such a transformation may not happen for decades, but we should understandits underlying dynamics, and do whatever we can to advance the process.To that end I offer the following guideposts. <BR><BR>First, let us steel ourselves for a long and difficult struggle. Jewishdemographics illustrate the problem. Reckoning conservatively (as conservativesshould), we estimate that America has 4 million voting Jews, that only 20percent vote Republican and that only 20 percent of those are real conservatives(the other 80 percent might be Jacob Javits types). This leaves us withonly 160,000 Jewish conservatives. <BR><BR>That number should both sober and encourage us. Although a minority withina minority, we can still comfortably fund an influential national organization,plus a periodical or two. We can partner effectively with far larger Christianconservative groups, benefiting from their size and influence while helpingto guard their flanks. We can offer the major media interesting &quot;manbites dog&quot; stories, potentially gaining exposure disproportionate toour numbers. (The radical feminists have done this for years). <BR><BR>Second, realize that an imbryonic Jewish conservative movement has muchmore intellectual firepower at its disposal than did the original conservativeleadership at a comparable state of development (say, 1955). This newspaper,the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, National Reviews, Commentary andthe American Spectator have all published Jewish conservatives by the score.<BR><BR>Third, get comfortable with putting religion into politics. We must do asour liberal brethren do, not as they say. The Reform movement calls itsWashington office, headed by a rabbi, the Religious Action Center. <BR><BR>Liberal Jews, unabashadly proclaim the religious authority of our sacredtexts, liberal Jews invoke the Talmudic principle of tikkum olam, the repairof the world. For them, &quot;repair&quot; includes active support for thehomosexual, feminist and abortion-rights agendas, the welfare state, andthe NEA. At the same time, liberal Jews vilify conservative Christians forsimilarly acting on their religious beliefs. <BR><BR>By definition, any religious-based attempt to repair the world must involveimposing on others. Modern Jewish liberals do this, so did President LIncoln.In his second inaugral address, a speech of fewer than 700 words, Mr. Lincolninvoked God six times and quoted the Bible three times. Lincoln put religionin politics to justify the Union imposing its values on the Confederacy.<BR><BR>Lincoln acted &quot;with malice toward none, with charity for all and withfirmness in the right as God gives us to se the right.&quot; That is thekind of whole-hearted, noble conviction our conservative Christian friendsshould bring into politics and we should follow their example. <BR><BR>God made our ancestors wander in the desert for 40 years before they couldcross into the Promised Land. Generations inured to slavery and sin hadto pass on before we could fulfill our destiny.

Can a Virtual School Help Improve Learning?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Tom A. Alberg<BR>
Chairman, Discovery Institute</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="zigzag-3.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="6" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>BILL Gates said several years ago that &quot;on a scale of one to ten,
if a mediocre teacher is a three and Socrates was a nine, computers and
software are about a four, with prospects of someday being a six or seven.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It probably is true, indeed, that computers and educational software, by
themselves, will never equate to a great or even a good teacher. But if
today's networked computing is enlisted, the possibilities become more promising.
Networking connects the calculating, storage, retrieval and display power
of electronic machines with people who have ideas, creativity, questions
and emotions. It is a means of asking others for their opinions and of expressing
your own. Its instantaneous reach is around the school or around the world.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The components of high-tech leaming already in use are impressive; from
the increasingly popular and powerful Internet to the expanding corpus of
educational software and CD-ROMS. Distance leaming video broadcasts have
the power to bring the best lecturers to all students. Adding interactive
techniques including wireless and Internet facilities-can create a much
enriched personal experience for students, especially for those living a
long distance from large schools.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we hope to approach the &quot;nine&quot; of Socrates, however, we need
to combine and organize such resources into a coherent program of leaming.
We need to find out how emerging technological possibilities comport with
human nature in practice. We must find out how the new technology works
and how it can be made to work better if we are to know how to encourage
its appropriate development and dissemination. It took generations to create
the traditional classroom; the high technology leaming center of the future
can and should be created in one: ours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One way to concentrate progress in high-technology leaming, while avoiding
disappointments and waste along the way, would be to organize a demonstration
project that tested out new hardware, Internet services and software for
varying kinds of learners. Call it a virtual school. In addition to combining
different high-tech leaming techniques (both Internet and software, for
example), it would pull together the lessons of existing experiments that
operate solely with one kind of technology or in one kind of leaming environment.
Today these experiences are scattered in n-tany homes, public and private
schools, universities and high tech firms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school project is not a job for govemment acting alone, nor
for any one school, foundation or corporation. It should, however, collaborate
with all levels and kinds of existing educational systems and educators-from
state officials to home schoolers, from software manufacturers to telecommunications
companies, from computer scientists to educational television stations,
and with much attention to the actual students and their parents.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A virtual school is not one without human teachers. We may talk about the
virtues of self-leaming, but even the greatest scholars usually operate
within a community, and almost all fledgling students must have a structure
and human guidance. But the nature of the teacher/pupfl relationship may
well change as high technology is introduced.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the experiments in the virtual school, therefore, would seek to discover
what kind of teacher/student interaction works best in a high-tech leaming
environment. We mostly abandoned rote leaming years ago and yet we have
found that total reliance upon student spontaneity does not yield measurable
progress in knowledge and skflls-which is one of the major concerns of school
refon-ners. With new hardware and software technologies, it should be possible
to develop both new kinds of group interaction and self-directed learning.
Accordingly, the job of the teacher is sure to be different, and it will
take experience to discover how to teach in the high tech environment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, what it means to be a student will change. For certain, it will
not be appropriate to give each pupil a computer with CD-ROMs filled with
great literature and hope that he or she will stumble across Nfilton or
The Federalist Papers. Nor should we consider it sufficient to give students
a connection to the Internet, which is a wonderful tool, but often referred
to as &quot;chaotic.&quot; They will need some kind of guide-and some reliable
accountability for results. It may be that the teaching model will be closer
to the tutor of yore than to today's classroom instructor. The &quot;tutor&quot;
guides his or her pupil, suggests certain inquiries and requires a demonstration
of increased knowledge and skill. Sometimes the tutor meets with the pupils
as a group, sometimes singly-sometimes over the Internet and sometimes in
person.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school, then, would be an association of educational tutors
(teachers) and participants of all ages (students), organized and equipped
to make maximum use of existing and new educational software and the Internet.
The tutors would work together to devise curricula, combining desktop software,
specific knowledge based resources on the Internet (such as the Harvard
files on Greek architecture for a fine arts or history course .... ), Internet
communication opportunities (pen pals in Italy for a course on Italian;
topical bulletin boards on whales .... ), interactive video &quot;classes&quot;
and personal meetings and field trips with students.<BR>
Assignments-and tests-in the virtual school would take place largely on
the Internet. Scoring of exams would be faster and easier than now, and
the whole idea of &quot;exams&quot; might change as learning patterns change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyone could &quot;audit&quot; the experimental virtual school, but the
tutorials would require preliminary application and approval. Whether he
or she was a home schooler or someone attending a standard public or private
school, a student would sign up with the virtual school for an actual course
and be assigned a tutor. C)n the other hand, a tutor with his or her own
group of students could also enter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine, for example, how a Garfield High School student who wanted to study
Italian@r some other language not now available in the Pubfic school system-might
sign up for a beginning course with the virtual school. The curriculum for
Italian would carry the student as far as he or she desired, with measurable
milepost results satisfactory not only to the student but to his or her
parents and Garfield advisor. The curriculum would be flexible enough, moreover,
that a hundred students taking Italian through the virtual school could
each learn in his own way and in varying real times, with wide choices of
content to permit instructional custon-dzing. The students also would be
part of an on-line, interactive, real time class. All would have some opportunity
for face-to-face interaction, as desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The tutors would be drawn from existing teachers at schools, supplemented
by other people in the community. For example, the Garfield High School
student who wanted to study Italian, n-dght have a knowledgeable language
teacher at Garfield as the tutor or someone else in the community who was
qualified to monitor his progress. Math and science teachers might be supplemented
by Boeing engineers serving as tutors on the Internet. Lawyers might tutor
constitutional law or environment and public policy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the virtual school would not bear any resemblance to the large physical
structures Of today, it would probably actually exist in physical space
as well as cyberspace and etherspace. There would be meeting rooms at an
otherwise modest virtual school office where you occasionally could meet
your tutor and probably other participants, as well. Rooms would be flexible
in size and also would include the latest high quality video broadcasting
and teleconferencing screens, as well as virtual reality facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most students would use the virtual school as an adjunct to their regular
institutional or home school program. The dynamic of the school would be
such, however, that it would be constantly iinproving itself and expanding,
as the participants learned what worked and what didn't.<BR>
Nationwide, schools are investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars
in high technology products, often for school office improvements, but increasingly
for student learning. The future is likely to see such investments expand
exponentially. But planning for this development currently is sparse (Washington
State is further along than most), and discouraging waste, therefore, is
inevitable unless better information is available on what works and what
does not. Teachers will need to be trained when they are still attending
schools of educationonly a small fraction are computer literate nowand existing
teachers need to be retrained. But trained to do what? A comprehensive virtual
school experiment that is not beholden to any interest can help shorten
the learning curve in the high-tech educational future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we want to pioneer in creating a virtual school in the Puget Sound area,
we must build a constituency that believes, first, that the use and deployment
of computer software, hardware and networks can measurably improve the learning
process, and, second, that the new system should be able to justify itself
in terms of measurable results for students and for the educational system
as a whole. Technology should not become just another expensive addition
to the present system. It should help transform education, facilitating
the real reforms in productivity and cost-effectiveness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But it can't happen without some experimentation, some trial and error me
use of high technology, in other words, to learn more about high tech learning.<BR>

<h3>WHY THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION MUST BE ABOLISHED</h3>
Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty1<br><A href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1057<br>
October 18, 1995<br>
</center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.2<p>	Despite its name, however, the Corporation does not use its budget (currently $400 million) to provide direct legal services to the poor. Rather, it distributes federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country. These grantees also receive another $255 million from lawyer groups, local and state governments, interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA), and private sources.3<p>	Unfortunately, taxpayer-funded legal groups, under LSC, engage in political, lobbyist, and cause-advocacy activities, often at the expense of providing real legal services needed by poor people.
<p>
	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias. Attorneys have promoted racial preferences and illegal immigration, and grantees are sufficiently politicized to become involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning on ballot referendum questions. For the past 30 years, the LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation, advocacy, and lobbying, it has caused an increase in local, state, and federal welfare spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and has effected the addition of millions of people to the welfare rolls.4  It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in other states. It even has engaged in actions -- litigating to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for example -- that harm the poor.<p>	During the 1980s, even though its budget was cut by Congress, the program survived an attempt by the Reagan Administration to eliminate it. Now, however, just as welfare itself is being debated in Congress, so is the LSC's future. Like the War on Poverty itself, the Legal Services Corporation has failed. It should be abolished.
<p>

<b>LEGAL SERVICES AS POLITICAL MOVEMENT</b>
<p>
	Legal Services sees itself as a "movement."5<p>	  According to its founders, its primary mission is not to meet the needs of individual poor people, but to achieve broader social change through "law reform."6<p>	  The Legal Services agenda is grounded in the belief that the "system" creates poverty; therefore, it is the system -- America's economic, political, and cultural institutions -- that must be altered. To this end, the LSC:
<p>
Attempts to effect a redistribution of income by litigating increases in transfer payments through class action suits against local, state, and federal governments;
<p>
Is at the forefront of the so-called rights revolution, litigating to promote "children's rights,"7 to protect aggressive panhandling,8 and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets;9 and
<p>
Engages in lobbying and political advocacy. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers," national in scope and organized around specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food,10 function as the legal arm of a host of social and political causes.<p>	The LSC says grantees handled 1.6 million matters last year. Supporters say allegations of ideological bias are without merit and that, due to sheer volume, it is inevitable that the program will become involved in some controversial cases. But a review of thousands of cases and news articles11clearly indicates that the LSC has never filed a major case opposed to the goals of the homosexual, feminist, or environmental movements or designed to help poor clients preserve the right to home schooling, defend the right to own firearms, stop the establishment of substance abuse facilities in their neighborhoods, or challenge any type of gender or ethnic quota.<p><b>AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY</b><p>	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. In affect, it takes public funds and transforms them into private funds, immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending.
<P>
	The LSC's unique structure, established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (drafted in part by Alan Houseman, a legal services movement theoretician) guarantees a lack of accountability. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation which makes grants to separately incorporated, private, nonprofit grantees, some of which make subgrants to other groups and to each other. An eleven-member board is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation,12 but has little actual influence over grantees and how they spend their grant money. Presidents Ronald Reagan and (to a lesser extent) George Bush appointed LSC critics to the board, but they were unable to effect any real reform. Moreover, by law, the LSC's budget is submitted directly to Congress. All the Office of Management and Budget can do is review it.13<p>	The LSC's status as a private corporation also exempts it from many provisions of the federal criminal code, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act, that apply to government officials. While it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act declares that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought to exercise oversight. They have been all but ignored. Since most grantees receive at least some funding from IOLTA funds and from state and local governments, they can claim that any restricted activities are not supported by LSC funds. The result:  Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy are ignored or circumvented.
<p>
	There is no way to confirm resource allocation claims because LSC attorneys do not keep time sheets. Attorney time is the most valuable asset in any law office, and timekeeping is absolutely <i>de riguer</i> at any private firm. Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of Legal Services lawyers.
<p>
	LSC lawyers do not report their cases to anyone outside their offices, and all client and case records are closed. This secrecy, based on invocation of attorney-client privilege, makes it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Legal Services attorneys. Moreover, there are no provisions for the waiving of this privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered.
<p>
	Because of these built-in problems, there is little information on expenditures, either per case or per type of case. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, Legal Services continues to ask for government funding without offering any detailed evidence of how it has used money already received.
<p>
	At present, the only way the LSC can track how grants are used is through a monitoring program involving on-site visits to programs by Washington-based staff. During the Bush Administration, about 125 visits took place annually, so the average program could expect a visit only once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, this largely ineffective program has been weakened to the point where only six monitoring visits took place last year.
<P>
	It makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman wrote in a 1984 history of the LSC, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."14<p><b>POLITICS AND SURVIVAL</b><p>	After the election of Ronald Reagan, even though the LSC supposedly is restricted in its ability to lobby Congress,15 officials directed a "survival campaign"16 that cost millions of dollars and mobilized thousands of Legal Services lawyers. This effort included such activities as training activists to lobby;17 transferring hundreds of thousands of LSC dollars to sympathetic outside organizations;18 orchestrating positive media coverage; and generating thousands of phone calls, letters, and visits to Congress.19  Some LSC offices were advised to have receptionists respond to potential clients by saying:  "I'm sorry but at this time we are unable to handle this kind of case. Due to the recent proposed federal cutbacks, we have had to reduce our caseload drastically. It would be unethical for us to take any cases.... "20<p>	An LSC grantee, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) became the "corporation in exile."  Having received no more than $72,900 annually in LSC support before 1981, NLADA received $2.2 million in late 1981. Staff members responsible for awarding the grants went on the NLADA payroll after leaving the LSC.21  This effort was known as "saving the rubies," a reference to the action of Czar Nicholas in sending the Russian Crown Jewels to Switzerland for safekeeping during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.<p>	In 1983, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee conducted oversight hearings on the survival campaign. Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) concluded that "The political abuses by LSC and many of its gr
ant recipients were not simply isolated anomalies. They were the business of Legal Services. They were committed on a national scale and were planned by key members of the LSC's national leadership."
<p>
	Also in 1983, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the LSC survival campaign had violated the law.22  This prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. In July 1984, Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott asserted that "the unauthorized activities of the Corporation, and many people associated with it, are uniquely reprehensible and beyond the scope of LSC's original mission" but that "notwithstanding these inappropriate, misguided, and abusive activities, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1913 as well as the federal theft and fraud laws -- for technical reasons -- were not violated by the lobbying activities involved here."23  Among these "technical reasons," of course, was the fact that LSC employees are not subject to laws that apply to federal employees.<p>	LSC grantees have sought to affect the composition of Congress through redistricting litigation. In 1989, the LSC board banned grantees from participating in redistricting cases, only to be sued by Texas Rural Legal Aid, California Rural Legal Assistance, and North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. A U.S. Appeals Court upheld the prohibition, "particularly in light of the Act's mandate to LSC to ensure that the legal services program remain free from partisan political involvement.... " According to Judge (now former White House Counsel) Abner Mikva, "we cannot conclude that LSC has no right to prohibit its grantees from engaging in partisan activities."24<p>	In addition to grants, the legal services infrastructure benefits from money litigated away from taxpayers. The National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas in 1993 to expand its child welfare system and won $314,107 in legal fees.25  Kansas Legal Services has charged clients up to $100 per hour for filing Social Security disability insurance cases, collecting almost $2 million in fees from money awarded in these actions.26<p><b>PROMOTING WELFARE DEPENDENCY</b>
<p>
	LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions in expanded welfare, AFDC,27 Medicaid, and food stamp benefits. Legal Services also has expanded welfare by seeking to nullify any "moral" conditions connected to its provision, such as a requirement for identifying the fathers of illegitimate children;28 by attacking citizenship29 and residency requirements;30 and by signing up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security disability insurance benefits.31  Western Massachusetts Legal Services (WMLS) has published a brochure advising lottery winners that they can stay on welfare by such devices as prepaying rent, buying a special gift, or taking a vacation.32  In 1994, WMLS filed suit to get Arthur Cooney back on welfare after he admittedly had spent the $75,000 he won in a 1992 lottery on drugs and gambling.33<p>	While the exact amount cannot be calculated, government spending for LSC litigation, advocacy, and lobbying has contributed significantly to the national debt. In 1973, former OEO Legal Services Director Earl Johnson, Jr., wrote that "A bare handful of lawyers, scarcely a footnote in the federal budget, has produced massive transfers of goods and services to the poor -- some from the private sector and some from the public treasury."34  Johnson pointed to the initial period between 1965 and 1972, when federal legal services cost the taxpayer a total of $290 million:<p><blockquote>	     [T]he welfare residency decision already has produced between $300 and $600 million added income for the poor, the 1968 man-in-house decision $400-$800 million, the 1969 and 1970 food stamp cases have thus far produced over $450 million in additional food stamp allotments, the prior hearing case over $200-$300 million. The California Medicaid suit saved $200 million in health services, the New York Medicaid case thus far has saved $367 million, and other actions undoubtedly have generated several million in additional income. Thus a total dividend in excess of $2 billion actually has been received by th
e poor since the beginning of the federal investment in legal services to the poor.35 </blockquote><p>		 Asserting that the program's "benefits" outweighed its "cost" by a ratio of 7 to 1, Johnson further calculated that since benefits were won in the form of entitlements, and therefore would continue many years into the future, the actual ratio was closer to 34 to 1.36<p>	Legal Services now seeks to protect earlier gains. To this end, LSC lawyers have responded to the 1988 Family Support Act, which allowed states to seek waivers from the federal government to experiment with welfare, by suing to obstruct or stop virtually every reform that has been attempted.
<p>
	In 1993, for example, Legal Services of New Jersey sued both the state and federal governments to prevent implementation of a cap on AFDC benefits designed to discourage illegitimacy.37<p>	In 1995, the Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI) filed a class action suit challenging Governor Evan Bayh's welfare reform plan, which includes a work requirement and benefit reduction for families that fail to get their children immunized or to send them to school.38  An LSOI-employed lobbyist organized opposition to the plan when it was before the Indiana legislature.39<p>	Legal Services also has sued to block welfare reform in California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Should Congress enact a serious overhaul of the welfare system, it is safe to assume that LSC lawyers will fight its implementation in the courts as well.<p><b>HELPING TO DESTROY PUBLIC HOUSING</b>
<p>
	One of the major problems in public housing today is drug-related crime. In Georgia, according to John Hiscox, Executive Director of the Macon Housing Authority (MHA), "One of the most difficult and persistent obstacles to removing drug-related, criminal activity from public housing has been Georgia Legal Services."  While it has never won a case, GLS routinely demands costly jury trials. The result:  The MHA's average legal cost for an eviction went from a few hundred dollars in 1987 to $8,000 in 1990. During the same period, its annual legal bill increased from $10,000 to $90,000.
<p>
	In 1989, Georgia Legal Services tried to prevent the eviction of Tina Burke, whose apartment was surrounded by gangs of young men and lookouts. During surveillance, police witnessed her presence during drug transactions in her apartment. But GLS maintained that she lacked knowledge of such transactions. In 1994, tenant Shon Scott was arrested after leaving a crack house two blocks from his residence. Along with a firearm and a beeper, he possessed 33 pieces of crack cocaine. He pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute. GLS fought Scott's eviction on the basis that his crimes did not take place on public housing property.40<p>	In New York City, the Legal Aid Society of New York went to court in 1994 to challenge the New York Housing Authority's plan to make it easier to evict drug dealers by cutting the process (which now can take as long as three years) to only three to four months. The Interim Council of Presidents, the organization representing public housing tenant groups, filed a brief in support of faster evictions. Tenants say they cannot sit out at night, let their children play after dark, or even visit others in their own buildings.41<p>	In Pennsylvania, when the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) attempted to evict a woman who allegedly was dealing drugs, loan sharking, and extorting money from other tenants, an LSC grantee filed a federal civil rights suit on her behalf and won on the grounds that the PHA had not given her adequate notice of the charges. Legal Services lawyers obtained $5,500 in legal fees. In 1993, another tenant set fire to her unit and the PHA won her eviction in state court. Legal Services filed a federal civil rights case and won a stay of the eviction. As of June 15, 1995, the case was still pending.42<p>	In Pittsburgh, Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has sued Northside Tenants Reorganization (NTR) repeatedly to prevent evictions of tenants responsible for drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. NTR is a tenant group which manages and owns its own low-incom
e housing. NTR Executive Director Harriet Henson and a building manager say they saw a tenant's boyfriend complete a heroin deal. "It took us two years to evict because NLS took us to appeal and appeal and appeal."43<p><b>UNDERMINING THE FAMILY</b><p>	Some Legal Services cases undermine the rights of parents. In 1994, notwithstanding a congressional ban on involvement in abortion litigation, the National Center for Youth Law (NCYL), co-counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, succeeded in overturning a 1987 California law requiring a teenager to seek the approval of a parent or juvenile court judge before getting an abortion. NCYL sought legal fees for 681 hours at $300 per hour from the state. It was awarded two-thirds of the amount it sought, pending eventual success before the California Supreme Court.44<p>	In another area, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law in April 1995 admonished Idaho parents about inviting police into their homes to search for drugs they suspected their children of using. The innovative Canyon County, Idaho, program is completely voluntary, and police make no arrests unless the drugs they find are especially dangerous or in large quantities.45<p>	Other cases also carry serious implications for adoptive parents. In 1993, for example, the Idaho Legal Aid Society (ILAS) sued to take a four-year-old child away from his legal parents. Karla and Leland Swenson had adopted a half-Sioux boy in 1989 when he was one-day old and were raising him on their dairy farm. ILAS claimed the boy should live with Indian relatives even though neither of his natural parents had sought custody. Representing the natural father's Indian sister, ILAS argued that a tribe's efforts to preserve its cultural integrity took precedence over the best interests of the child. The Swensons sold their home to raise funds to continue the legal fight.46<p>	In New Jersey, Somerset-Sussex Legal Services is seeking to take a one-year-old boy away from his adoptive parents because his natural
 father wants him back. Reverend Paul Rack and his wife adopted the baby in February 1994 when he was three weeks old. According to a letter circulated by community leaders in support of the Racks, the natural father is unemployed, has a criminal record, and already cannot support several other children.47<p>	In a third case, however, Legal Services fortunately did not fare well. Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Legal Services sued to get parental rights for the 16-year-old father of a child conceived by his rape of a 13-year-old. The rapist has a long criminal record and two other illegitimate children. In March 1995, the judge ruled against LVLS and criticized "misguided adults" for bringing the case.48<p>	Several LSC actions advance goals of homosexual activists. In 1993, James Cox and his male "partner" attempted to adopt a child. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services denied their application because Florida law prohibits homosexual adoption. The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation successfully sued, the state appealed, and the statute in question was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court on April 27, 1995.49  Legal Services of Greater Miami filed a brief in support of the ACLU Foundation's position in this case.<p>	In a similar 1994 case, Brooklyn Law School's Family Law Clinic, another LSC grantee, successfully represented a lesbian seeking to adopt her female "partner's" child. A Family Court ruled that a same-sex partner had the same rights as a stepparent for purposes of the adoption statute.50  In a 1989 case also attempting to equate homosexual relationships with the traditional family, the Legal Aid Society of New York and Community Action for Legal Services, Inc., filed amicus curiae briefs in state courts arguing that a "gay life partner" should have the same right as a spouse to remain in a rent-controlled apartment after the tenant's death. The New York Supreme Court agreed.51<p>	LSC lawyers even have attempted to secure legal recognition of a right to public housi
ng for minors. In a 1993 case, a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld federal requirements that public housing be leased to tenants at least 18 years old, and in 1991, Central Pennsylvania Legal Services sued the Reading, Pennsylvania, Housing Authority for refusing to lease a unit to an unemancipated and unmarried 16-year-old girl.52<p><b>PROMOTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</b><p>	The Legal Services apparatus has been equally active on issues pertaining to illegal immigration. When the voters of California passed Proposition 187 in 1994 to deny public benefits to illegal aliens, California Rural Legal Assistance, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other groups filed suit to stop its implementation.53  Prior to election day, LSC grantees campaigned against the measure. Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, told the media that "It's just a question of whether we have the time or the resources to lay Prop 187 bare."54<p>	The National Immigration Law Center (NILC), a Legal Services support center, sued the state of California over a 1992 law requiring those seeking emergency health services under Medi-Cal to disclose their immigration status. Legal Services attorneys contended that the law should be struck down because it would deter undocumented immigrants from seeking emergency services. The California Supreme Court rejected this argument in December 1994.55  The NILC also condemned Congress's insertion of a stipulation into the $9 billion earthquake relief bill last year prohibiting non-emergency aid to illegal aliens. The amendment denied illegal aliens access to home repair loans, disaster grants, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance, although it did allow them to collect emergency food and clothing.56<p>	The National Immigration Law Center also sued to force the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to stop asking resident aliens to pay $70 to renew green cards issued before 1978. The replacement program was part of an INS effort 
to end widespread document fraud. Legal Services claimed the $70 fee was excessive. A federal judge in Sacramento, however, disagreed and upheld the fee in November 1993.57<p>	This Legal Services activity extends even to the deportation of criminals. In Georgia, for example, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society attempted to halt the deportation of Cuban nationals convicted of committing serious crimes, including attempted murder and drug trafficking. Arriving in 1980 via the Mariel Boatlift, the Cubans committed these crimes while on immigration parole. After their release from prison, their immigration parole was revoked, and authorities subsequently placed them in detention to await return to Cuba. Atlanta Legal Aid lawyers said their detention violated their constitutional rights and international law. In 1993, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the petition.58<p>	In Massachusetts, Greater Boston Legal Services sued to stop the deportation of an alien resident who had been convicted of serious drug offenses. A Dominican woman was tried, convicted, and sentenced on four drug offenses that took place in 1982, including possession of and intent to distribute cocaine. Twelve years later, in 1994, a U.S. Court of Appeals let the deportation order stand.59  Another case involved the ability of the INS, under the 1986 Immigration Control Act, to deny residency to immigrants with one felony or three misdemeanors. In 1992, California Rural Legal Assistance sued the INS to stop the denial of temporary residency to immigrant agricultural workers with criminal records, arguing that this practice violated both the workers' Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Rules Procedure Act. In 1994, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the Fifth Amendment claims but upheld Legal Services' challenge on administrative grounds.60<p>	Two LSC grantees sued California's Department of Motor Vehicles for refusing to issue drivers' licenses to illegal aliens. As required by law, the DMV requires that all applicants provide proof of legal reside
ncy to obtain licenses. The National Immigration Law Center and California Rural Legal Assistance sued the DMV on behalf of several illegal aliens whose applications had been rejected. A state appeals court ruled that the "DMV is not only authorized but obligated" to deny licenses to illegal aliens.61<p>	In yet another California Rural Legal Assistance case, the organization in 1982 sued U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello for investigating allegations that unqualified aliens had been registered to vote. The purpose of this investigation was not to prosecute improperly registered voters, but to find out whether someone was deliberately signing up unqualified residents. CRLA sued Russoniello on the grounds that his investigation of Spanish-speaking residents was "invidious discrimination."  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument.62<p>	The extremes to which such litigation can be pushed may be indicated in a 1991 case. Two LSC grantees, Texas Rural Legal Aid and the Los Angeles-based National Health Law Program, filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to sue the McAllen, Texas, Medical Center because its security guards wore uniforms allegedly resembling those of Border Patrol agents. Legal Services said this discriminated against illegal aliens because it discouraged them from seeking care.63<p><b>PROMOTING RACIAL PREFERENCES</b><P>	The Legal Services apparatus certainly is no stranger to litigation that promotes racial preference. In 1978, LSC filed an <i>amicus</i> brief supporting the University of California's minority set-aside program in the famous <i>Bakke</i> case. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, declared the UC-Davis set-aside unconstitutional because it reserved places for minorities exclusively because of their race.64<p>	In a 1992 case, the outcome was somewhat different. The Cincinnati, Ohio, quota system, adopted in the 1970s, required that at least 18 percent of all fire personnel be minorities. To achieve this numerical goal, the fi
re division made it a practice to insure that at least 40 percent of all new recruits were minorities. White applicants who scored higher than minority applicants on the civil service exam but were rejected sued the city for reverse discrimination. A U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati's position and ruled that the white applicants' constitutional rights were not violated.65<p><b>HELPING CRIMINALS</b>
<P>
	In addition to litigating in behalf of criminals the government is seeking to deport, Legal Services lawyers have been active in behalf of domestic criminals. Starting in 1991, for example, Georgia Legal Services has filed petitions for the release of David Nagel from a maximum security mental hospital. Nagel was imprisoned for murdering both his grandparents by slitting their throats in 1981 when they refused to give him the car keys.66<p>	In Florida, Greater Orlando Area Legal Services in 1989 successfully sued the Orange County Jail to stop segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Infected inmates now are placed in the general prison population without notification to other inmates in order to insure their "privacy."  The suit was filed on behalf of 18 former inmates, most of whom were deceased when the case was settled in 1994. After four and a half years of litigation, a federal judge ordered Orange County to pay Greater Orlando Area Legal Services $81,500 in legal fees.67<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed. Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds. Most legal problems faced by the poor fall into several basic categories:  family, including divorce, custody, guardianship and child support; housing, including landlord/tenant controversies; financial, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and inability to pay bills; consumer; employment; and public benefits. While taxpayer funds are provided to Legal Services for the handling of individual cases, too great a portion of such funds are used to pursue class action suits and ideologically important test cases.
<p>
	Legal Services has helped to destroy the independence and dignity of poor people and to create a permanent underclass. Its activities undermine both the family and the larger community. For the sake of the American taxpayer -- and for the sake of America's poor -- it is time to abolish the Legal Services Corporation.

Most of the cases could be brought in state court, but Legal Services entities typically prefer the federal courts where they can collect attorney's fees.

<title>Straight Talk November 1, 1995 Transcript</title>
<body>
<center><h2>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</h2>
<p>
<h4>Broadcast aired Wednesday, November 1, 1995, 8:00-9:00 P.M.</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've never seen this show before, <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  You may be wondering what we're
about or why we have a television show.
<P>
 Well, the Family Research Council has been researching and influencing
government and cultural policies affecting the American family
since 1981.  Already this year, Family Research Council has appeared
on more than 50 television programs, from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> to PBS
<i>MacNeil-Lehrer</i> to ABC's <i>Nightline</i>.  In fact, we are profiled in
the <i>New York Times</i> news feature, today.
<P>
 We've responded to what many have to say about families.  I am
your host, Kristi Hamrick, and now <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> gives you the opportunity to hear what we have
to say, unedited.
<P>
 You watch the news and read the newspaper, but do you ever wonder
if you're getting the real story?  Gary Bauer is one source that
you can trust.  He knows what is happening behind Washington's
closed doors, from years of experience, from the Reagan White
House to grassroots America.  For a news perspective you can't
get in the newspapers, our first segment features Gary Bauer,
president of the Family Research Council, Behind the Headlines.
<P>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<P>
Gary, it has been a very historic week on Capitol Hill, and particularly
with the budget.  We've seen some real fights, almost to the finish.
 What's your perspective on the historic things we have been seeing
lately?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think what's so unique about this past week is
that we've had a group of people run for office last year promising
the American people they would cut the budget, they would get
a balanced budget on the books that really would be predictable
and something where there would be a deadline for that balanced
budget.  And they have come to Washington and, lo and behold,
they have actually done what they said they were going to do in
the campaign.
<P>
 There has been a lot of public cynicism, and legitimately so,
in the last few years, about politicians saying one thing and
doing another.  But this latest group of Congressmen and Senators
have fulfilled their promises, and I think the American people,
over the next year, when they begin to look at the details instead
of listening to some of the scare tactics, are going to be astonished
and quite pleased that we now have some fiscally responsible people
in Washington and are cutting back the size of government.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In this budget debate, we have seen some new heroes
as a result of the last election.  What's your perspective on
who deserves the credit for the historic things taking place on
Capitol Hill?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  There's a lot of good guys in the House and Senate,
but I think the thing that really stands out is this freshman
class, particularly in the House of Representatives.  They have
come here, and they haven't been taken in by the power structure
of Washington at all.  They really have moved to cut some programs
that even impact their own home districts.  They have been willing
to take on their own leadership on occasion, which is really extraordinary
for freshmen.
<P>
 And so I think there has been a real generational change.  If
we have a couple more cycles like this where the types of people
you get in the House and Senate from both parties are more willing
to deal with some of these tough issues, I think the country will
be a lot better off for it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think what strikes me about that -- and I am
interested in your perspective -- is here we see the most successful
class of recent history, maybe of all time, in terms of a real
change from the floor up, saying it's economic and social issues.
 At the same time, we see the GOP, it would appear, ready to throw
away the marriage of those issues and go with someone like perhaps
a Powell.  Colin Powell is in the news a lot lately.  What's your
perspective on what it means for the GOP or just what it means
for the current political climate?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Christy, I think the important thing
here is not the Powell candidacy or Bob Dole's candidacy or Phil
Gramm's candidacy; all of that will sort itself out, I think,
in the months ahead.  But the key thing really is what kind of
party is it; what are the principles the party stands for.
<P>
 I got into politics way back in 1964 in the Barry Goldwater campaign,
which was a disaster at the polls but began the movement in the
Republican Party to becoming a predictably conservative traditional
party.  And as the party stood for those principles over the years
after that, it began to win elections.  When it violated some
of those principles, the conservative coalition got divided, and
then we would lose elections.
<P>
 I guess the most obvious example is when some of his advisors
convinced George Bush to raise taxes.  I understand the pressure
he was under, but that was a mistake, and it ended up creating
Ross Perot and costing Bush the election.
<P>
 My hope would be that whoever the nominee of the party is a year
from now, that the party remembers that it has gotten this success
because it stood for things:  low taxes, smaller government, traditional
family values, the sanctity of life, a strong foreign policy.
 Those are the things that have gotten the party where it is today.
 Those are the things, I think, that can carry it into victory
later and make it the majority party in the next century, and
those are the things that I certainly want to fight for in the
months ahead.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One last question, Gary.  There is a lot going
on on the Hill, and I know you need to get back to the phone calls,
Congressmen and Senators lining up.  But one thing that we hear
a lot about these days is that social conservatives are willing
to give on certain points.  And yet one of the things I know that
-- some of the data that Family Research Council has been looking
at, original polling, would indicate that some of those values
aren't for sale.  What's your perspective on whether or not conservative,
pro-family Americans are willing to have victory at any cost or
whether there are some things that are going to be sticking points
as people start looking at their platforms, issues, and just the
kind of society we want?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think this is really important for the party establishment
to understand.  If the party walked out again on tax issues, for
example, or if for some bizarre reason it became a big-tax party,
millions of voters would walk out of the party at that point.
 These voters believe that Americans are overtaxed.  I believe
Americans are overtaxed.  So the party really needs to stay with
that issue.
<P>
 Likewise, if the party walked out on the concept of the sanctity
of human life, or if they walked out on issues involving parents
and the rights they ought to have in raising their children, if
they did that, there is a significant segment of the Republican
Party that would walk out on them.
<P>
 So I think it is a pretty basic issue.  Parties stay together
and become majorities because they deal with the issues that draw
those voters to them, and when they abandon those issues, the
voters abandon the party, and I think that is what would happen
in 1996.  I hope the party or no one in the party is so foolish
as to think that they can throw anybody in the coalition a bone
and somehow still get their votes on election day.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being
with us, Gary.  We'll look forward to some of your insights next
week. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll ask some hard
questions about what is happening to our children's education.
 Stay tuned.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 ANNOUNCER:  Parents want their children to learn how to read,
to write, to do math, and to tell right from wrong.  We want schools
that teach sound curriculum and positive values, schools where
teachers are good role models.  At one time, it didn't seem like
this was too much to ask, but today our school system is not accomplishing
this essential task.
<P>
 Secretary of Education Richard Riley says that he has the answer.
 He says that he has a system that works, and it is called Goals
2000.  Those opposed to Riley believe that Goals 2000 creates
federal control over our children's education and over our rights
as parents and communities to have a say in that education.
<P>
 As a result, some states refused to cash in on the program. 
Virginia and New Hampshire never took a penny of the Goals 2000
funds, and Alabama recently sent back the $1.4 million in federal
funding they had received under Goals 2000.  If other states follow
suit, Goals 2000 may eventually go out of business.
<P>
 But for now, a growing number of parents are becoming increasing
disillusioned and distrustful of the public school system.  More
children are being enrolled in private schools, and some 400,000
families are currently homeschooling.
<P>
 The homeschool movement has become a promoter of strong family
relations and a model grassroots organization, providing a framework
for educational reform.  Yet Riley contends that Goals 2000 would
benefit all families, and he claims that there are no strings
attached.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What are parents to believe?  Bill Mattox, Vice
President for Policy, and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy
Analyst, both with the Family Research Council, are here to help
us understand why, for some, Goals 2000 is a four-letter word.
<P>
 Jennifer, you've worked quite a bit on education issues for us,
and what we have seen is that it is one of those things where
the advertising doesn't really represent the product.  What is
in Goals 2000 that gives us concern?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It is easiest to look at Goals 2000 as an application
process, where the state is required to do certain things to get
money from the Federal Government, and the Federal Government
requires that a state would turn in its standards and its assessments
in order to get money for this.  And that is an inappropriate
role for them.  They are not to be dealing with curriculum.  Historically,
they haven't been allowed to; now they have transgressed into
that area.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  So it is kind of like all the schools have to submit
their lesson plans -- 
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Exactly.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  -- and the Federal Government is going to say,
&quot;I like it; I don't like it.&quot;
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But some would say national standards are a good
thing.  I mean, we are looking at inner-city schools with falling
test scores, and we are saying, How do we make it better?  Why
not national standards?  I mean, what's wrong with that?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It's an easy answer; you're right.  But we've
seen with these national history standards exactly what can go
wrong.  They're easily captured by a political faction, and for
anybody who didn't think that the politically correct, anti-American
history standards that we saw last year were a problem, well,
what if Senator Jesse Helms or Representative Newt Gingrich had
written those?  I think we would have a different picture.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What's kind of interesting about Goals 2000 is
it makes it out as though government is the solution to our educational
problems.  And, Bill, I know you have taken a look at children
who really do succeed.  A lot of people may have seen some of
Bill's columns country-wide, as a matter of fact, from the Detroit
News even on this topic.
<P>
 What have you seen, Bill, in terms of children who succeed? 
Why do they succeed in school?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it's interesting.  For a long time, there
has been a great deal of inquiry into questions about why do kids
in certain schools do better than those in others, and dating
back to the mid-1960s, one of the things that has shown up consistently
in the research is that it is not so much what goes on at the
school that may be ultimately most significant; it is, instead,
what is taking place in the home and how rich a learning environment
kids have in the home.
<P>
 When kids have the benefit of growing up in a household where
their parents are actively involved in reading to them, in sharing
in mealtimes where there is a rich dinnertime discussion, in tucking
them into bed and that kind of thing, there are significant differences
that show up in terms of how well kids do in school.  How much
access kids have to home learning tools, to encyclopedias, books,
newspapers, computers, things of that nature, have a dramatic
effect on a child's learning.
<P>
 One of things that I guess concerns me a great deal about Goals
2000 is that it further marginalizes parents.  It kind of pushes
them to the periphery of the education of children and does not
recognize them as a central player.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Secretary Riley -- I have seen the news conference
where he was talking about this new partnership with parents and
how important that they are.  Does anything the government is
doing right now, or maybe the Clinton Administration, really facilitate
a greater partnership with parents?  I mean, in Goals 2000, is
one of the goals Mom and Dad showing up and helping?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  There is quite a bit of rhetoric, actually, about
parental involvement.  But we find a problem when it is the government
defining exactly what parental involvement will be.  We have seen
parents be relegated to a back seat -- just pay and be quiet about
the way schools are run -- and that is not an appropriate role
for involving parents at all.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes.  I mean, this is such an important point, because
a lot of times, you are right, there is a lot of lipservice about
parental involvement.  The Secretary just put out a report last
year saying, Boy, parents are key to education.  And yet when
you stop and really examine what they are saying, the way that
they define parental involvement is, well, if you think of a potluck
dinner, I think they seem to think that what schools and experts
like themselves provide is kind of the meat and potatoes of education,
and what parents provide is kind of the dessert.  It's a nice
frill, but it's not absolutely essential to the well-being of
children and to their educational development.  And yet the research
consistently contradicts that point of view.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One would think, if you look at some of the Clinton
Administration rhetoric on Goals 2000, that every state is clamoring
for this money, because it all comes down to money.
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Jennifer, what does your analysis show in terms
of how states -- are they embracing this?  Are they exciting about
it?  What's happening at the grass roots?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  You'd be surprised at how much murmuring there
is against Goals 2000, both at the federal and the state level.
 Two states flat out said, &quot;No, we will not take this money.&quot;
 They absolutely rejected the money, and that was New Hampshire
and Virginia.  And then we saw an almost unprecedented move of
Alabama to send back federal money and say, &quot;No, thank you;
we won't stoop this low to take this money.&quot;
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That's kind of astounding.
<P>
 I know, Bill, you've been looking at different educational reforms
in the state.  What states have seen better numbers, or have we
seen better partnerships with parents anywhere?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, the key, I think, is to not think so much
in terms of systems or even in terms of states, but to really
look at how can we succeed in furthering education at the local
level, because one of the things that comes out of the research
again consistently is not just that parents are central players
in this process, but when they are surrounded by a community of
adults that are prepared to help them in that process and to support
them, then you then see the kinds of results that I think we are
all looking for.
<P>
 And so I think a lot of the key to this debate is getting the
discussion back to the local level, getting the Federal Government
-- and even in many ways the state government -- out of the action
and really putting emphasis on the local community and especially
on parents.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I have been really interested as I have been looking
at the data that small things -- whether you read to your child,
which we'll talk more about later; whether a parent even attends
a PTA meeting, or whether there is even a father in the home --
that even family structure needs to be read, rather than what
dollars per child in education.
<P>
 Bill, you headed a fathership program at Family Research Council
for a long time now, Being a Dad Is Important Business.  Just
quickly, as we are getting near the end, what do we know about
the importance of even a father in the home, or for those people
with broken family structures, the importance of having a dad
involved, or a dad figure?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, this is a very important point, because a
lot of the research tends to focus on what are sometimes defined
as process variables; that is, are families eating together, are
they reading to children, are there various processes taking place
within the family that might enhance a child's learning?
<P>
 And yet we know that families in which fathers are present are
much more likely to have these kinds of things take place.  There
are dramatic differences in the rates, say, for example, of how
many family meals a family might enjoy together between two-parent
and single-parent households, and it's not because single mothers
have any less desire to be home and to be able to sit down and
dine with their kids; it is that they are quite often facing extraordinary
odds in trying to do the work of two parents by themselves.  And
it becomes very difficult for all the different trains to run
on time and for them to have the kind of routine that is actually
quite important to a child's well-being and educational development.
<P>
 So it is important that we recognize that the contribution that
families make is one that comes from these different processes
taking place, but there are family structures -- namely, those
in which both parents are present -- that lend themselves more
to these kinds of activities than single-parent families.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Goals 2000, Jennifer, it tries to say that
if we tweak things -- numbers of books, numbers of classrooms,
teacher ratios -- that it is all the hard variables, hard-wired
things, that make a big difference.  Is that accurate?  Would
you say that Goals 2000 says, &quot;Give me enough books; I can
give you an A student&quot;?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  They focus on something called opportunity-to-learn
standards, which is just what you've described:  what goes in,
the inputs, measuring how much we've got there.  And it's all
about systems management.  It doesn't deal with the classroom
learning, the human variables, as Bill as spoken of, at all.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And the human variables make a big difference.
<P>
 When we come back, we're going to add some more human variables.
 We're going to be talking with Mike Farris, president of the
Homeschool Legal Defense Association, and we'll find out why he's
concerned about Goals 2000 and what defense strategies he's using
to combat government control of education here in Virginia and
nationwide.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're joined by Mike Farris, president of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.  Many political watchers may remember
him as the man that the entire Democratic Party ran against in
recent Virginia elections.
<P>
 Welcome, Mike.  Glad to have you here.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for coming.
<P>
 We were talking about some of the problems with education earlier,
and I know they drove you in a very powerful direction:  out of
the schools.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Right.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Tell me, why did your organization decide that
we need to go a completely different direction?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, let's start with my family.  I was raised
in a public school family.  Not only did I go to public schools
myself; my dad was a public school principal.  In fact, I was
being prepared to be a lawyer for school districts.  My undergraduate
honors thesis was written under the tutelage of the state school
board's attorney.
<P>
 Someplace along the line, I figured out that the philosophy that
had taken over the education system was antithetical to the Christian
values that I believe in.  So we decided, first of all, for Christian
schools for our oldest daughter in kindergarten and first grade,
and then we heard about homeschooling and we decided to try that
14 years ago, and that is kind of a similar story -- change the
facts a little bit, but the themes are the same -- and there are
about 400,000 families homeschooling their kids today.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And Goals 2000, did that exacerbate the numbers
of people going one direction or the other?  I mean, what are
you seeing in terms of educational trends today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, homeschooling is growing at a very rapid rate.
 Private schools are growing at a rapid rate.  Goals 2000 helps
the growth of the private school and homeschool movement.  Frankly,
the thing that helped it the most was the election of Bill Clinton.
 Within about three months after Bill Clinton's election, we saw
the most phenomenal growth rate ever in membership of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.
<P>
 So I think that that is -- people's uncertainty about their government
is translated to uncertainty about schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the government, the Family Research
Council, under Jennifer's excellent assistance, and Bill, and
Bob Morrison, put together this brochure, Let Freedom Ring, which
took a look at the national history standards.  And it was amazing
to see what they left out, everything from Thomas Edison to the
man on the moon, as you saw earlier.
<P>
 Jennifer, you have been taking a look at what has been happening
in schools.  What kinds of voids are you seeing?  Do you agree
with the voids that Mike is describing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes, and the national history standards show a
direction, a very negative direction, in which public education
is going.  We produced this document with five staff over a course
of five weeks with a couple thousand dollars.  It took the Federal
Government $2 million, over two years, and a panel of probably
hundreds of experts to come up with the anti-American product
that they put out last year.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it needs to be pointed out here that
not only did they overlook some of the folks that you mentioned,
but they did in fact find a way to include Madonna and the Simpsons.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 So, somehow, somewhere, the priorities were out of whack.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of Mike's organization, recently I was
at a hearing where this whole piece of data came up that the larger
the family, the less intelligent the children at the end; that
somehow large families and homes break down when it gets to numbers.
<P>
 But we were talking about education earlier, Bill, and you saw
a whole different trend and in fact wrote about that recently
in an Op-Ed.  What did you see?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, this has been a common theme in education research,
and it is confirmed by a new study that's out in just this month's
American Sociological Association Journal, which shows, just as
you said, the larger the family size, the poorer the educational
performance, supposedly.
<P>
 The key thing to remember, though, is this:  that some research
that has recently been done at the University of Michigan refutes
these findings in some very interesting ways.  What the University
of Michigan researchers did was they looked at some Vietnamese
boat children, some kids who had come over as refugees after the
events in the 1970s in Vietnam, and they saw that these kids were
doing amazingly well in the public school system.
<P>
 They began to ask, why is it that these kids are doing so much
better than many of their peers?  And they went and looked at
the dynamics taking place in the home and found that even though
these kids were coming from larger families, even though their
parents really could not speak much English, these kids were doing
exceptionally well; and part of the reason was because there was
something akin to the old one-room schoolhouse effect taking place.
 That is, after the kids would eat dinner, they would clear off
the dining room table.  The older children would tutor the younger
children, which would have the effect of reinforcing some of the
things that they were learning as well as transmitting new information
to the younger children.
<P>
 What that study showed is that if you think of children as kind
of educational consumers alone who are drawing upon their parents'
resources, one can easily imagine where this theory that the larger
the family size, the poorer the kids do in school comes from,
because they are all then in a sense competing with one another
for their parents' attention and resources.
<P>
 But if, instead, these older children end up serving in a sense
as educational producers who are contributing to the educational
environment in the home and making it a richer environment, then,
all of a sudden, everyone does better, and in a sense a rising
tide lifts all boats.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you've got to be seeing this kind of thing
if you look at homeschooling.  Just today I was reading in the
paper that we are seeing the data across the board that homeschooled
children test better.  What do you see as you are looking at homeschools,
children working together, families working together?  What does
the data show in your people?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Homeschoolers score 20 to 30 percentile points higher
than the public schools.  And so I would be happy to match any
ninth-born homeschooler with any firstborn public schooler any
day.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 You can jimmy numbers any way you want, but the reality is my
ninth-born child is a smart little kid, and I have no doubts that
he is going to do just fine, and that he is enriched by the large
family.  And, frankly, if you control for some socioeconomic factors,
then I think that it is a complete explanation of these what I
would consider to be phony studies.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of homeschooling, you have had a tough
time, though, despite the growing prominence, sometimes getting
that even legal, and there have been a lot of attacks.  I am sure
we all remember H.R. 6.  What kinds of attacks are coming against
efforts to look at other educational options for families?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, the establishment doesn't like anybody that,
A, pulls out of the system, and, B, does a better job.  The consequential
embarrassment that comes to them causes some retribution at times.
<P>
 But the battles have changed.  We have been defending homeschoolers
for 13 years now.  Initially, it was a total ban on homeschooling.
 It's a little more sophisticated than that now, and they usually
don't try to do a total ban, but the battles are still there.
<P>
 We had a situation in Kansas within this last three or four months
where a judge held that homeschooling was illegal.  We appealed
that and got that reversed.  The more common problem is really
social services agencies that -- like a case we have in Sacramento
right now.  There were three allegations against a family.  One
was that they were very religious; secondly, that they were homeschooling;
and, third is they heard a child say, &quot;No, Daddy, no.&quot;
 And based on those three facts and those three facts alone, they
busted down the door and did a strip-search of the children.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That is amazing.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  And so, of course, we are suing those people in
Federal District Court.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Even that your organization, Legal Defense Association,
that we have to do that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  You know, one of the things Mike's comments reminded
me of is that even though we do see the system out there quite
often harassing homeschoolers, one of the things that was rather
interesting to me as I began pulling together some of this recent
research is that there are several very prominent school teachers
who have been in the public school system, or are currently in
the system, who are saying, &quot;You know, there's something
going on over there that we really ought to take notice of.&quot;
<P>
 I know a recent teacher who was just named Teacher of the Year
in New York City made comments of this kind, and a Seattle public
school teacher has written a book about homeschooling and talks
about how, in many ways, the homeschool environment offers what
public school teachers have for many years been advocating in
terms of teacher-student ratio and things of that nature.
<P>
 And so it may be that, at least among some school teachers, we
are seeing a change in attitude that is quite promising for years
to come.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I thought it was interesting, in Massachusetts,
before public schools, 98 percent of the children were literate;
after public schools, it has always been a 6 percent drop and
never been that high.
<P>
 What do you think?  I think the fear that people have to have,
Mike, is that I don't want my children in public schools, but
can I really be a teacher?  How do you address that kind of concern,
if I say, &quot;Look, I'm concerned about national history standards;
I don't know if I can actually do a better job&quot;?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Anyone who wants to homeschool can.  If you can
read and are basically literate yourself, you can homeschool your
kids.  Now, if you can't, you need to learn to read.  Somebody
who can't do basic math and cannot function at high-school-level
reading should not be trying to attempt this.  But for anybody
who meets those basic criteria, if you're willing to work hard,
you can do a very successful job.
<P>
 People imagine themselves trying to conduct a schoolroom.  Well,
you don't have to conduct a schoolroom.  Homeschooling is a much
different form of academic instruction, and it is easier in a
sense because you're not having group dynamics going on where
you're having to teach to the middle and trying to worry about
these; you're just teaching to one child.  It is much more efficient,
academically better, just all around is a very successful way
to produce a good education for your kids.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think some people see the homeschoolers as people
trying to go outside of the system, maybe an Amish thing, in a
way.  Do you see that?  Because, frankly, in the terms of your
name coming up in the news, it would seem like in some ways you
get more involved in the politics of education rather than less.
<P>
 How do you talk to people who say, &quot;If I go the homeschool
route, then I'm kind of missing out on part of my culture?&quot;
 Because you're certainly here in Washington today for many reasons.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, my own belief -- and it may be a little bit
biased -- is that the most effective, most well-organized political
network in the country is the homeschoolers.  There's nothing
as good.  And people are very, very activist, and the reason is,
they've seen their freedoms directly threatened in their own life,
something that's core to their day-to-day existence; and trying
to motivate other people to get involved is much more difficult,
because it's an abstraction to them.  But homeschoolers have lived
the battles of freedom.
<P>
 What I am really excited about for the long range is the couple
of million kids that are being homeschooled that have had to personally
observe and be involved in the battles for freedom.  The leadership
potential among those kids is enormous, and I think that we're
going to see some great things.  If our generation can just hold
on by our fingernails for about another dozen years or so, my
view is that probably a quarter or a third of Congress will be
homeschool graduates within 20 years.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fascinating.
<P>
 Bill, politically speaking, in the poll -- Family Research Council
does a lot of original polling -- in the poll last year, you took
a look at who is the constituency for a pro-educational-choice
way of viewing government.  Tell me, we found some interesting,
different demographics on that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, we really did, because, like many others, we
were measuring the level of support for things like providing
parents opportunities outside of the public school system and
things of that nature, but -- 
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to hear more about that in
a second.  We're going to go to break.  We're going to be right
back with more on educational choice, or maybe you don't have
educational choice.  Please come back.  Thanks.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  It was an exciting day on Capitol Hill today, in
fact a very historic vote.  The partial-birth abortion ban passed
in the House.  This was a long-fought and a very hard-fought bill
that we have been working on for a long time to preserve the lives
of children killed at the very end of the pregnancy, late-term
abortions beginning at five months through the moment of birth.
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Congressman Joe Scarborough, who was
going to join us, could not be here, but we are happy to have
had his vote on the Hill.
<P>
 Mike, I know that one thing that you and the Congressman are
looking at is the elimination of the Department of Education.
 It is very exciting.  It is the kind of thing that we've been
talking about since 1980.  But why are we still talking about
it today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, we're talking about it because the moderates
in the Republican Party convinced President
<P>
Reagan to table the idea of eliminating the Department of Education,
and frankly, they were wrong.  What has happened to education
since the Federal Government has gotten involved has been abysmal.
 Take any measure of education you want.  Academic achievement
is down.  In fact, it is so bad now that the most recent National
Assessment of Educational Progress scores are only a quarter of
the eighth graders can do math, and only a quarter of the fourth
graders can read at the level of proficiency on both of those
statistics.  And out of every new dollar that has been spent on
education since 1972, 76 cents has gone to administrative costs
and overhead, and only 24 cents has gone to teachers.
<P>
 It's nuts.  It is a crazy, centralized, drunk system.   They're
drunk with bureaucracy.  And every new reform proposal, the only
thing you can say about it is it requires a centralized bureaucracy
to run it.  Other than that, it is just a new five-year plan like
the Soviets brought out.  Every three-and-a-half years, just like
the Soviets, they know that they fail after a while,  And so it
is time to just abolish the system and go back to local control
of schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  The issue in some ways is how to do that.  You
know, I think some people have a fear that educational systems
are going to be abolished, or somehow property taxes will go away
and we'll have more money and no schools.
<P>
 But certainly Michigan, which decided to be revolutionary, has
done some exciting things.  What do you think about what's happening
in Michigan?  And maybe you could tell people about it.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I don't know that much about the details of
the Michigan program.  I just am proud of Governor Engler's general
efforts.  I have a general knowledge of it, and I think that he
has done a good job in showing that you can do things in a completely
different way and make a difference.
<P>
 Now, the impact on a local school district is that about 6 percent
of an average school district's budget comes from federal funds.
 The smarter thing is just not send that money to Washington in
the first place.  So the proposal that Jennifer and I and others
have been working on for several months now is to stop spending
the $70 billion we spend at the federal level and, instead, have
a $70 billion tax cut.  Just leave the money in the locale to
begin with and let the local people figure out how to spend it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  See, what's so ironic about that is, there was
a survey done recently that the majority of public school teachers
had their children in private school.  We have our President with
his daughter in a private religious school, our Vice President
with his children in private religious school.  And what is funny
is private options are becoming sort of the thing that wealthier
Americans have, and some people are a little intimidated by homeschoolers,
and so people, for lack of financial resources -- which are going
to Washington in taxes -- end up in the hands of the bureaucracy.
<P>
 I mean, Bill, I know that that is a thing that you have been
concerned about.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it really does gall me as one who used to
live here in the District of Columbia and had my daughter in the
public school system here, and I can well remember those kids
that she went to school with that were part of her classroom.
<P>
 You know, when Bill Clinton came to town and walked down Georgia
Avenue and tried to identify with the people that lived there,
and yet then the next week was enrolling his child in a private
school that not one of them could possibly afford, it really did
strike me as very hypocritical.
<P>
 My hope is that we can see reform not just here in the District
of Columbia but throughout the country, so that families that
are far less fortunate than the Clintons or the Gores will enjoy
the kinds of options that they now have.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And what was ironic about that in terms of the
dollar thing is that, as I understand it, the amount that we spend
per child in the District of Columbia is the highest of any in
the Nation.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Its extraordinary.  I mean,
if you gave parents that kind of money to do with what Mike's
parents do, it's amazing the kinds of things that they could have
afforded or the kinds of private school options that parents could
avail themselves of.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But, Jennifer, so you're not a homeschooler.  So
why should we care?  You know, what is it that you're finding
as an education policy analyst that would indicate that everyone
needs to really be in favor of the things that Mike is doing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Well, at Family Research Council, we refer to
homeschoolers as pioneers of freedom, because they're defending
freedoms for us all.  We are all going to be better in America
because they are standing up and defending our freedoms.
<P>
 I would like to point out, too, about Mr. Clinton's great idea,
grand plan for local control of education, which he has called
Goals 2000, in that first year of funding, only 50 percent, less
than 50 percent, of the money makes it back down to the local
level.  That is not local control, by any stretch of the definition.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of local control, I think it is always
interesting that, annually, People for the American Way comes
out with a report, &quot;Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,&quot;
which could be as simple as a parent called a school saying, &quot;I'm
concerned about a book.&quot;  And this isn't democracy; this
is an attack on the freedom to learn.
<P>
 What kinds of ridiculous attacks are you seeing out there, Mike?
 And I know the &quot;censorship&quot; word gets thrown around
everywhere, and you're on the front lines of that.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  I just don't take the People for the American Way
very seriously.  Any group that comes into being for the sole
purpose of saying born-again Christians don't have the right to
participate in politics just doesn't deserve to be called a civil
organization, much less a civil rights organization.
<P>
 Think of it.  What would people say if they would have come into
existence to say, &quot;We don't think Jews should be involved
in politics,&quot; or, &quot;We don't think that Lutherans or
Muslims or some other group&quot; -- apparently, it is okay to
say that evangelical Christians shouldn't be involved in politics,
but nobody else.  It is a patently ridiculous organization, and
I don't think that they have much of importance to say, period.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  As we get ready to close this segment of our show,
what one last thing would you like parents to know about homeschooling
or about their concern for education today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I think homeschooling works very well, and
our desire simply is to be left alone, and I hope that that is
the desire of every parent, that they want to be left alone by
the Federal Government and allowed to run their schools.  Whatever
school they choose for themselves, whether it is public school
or private school or home school, they need to be left alone and
allowed to pursue excellence.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank Mike and our guests for their
insight and for giving us the hope that parents maybe some day
will have the opportunity to influence their children's education.
<P>
 Stay tuned; there is more to come.  Thanks for watching.

 [From Christian Coalition &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Appearance,
September 8, 1995]:
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I remember, a month or so ago, being in a hotel a
few blocks from here, sitting in a hotel room with Dan Rather
as we did two hours of interviews.  And during those interviews,
Dan Rather at one point leaned over to me and, I thought, in a
very real way, not just rhetorically, looked at me and said, &quot;Gary,
just what is it that you people want, anyway?&quot;
<P>
 I said, &quot;Well, you know, Dan, I would like to live in a
country where my daughters can go out on a date at night and I
don't have to worry about date rape.  Or my wife can take a walk
through the park a few blocks from our house and not feel that
she has to carry a can of mace with her.  I would like a country
where we wouldn't have to have bars on our windows, whether we
live in the inner city or live in the suburbs.
<P>
 &quot;I would like a country where women have economic opportunity.
 I've got two daughters.  Why wouldn't I want that?  But I also
want an America where, if my daughters decide to be a mother or
a homemaker, that that decision will be held up and honored as
something noble and good and decent.&quot;
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that rejected racism, the racism
of Fuhrmann in Los Angeles and the racism of quotas and set-asides
and all those programs, a country where we actually taught all
of our children -- black, white, and Hispanic -- to judge others
by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that believed in the sanctity of
life again, that looked at drive-by shootings or 1.5 million abortions
a year and knew that those things were a tragedy.
<P>
 I want to be in a country where, when people play by the rules
and work hard and save and do the right things in their homes,
they actually win at the end of the day, and they're not treated
like suckers.
<P>
 I want a country that takes virtue seriously again, a country
where children aren't crying themselves to sleep at night because
there are no fathers there to comfort them or because their bodies
have been racked by venereal disease or exploited by pornography.
<P>
 In short, I told Dan Rather than I wanted a shining city upon
a hill, the place that our founders promised us.
<P>
 And as I said those things, I watched Dan Rather nod his head
up and down.  He was agreeing with me; the body language was clear.
 When I was finished, he looked at me, and he said, &quot;Gary,
that was an eloquent answer.  I've never heard anybody quite put
it that clearly.&quot;
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 And, of course, last night, if you watched that special, not
one second of that answer made it into the final show.
<P>
 You know, my friends, I think Dan Rather understood, and I think
the folks at CBS also understand, that if they actually ever really
tell the American people what we want, that the American people
will join with us in one voice and we will win.
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 [From Testimony by Cathy Cleaver, FRC Director of Legal Policy,
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 25, 1995]:
<P>
 MS. CLEAVER:  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, on behalf
of Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council, I want to express
our sincere appreciation for the opportunity to address this distinguished
committee on the critical issue of religious liberty.
<P>
 The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause was designed to prevent the state from coercing our religious
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the
state from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
 Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<P>
 In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses,
which must be reconciled in each case.
<P>
 I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute and address certain specific
concerns that have been raised in the public debate.
<P>
 The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations
in access to government benefits or protections on account of
the religious character of their speech or identity.
<P>
 We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<P>
 Several concerns and questions have been raised about this approach.
 Is this radical approach really necessary?  First, it is wise
to keep from confusing procedure with substance.  Amending the
Constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.  Article V of
the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved without
effort and consensus.  Yet the substance of a restorative religious
liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.
<P>
 Legal experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for such an amendment.
 We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde.
<P>
 In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new.  It is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A religious liberty amendment could restore the saving
principle so that our First Amendment would not be used to promote
the empty state religion of secularism but to promote true freedom
and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, to which every
American is entitled.
<P>
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
<P>
 SENATOR HATCH:  Thank you, Ms. Cleaver.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I will be right back for some closing thoughts.
 Stay tuned.

</ul><p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight
Talk</i> from the Family Research Council.  We're thrilled to have
made it through our first show last week, and we are looking forward
to an exciting season ahead.  In our many weeks to come, <i>Straight
Talk</i> will be addressing issues that are critical to today's families,
which is really what the Family Research Council is all about.
 Working hand in hand with government policies are cultural issues
that affect those policies.
<p>
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will be
sharing an investigation into what our society views as typical
sexual behavior, based on the studies and published works of Dr.
Alfred Kinsey, his studies known worldwide as the Kinsey report.
<p>
Within our show, we will be airing an exclusive video production
in full called <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This video asks, and
attempts to answer, some of the questions first investigated by
Dr. Judith Reisman, who examined the Kinsey data on child sexuality.
 Dr. Reisman cites clear evidence that children were either sexually
abused by adults for scientific studies or somebody lied about
the data.
<p>
This shocking revelation strikes at the core of society's
current sex ideologies, which have solely shaped sex and health
education curriculum; and the funding came even perhaps from our
own government.
<p>
So the Family Research Council decided to get
the word out, let people know that their tax dollars are funding
programs that are based on unscientific research.  Viewer discretion
and parental guidance are therefore strongly advised in viewing
tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary is quoted weekly in the
nation's newspapers, and makers from all kinds of news programs
call him.  In fact, today you may hear him talking about Colin
Powell.  This is his opportunity to share with you what you might
not hear from journalists and broadcasters.  Join me and Gary
Bauer as we talk about the stories that lie behind the headlines.

<p>
It is Tuesday morning,
and I am here with Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research
Council.  Most of political America, Gary, is watching the elections,
some pivotal ones in Kentucky and Virginia.  As we watch early
returns in what some are calling a referendum on the GOP and the
conservative pro-family movement, what do you see in this election
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, Kristi, our viewers have us at a
disadvantage:  We are taping this while people vote, and our viewers
will know the outcome of the elections by the time they see us
talking about them.
<p>
But my sense is that whatever happened in
these elections around the country -- in Virginia, New Jersey,
I guess Kentucky, and Mississippi -- you can't cover up what the
overall trend in the country is.
<p>
I suspect conservatives are going
to do well and that our viewers already know that.  But even if
they don't, the fact of the matter is the trend line around the
country is unbelievably in a conservative direction.  And even
in these elections, the Democrats running around the country were
running as conservatives.  They were trying to act like they were
fiscal conservatives, economic conservatives.  They were not talking
about social issues because they know those issues are hurting
them.
<p>
So the untold story is that the Democratic Party and liberalism
around the country is demoralized.  You've got people switching
parties.  I think we'll have three more House members switch before
the end of the year.  State legislatures that have never been
Republican have gone into Republican control in the last few months
as special elections have been held.
<p>
So there is a strong conservative
tide running in the country.  I hope it continued today, but even
if there were some bumps in the road, I think that tide is going
to run for a while.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the different interest
groups have said that an anti-American sentiment has been moving
away from being in favor of any referendum, tax increases of any
kinds.  Do you agree with that?  Because certainly there are all
kinds of tax-increasing referenda on the ballots.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Yes.  I think people will vote for referenda when the issue is
the right issue.  The critics are right about taxes, however.
 Just about anyplace in the country that there is a tax bond measure
or referendum on the ballot, people are saying no.
<p>
I mean, here in Northern Virginia, which is, of course, peculiar to this 
one area, but it really is very similar to a lot of places in the
rest of the country.  You've got state taxes, local taxes.  The
federal tax rate went up in the beginning of the Clinton Administration.
 There is a particular gross receipts tax in Northern Virginia
that has driven a lot of small businesses literally out of business.
<p>
Americans remain deeply overtaxed, and I hope that's an issue
that the Republican Party will continue to emphasize and run with
in 1996, because I think it brings millions of voters to the banner.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to fear tactics in Washington right
now, some of the worst language is reserved for Medicare and the
Medicare vote.  Gary, you have been watching this for a while.
 Why do you think the Medicare debate needs to go forward? 
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, we believe that that program, which is a valuable
program to many elderly, has to be reformed, and it has to be
reformed to save it.  If you take the current trends in place
and let those trends continue another 20, 25 years, what you have
is a Medicare program that literally would be consuming almost
all of the revenue of the Federal Government.
<p>
Well, obviously,
we can't have that.  That's not going to work.  So we've got to
come up with a way to get costs under control, to save the program
for people like my 75-year-old mother who relies on it and many
of the other elderly who have come to rely on it.
<p>
I think it has
been disgusting to see some of the politicians use scare rhetoric
and harsh rhetoric to try to bamboozle, quite frankly, senior
citizens into thinking that their benefits are going to be taken
away and that they're going to be left without medical care. 
That's a disgusting thing to do to elderly people who already
worry about the future, and I think the politicians who engaged
in that are going to suffer for it at the polls next year. 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the most historic things in this last week has
been the partial-birth abortion ban vote in the House and, we
think, this week in the Senate.  What do you think, Gary, has
brought us to the point where we can see this kind of historic
pro-life vote?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  The problem on the abortion issue has
always been getting facts to the American people.  If you get
them facts, then the votes tend to come out pro-life.  We saw
that in the House of Representatives.  When the Congress had to
actually focus on the facts of what a partial-birth abortion is,
most of them were so horrified by the procedure that they voted
to ban it.
<p>
I think the final vote, at least the vote in favor
of the ban, was 288 votes.  That's a bigger consensus than a lot
of the economic agenda that the Republicans are pushing.  So I
think it was a very historic vote and probably the beginning of
a number of votes in the Congress that will, I think, educate
the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for
being with us, and we'll look forward to talking to you next week.
 Good night.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you.  Good to be with you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
returns, we will speak to Bob Knight, who wrote, produced, directed,
and edited the 1994 documentary, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  Bob
will explain the importance of uncovering Dr. Alfred Kinsey's
unorthodox and unscientific study of child sexuality.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  Tonight we are talking to Bob
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council.
 Bob daily examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and
are affected by cultural values.  He will be introducing one of
his most recent and possibly one of the most shocking issues he
has encountered.
<p>
Bob, welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  Appreciate you
being here.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You were a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, got involved
at the Heritage Foundation on cultural issues.  You have a long
history of looking at the things that really have changed America.
<p>
What drew your attention to this particular topic?  Family Research
Council hasn't done any other videos.  You're the first.  What
caught your eye?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it really began about five
years ago when I was doing research on federal funding for all
sorts of cultural projects, and I kept running into Kinsey, the
name Kinsey, the references to Kinsey.
<p>
I talked to a number of
people, including Dr. Judith Reisman, who had been investigating
Kinsey since 1981, and she revealed in a 1990 book, Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud, that some of the very basis for what we now regard
as gospel in sex education and sexology came out of experiments
on children in the 1940s under the rubric of science; and she
made the charge that it's either fraud or criminal exploitation
of children, but either way, we shouldn't be basing our idea of
normal sexuality on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested in reading
some of the literature that you had written.  I mean, in terms
of attitudes about sex that have come from Kinsey, it has been
everything from 10 percent of the population is homosexual, which
was a project that you worked on; and showing that that was not
true -- it was really 1, at most 2 percent -- but even the data
that says men mature sexually at 18 and women, at 30, that data
all comes from Kinsey as well, correct?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  It does.
 Kinsey is the motherlode of information on the sex issues.  Kinsey
formulated what he called the Kinsey scale, which is a scale from
zero to 6.  Zero is heterosexuality; 6 is homosexuality.  Notice
he puts the norm at the bottom.  And he actually said that only
4 percent of the population constitute either end of the spectrum,
and everybody else is bisexual.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's amazing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  So he used this and, by the way, developed this before
he did 95 percent of his research -- it just came out of his head
-- and he used this to push the idea of outlet sex, which makes
all sexual acts equal morally, whether it is between husband and
wife or any other combination, in or out of marriage.
<p>
This was a moral leveling force that Hugh Hefner picked up with his 
playboy philosophy, and it became the grounding for the 
if-it-feels-good-do-it generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, this video which we're going to
see does go into greater detail, but the thing that is compelling
-- you know, today there's a lot of stories -- oh, a priest who
molested children 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago --
there have been stories that have come from terrible sexual acts
of the past.  But what is powerful about this is that it's not
really just the past, is it, Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  No, it's the guiding
force of most sex education today.  Kinsey is the only sexual
data on children we have because, after all, it's criminal to
exploit children in this fashion.
<p>
So what the Kinsey people did
was take this data from molestation of children and extrapolate
it into a philosophy that said, &quot;Hey, kids are not only viable
sexually, but they're entitled to it.&quot;  And, if you notice,
the history of sex education is to bring sex ed, graphic materials,
to children at earlier and earlier ages, because, after all, science
says they are sexual beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I know people have
got to be watching and saying, &quot;Are you really saying children
were molested?&quot;  And we are going to get into that in just
a little bit.
<p>
But, frankly, what has been interesting is the lack
of interest in discussing it.  Have you found that shocking as
you have tried to present this information?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  This has been a hard sell -- and, I think, for one reason:  
It strikes at the very heart of the sexual revolution, because Alfred Kinsey
is the most quoted sexologist in history.  What he said undergirds
most current if-it-feels-good philosophy.  And they sense the
danger here.  If you discredit Alfred Kinsey, a lot falls down
with him.
<p>
So we think that people instinctively who feel that
sex ought to be free and wild and there ought to be no structures
sense that this could be very bad for them if it gets out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is one fast thing people need to know before we
unveil <i>The Children of Table 34</i>?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I wouldn't have any children in the room.  You know, some 
of the material is shocking.  We did it as tastefully as we could, and there's
really nothing obscene or anything.  But it's shocking.  It's
hard stuff to digest, and you don't want children around.
<p>
The only other thing is that we took three years to document this
and make sure everything is absolutely accurate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of information there to see. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we'll take a look at what Bob has investigated and the
revelations that he has discovered as we bring to you <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.  Again, viewer discretion and parental guidance is
strongly advised, not because of the material you will see, but
just the ideas are very powerful.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.  Tonight's unique show includes the extraordinary documentary,
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This documentary asks key questions
of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's child sexual studies.  Was consent obtained
from parents or guardians of those children who were sexually
molested in the name of science? <i>Straight Talk</i> now presents <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>The Children of Table 34</h3></center>
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Hello.  I'm Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.  A number of
years ago, I starred in The Chapman Report, a film about the sex
studies of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.
<p>
Like most Americans, I felt at the
time that Dr. Kinsey's work was groundbreaking, and it was.  But
since then, serious questions have been raised about the Kinsey
research methods, serious enough to warrant a closer look.
<p>
What would you think if you learned that some of the most important
scientific research of the century may have been based on fraud,
or, if not fraud, criminal experimentation on children, funded
by the taxpayer?
<p>
What if you learned that the results of this
research are exerting a profound influence on our society today,
ranging from how we deal with sex offenders to how, when, and
what our children are being taught about sex, not to mention why.
<p>
Every parent in America needs to know the facts behind Alfred
Kinsey's inclusion of children in his famous sex studies in the
late 1940s.  Recent revelations about government-sponsored radiation
experiments remind us once more of the dangers of projects that
violate informed consent and the standards of common decency.
<p>
As you watch this story unfold, you will learn how America has
unknowingly put its children at risk in the name of science. 
And you may also join me in asking, What happened to Dr. Kinsey's
smallest subjects?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
NARRATOR: Children, our most precious gift and our hope for the future.
 Once upon a time, children were free to roam their neighborhoods
without worry.  Parents could count on the good intentions of
neighbors, school officials, and other adults to keep their children
safe.  But in recent years, parents have had to take special measures
to ensure that their children not come to harm.  Their fears are
not unfounded.  Many children have fallen victim to sexual abuse.
<p>
How did we go from a safe, caring environment for children to
one in which parents are terrified that their children are at
risk in just a few short years?  Part of the answer may be found
in Indiana, at the world-famous Kinsey Institute.
<p>
In 1948, a zoologist
named Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his pioneering study,
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>. Although many scientists were
critical of Kinsey's methods, the media popularized Kinsey's findings
about sex.
<p>
By 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman uncovered the role of child
sexual abuse in the Kinsey studies in a paper presented to the
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem.  She documented
Kinsey's reliance on the systematic molestation of more than 300
infants and children from 2 months old to 15 years of age.  Graph
tables depicting sexual activity in children use identical criteria
as those in the tables on adult subjects.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  Then I went back and I took a look at the Kinsey report, 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>, and as I reviewed the tables, 
it struck me as clear as day.  How could they get this data?  Where would they
get these data?  How did they know that a 2-month-old baby did
or did not have an orgasm?  How did they get a record of 26 orgasms
in 24 hours for a 4-year-old -- a 4-year-old?
<p>
MR. TRUEMAN:  If these experiments took place, they involved acts to which 
no child could provide consent and for which no parent or guardian could
provide consent on behalf of the child.  Therefore, we are talking
about criminal activity, the criminal sexual abuse of children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Research scientist Gordon Muir sees broad ramifications
from Kinsey's work.  According to Dr. Muir, who helped edit and
publish Judith Reisman's and Ed Eichel's 1990 book, <i>Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud</i>:
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Children as young as 2 months of age are
featured in tables, in some cases 188 children in one table, and
the legend beneath the table says, &quot;Timed with a second hand
or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
The understanding that we have of childhood
sexuality and normal childhood sexual development as it is believed
and taught in academia today comes from the experimental evidence
documented in Kinsey's male report published in 1948, with the
child sexuality tables that we have just discussed.  It is absolutely
astonishing that this is taken as the basis for what we understand
to be normal childhood sexual development.
<p>
When I try to explain
this to colleagues in the type of science that I am involved in
and what I call the harder sciences of biology and medicine, statistics,
immunology, they frankly do not believe what I am trying to tell
them, and the only way that I can convince them of the truth of
this is to go to the library, pull off the shelf one of Alfred
Kinsey's books, and show them what in fact is inside, and it is
quite shocking.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on the Kinsey data, six researchers
formulated a theory of child sexuality that has influenced everything
from laws against molestation to how and when sex education is
taught.
<p>
Few professionals would disagree that Dr. Kinsey has been
the most influential figure in the study of sex, particularly
the concept of child sexuality.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He did not openly promote
pedophilia, but he provided the &quot;scientific&quot; basis
for it.  He felt the main problem with adult-child sexual relations
was hysteria and overreaction on the part of parents and authorities.
<p>
He believed that young boys needed the help of older people to
develop effective sexual techniques, and he recorded that adult
sexual contacts with young girls were a source of pleasure to
these girls and may lead to better sociosexual development in
their later lives.
<p>
His co-author, Wardell Pomeroy, a prominent
sexologist, has written that the Kinsey research uncovered &quot;many 
beautiful and mutually satisfying relationships between fathers
and daughters&quot;.
<p>
Pomeroy also, in his sex education book, <i>Boys and
Sex</i>, refers to the possibility of &quot;loving sexual relationships&quot;
between children and animals.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children have been increasingly portrayed sexually in 
major pornographic magazines.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  In our study conducted for the U.S. Justice Department,
particularly juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, we came
up with some pretty surprising findings on the images of children
in <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> and <i>Hustler</i>.  In particular, 
<i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> were surprising to us.  We were 
instructed to do the research because of the finding of these kinds of 
materials being used in sexual activities, sexual crimes, really, against
children.
<p>
Most disturbing was that 29 percent of the visuals --
that is, the photographs -- included some sort of nude or genital
display -- very, very surprising.  Twenty-one percent were visually
exposed and sexualized.  Twenty percent had some sort of genital
activity taking place of some type.  Ten percent involved force;
10 percent, killing or murder.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Before Kinsey, psychologists
had rejected the idea of children as sexually viable until the
age of puberty.  Earlier this century, Sigmund Freud paved the
way for Kinsey by asserting that children were sexual but that
their sexuality was latent; that is, not acted upon until puberty.
<p>
Kinsey's report radically altered this perception, spawning an
entire industry based on the notion that children have a right
to sexual relations at any age.  The Kinsey perception of the
&quot;right&quot; of children to have sex at any age has resulted
in challenges to laws protecting children from sexual exploitation.
<p>
MR. SHAHEEN:  In Florida recently, a state court judge threw out
several cases that had been brought under the statutory rape laws.
 Citing privacy grounds, the judge found that minors under the
age of 16 had a constitutional right to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
Several courts have recently held that parents do not have a right
to stop school districts from handing out condoms to their children.
 Again, you see in school districts, in courts, in the media,
the Kinsey philosophy that children should be free and autonomous
to decide for themselves what sort of sexual activity, what sort
of sexual behavior they should engage in, without any kind of
regulation or restriction from the state or their parents, has
begun to chip away at the protections that our legal system had
previously provided to children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Some scientists feel that an inquiry of the Kinsey 
Institute is long overdue.
<p>
DR. MUIR: I have been in contact with perhaps the best known fraud specialist
in this country over a period of years concerning this Kinsey
research fraud allegation.  The person I am referring to, of course,
is Walter Stewart(?), who is well known in Congress and in the
scientific community for his work in the Baltimore case, particularly,
and in other cases.  Now, Stewart is firmly of the opinion that
there is something here that needs to be investigated and has
told me so many times.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Muir says that such an effort
may be mounted outside the United States and cites a letter by
Walter Stewart to the Canadian Medical Journal.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  What Stewart said was that he finds the evidence -- that is, 
for fraud and ethical violations in research -- compelling, since the evidence
comes almost entire from Kinsey's book itself.  He says, &quot;I
find it disturbing and believe it requires investigation.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Dr. Muir says he hopes that Congress will investigate
the Kinsey Institute once it is widely known that children may
have been used in sexual experimentation.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Because there
is a mess here that has to be cleared up in the backyard of American
science, and it would indeed be tragic if it gets cleared up from
elsewhere first.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Important questions need to be answered.
 Where are the children today?  How were they procured for the
experiments?  Did their parents know they were being used in sessions
with avowed pedophiles?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
DR. COURT:  I am concerned about these people, who must now be in
their fifties, that they must have had some very difficult experiences
following these experiments, and it would be good, really, if
they could be contacted even for therapeutic purposes at this
stage.
<p>
I often wonder if they will come forward when we are speaking
in lectures or speaking on radio or whatever it may be.  I have
been waiting to hear, for some of these people to remember the
experience and to come forward and say, &quot;Yes, I was one of
those.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on 12,000 interviews, empirical
observation, and Kinsey's own ideas about sexuality, the Kinsey
report, as it came to be known, had enormous cultural and scientific
impact.
<p>
MR. GAGNON:  You could use the findings from the survey
to counter the moral judgments of other people, and that's really
the importance of Kinsey.  As Kinsey moves the argument away from
the old kind of sterile debate about morality -- in which, of
course, there is no solution -- to a place where people can start
talking about sexuality in a different kind of way, looking to
different kinds of standards.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey concluded that
Americans' sex lives were far more varied than had been thought
and that children were sexual from birth.  But the Kinsey books
have serious flaws, as has been noted by the National Research
Council and Dr. Abraham Maslow, who warned Kinsey that sex surveys
tend to skew the data toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.
<p>
Because sexual manipulation of children is illegal, the Kinsey
studies have served as virtually the sole source for sex researchers.
 The Kinsey findings about children are based on interviews with
and records kept by pedophiles, which he described as &quot;adult
males who've had sexual contacts with younger boys and who, with
their adult backgrounds, are able to recognize and interpret the
boys' experiences.&quot;
<p>
DR. MUIR:  As a practitioner, a psychologist,
I cannot see that this is the way in which we collect information
about normal childhood sexuality.  To get pedophiles to go out
and do experiments on children is not how we learn about normality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Please stay tuned to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  Did the Kinsey Institute people pay pedophiles
to conduct their studies?  After the commercial break, we'll ask
this and other questions as we continue with more of <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.
<p>
[Commercial break.] 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i> is back.  As we continue to put Dr.
Alfred Kinsey's scientific sexual findings under a microscope,
the Family Research Council's 1994 documentary, which we share
with you tonight, reveals the fallacies Dr. Kinsey's study created.
 Amazingly, these fallacies shape sex and health education even
today. Now, more of <i>The Children of Table 34</i>:
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey acknowledges that some of the experiments involved the 
use of physical force with unwilling participants.  Kinsey describes
what he terms &quot;orgasms&quot; by the children, &quot;. . .
a gradual and sometimes prolonged buildup to orgasm which involves
still more violent convulsions of the whole body, heavy breathing,
groaning, sobbing, or more violent cries, sometimes with an abundance
of tears (especially among young children).&quot;
<p>
&quot;Some of the children exhibited extreme trembling, collapse, loss of 
color, and sometimes fainting.  The males in the present group will fight
away from the partner and may make violent attempts to avoid climax,
although they derive definite pleasure from the situation.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A fretful babe quiets down under the initial sexual stimulation,
is distracted from other activities, begins rhythmic pelvic thrusts,
becomes tense as climax approaches, is thrown into convulsive
action, often with violent arm and leg movements, sometimes with
weeping at the moment of climax.&quot;
<p>
According to Paul Gebhart(?),
a Kinsey report coauthor and former president of the Kinsey Institute,
the researchers were aware that the experiments were illegal.
 &quot;We have always insisted on maintaining confidentiality,
even at the cost of thereby becoming amoral at best and criminal
at worst,&quot; said Gebhart.  &quot;An example of criminality
is our refusal to cooperate with authorities in apprehending a
pedophile we had interviewed who was being sought for a sex murder.&quot;
<p>
DR. POMEROY:  Kinsey would have done business with the devil if
it helped the research, and this is true.  The research was absolutely
paramount.  And he was astute enough to stay out of trouble. 
He got in practically no trouble, but he worked at it.
<p>
DR. MUIR: Related to that, of course, is the question, did parents give
consent to what was being done?  Nobody has indicated to us that
consent was given.  Indeed, these coworkers seemed to indicate
to us that consent was not given, and they didn't really see it
as terribly important, because this wasn't going to be particularly
harmful to the children, anyway.
<p>
NARRATOR:  There is another possibility
regarding Kinsey's data on children:  that the experiments never
took place.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  We have the other serious implication that
the data are being used as if they were real in order to generate
a whole view of child sexuality and availability of children in
sexual encounters which is based on nothing.
<p>
NARRATOR:  If that is so, then scientific fraud may have occurred.  
In either case, the reliance on reports on sexual torture of children under 
the auspices of federally supported research cries out for examination,
especially since Kinsey's research had such a profound effect
on the entire sex research field.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  I went back to
get a degree and went into the human sexuality program at New
York University, and it was when I was in that program that I
began to learn and see the indoctrination of what has been called
the Kinsey grand scheme.
<p>
Now, that term comes from Wardell Pomeroy,
Kinsey's closest associate, but I experienced it firsthand in
an international health seminar held in Holland, organized by
my professor, Dr. Deryck Calderwood.
<p>
Calderwood initiated nude-body
workshops in which he would give quasi-medical excuses for men
to touch each other's genitals and for women to interact in different
feely-touchy situations.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey Institute has dominated
the world of sexology through the migration of Kinsey disciples
to several key centers of sexology, including New York University,
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Advanced
Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco.  These three institutions
account for the lion's share of the academic credentialing of
sex educators in the United States.
<p>
Working with the Kinsey team
was Dr. Mary Calderone, who was medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America from 1953 to 1964, before co-founding
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States,
better known as SIECUS.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  She formed that organization
with Lester Kirkendall, another pioneering sexologist, who was
the teacher and the mentor of Deryck Calderwood, my professor.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Also involved was Kinsey's co-author, Wardell Pomeroy,
a founding member who also served as president of SIECUS as recently
as 1975.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  In terms of Lester Kirkendall, in 1985,
he made a statement in an article entitled &quot;Sex Education
in the Future&quot; that I think is worth noting.
<p>He says that
programs of the future will probe sexual expression with same-sex
partners and even across generational lines.  &quot;With a diminished
sense of guilt, these patterns will become legitimate, and the
emphasis on normality and abnormality will be much diminished
with these future trends.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  The most obvious impact
of this effort is to demystify the taboos of sexuality in sex
education classes to very young children.  Many sex education
curricula now begin in kindergarten and continue through high
school, often under AIDS prevention.  The message to parents:
 If we don't begin teaching children about safe sex as early as
possible, including every variation, then they may get AIDS.
DR. REISMAN:  Mrs. Smith or Ms. Smith from somewhere in Ohio, who
goes for her three-unit training in human sexuality because she
has to teach human sexuality to the kids and she has to teach
AIDS prevention, she goes to an accredited sex educator, and she
will be trained in the Kinsey model.  That is the only model that
she can be trained in.
<p>
And as a result, then, she has to set aside
whatever value structure, whatever moral structure she has been
carrying all these years, because she has been told that the &quot;science&quot;
has proven that children are sexual from birth, that children
have orgasmic potential from birth, that this therefore can be
perfectly fine.
<p>
[From a Nickelodeon special]:
<p>
CHILD:  How can you be protected from AIDS, like when you're having sex? 
<p>
TEACHER:  Well, one of the best ways, Magic, is wear a condom,
isn't it?
<p>
MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  The safest way is to wear a condom.
<p>
NARRATOR:  As a result, some schools, and even a documentary
presented by Nickelodeon, are instructing children as young as
8 years old in how to use a condom:
<p>
TEACHER:  You roll it
down the penis, and that protects the man when his penis is inside
the woman's vagina.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children are also told how to perform
anal sex.  At a safe sex youth conference in New York in 1994,
children as young as 12 were given graphic brochures advising
boys to enjoy safe sex with men and encouraging girls to experiment
with lesbian sex practices that could cause sterility.
<p>
MR. EICHEL: Nowhere in the program curriculum that was developed to be the
guidelines for future sex education was there anything that suggested
sick sexual behavior, any form of sexual activity that might
be categorized, or abnormality.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey view of
child sexuality has also been promulgated by Dr. John Money, perhaps
the most prominent sex researcher in America.  A founding board
member of SIECUS, Dr. Money has written numerous books, as well
as hundreds of papers, reviews, and textbook chapters on the subject
of sex.
<p>
In 1990, Dr. June Reinisch dedicated her book, <i>The Kinsey
Institute New Report on Sex</i>, to Dr. Money, whom she describes
as &quot;one of my mentors.&quot;
<p>
Recently, Dr. Money was interviewed
by Piedika(?), the journal of pedophilia, which is published in
The Netherlands.  The journal argues for man-boy sex and contains
advertisements for the North American Man-Boy Love Association
and other pro-pedophile groups.
<p>
Kinsey Institute associate Dr.
Vern Bulow(?) is on Piedika's editorial board, which issued this
statement of purpose:  &quot;The starting point of Piedika is
necessarily our consciousness of ourselves as pedophiles.&quot;
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  But when you look at the journal Piedika, the Dutch
journal, you will see that on the board of directors you have
people like Vern Bulow.  Vern Bulow was the president of the Society
for the Scientific Study of Sex when they formed the accrediting
committee for future university programs that give degrees to
sex educators.
<p>
Vern Bulow did the foreword for Edward Brongursma's(?)
two volumes, <i>Loving Boys</i>.  John Money of Johns Hopkins Hospital
and the mentor of June Reinisch was interviewed in Piedika, and
of course, he is one of the people saying that sex with children
can be an enriching experience and doesn't harm the child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you the 
conclusion of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> and more insights from the 
documentary's producer, Robert Knight.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> now
brings you the conclusion of our 1994 documentary, which reveals
shocking findings about Dr. Alfred Kinsey's children of Table
34.  And immediately following, we will once again speak with
Robert Knight, producer of this chilling video.  Please watch.
<p>
NARRATOR:  In Dr. Money's interview in Piedeka, he was asked about
child sexuality.  His reply:  &quot;If I were to see the case
of a boy aged ten or twelve who is intensely attracted toward
a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally
mutual and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual, then I would
not call it pathological in any way.&quot;
<p>
This attitude mirrors
that of Dr. Kinsey, who once wrote that, &quot;It is difficult
to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched.&quot;
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  In 1965, the Kinsey team published the book, <i>Sex 
Offenders</i>, which argued that sexual behavior was so varied that 
certain activities should not be singled out for harsh punishment.
<p>
During the past 10 years, reports of child abuse cases have soared to more 
than 2.5 million annually.  Although many of these cases have proved
to be false reports, it is clear that child abuse, and the perception
of child abuse, is a growing problem.  Increasingly, child abuse
experts are expressing concern about Kinsey's impact on the way
people view sexuality.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  One of the objectives of Kinsey-type
programming is to change the concept of the family, and if you
think about it, if Heather has two mommies and Daddy has a male
roommate, in a way, you are denormalizing the heterosexual nuclear
family.  And if you remember from the pedophile-type statements
in the writings, for example, of Theo Sanford, he said that if
children could be weaned away from the nuclear family, they could
then form emotional attachments with others beyond the family.
<p>
So, in a sense, the systematic destruction of the concept of a
family with a mother and father, and with the family break-ups
and divorces that are occurring, it is a very opportune time.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Attempts to uncover evidence regarding the experiments
on children have been rebuffed by the Kinsey Institute.  Former
director Dr. June Reinisch, interim director Dr. Stephanie Sanders,
and other Kinsey personnel either declined or did not respond
to interview requests.  Dr. Money also declined to be interviewed.
<p>
<i>Child</i> magazine featured an article by Dr. Reinisch urging parents
to regard their children as sexually active and to promote more
sexual activity.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Given its critical role in overhauling
a culture that used to value and protect children above all else,
the Kinsey report is long overdue for scientific scrutiny.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He used data from the rape of children, as we've discussed,
some as young as 2 months, to demonstrate and prove childhood
sexual capacity.  He concealed the full nature of these experiments,
and he concealed information on who performed these experiments.
<p>
He extrapolated these data to describe normal childhood development.
 He did not follow up these abused children, as was ethically
and morally required, though the identities of many of these children
are known and known today, and they still could be followed up,
and should be.
<p>
Furthermore, he shielded criminals who were involved
in this work, including one murderer that we know of, from the
police.
<p>
If I have not said enough about the need for this research
to be investigated, then I doubt if there is really anything else
that could be said.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  These questions need to be
answered:  How were the children procured for the experiments
recorded in Table 34?  Where are they now?  Most would be in their
fifties.
<p>
Also, many of the Kinsey associates themselves are still
around, but most of them are elderly.  It is important that they
be given the opportunity to shed light on what happened before
it's too late, before any more children are victimized.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back. Bob, you produced this video.  You've been 
working on this project for years.  As a matter of fact, you were talking
about it the day that I met you, about four years ago, three or
four years ago.  It's a very powerful video.
<p>
But what does the Kinsey Institute say when they're asked about this 
horrendous research?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  I am glad you asked that, because they
have finally broken their silence on it.  Dr. John Bancroft, the
new director of Kinsey Institute, has said that he looked into
the files -- which means they exist -- and he said that he thought
all the children had been molested by a single person, an elderly
pedophile, and that conflicts with what Dr. Kinsey wrote in the
Kinsey report.  So it has opened up a whole new realm of questioning.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in fact, I understand that recently a woman
came forward and said that she was one of the molestation victims.
<p>
Family Research Council is looking for victims.  What are you
finding on that?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we're hoping some people will
come forward because, actually, we want the identity of this so-called
lone pedophile, because if we nail that down, people will begin
to realize what may have happened to them so many years ago at
the Kinsey Institute.
<p>
This woman's story has checked out.  It
has an Indiana University tie, and we are hoping she's the first
of many who will come forward.  And, incidentally, her story probably
was research that was included in Kinsey's female volume, which
followed the male volume.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of
time left, Bob, but the story doesn't end here, and I am sure
<i>Straight Talk</i> is going to bring updates.
<p>
But we are looking at
congressional action related to <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  In
fact, you may even be testifying, Bob.  Briefly, in about 20 seconds,
what can Congress do, and what is happening right now in terms
of looking into this data?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay.  Right now before
Congress is the Family Privacy Protection Act, which bars any
federal funding for research into using children for which parents
have not given written consent.  We're testifying to say this
is a good idea; you've got to have written consent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Really quickly.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, and we hope Congress will
absolutely open the doors of the Kinsey Institute, using subpoena
power, holding hearings, whatever it takes to shed light on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to look forward to that.  <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues after the break.  Stay tuned to hear how you can obtain
a copy of the video, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>, and information
about other important issues being investigated by the Family
Research Council and Robert Knight.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for watching <i>Straight Talk</i> and the Family 
Research Council exclusive video production, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.
 If you want more information, the video or some information,
please call the Family Research Council at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Hope you can join us next week when we'll be talking to people who
are successfully paving the way for the country's welfare reform,
and we'll share with you how you, too, can get involved.
<p>
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Our show this week will 
try to answer some hard questions. What happens to people if the 
government isn't the safety net we've come to expect?  What kind 
of help can the private sector really be?
<p>
The concept of real welfare reform can seem overwhelming. The 
government for many years has said that it can best care for people 
caught in tough circumstances.  But the problem with the welfare 
state is that it's people, not statistics, we're talking about. 
The state doesn't have time or manpower enough for one-on-one attention. 
When lives really change, something personal happens. It is 
individuals who actually reform the welfare state, one person at a 
time, one life at a time.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> portrays examples of individuals like 
you and me who are making that reform a reality.  But first, let's take 
a look at the story on the minds of most of political Washington, 
yesterday's government shutdown in the name of a balanced budget.
<p>
I had the chance to speak with Family Research Council's Bill Mattox, 
who has been working on budget and tax policy in Washington, D.C., 
for more than 10 years. You won't find Bill's insights as to how this 
situation will affect our country and families in most news stories. 
Join me in questioning Bill on what lies behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here with Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy 
of the Family Research Council, and, Bill, as you and I know, the train 
has wrecked. It doesn't seem like Washington, D.C., is stopped, and yet 
a lot of people, interestingly enough, are saying that the train
wreck isn't about Medicare; it's not about whether or not we have
one tax proposal or another.
<p>
<i>The Washington Post</i> and Republican leadership are agreeing that 
the real issue here seems to be balancing the budget long term, over a 
seven-year period.  What do you think the train wreck says to pro-family 
America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think it is primarily about whether or not the President 
and Congress agree on getting a balanced budget in the next seven years. 
The Congress has repeatedly moved toward that target and has said,
&quot;We believe strongly in a balanced budget, and here's proof
in the pudding.  Here's our proposal, here's our plan; we want
to see this adopted.&quot;
<p>
The President, in recent months, has given some good lip service to this 
idea. He has not been a long-time supporter of a balanced budget, but 
here in recent months he has said some nice things.
<p>
Unfortunately, when putting-up time comes, you cannot get to a balanced 
budget unless you are willing to make some very hard decisions.  And what 
the President is suggesting is that some of the hard decisions that 
Congress has made in the Medicare realm, for example, where they are not 
allowing the kinds of increases that would otherwise occur, that are going 
to lead the Medicare program to bankruptcy, what the President is suggesting
is that those kinds of hard decisions he doesn't want to see made
and would rather not have a balanced budget if that is what is
required.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that ironic, because he campaigned
on a balanced budget, as the freshman class campaigned on, and
it seems now that whether or not we have a balanced budget is
the true sticking point.  Is that going to hold?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think it will be <b>the</b> central question.  The big issue 
will be, how quickly will this whole matter be resolved?  I mean, I do
think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure adopted
here before too long that will get those nonessential government
services running again.  It is always kind of curious that these
programs are nonessential, and it leads me to say, Well, if they're
nonessential, why do we even have them in the first place?  I
mean, I do think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure
that will keep the government running.
<p>
The question will be, will we adopt a new budget for the new fiscal year, 
or will we instead continue to operate this year on last year's spending 
levels? Because that is essentially what is being done right now, is
that they are simply saying, We'll keep the government running
at last year's levels until we can settle this issue.
<p>
There are some advisors to the President, including James Carville(?), 
who, of course, was renowned for his insistence that &quot;It's the
economy, Stupid,&quot; in the 1992 campaign.  Carville has suggested
to Clinton, &quot;Look, don't resolve this problem.  Take this
to the voters next November and let the election of 1996 center
around the question of do you want to balance the budget on the
backs of the senior citizens,&quot; or whatever sort of spin that
Carville and company would like to put to it.
<p>
Of course, the big concern that we have is that this is irresponsible. 
This is just irresponsible on the part of those who have been elected
to govern this country, and we do not want to see an interminable
playing of politics by those in the White House or, for that matter,
those in the Congress.
<p>
We do want to see those pro-family tax cuts that, here again, both the 
President campaigned on in 1992 and the Congress did in 1994 after no 
action had been taken during the President's first two years in office. 
And one of the things that is threatened in this package is those pro-family 
tax cuts. If some type of resolution isn't made here, we could see those
tax cuts disappear, and I think that would be a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But the Family Research Council has been working on tax 
relief since the early 1980s, and ironically, the per-child tax credit,
which is about $2,500, if it had kept pace with inflation, would
be about $9,500 today, and we are talking about $500, which is
incredibly ironic.  Do you think the $500-per-child tax credit
will survive?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  We hope so.  The House and Senate leaders
met yesterday to finalize their tax plan.  The details actually
have not been released quite yet, but the early indications are
that the $500 credit has survived, that it will be the central
part of this tax package; that in fact in the first year, in 1996,
come October of next year, right before the elections occur, interestingly,
taxpayers will each receive a $125 check per child, and that in
the year following, the calendar year beginning then in 1997,
the $500-per-child credit would kick in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: From your experience -- you do a lot of original polling 
for the Family Research Council, and next week, in fact, we are going 
to hear about what you are looking at for a family issues survey of 1995
-- but from your experience on the tax issue, how do you think
average Americans, pro-family Americans, are going to respond
to this kind of cat-and-mouse game we are playing?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, there are a lot of legislators who like to pose 
these two things against each other and say, well, you can either 
balance the budget or you can cut taxes.  But, surely, if you are 
going to be cutting taxes, you could be taking that money that you 
would have raised and putting it toward deficit reduction and making
it easier to balance the budget. 
<p>
These are not, however, mutually exclusive goals, and we have said from 
the outset, &quot;Look, we believe just like the American people&quot; 
-- and you're right; the polling data is ample there to show that the 
American people strongly want a balanced budget; they do want the fiscal 
house of this government brought into order.
<p>
Look, give us less government. Give us smaller government.  Cut our 
taxes. You can cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time.  That, 
I think, is something that this town really needs to hear, because quite 
often, as you say, a lot of cat-and-mouse games are played to suggest 
that you really cannot cut the taxes and balance the budget.  It isn't
so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, thank you very much for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing the poll next week.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Very good.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  After this commercial, we will be joined
by Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, Family Research Council
analysts who devote their time to researching and developing alternatives
to America's current welfare system.  Stay tuned for this and
the chance to meet those who are making practical changes in that
system.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing welfare reform and the practical 
ways that individuals can step into the gap when the government frees 
itself from the welfare business.
<p>
Here with me now are Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson of the 
Family Research Council.  Both work diligently to investigate what 
changes need to be made within our government and our society to 
make welfare reform a reality.
<p>
Welcome, both of you.  I get to see a lot of you, and frankly, you 
guys have been involved in a big fight in the last year.
<p>
Jennifer, can government do anything right?  I mean, the secret to 
welfare reform seems to be getting the government out of welfare.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I do agree that we need to revert from a 
government-driven system to one that is driven more by the private 
sector, by individual citizens and local communities.
<p>
In answer to your question, yes, the government can distribute some 
material assistance.  It doesn't do so efficiently.  But frankly, our 
concern is not particularly about inefficiency or about excess costs. 
Our worry is that government cannot offer material assistance and 
self-respect and human dignity at the same time.
<p>
You do rob people of something very precious. We need to allow them to 
work out problems on their own, to fend for themselves.  And you do 
damage to the human spirit when you suggest that they are not able to 
live by the same rules that the rest of us live by.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Deanna, you, interestingly enough, were a social 
worker.
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What was government able to do?  What were you able to do?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  Well, working for a government agency is limiting. 
There are some things I could do for my clients.  I could set
up resources for them to meet their physical needs as well as
counsel them for their emotional needs.  But there comes a time
when people are in crisis situations where I felt like I had my
hands tied, and I couldn't give things to meet their deepest needs.
 Specifically, I am talking about their spiritual needs.
<p>
I remember one client I had who was severely handicapped.  She was 
three years old, and she required suctioning every 15 minutes so she
could breathe.
<p>
I went in and met with her mother a number of times,
and at one point I just realized that there was something more
I needed to do.  And so, on my own time, the best thing I did
for that family was to sit down with them one evening and to meet
with the daughters and the mother and to pray.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Not the kind of thing that you're going to get too often 
from a government service.
<p>
In your work at the Family Research Council, 
Jennifer, what would you like to see the private sector do?  Is it 
offering prayer support?  Can it offer food support?  How do you think
welfare can really be reformed?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  I think the key is to match individuals one on one so 
that we can build a personal relationship.  I am very interested in 
encouraging church members, in particular, to work one on one with 
children at risk.
<p>I think that religious activists are precisely the 
kinds of people who have the initiative and the energy and the idealism 
that will be required to do this job, because it is a big job.  But 
building relationships is the key.
<p>
We already have a very good precedent with crisis pregnancy centers. There 
are many of our constituents who are already doing this kind of work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is probably hard for people to believe, watching, saying, 
yes, it would be great if government would be more personal.  It would be 
great if we could build key relationships.  But how do you accomplish
a shift from a government-based care system to a private-based
care system?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I think, first, we need to look
at reducing the size of the population in need, and one of the
ways we do that is by an illegitimacy-based approach to welfare
reform.  We know that children born out of wedlock are much more
likely to live in welfare dependency, to depend on the government
for assistance, so that instead of just putting mothers back to
work, we should be finding ways to reduce the number of children
who are born to single mothers and absent fathers.
<p>
It is true that the government will always have a dampening effect on 
the kinds of private-sector remedies that are available, and so it
will be necessary to start scaling back government benefits, because
they crowd out civil society; they crowd out the traditional arrangements,
like families and churches.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think here in Washington,
D.C, I know I walk by -- I am a public transportation user --
walk by homeless people and see a lot of heartache every day.
 We know that there is mental illness, we know there is drug abuse
and chronic alcoholism.
<p>
Deanne, I am wondering, is there not a
certain number of people who really need help, who are not capable
of some of the self-help things that could be offered?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes, there are people who are dependent through nothing 
that they have done, who are born in a state of dependency.
<p>
I think what we want to do is encourage individuals to decide what they
can help with.  Some people are professionals.  They are skilled
to deal with very severe situations.  But for those of us who
don't have that type of education, we each have something that
we can give to someone.
<p>
If we see a homeless person on the street
and we have not worked for a homeless shelter, we can still give
that person respect, and that starts with smiling and with saying
hi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But for the people who are going to need a little
more than that -- because I think you are right -- you know, I
interviewed some people at a shelter not too long ago, and they
said the worst thing about living on the street is that no one
looks at you, and that was very powerful, to see these people
saying, We wanted just to be noticed.
<p>
But how does a government-private
sector world work, do you think?  Family Research Council is getting
ready for a welfare symposium December 13, Jennifer, that you
have been putting together that is going to look at private sector
initiative.  What is the key to private sector initiatives?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, Kristi, you love individuals one at a time; you
don't love collectivities.  And this is one of the reasons why
we are talking about person to person, one heart at a time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic!  And of some of the solutions that you have
seen, what strikes you as being some of the best and most powerful?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There's a church in Mississippi that was challenged
by the governor to meet the needs in their neighborhood, and they
identified the resources that they had within their church.  They
also identified the needs of their community, and they matched
people in need with people who could provide assistance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That kind of matching is going to be key, and we are 
looking at the building of civic virtues.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will meet a former welfare 
recipient and find out how she, through determination and the support 
of an individual willing to help, overcame her welfare plight.  Please 
stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
NARRATOR:  When thinking of welfare recipients, what image
comes to mind?  Many identify welfare with nameless, faceless
statistics -- those who are beyond help, those who do not want
help.
<p>
But our current system has failed to bring the help that
lifts people from their sometimes shattering situations.  One
major flaw:  the system seems to have failed to incorporate the
key to achieving success -- personal relationships, a one-on-one
accountability.  That is how Lisa Biondo changed her circumstances,
stepped out of those statistics.
<p>
A former welfare recipient, Lisa now supports herself and her 
16-month-old son, Dillon. Combined with her own determination was the 
friendship of Megan McMullen. With her help and inspiration, Lisa began 
to achieve the success that marks her life today.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tonight we are discussing
welfare reform and introducing you to individuals who diligently
are making a change in the current system.  Two of those people,
whom you just met in our video piece, are Lisa Biondo and Megan
McMullen.  With Megan's support, Lisa, a former welfare recipient
and single mother, has successfully overcome a difficult situation.
 I don't want to tell too much of the story.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Thanks for having me here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for coming.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What was it like for you?
 Maybe you could tell a little bit.  You were pregnant.  What
did you feel?  What were you thinking at the time?  What was your
family situation like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  When I found out I was pregnant,
I was very scared, and I turned to my mother and my father, which
they were very unsupportive of me, so I sought help through friends.
<p>
When I was seven months pregnant, I came to the Northwest Center,
and I was receiving AFDC at the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How did you hear about the center?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Actually, I was staying at another maternity home similar 
to the Northwest Center. It was designed for a younger group, and I 
wanted to get out, so I researched some places and I came up with 
the Northwest Center and went to interview with them, and then I was 
accepted, and I had another interview with the actual house mother.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It had to be a very traumatic time for you.  What did you 
think your future would be like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I had no idea.  It was very scary
when you are responsible for another life, and I didn't have my
high school diploma at the time, so I had to get my GED, and I
received that after I had the baby, and I am very confident now
that I can make it in life without the support from welfare and
things like that.  I have an excellent job, and I have great friends
who have been there for me for everything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's what I hear.  You met Megan, and was that a turning 
point for you?  How would you describe meeting Megan that day?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, when I met Megan, I was not very open to talking to 
people. I didn't share too much information on myself.  And then as I
stayed there at the maternity home, we were in conversation, and
I just mentioned that I didn't have a birth coach, and so Megan
basically said she would be my birth coach, and it was just a
great experience, you know, having -- she was like a sister to
me -- [inaudible] brothers and sisters -- so this is great having
her support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You do that for a living, Megan? Are you a volunteer?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Yes.  I am a director of a crisis pregnancy center, and at 
the time I was not the director, when Lisa came to the Northwest Center; I 
was the program director.
<p>
She started coming to the pregnancy center because she wanted
to learn more about the pregnancy and about what delivery was
going to be like, and I guess we entered into a number of conversations
about that, and at one point she mentioned that she didn't have
anyone to go with her to the hospital that night, and she was
very nervous about it.
<p>
I just said at the time, &quot;Oh.  Well, I'll go with you.  Sure, no 
problem.&quot;
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  She didn't know what she was getting into.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You hadn't done that before?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  No, I had never done it before.  I
was very interested, and so Lisa and I started going to all of
her prenatal care appointments together and then to birthing classes,
and then we -- Dillon was expected -- what day was he expected
on?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  He was expected July 8, but he didn't arrive
until July 21.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  We were waiting for a while.  But
that night, I guess, to tell the story, we were at a party at
the Northwest Center, and Lisa kept going, &quot;You know, I'm
getting the funniest feeling.  Something is going on.&quot;  And
everyone is going, &quot;Yeah, Lisa, that's all right.&quot; 
And she said, &quot;No, really, like something strange.&quot;
 Then we started timing them.  They were about five minutes apart.
 It was amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, tell me, how has this changed
your life?  You have now left welfare.  Was this a decision that
you guys talked about?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, I had it
set in my mind, even from when I began receiving AFDC, I just
knew it was a sick cycle.  You get trapped in it, and I didn't
want to get trapped.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Had you seen friends or family or people around you 
getting trapped?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, I know a few people that have - you know, it is just 
the way -- they give you a certain amount of money to live on, but yet if 
you get a job, you make more than what you would normally get on a
check, and you would be ineligible, and so they basically, they
say, &quot;Well, here's your medical assistance, here's your food
stamps, here's this money,&quot; and it is very comfortable for
them to stay on it without having to go out and work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you didn't want to get stuck?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: No, I didn't want to -- I come from a middle upper-class 
family, and I was very embarrassed and ashamed to be on welfare.  But 
it was something that -- I used it as a stepping stone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And for you, Megan, do you see in your work a lot of people 
trying to struggle to get off?  I mean, you see a lot of people coming in, 
and the temptation must be to stay on welfare.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Certainly. I think that quite oftentimes women are concerned 
about medical benefits, even, talking about a lot of minimum-wage jobs, you
are not getting medical benefits in order for their children and
things like that, that they feel trapped.  I think oftentimes
we are talking about young women that have second- and third-generation
welfare families, where it is everything that they have ever known.
 No one has ever talked to them about actually finishing high
school, actually going to college, working, doing things like
that.
<p>
I am seeing young women who are having their first baby
at 15, and that is not uncommon nowadays, to have four children
by 19.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you tell them?  You know, you have
some experience now to talk from, and you obviously work with
that every day.  What do you tell them when they come in?  What
can you say to someone in that situation?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, basically, I have been through this so I know how they 
feel, and I have reached out and I have tried to help in my own way that I 
can.  I don't have much to give, but I try to give what I can.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You in fact invited a young woman to come and live with you.
<p>
MS. BIONDO: I did.  She was calling to the center, and I spoke
with her on the phone, and she finally came into the center, and
she didn't have anywhere to go.  Something inside of me just said,
Well, she can come home with me.  I have a very small apartment,
you know, but I wanted to provide for her.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I gave her clothes, and she has a beautiful daughter
now, and she has everything, but I felt the need to help someone,
because I needed someone to help me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sort of one on one.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  And Megan was there for me, so it is like
a cycle, you know, keep it going.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of what you are seeing in your work, Megan, is 
that what is making the difference, one person helping one person 
helping one person?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think, absolutely, the idea that someone who
is there at 12 o'clock at night when you call on the phone and
you're upset about something.  That makes the difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think to know that there is someone
out there who truly cares, who is starting to talk about the future,
to go, &quot;Well, what are your plans?  Where do you want to
be a year or two from now, and what are the plans and the steps
that you can take to be there?&quot;
<p>
I think specifically with Lisa, the big step was originally to get her 
GED and then to get some work experience and then to get a job of her own, 
which she has now, which is fantastic --
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Excellent.  An excellent --
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  -- affording her -- she has health benefits,
she has an apartment for herself, and she can afford to pay for
excellent day care for Dillon, which is, I think, two years ago,
when you were talking about it two years ago, you wouldn't have
thought that that was possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, the Northwest Center is very well known in Washington 
for doing some wonderful work.  Everyone I know raves about it.  How could 
people get involved? Is there anything that you would advise someone in 
terms of how to be a real helping hand?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, if you know someone that has reached out 
to you and expressed that they do have a problem, I would say do what you 
think that you can do to help them.  You know, there's lots of ways.  You 
can volunteer at the center.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Lots of practical ways.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  I would love you to give the
phone number of the center before we go.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: It is 202-483-7008.  We are located in Washington, and we 
are open to taking anyone who would like to come and help us with anything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have heard wonderful things.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Following this commercial break, we will be back and joined 
by Hannah Hawkins, a woman who took it upon herself to make a difference in 
her community. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Anacostia. Southeast Washington, D.C.  A neighborhood 
recently labeled, &quot;The shattered heart of the murder capital.&quot;
<p>
In this neighborhood of what seems to be made of broken dreams and hopelessness 
lives Hannah Hawkins.  She is making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER: Did you get a cup?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  God put us here for a reason, and that
is to serve and not to be served, and in saying that, He never
wants us to look down on a man unless we're picking him up.
<p>
[Children playing games.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And those who volunteer with Hannah
are also making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  That's the sounds he makes when he's mad.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Hold up nine fingers.  Now take away four.  Now, how many 
have you got left?
<p>
CHILD: Five.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  It comes with volunteering:  giving it back.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Number one, I feel that you need, everybody needs to volunteer
in some organization, and the cost of real love -- and that's
our motto -- is no charge.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Hannah is beginning reform at the beginning, with children.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Because you're going to either deal with them here to you're 
going to be dealing with them somewhere later.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is easy to see why Hannah Hawkins has created a successful 
organization which helps the children of her neighborhood in Anacostia. 
Ms. Hawkins started the Children of Mine Center in her home more than nine 
years ago. Hannah and her center now serve 75 to 100 children a day in an
after-school program that provides an immeasurable amount of academic,
nutritional, emotional, and spiritual support.
<p>
Welcome so much. I am glad to have you and Deanna back again.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you choose to focus on the children?
 There are a lot of needy people out there.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, many years ago -- I am an activist; I am a native of 
this city, and there are very few of us that are left in the city -- I 
became a drug counselor.  I have three sons who are recovering addicts.
 I found that so much emphasis had been placed on the adult addicts,
and no one was paying attention to the siblings.
<p>
I would travel through the street, walking through the streets all hours of 
the night, coming from different meetings, and I would find children
who were out begging for various things.
<p>
Therefore, I felt as though that we had to do something.  We could no 
longer sit around the round table and discuss what was happening to the 
children and not do something for the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That first day that you decided to have children come into 
your home, what was that day like?  Or was it a special child, when you said,
&quot;I'm going to open my home&quot;?  How did that happen?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, it is so ironic.  It just happened.  You know,
me and my prayer partner had started a Bible study group.  She
had it in her home, and I encouraged her to take the children
from out of her home because, by word of mouth, she had outgrown
her home, and I found her a place across the street from where
I lived, and in finding her a place, I found that children were
coming to me for counseling, and it just happened.  It is just
like when you fall in love.  You don't know when or where; it
just happens.
<p>
And so I found that the traveling into my home,
which I live in a very small, two-bedroom townhouse in Anacostia,
that I was no longer able to accommodate the many children that
wanted to come in.
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, other government agencies, people have come to you and 
offered to take this over or help, and you have said no federal funding.  
Why is that?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, the government agencies have not virtually come to 
offer assistance and taking it over.  They have admired me from afar,
like many people.  But I tell people that your mouth can say many
things, but your behavior don't lie, and their behavior has lied.
 They have not come forth to virtually offer me anything, and
to be honest with you, maybe it's all for the best, because some
of the services, one of the major services that we provide at
the Children of Mine Center is Bible studies, and when you are
receiving federal funding, they don't want you to discuss religion
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a social worker, Deanna, I know you saw
a lot of that.  What impresses you most about Ms. Hawkins' program?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There are so many things that impress me about your
program, but one of them is that it is in a neighborhood that
you live in and that you are meeting a need of those around you.
<p>
All of us find ourselves in different neighborhoods, with different
children around us, and I have just noticed in you a real genuineness
and wanting to reach out to whoever it is, whatever those needs
are that you have seen.
<p>
I am really impressed, too, in the fact
that you are working with children and in that investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the lives changed, even in a nine-year period,
what has happened to some of the kids that you have had?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, I have had them more than nine years in actuality; I 
have had them for over 10.  It is so ironic that you asked me that
question, because I always use a slogan, &quot;From little acorns,
big oaks grow.&quot;  The children are able to equate to this,
because they can see a little acorn, and then they know about
the big oak.
<p>
The children that have stayed under the umbrella
of the Children of Mine Center have grown.  I have taken them
from profanity to prayer, from crime to a normal way of living.
 And the problem -- and this is what I tell so many of my constituency,
and I try to tell society -- you know, we are so busy -- so many
of the Congressmen are so busy posturing themselves until they
don't understand that these children are no different than any
of us.  It is lack of nurturing that has occurred.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of homes do the children come from?  How would 
you describe their environment?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, they come from all over the city, all over the 
metropolitan area -- Northwest -- all four quadrants -- Northeast, 
Southwest, and Southeast. Some come from two-family homes.  Some are in 
foster care.  Some have been adopted.  We have adopted some of these 
children.  Some come --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a common thread, do you think,
as you look at them -- two-parent, one-parent, rich or poor? 
What holds them together in your home and in your heart?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: In the Children of Mine or in their home?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In the children that you see coming in.  What do you see a 
common thread today?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, the main thing that I see, and the
most common denominator, is that consistency -- and this is what
society does not have anymore.  Look at today.  The government
is closed down.  You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow.
 Through the grace of God -- it is nothing that I am doing; it
is only through the grace of God that we are able to do this.
 It is consistency.
<p>
There are days when I am awfully tired, awfully
tired.  But I go in spite of my tiredness.  And the children see
a consistent pattern that we are there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The research has been very clear that consistency and a 
stable environment is one of the key elements that children need. 
Faith is something that government often doesn't provide.
<p>
Deanna, what do you see in the research in terms of the powerful impact 
that role models and role models of faith have on kids?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: The research has shown consistently that if you have a 
faith-based program, it is more effective than the government programs, and 
that is exactly what Ms. Hawkins is doing in her center.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The children -- I know you've got to have many different things
that you give them:  food, shelter, academics.  Academics is another
long-term skill.  What do you do for the children in helping expand
their thinking?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, first of all -- and you must
understand this, and I cannot emphasize this enough -- the cost
of real love is no charge.  The children, they are very sensitive,
and I think we as adults, we underestimate the intelligence of
children.  They are just like sponges.  They will absorb anything
that you give them.
<p>
I will say to you just like I say to them
every night, &quot;Poison in, poison out.  Love in, love out.&quot;
 And that's what we try to give them:  love, consistency, understanding,
and patience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I understand that even though there
are sometimes gang problems, crime problems in the area, that
people have been very much leaving your program alone and giving
you the space to do what you are doing.  Why do you think that
is, when so many people are talking about those kinds of gang
and crime problems in the inner cities?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, it's only through the grace of God, and what you 
must understand -- I will say to you just like I say to a lot of the 
volunteers that might want to come, and they say to me, which I laugh 
about it now, but it used to be very insulting, &quot;Is it safe to come
there?&quot;
<p>
And I say to them -- and I am going to say this to
you -- &quot;When you're doing God's will, He will put a hedge
of protection around you at all times.&quot;  They are more safe
there than they are sitting in their own so-called secluded living
rooms.  The community knows that we are doing God's work, and
that's why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have about a minute left, and I would
love to give you the opportunity to say anything you would like
to the people who are watching about your program or the work
that you are doing.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  I would just like to say to
you, my brothers and sisters, today, we have so many children
that have a hole in their hearts.  Please close that hole with
love.  Take time out to reach down and pick one of these children
up.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, Ms. Hawkins.  It has been
an honor.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you highlights
of what the Family Research Council staff is doing to ensure that
the government gives us the very best for today's families.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
The FRC staff participates in many events to
promote America's families.  In fact, just last week, Robert Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies, testified before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee to give his insight and influence regarding
the Family Privacy Act.
<p>
<i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you the Family Research Council's Homefront 
News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From testimony given on November 9, 1995, before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on the Family Privacy Act.]
<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR: Mr. Knight, could we have your statement, please, sir?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Sure. I am Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural
Studies of the Family Research Council.  I am a former journalist,
having been a news editor at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, a Media Fellow
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
We appreciate your including Family Research Council in this hearing,
and we feel we are speaking on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
In 1986, the White House Working Group on the
Family's final report included these words:  &quot;Parental nurturing
and education of the young is our most important national investment.
 It is the fundamental task of humanity.&quot;
<p>
Those words were penned by my boss, Gary Bauer, and nothing that has 
happened since has changed the truth of what he said.  It could have been 
said at any time and any place.
<p>
We often hear from child's rights advocates
that it takes a whole village to raise a child.  But parents are
indispensable.  Not even a whole village can replicate them. 
As the people most responsible for and most equipped to discern
the needs of their children, parents must be accorded deference
in all matters of education.
<p>
Children in public and private schools
are taught by dedicated professionals, but only because the parents
consent to have these professionals participate in their education.
 No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological ones.
<p>
Mother Teresa described such devotion through
a firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta.  She said,
&quot;I'll never forget.  I gave a child to a Hindu family, and
after a few months, I heard the child became very, very sick,
and I sent for the family, and I told them, 'Give me back that
child.  I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.'  The father looked at me and said, 'Mother, take
my life rather than take the child.'&quot;
<p>
Like this Indian father,
most parents would lay down their lives for their children, and
they are acutely aware of this responsibility.  So decisions about
what kind of information is conveyed to children or extracted
from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods,
including surveys, that place a barrier between children and their
parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have found
themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not the parents, know what is best for the children.
<p>
Such officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials, and relativistic notions of
morality, all in the name of research and education.
<p>
Often parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.  The 
concept of informed consent is faulty, because there are too many ways 
for it to fail, as Senator Grassley pointed out.  Parents are often
not given adequate information, and a teacher may send a child
home with an announcement about an upcoming survey, but unless
the parents signs a permission form, there is no way to determine
if the parent ever got the message.  As a parent myself, I can
tell you, those messages don't always get through.
<p>
And to those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and 
expensive, a loss of parental freedom to determine a child's education is
a far higher cost, one that is unacceptable.
<p>
There are other ways
that information can be obtained on dangerous behaviors.  Documentation
of the numbers of cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually
transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses, and the like is
readily available.
<p>
The drive to target all teens and children
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information, in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.
<p>
But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more value-free information
about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral change
at all except perhaps earlier experimentation leading to more
problems.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000 and its emphasis on national
standards and accountability, the role of testing is becoming
paramount.  Outcome-based education as implemented by Goals 2000
moves schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain attitudes.  Consequently, the line is becoming blurred
between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are worried about surveys for two reasons. Some questionnaires 
reveal information that is nobody's business but that of the families,
and some questionnaires convey information to the children that
the parents would rather their children were not exposed to. 
<p>
The issue has been driven primarily by sex, suicide, and drug surveys
among young teens, some of which have been politically motivated
and manipulated.  A few years ago, a national youth survey on
sexuality contained questions that were so graphic that many parents
felt they were pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless
children has been driven by revelations of abuses by federally
funded researchers going as far back as the famous studies of
Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s.  It was under grants from the National
Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected material for his famous
Kinsey report.
<p>
In that report, 317 children were reported to have
been subjected to sexual molestation and their responses recorded
in a graph table.  Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent
was given.  In fact, no one, not even parents, could give consent
for such acts.  But that didn't stop the Kinsey scientists.
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse can
be found in the Family Research Council's new documentary, <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>, which I am donating and submitting for the
record.  It can also be found in <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud:  The Indoctrination
of a People</i> by Dr. Judith Reisman, Edward Eichel, with Drs. J.
Gordon Muir and John Court as editors.
<p>
Now, I am not suggesting
that the mere taking of a survey is equivalent to the kind of
abuse that Kinsey recorded, just that there is a temptation to
gather information because it can be done without asking whether
it should be done.
<p>
Surveys that ask questions about suicide or
drug use can plant the idea of either activity as an option, when
a teen may never have entertained this option.  For sheer repetition
of reference, harmful activities can lose their power to inspire
natural resistance.  After all, if a teen hears about this stuff,
a teen could conclude, &quot;If we're talking about it so much,
everybody must be doing it.  What's wrong with me?&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys, in and of themselves, are objectionable when directed toward 
children, and they are notoriously unreliable.  They are slanted towards
the unconventional.  People who indulge in unconventional sexuality
or precocious sexuality are far more interested in talking about
it.
<p>
Here's the dilemma for little Susie.  She responds to a question
that asks if she's a virgin.  If she answers yes, then she is
supposed to skip through several detailed questions about sexual
activities, such as how many partners she had had.  After an exercise
like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever for having
kept herself chaste.
<p>
Teens are very peer conscious and can feel
left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves from
a battery of questions.
<p>
Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of intrusive experiences, the possibility for
stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in with written consent.  Those who administer surveys are more
interested in high compliance than parental input, so they tend
to be opposed to such safeguards.  But parental rights have to
come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts like H.R.
1271 to safeguard the rights of parents to direct their children's
education and welfare, and that includes how, where, and when
children are included in research.  Parents are assigned that
task by no less an authority than God Himself.  It would be the
epitome of hubris to tamper with that bond because some educational
experts feel they are smarter than everybody else. Thank you.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council.</i> I'm Kristi Hamrick, and we are here to present issues that 
affect your family, all American families, and the impact government
and social policies have on families today.
<p>
In fact, this week's show provides new scientific data on what Americans 
want for themselves, their families, and our country as a whole.  Tonight 
you will hear the exclusive results of the Family Research Council's 1995
Family Issues Survey, which delves into things like our current
welfare program, crime, divorce, and pop culture's influence on
you.
<p>
In fact, just yesterday, Family Research Council held a news
conference to release scientifically conducted poll data.  Although
major media from ABC, NBC, and PBS attended, these stories that
appeared couldn't cover all of what is the most pertinent about
this original work.  So, before we divulge into our findings,
let's take a look at what the newspapers and networks got to see
of our news conference as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p><center><h4>Excerpt from News Conference</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I'm Kristi Hamrick, the Director
of Communications for the Family Research Council.  This is the
fourth annual Family Issues Poll.  Family Research Council, which
has had an interest in examining research of all kinds, likes
to participate in it as well, and sometimes I think we all know
that a number can say almost anything that you want it to say.
<p>
So we like to do our own numbers, take a look for ourselves at
where the people are in terms of their attitudes and values and
how do they see some of the reforms, from welfare reform to some
of the choices on abortion to some of the things about our culture
that really concern us.
<p>
So we have been doing polling under the
leadership of Bill Mattox, who is the Vice President for Policy,
who has been here in Washington quite a while and at FRC, I think,
10 years, and has been directing these polls.  So I would like
to invite him up to let you know where the country is today on
some really key family issues.  Bill, if you would come on up.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Thank you, Kristi. Today I am pleased to join Bob
Maginnis of our staff in releasing the findings of the Family
Research Council's 1995 Family Issues Survey.
<p>
Like other FRC polls that have preceded it, this year's survey addresses 
a wide range of questions that have cultural, public policy, and electoral
implications.  Indeed, the clear message of our 1995 survey is
that the catch phrase for the 1996 election year is unlikely to
be, &quot;It's the economy, Stupid.&quot;
<p>
Instead, many Americans perceive that our nation's most daunting problems 
stem from the fact that our nation's ship has lost its moral compass. This
is, I think, quite evident in a number of the findings of the
Family Research Council.
<p>
Kristi mentioned there was a significant
section of our poll that dealt with questions surrounding the
current welfare reform debate and, indeed, questions that I think
will become increasingly important as we see the budget battle
continue and as we see Congress increasingly move toward relimiting
government.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  We gave the statement and asked
for a comment.  The statement is:  &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my views.&quot;  Seventy-five percent of all Americans agree with
that statement.
<p>
Now, possibly they agree -- and this is when we
asked even further about what would you do -- we found that clear
majorities of Americans would block out offensive material --
violence and sexually explicit material -- on cable television
and on computer networks.  As well, when we talk about cyberspace,
we also found, interestingly, that young women and older women
agree:  they don't want this sort of trash on our computer networks.
<p>
You know, we ask Americans -- and they are divided about this,
interestingly -- whether or not they can protect their kids from
the offensive nature of what's going on in our pop culture and
are they doing a good job.  Now, what we found is that 49 percent
said, &quot;Yes, we can protect our kids from the ravages of the
pop culture.&quot;  Forty-nine percent said, &quot;No, we can't.&quot;
 Forty-nine percent -- maybe the same first 49 percent -- said,
&quot;We're doing a good job.  We're monitoring the shows, we're
monitoring the music lyrics, and we're protecting our kids.&quot;
 But 49 percent said, &quot;We aren't.&quot;
<p>
We found that one-third
of all single moms and one-third of all divorcees say that they
can do the job.  But 61 percent, almost two-thirds, said, &quot;We
need help.  We cannot do this by ourselves.  We need possibly
government, possibly community activities, possibly even the industry,
to jump in and do the right thing.&quot;
<p>
We found that more than nine out of ten parents oppose public libraries 
giving objectionable materials such as <i>Playboy</i> magazine to young children 
without parental consent.  Then we found about nine out of ten Americans wanted
parents to have a veto power over the materials that any child
-- their child -- would take out of library, specifically because
parents are concerned about the moral guidance of their children,
and also, quite frankly, they are liable for the materials that
their child might check out of the local library.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: With that, we'll throw it open for any questions anyone may 
have. Yes?
<p>
QUESTION:  Is there a reason why you didn't focus on education
and the role of school?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, actually, we have done
a lot of education research in the past.  Last year's survey --
and this did not get the kind of pickup that it should have --
last year's survey found that younger parents -- that is, parents
of preschoolers and of early elementary school-aged kids -- tend
to support school choice to a significantly larger degree than
do parents of older children.
<p>
I think there are all kinds of reasons
why this might be so.  They may be less subtle in neighborhoods
that are -- and may have yet to even buy a house -- and since
we know that housing is quite often closely tied to school districts,
that could be part of the reason.
<p>
I think in many ways younger parents may perceive that the school can more 
likely have a positive effect on a potentially troubled child than that the 
potentially troubled child might have a negative effect on the school culture;
whereas, with older children, the opposite may be true, that many
perceive that a troubled teenager is more likely to be a corrupting
influence in a school than to benefit from some type of school
environment, having a positive effect on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill Mattox 
and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, the two FRC staff members who spearheaded
the development and analysis of this year's poll, to bring you
the results.  Stayed tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are presenting the 1995 Family Issues Survey results
and FRC's top 10 list of findings, as detailed by our guests,
Family Research Council Vice President for Policy Bill Mattox
and Policy Analyst Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis.  Welcome,
gentlemen.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This was a very impressive product.  How long did it take 
to put together?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, we started the process back in the summer,
identifying some different questions that we wanted to ask, including
some that we have asked before in previous years.  We then put
together the questionnaire during the course of September and
worked then with our pollster in kind of fine-tuning that.
<p>
He went to the field in October, and we then spent really much of
the month since then analyzing the results, writing up the report,
getting graphics coordinated with Valerie Stambaugh of our staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, a product like this -- we have heard of Gallup
polls, we have heard of Worthland(?) polls.  Any difference between
the poll that Family Research Council did and anything you might
see on the evening news?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No.  We, much like they,
surveyed 1,000 Americans, randomly selected by telephone, and
asked them a series of questions that they then responded to.
 So it was very, very similar to the kind of thing that you would
see on an evening newscast.
<p>
In fact, some of the CNN polls or other polls that you might see that some 
of the networks do quite often only surveyed 500 Americans and so, therefore, 
don't actually have the same accuracy that ours would.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things I know people look at is, is this the kind of 
thing I can depend on?  We're going to talk to people later about getting
a copy of this.  But when they look at this, they could depend
on this as well as they can depend on any other numbers that they
might find?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I would say so.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, I would think so.  You know, we look at polls all 
the time in writing the papers that we write, and the numbers here really
corroborate what we have seen on virtually every other national
poll.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to talk about what we've seen.
 Let's begin to count down Family Research Council's top 10 findings
in the 1995 Family Issues Survey.  Number 10:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Family breakdown and moral decline are fueling perceptions 
America is on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family breakdown. So, tell me, we're talking about being right 
track, wrong track. Why do people think that?  What kind of went into the 
development of that number?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the first question in every
single poll we have ever done is, &quot;Do you think that America
is on the right track or on the wrong track?  Are we moving in
the right direction or not?&quot;  And what we found this year
is that a significant proportion of the American public -- roughly
two-thirds -- say things are headed in the wrong direction.
<p>
What was really interesting is we followed this question up with a
second question that says, &quot;Why?&quot;  Because, typically,
that right track/wrong track question, the answer to it has closely
tracked the economy, and if the economy was going in the right
direction, Americans said the country was going in the right direction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of a guaranteed connection, wasn't it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.  This year what we found is that when we asked
people, &quot;Why are things off on the wrong track?&quot; it
is not, they think, because of economic problems -- 18 percent
said that that was the primary reason -- but the vast majority
said, instead, that the primary reason why they think things are
going in the wrong direction is because of the breakdown of the
family and the decline in values in our society.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that surprising, given the relative stability 
of the economy?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it really is interesting
that you have this divergence between these two questions that
had always in the past gone hand-in-glove.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In terms of what you are seeing, Bob, your area takes a look 
at a lot of crime and cultural issues.  Do you think that that underscores
the need to continue to look at those kinds of areas?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, clearly, you know, the last Presidential election
was about &quot;the economy, Stupid,&quot; and now it is really
what is happening in the cities and in the suburbs of our country.
 And if we don't do something to turn around the violent crime
epidemic, especially amongst the youth, then we are going to find
that no telling where this country is going to go.
<p>
So we have to turn that around.  That is why I think parents or single 
people throughout this country understand that we are indeed on the wrong
track.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to keep looking at what track
we are on.  To continue our countdown, let's look at finding number
9:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Adoption is viewed as the best response.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: And abortion is viewed as the worst response to an unwed
pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very surprising findings when it comes
to the issue of abortion.  We hear all the time that Americans
worldwide are clamoring for more abortion, people worldwide, but
our finding found that abortion was not the knee-jerk response
of people to an unexpected pregnancy.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, no. In fact, our polling suggests that the majority of the 
American public are clearly anti-abortion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of numbers did you get on that, though?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, we asked people, we said, &quot;Look, imagine a young girl 
who is unmarried, teenager. She's pregnant out of wedlock.  What do you think 
she should do? Should she abort the child, put it up for adoption, marry
the child's father, or should she bear the child and keep it herself?&quot;
<p>
What we found is that the American public generally said adoption
is the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And that, closely following that, marrying the child's father is 
the second-best option.  And interestingly there, there were a lot
of men, both married and single, who regarded marrying the child's
father as the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Many people think that men think abortion is the best option.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, yes. I mean, that, I think -- I would have expected most 
men to say marriage is the last thing we want considered here.  But instead,
we found just the opposite.
<p>
When we asked, &quot;What would be the best thing that she could do?&quot; 
abortion ranked at the bottom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  When we turned the question around and said, &quot;What do you 
think would be the worst thing that she could do?&quot; a clear majority said
abortion is the worst thing that she could do in that kind of
situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you see breakdowns in ages or by
race or anything like that, or was it primarily a break between
male and female?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, most of this kind of standard
rank order held true across virtually every demographic group
that you could find.  There were some notable differences on the
basis of gender, with men being more likely to support marriage,
women more likely to support adoption, and their second choice
-- at least the choice of single women -- their second choice
was for single motherhood.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And then third was marrying the child's father.  But abortion,
on everybody's scorecard, ranked last.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, ladies, there is hope for you.  Marriage was at the top of 
the men's list. Okay, let's see now finding number 8:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Most Americans, including rank-and-file pro-lifers, strongly 
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Strongly oppose. That's interesting, because the budget debate 
now, you would think, listening to the President and some of the Democratic 
members of the House and Senate, that people are out there saying, &quot;I 
want welfare just as it is.&quot;  But you do not find it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No. In fact, I think it is a reflection of some of the 
resistance to single motherhood and the perception that many people have
that government programs help to encourage illegitimacy; that
they do not want to see increases in the size of one's welfare
check if they have additional children out of wedlock.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's interesting.  Do you think that, in terms of 
compassion -- you saw people saying basically, &quot;I am concerned about
subsidizing the lifestyle,&quot; or, &quot;I think there are better
ways to be compassionate.&quot;  What did you see in the numbers?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think one of the things that we saw throughout
this was that there is a compassionate impulse on the part of
many Americans, but there is also, I think, a recognition that
government programs quite often undercut that compassionate impulse
and encourage the kind of behavior that actually causes people
to find it that much more difficult to lead healthy, productive
lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Does this surprise you?  Bob, you watch the
Hill, as well as all of us.  As we are watching the whole welfare
reform debate, were you surprised to see the direction that Americans
were tilting?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No, not really.  I think most
Americans are disenchanted with the current welfare system.  But
I was surprised that the numbers are absolutely high in regard
to especially the most religious part of our culture.  They were
saying, you know, fathers need to take more responsibility.  We
don't need to subsidize more illegitimate children.  What we need,
obviously, is to reinforce the family and reinforce marriage in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right, which is sort of an interesting
Family Research Council theme.  It is nice to hear that we are
consistently right on that.
<p>
We have a lot of other findings to come, but one last thing.  Do you 
think that this will be helpful in FRC's work on the Hill?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I do, especially on the
question about the family cap, because, as you know, there has
been a debate between pro-lifers.  A lot of our friends have said,
&quot;You know, we really ought not to limit these welfare checks,
because we might encourage abortion.&quot;
<p>
Others have said, &quot;No. We've got to tackle unwed pregnancy, because 
those are the girls that are quite often having the abortions.&quot; I 
think this polling data, especially since pro-lifers --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It kinds of pulls it together.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- were supportive, I think, may help us to break that impasse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more of this impressive kind of data.  We are going to continue with our 
top-10 countdown and bring you more details.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are in the middle of looking at Family Research Council's
scientific and original Family Issues Poll.  We are ready for
finding number 7.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that preventative
strategies aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancies are better
than those strategies aimed at promoting workfare.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So work is supposed to be better, in the eyes of most 
Americans, according to the White House, according to a lot of congressional
things.  But what you have found out was that in fact that whole
saving-sex concept ranks higher.  I found that a little surprising.
 Were you all?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think this one really did surprise
me, because it is clear that Americans do believe that welfare
recipients, all things being equal, ought to work for their benefits.
 But when we asked them, &quot;Do you think that is the best strategy,
a remedial strategy after people are already on welfare, that
we ought to focus our attention on trying to get them off, or
should we be focusing perhaps more of our attention on trying
to prevent the need in the first place by discouraging out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and seeing if we can't keep people off welfare?&quot;
<p>
And, lo and behold, folks said, &quot;Yes, we really think this
is where our energy ought to go, in part because we think that
this problem may actually be easier to solve than the problem
of getting people off welfare once they are on.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.  It seems to be a conclusion they have come to 
without a lot of support from the media.  Certainly the workfare kinds
of ideas, from Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin to other states, get
a lot of attention, while marriage alternatives don't.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes, and I think it is important that people understand, we 
are not suggesting that we don't think workfare is a good idea.  We
obviously think that the welfare reform package on the Hill, which
includes a significant workfare package, makes sense.
<p>
All we are suggesting here is that maybe the question here is a little 
bit more complicated or a little bit bigger than many would like to
kind of limit the debate only to this safe territory over here,
talking about work, without getting into some of these thorny
issues about how do we discourage out-of-wedlock sex.  And yet
what our finding suggests is that the American people really want
a focus on encouraging abstinence and encouraging people to avoid
out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is interesting
about this number is it almost has implications into the title
X, which is the government's abstinence, saving sex, proposals,
versus title -- well, actually it is title X, which is the bad
side of the coin, the condom distribution, compared to title XX,
which is saving sex.
<p>
We spend one dollar in ten on saving sex
and do a lot on condom distribution, and yet this is a whole study
saying we think we need to focus our whole welfare reform even
more on saving sex.
<p>
Do you think this is a message the Hill is ready to hear?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I doubt they are ready to hear
yet, but we clearly need to be sending a very clear message that
children, whether they are 12 -- and in some cases we have children
12 years old having children in this country, unfortunately --
or they are 28, and if they are not married, they shouldn't be
engaging in activities that are going to lead, obviously, to more
children, because children raising children is not a good idea.
<p>
But whether it is title X or title XX, our government needs to,
in my opinion, back out of the business of promoting sex and get
into the business of promoting abstinence.  You know, there was
an interesting profile --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That kind of promotion is going to be key, I think, in 
what the Family Research Council does.  But let's move on with our poll 
just a second.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of promoting sex, we are going to get back to that 
later, but right now, finding number 6:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  The religiously devout are more apt to give
and volunteer and say they would do more if government welfare
programs were dramatically cut or abolished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In some ways, the sex number and the religiously devout number 
tie together, do they not?  People saying attitudes and the kinds
of people that we raise our children to be are really significant,
and they see the religiously devout as being good citizens.  What
did you find to be interesting about that finding?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I think the thing that is hopeful here is that if we do
see a cutback in welfare programs, or perhaps even the abolition
of the government welfare state, we have religiously devout Americans
saying, &quot;We are prepared to pick up the slack.&quot;
<p>
What is impressive, I think, about that sort of offer, if you will,
is the fact that if you look at what individuals who are attending
church weekly are already doing, they are already giving to charities
at a higher level and volunteering in various charitable endeavors
at a higher level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is interesting, isn't it? By what amount are you finding 
the people of faith to be more involved in their community?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that if you look, for example, at 
giving to charitable organizations, that nearly 100 percent of those 
who attend church weekly say that they made more than one gift at some point 
during the last 12 months.  For the general population, the number was in the
mid-80s.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the difference is not that substantial, though I suspect that 
if you were to ask the question in terms of dollar amounts or percentage of 
income or things of that nature, some of these differences would prove
to be even greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And it is interesting, too, isn't it, because there is a lot of 
media information out there that would indicate that people of faith aren't 
the best citizens. You certainly get that from movies like <i>Cape Fear</i> 
to whatever: when faith comes up, it's negative.
<p>
We are going to come back in a moment with finding number 5.  We are going 
to look forward to telling you that in just a second.  Please join us in 
looking at finding number 5:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Even members of Generation X believe today's popular culture 
encourages teen sex, violence, and drug use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you find that to be -- well,
Bill, you are laughing.  You will have to tell us a little bit
about that.  But that was a very quirky number, wasn't it?  Where
did all that came into that come from?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, I will let him answer why first, because he was 
laughing more than I was.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I am just tickled with some of our staff members who are helping 
to tell the story today.
<p>
But, no, here I think what is interesting is this:  When we asked
people, &quot;Do you think that the popular cultural influences
are positive or negative?  Do they encourage out-of-wedlock sex?
 Do they encourage drug use?  Do they encourage violence?&quot;
 I don't know that it is altogether that surprising that the general
public -- parents, especially -- say, &quot;Hey, this is harmful
stuff.&quot;
<p>
But I think it is rather interesting that those in
that 20-something generation -- 18- to 29-year-olds -- say, &quot;Hey,
we agree.&quot;  The levels of agreement are not quite as large,
but there is, nevertheless, a strong majority that are prepared
to say that we believe that these kinds of influences are negative;
that they do encourage these types of behavior; and that the values
in pop culture really don't reflect our own.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But for kids to say that, though, that seems even more 
startling, I mean that they would acknowledge, &quot;You're right. I 
watch this stuff.  I am more likely to have sex, do drugs, you know,
check out whatever the song is talking about.&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But even when we asked the 18- to 30-year-olds, they 
came back and they told us in large  majorities that what they are seeing
on the pop culture is not reflective of who they are, of what
their family is all about.  And they are upset about that.  And
I think that that sends a clear message to our Congress that maybe
we need to consider the types of violence, the type of drug promotion,
the type of teen sexuality that is being pushed into the living
rooms of every American home today and start to rein some of that
in.
<p>
You know, what happened with Time Warner this past summer
with regard to rap music -- you know, we start to recognize that
those messages are not promoting the sorts of things that we want
healthy Americans to be all about.
<p>
So we need to be involved, not only as a government but as a people, showing 
that our pocketbook can influence large corporations that are promoting this 
stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Helping people make good decisions.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Hopefully.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now it is time for us to see finding number 4. Please watch.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Single parents say families need help shielding their kids 
from harmful cultural influences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is an very interesting number, and it kind
of ties into some earlier poll data from the Family Research Council
in terms of single parents seem to be the most pro-family in some
ways.  What are you finding as we are tracking single parents
over the years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, if you look at this question,
it begins to make sense when you consider that a lot of single
parents are trying to do the work of two and cannot be there to
monitor their children's behavior at every moment.  And so when
the kids come home in the afternoons to an empty house, yes, the
chances of their getting involved in some type of incident in
the neighborhood or something are probably greater.  The chances
of possibly getting hold of some pornographic video to pop in
the VCR or something like that are greater.
<p>
So I think in many ways the lack of adult supervision is something that 
many single parents feel very acutely, and they say, &quot;Hey, look. 
We don't think that the job that we are being asked to do is one
that we can do alone.  We do need societal community support.
 We need, for example, public libraries to respect&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Be a little more discreet.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- &quot;yes, and respect our wishes; that we don't want 
pro-homosexual or <i>Playboy</i> or other types of materials available 
to our kids without some type of shield.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is interesting about that is the knee-jerk ACLU 
reaction to parents saying, &quot;I'm concerned,&quot; is, &quot;Look, 
it's your problem. Deal with it. You need to be the monitor.&quot;  
But with single parents, they've got all that they can do to handle.
<p>
Bob, you have been working with a lot of single-parent issues.  What do 
you see on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, clearly, the single-parent issue
is dynamite, given the illegitimacy rate, given the whole welfare
 debate that we have today, and the out-of-wedlock birth issue.
<p>
But when we looked at the entire population, America is split
in half on can we deal with this; and parents are saying, well
-- half of them say yes and half of them say no.  And then when
we ask the question, &quot;Are you monitoring your children?&quot;
half say, &quot;Yes, well, we are watching the same television,
we are watching the music videos, and so forth.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They are trying.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  But the other half say no, they aren't doing a very 
good job. And so we have a country that apparently is just divided down the 
middle in regard to this whole issue, and we need to pay close attention to 
it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And it is incredibly stressful for the people in that 
situation. That is the saddest thing. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial
break, we will be back and counting down to the number one Family
Issues Survey finding.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>, and we are rolling down to FRC's number one
finding in our top-10 list resulting from analysis of the 1994
or 1995 Family Issues Survey.  The survey experts, Bill Mattox
and Bob Maginnis, are here helping me count down.  So let's see
what our next result is as we count down to number 3:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Most Americans strongly support increasing tax benefits 
for families raising children and want this relief to remain permanent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I am not so surprised that people want tax benefits.
 I am a little surprised maybe by the budget debate where that
seems to be the one thing everyone is suggesting we get rid of.
 How do you think these two things come together in the budget
debate?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the encouraging news here is that people
don't just want tax relief, but they see the need for tax relief
for families with children, and of course, we have been talking,
really, till we're blue in the face, saying, &quot;Hey, look at
the way in which the tax code, over the last 40 or 50 years, has
dramatically increased the tax burden on parents.  Shouldn't we
do something with that?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of numbers did you get?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that when you put
this to the American people, roughly 8 in 10 say yes, you know,
this really ought to be done.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow!
<p>
MR. MATTOX: What is impressive about that is that support for pro-family 
tax relief is even higher than that for the flat tax, which is something
else that we polled here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What did you find on the flat tax?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  The flat tax generally had numbers in the
mid-50s range for the entire population.  Now, among, say, Republicans,
it was in the 70 percent range.  But this number here on pro-family
tax relief was consistent in the high 70s across the board, and
again, the point there that we want to have this tax relief made
permanent, not simply some sort of gimmick that you get this year
but you don't get the following year, but instead, something that
is in the tax code permanently that solves this problem once and
for all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about that
is the <i>Washington Post</i> on Sunday and other esteemed members of
the media have been indicating that we should get rid of this
tax relief; if just -- if it wasn't for that tax relief, everything
would be great with the budget.  But 80 percent of Americans say
that they want that, and they want it permanently.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you think that some of the
people who are discussing this could better connect with the public
on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Listen to the polls.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, clearly, you know, as Bill points out, they favor permanent
tax relief.  They don't want a temporary tax cut right now if
they are going to get something permanent long range, because
we recognize we have a deficit in this country that has to be
serviced, and if we don't take care of that now, we are going
to be in trouble a few years from now.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, and I think the key message here for those who are 
trying to cut the size of government is to link those cuts in government 
spending to tax cuts and to say, Look, instead of going out and spending
money for all these programs that really aren't doing a good job,
we are going to instead give the money back to the people who
earned it and let them use it to buy their kids braces or to fund
a family vacation or to put food on the table.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is what is kind of interesting about this, isn't it? 
Families in America are really taxed.  You are taxed a higher rate when
you have small children than if you had no children, and then
later you are taxed for a marriage penalty if you are married.
 And then, frankly, your children are going to pay for the things
that somebody else chose to spend.
<p>
I mean, do you think that these kinds of numbers could indicate a stronger 
stand is possible here in Washington on this issue?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you are right in saying that these are extremely important 
issues, because even though they don't perhaps directly influence behavior, 
they certainly do indirectly.
<p>
I don't know too many people who sit down and say,
well, &quot;Let's have us another kid, because that will give
us a tax break of X amount or whatever.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But when people see that, gosh, you know,
it really is difficult to make ends meet, it quite often does
cause them to say, &quot;I'm not sure that we can afford to send
our kid to private school.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's a concern.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're almost there, but let's hear first finding number 2:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that divorce laws should protect the spouse 
that wants to save the marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce reform is getting a lot of interest
at the state level.  Family Research Council does not favor a
federal policy; we would like to keep the government out of that.
 But there is a lot of empathy out there for people trying to
keep a marriage together, despite all the different movie evidence
to the contrary.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, well, we are approaching a 50 percent divorce 
rate in this country with every new marriage, and it is devastating what 
is going on.  As you indicate, every state in this country, or most states, 
have laws that protect the spouse that is seeking the divorce and not the 
spouse that wants to salvage the marriage.  We asked and found out that more
than half of Americans want to change that, want to turn that
around.
<p>
We also found, interestingly, that in cases where adultery
is involved, or abuse, that more than three out of four Americans
say that the spouse that is not guilty of that offense should
get the custody of the children; and, also, more than half of
Americans say that for the non-philandering spouse, that person
should get more than half of whatever is left of the couple's
property.
<p>
So they are sending a very clear message that we want
to protect people that want to keep together and keep their marriage
going, because they understand how devastating this can be to
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In America, it would seem that the marriage
contract is the only thing that can be unilaterally exited from.
 Everything else, we have to at least sit down and have a discussion.
<p>
Very quickly, Bill, what are one or two divorce reforms that Family
Research Council favors?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the State of Michigan is doing the very kind of thing 
that we were polling about here, which is to say that they have a piece 
of legislation before the state legislature there that says, in cases 
where a spouse wants to work things out, instead of the law tilting in 
favor of the one who wants to leave, the law will instead tilt in the 
other's favor and will require fault to be shown on their part in order
for the one who wants to leave to leave.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We could see some changes in the law.
<p>
And now, our number one Family Issues Survey finding:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Like other Americans, blacks support get-tough 
measures to combat crime.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Every poll -- Family Research Council's included -- 
would indicate that crime is at the top of the things that people are 
concerned about. And yet you all found this number interesting because of 
some of the rhetoric that came out of the O.J. Simpson trial.  What
did you find interesting about this number?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, in the aftermath of the O.J., the message was 
that black citizens are not concerned about crime in this country, and that
is completely wrong.  We found in great numbers that black Americans
are very, very concerned about crime.
<p>
Specifically, they want restitution paid to the victims of these heinous 
crimes. We also found that they want criminals who are incarcerated to work.
They aren't out there to enjoy being in a health spa or watch
TV; they are there to work.
<p>
Now, part of the problem has been -- and we need maybe some legislation 
here -- is that only 9 percent of the incarcerated people in this country now 
have gainful employment where they could possibly earn money so they could 
pay restitution to the victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Nine percent, you say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Nine percent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A very low number.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there are some reasons.  You know, after
all, most Americans who are law-abiding don't want to give up
good jobs, their good jobs, so that somebody that is a felon in
jail, so that they can earn money to pay their victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But at the same time, there
should be some way in which we can find alternatives.  And there
are some that are out there today.
<p>
We also found that black Americans want drug testing of criminals before 
they are released.  Why? Because a third of all people going into prison 
committed their crimes while they were either intoxicated with alcohol or 
they were using a now-illicit drug.
<p>
So we don't want people that are inebriated or potentially drunks, and so 
forth, to get back on the streets and to just ravage our communities. 
And black Americans, after all, are the most victimized people in this 
country. Their sons and daughters are the ones that are going to jail the 
most. But yet they understand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is interesting; I mean, the numbers would indicate that 
they have a very clear understanding of the cost of crime in their communities. 
<p>
We have about 15 seconds left, Bill. When you take a look at Family Research 
Council's crime proposals, what do you see from this poll that can help
people have a more crime-free America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, one of the other items that we included on the poll 
questionnaire was, &quot;What do you think of the legalization of drugs?&quot;
and found that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including
once again black Americans, say we don't want drugs legalized; we want,
instead, for illicit drugs to remain off limits to young people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very timely, especially given our past surgeon general's
exit.  And I am afraid we are going to have to exit shortly, too.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, as he shares his views today with
the American press corps.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC staff every week is involved in events to promote
strong families and inform people about the status of real Americans.
<p>
Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, recently
held a foreign press briefing to share his views with an international
audience. <i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you Gary Bauer in the Family
Research Council's Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MR. BAUER:  First of all, I would like to thank everybody
for coming here today.  There's a lot of news breaking in Washington,
D.C., so I fully expected to come over here and perhaps chat with
one of you.  So I am pleased that some of you could fit this into
your schedules.
<p>
I would like to just make a couple of brief comments
about American politics and about America at the end of this century
and then find out what is on your mind about things going on in
Washington.
<p>
This is sort of an ironic time for the United States.
 My oldest daughter just went off to college a few months ago,
and she spent the summer reading and re-reading some of the old
classics that she thought that she would have to be familiar with
in an American university.
<p>
One of the books she re-read was <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles 
Dickens. You may remember that at the beginning of the book, there is 
this wonderful line: &quot;It was the best of times and it was the worst 
of times.&quot;
<p>
I found myself thinking as I saw the book that that is a great 
description of the United States in 1995, even though it was written 
about Great Britain and France many years ago.
<p>
There are a lot of reasons that Americans can be very happy in 1995. It 
has been a very successful century for the United States.  We have 
prevailed in several major world conflicts.  I think it is not an 
exaggeration to say that we have won the Cold War, at great sacrifice to 
the American people, both financially and also with the blood of their
sons in places over the years.
<p>
The American economy goes through all the cycles economies always go 
through. There are ups and downs, and so forth.  But if I would have 
brought my Ross Perot charts with me today, I could show you an economy 
that, since 1900, has produced more jobs for more people and more opportunity
than any system in the world.
<p>
There are great medical breakthroughs, technological breakthroughs. There 
are a lot of reasons for Americans to feel good about themselves and about 
their country.
<p>
But, ironically, for about 10 years now, when the pollsters ask 
the American people how they feel, two-thirds of them say that America 
is headed in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was in the
White House, and they are saying it when Bill Clinton is in the
White House.  They said it when the Democrats controlled the Congress,
and they are saying it now that my friends, the Republicans, are
controlling the Congress.
<p>
I don't believe, when they say that we are headed in the wrong direction, 
that they are thinking about the economy or about the military or about other 
issues that tend to grab the headlines.  I think Americans are making a 
comment about the heart and soul of their country, about its culture.
<p>
I think that most experts, when they try to measure a great nation,
look at the obvious things:  the size of its economy, the strength
of its military, the gleam of its cities.  That is one way to
measure a great country, and certainly by those measurements I
think the United States would have to be judged a great world
power.
<p>
But you can also measure a country by the strength of its
families, by what its culture -- the values its culture passes
on.  You can measure a nation by how many of its children cry
themselves to sleep at night.  And I think that in the United
States in 1995, today, too many children will cry themselves to
sleep because they have been abandoned by fathers who aren't there,
because they have been exploited in a number of ways.  And I think
by those measurements my country is in danger of being something
less than a great nation.
<p>
Now, politicians are notoriously uncomfortable talking about 
these kinds of issues.  They would much rather talk
about marginal tax rates and whether the food stamp program ought
to have $1 billion or $1.2 billion.
<p>
But my feeling is that these are much grander issues and much more 
important issues than the others I just mentioned, and that even though 
politicians don't talk about these issues a great deal, I believe the 
American voter is deeply worried about these things and has in recent years 
been indirectly voting on these issues.
<p>
Now, I think that fact has benefitted my party. I obviously am a Republican. 
I served with Ronald Reagan for eight years and have been active in the 
Republican Party for a long time, and I think that, generally speaking, many
voters, particularly evangelicals in the southern United States
and Catholics in the Midwest, have tended to identify these issues
of values and culture with the Republican Party and have tended,
rightly or wrongly, to identify hostility to traditional values
with the Democratic Party.  And I think, as a result of that,
the Democrats have had a very difficult time keeping otherwise
historically loyal voting blocs in their camp.
<p>
I believe that, on through 1996 and into the next century, this is going 
to be the great debate in America.  It is going to be a debate about
liberty and how you use it, the relationship of liberty to virtue,
and it is going to be a debate about the simple question of how
it is that free men and women live their lives; and that this
is perhaps one of the most important debates that any country
and any nation can possibly have.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm Kristi Hamrick, your host.  And you might say we're going 
to have a board report today on whether the business of government, which
runs on your money, has been working for the American family.
<p>
The Family Research Council works closely with Members of Congress
working to influence key decisions that affect the family, which
is that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood, and adoption.
<p>
Today we will discuss vital issues brought before the House and
Senate, such as pro-family tax relief and the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  We will also be looking ahead toward issues in 1996
that could adversely or positively affect the American family's
future.
<p>
First, though, let's see what Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, has to say about the monumental issues
facing us this week, both nationally and internationally.  This
is his perspective, brought to you without a journalist's bias
as a filter.  Gary Bauer instead takes you straight Behind the
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gary, we just saw the great &quot;train wreck&quot; here 
in Washington, D.C., over the budget, and frankly, it doesn't seem like it 
was that bad.  What is your perspective on what just happened in the
budget debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, this is really the great untold
story.  We had all the build-up to this incredible emergency the
country was supposed to face if Washington closed down.  Washington
did close down, and I think most Americans went about their lives
pretty much uninterrupted.
<p>
Now, there was some inconvenience. If you were a tourist here, the major 
tourist attractions were closed. I saw in the paper that the Grand Canyon 
was closed. That raised some questions in my mind:  How do you close the
Grand Canyon?
<p>
But at any rate, I think most Americans still got
their social security checks, their Veterans Affairs checks, and
so forth, and I think it actually was a lesson that there is a
lot of waste in Washington that we can do without, and most of
the world and most of America really won't notice if we make those
cuts.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been very interesting in the budget
debate how so many people, liberal Democrats and the <i>Washington
Post</i>, are saying, really, the Republicans and the Democrats are
so close.  If we could just be reasonable over some things like
pro-family tax relief, let's just get that off the table.  What
is your perspective on whether it is reasonable to get rid of
pro-family tax relief?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  No, that is outrageous.  I mean, when you look at the last 30 
or 35 years, the average American family has had stagnant income.  Literally, 
income growth has barely kept up with inflation.  So the average family today 
is at the same place that family was 25 years ago.
<p>
But if you look at government and their growth in resources, their growth 
has been through the roof.  They've gotten more and more money from
more and more American citizens in the form of taxes each year
than they have had the year before.
<p>
The whole country is tightening their belt; Washington is on a consumption 
spree. That is exactly backwards.  The tax cut is the one thing that ought 
to stay, and the budget cuts have to be implemented.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This Friday, Gary, you are scheduled to be on <i>Larry King Live</i>, 
talking about a political roundup, and James Carville(?), the President's 
advisor, is going to be one of the guests.  In the <i>Washington Post</i> 
this week, he was saying that this budget debate is good for Democrats.
 Do you agree with Mr. Carville?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I don't agree with Carville on much, but I understand why he is 
taking that position. Unfortunately, the polling data is showing that the 
majority of Americans, probably because of what they have been told in
the media, have sided with President Clinton's handling of this
budget crisis.
<p>
Now, Kristi, keep in mind, these are the same Americans
that, one year ago, voted overwhelmingly for fiscal responsibility,
cutting down the size of Washington, for less government, less
bureaucracy, less regulations.  And now, one year later, they
seem to be saying the exact opposite in these polls.
<p>
I don't know how all that is going to play out, but I think Carville, 
unfortunately, has some reasons to crow right now that he and the other 
handlers of President Clinton have managed to position the President to
look good in all of this; but in fact all Clinton is doing is
supporting more spending, higher taxes, and all the things that
I think most Americans are against.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Obviously, Gary, the top news story this week is Bosnia.  A 
lot of the news commentators over the weekend said that Clinton can't go to 
the Congress with budget demands and Bosnia demands and expect both to be 
met. Do you think that the budget battle puts Clinton over the barrel?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I see the argument, but I don't agree with it.  The
President has made it clear he is going to send the troops to
Bosnia regardless of what the Congress does.  So it really doesn't
make any difference what Bob Dole or Newt Gingrich say about this.
<p>
Now, it is true that the Congress could cut off funds for the
troops in Bosnia.  I quite frankly think that would be a mistake
politically as well as a mistake for those men whose lives are
on the line.  Anything you do to try to get at Clinton on this
issue will be interpreted by the President and the press as cutting
out the ground from underneath the young men and women that are
going to be put in harm's way.
<p>
So I think we need to keep being critical of the President's program on 
Bosnia. I think we need to ask hard questions.  But I also think we have to 
make it absolutely clear that once American soldiers are committed that we 
will stand behind them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What pitfalls do you see for the President
and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, you know, Harry Truman said a long time ago, 
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill Clinton 
ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy, as Commander-in-Chief, 
to commit American soldiers in all sorts of places.  It is very hard to 
extricate them with honor once you've gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year from 
now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining the
credibility of the United States is going to be very tough, and
at that point the American people, I believe, and public opinion
generally will turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that Americans 
will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the 
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions. But
I think once Americans see young women, their daughters, coming
home in body bags, I believe at that point public opinion will
turn against this idea of complete equality in combat of women
and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us,
Gary.  We look forward to seeing you next week.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will be joined 
by Marty Dannenfelser, who knows just about all there is to know 
about congressional happenings in Washington, and he will share that 
insight with us.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As the year comes to a close, we are that
much closer to April 15, taxes, a word that can send chills down
the spine especially for lower and middle-class families, who
often bear the brunt of our country's current tax system.
<p>
Forty years ago, the average family paid one dollar in 50 in taxes;
today, it is an average of one dollar in four, and rising.  For
that reason, advancing pro-family tax relief has been an FRC goal
since its creation in 1981.
<p>
In early 1995, the House finally passed a tax relief package containing 
key elements which benefit American families.
<p>
[Scene from the floor of the House of Representatives]
<p>
CONGRESSMAN:  When we wrote the Contract with America, we said
we agree with the American people that the Federal Government
is too big and takes too much of their hard-earned money.
<p>
The average family today pays more in taxes than it does in food,
shelter, and clothing combined.  Most households have a second
wage earner, not to support the family but to support the government.
 And, Mr. Chairman, starting today, relief is on the way.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
[Conclusion of House floor scene.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The package included:
<p><ul>
<li>The $500-per-child tax credit
<li>An adoption tax credit
<li>Marriage penalty relief
<li>A credit for the care of an elderly parent
<li>Expanded individual retirement accounts
</ul><p>
With the package, the seven-year budget resolution also passed, providing 
$353 billion in overall tax relief.  It seemed that families were on the 
road to victory.
<p>
Yet the Senate soon thwarted the House attempts and
refused to pass a tax relief package until it had been amended.
<p>
One positive element remained:  The Senate did hold onto the $500-per-child
tax credit, along with several other pro-family provisions.
<p>
It was just a few weeks ago that both houses passed the long-awaited
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  But President Clinton chose to veto
the act, which contained much-needed family tax relief.
<p>
The train wreck happened.
<p>
The country waited to see what this conflict would
produce, and on November 19, both sides eventually committed to
enacting a seven-year balanced budget plan by the end of this
year.  But the details have yet to be announced.
<p>
Congressional Republicans consider the $500-per-child tax credit a vital 
element for providing family tax relief.  Therefore, the upcoming 
negotiations, as we count down to 1996, are crucial to the future tax relief
of American families.
<p>
With us tonight is Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's 
Assistant to the President for Government
Relations, and Marie Wheat, Legislative Director for Congressman
Steve Largent; and Rick Dearborn, Senate Liaison for the Heritage
Foundation.  They are here to discuss why we need change to our
current tax system, pro-family tax relief.
<p>
Marty has been following this closely. Frankly, why is tax relief so 
controversial?  You all have been working on it.  I know, Marie, you were 
on the Budget Committee.  What is so controversial about a little tax relief?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I think it is about the size and scope of government.
 We want families to keep more of their money, and that is what
it is all about.  We want the government to spend less and families
to be able to keep their own money and spend it the way they like.
 Parents are better than bureaucrats at raising their own children.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I agree.  I think it just comes down to a classic
difference between conservatives and liberals, and liberals believing
in big government and the ability to spend your money, and conservatives
and families believing in the fact that, look, it's our money
to begin with, and we would like a little bit of it back.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have been in Washington for a long time; I know you
all have been, too.  I remember when a $500-per-child tax credit
was a pipe dream. Recently the <i>Washington Post</i> said, you know,
we could really get along if we could just get rid of that $500-per-child
tax credit.
<p>
Is it in trouble?  What kind of fight is going on on behalf of tax credits?
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I would just offer up that I think that there is a chance that 
it could be in trouble. There is always the potential that it could be in 
trouble. I am glad to see that Dole recently came out saying that he is going
to fight for $245 billion.  Armey was asked recently, well, shouldn't
we lower the family tax relief?
<p>
His answer, I thought, was kind of classic, which is, &quot;Look, I already 
gave at the Senate.&quot; I mean, these are folks that had a $345 billion 
tax package with the Contract With America and already came down $100 billion.
 So there are problems with making sure to shore up everyone else
to keep family tax relief.
<p>
But I think with folks like Phil Gramm, in a way, because of the Presidential 
context, pushing Dole more to the right, to be conservative and hold his 
ground on this, I think that should help at least guarantee some form of 
family tax relief.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Marty, you were on the Hill so
recently before joining Family Research Council.  Do you think
from your long experience that Presidential politics are making
tax relief possible?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think it helped. Certainly there is a certain 
competition for the pro-family vote, which we feel is very healthy, and in Iowa, 
for instance, the first state, the pro-family forces are very strong, and I 
think that does give incentive to all of the candidates to be strong
advocates.
<p>
But I think, as Marie and Rick have stated, this is
a philosophical divide where these people do genuinely believe
that families are better equipped to spend that money than the
government and that families can provide for family members better
than the government.  So that is really what is driving the issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from all of you, is that a tough case to make,
that families are better at providing?  I saw a thing on CNN this
morning where two liberals were laughing as though government
day care wasn't a good idea.  What kind of a fight are you having
to make to support the family in that context?
<p>
MS. WHEAT: What you see is that it plays well outside the beltway. It 
is the CNN pundits and the people that are on the media talk shows that
think a $500-a-child tax credit is a pipe dream or something that
they want to get off the table.
<p>
But out in real America, in our district, Steve Largent's district in 
Oklahoma, it resonates. People understand that a $500-a-child tax credit 
would let them keep more of their money and help them be able to raise their
children more effectively.
<p>
And so it is playing well.  The calls we get are in support of it 
overwhelmingly. So I think it's an inside-the-beltway versus 
outside-the-beltway, and the real people know that it's a good thing.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Do the Members of Congress feel that if they give the 
administration $200 billion of this, that it is going to go to reduce the 
deficit, or do they feel that it is going to go to spend more on various 
social programs?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  We believe absolutely that it must go -- it has to
go to cut spending.  There has to be more deficit reduction; that
there is not an offset that you can make; that we have to get
the deficit under control.  And if they want to talk about tax
cuts, if they do want to talk that way, we pay for our tax cuts
-- quote, unquote.  Any of the cuts that we made, we cut spending,
if you want to get into that lingo.  I hate to digress into that.
 But if Clinton wants to spend more, let him cut more.  That's
the bottom line.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  Right.  Yes, we would say the same thing.  I would also 
piggyback on what Marie had said about family tax relief and how it resonates, 
I think, around the country. At the Heritage Foundation, we broke it down, 
family tax relief, as far as a $500-per-child tax credit by congressional 
district and also by county, and the one thing that we noticed is when
we gave that information to the press, all the local papers across
the country would literally just rewrite all of it in their columns
saying that Kenosha County receives X million in family tax relief,
and folks would write in and say, &quot;I had no idea that that
is what this family tax relief meant.&quot;
<p>
So, I mean, people outside the beltway -- you know, I agree with Marie -- I 
think understand what $1,000 more in their pocket per year means.  It
is when we get inside the beltway and everyone up here decides
that they know how better to spend everyone else's money that
we start having the problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see -- some people are trying to say the freshman class 
is going to change America.  Some people are saying they're already becoming 
inside-the-beltway types.  What is your perspective?  I mean, pro-family tax 
relief seems to indicate that they are fighting strong.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would say -- I do the Senate side, so I have kind of -- I 
can stand back and look and see what the House has done and compare
it to what the Senate has done.  A lot of people are saying that
the Senate is kind of the black hole for the House of Representatives,
and to a certain degree, I think they are absolutely right.  I
mean, there are some solid, good freshmen on the Senate side,
but when I see what the House does, I am just astounded that,
first of all, they are doing so much in such a short period of
time that is so revolutionary, I don't think they have a chance
to, first of all, catch their breath to become institutionalized;
and secondly, when they do start catching their breath, there
is something that happens on the Senate side that monkeys up what
they have already done on the House side, so they have to come
back and try to fix it again.
<p>
And I am not trying to be down on the Senate because, day in and day out, 
that's what I work with, are the folks on the Senate side, and there are 
some great warriors over there.  But for the most part, I think these House 
guys have just been phenomenal and really fighting hard for their 
constituents.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  So many of them came here because they were
genuinely committed to change something.  They didn't come here
to be career politicians.  They came here to get a job done, and
then they are ready to go back home to their families.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: Yes.  I mean, look how many of them have already said, 
&quot;Look, I'm doing the term limits things.  I'm a citizen legislator.
I'm going to serve my couple of terms up here and then I'm going
to go back, because I have a business back home, or I plan on
doing X back home.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That does seem to me a big change in the practical side.
<p>
We have about a minute left in our show.  What would you like people to 
understand about what has been happening here in this sausage-making process 
of tax reform, in the last minute?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I would say call your Congressman and call your Senator and tell 
them that you want tax cuts and that it is vital and it is important.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would agree, and just say we should not be spending a dime
more on any of these programs.  You are talking $12 trillion over
the next seven years.  If anything, we should be putting that
money back in folks' pockets, and I would urge people to call.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And you think we can save the $500-per-child tax
credit, as much as it is under attack by the media, perhaps, more
than -- 
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  When Members hear, they listen.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I guess the other thing I would point out -- Marie alluded 
to it a moment ago -- is that the $500-per-child tax credit and the
other family relief has nothing to do with Medicare.  Those tax
cuts were paid for early on with some of the other discretionary
spending cuts.  Medicare is a separate issue.  That is something
that needs to be dealt with but has nothing to do with the family
tax relief.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  No connection whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is controversial, but I appreciate your all's help on that.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss another
pivotal and historic issue, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.
 Stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Since the Supreme Court made the historic <i>Roe v. Wade</i> 
abortion decision in 1973, few congressional sessions have been so momentous. 
But it was a tough fight for life.
<p>
Within days of coming to office in 1992, Bill Clinton signed executive orders 
liberalizing abortion as never before.  Despite his extremely pro-abortion 
policies, the pendulum has swung back a few degrees on some key abortion 
issues.
<p>
Earlier this year, Family Research Council was a leader in the
nomination fight involving Dr. Henry Foster.  On the heels of
the controversial Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, Clinton nominated
another radical, a Tennessee gynecologist who had worked with
and on behalf of Planned Parenthood during most of his career
and was involved in a teen sex eduction project that had resulted
in even higher teen pregnancy rates.
<p>
The Foster fight came down to the wire, and only a few Senate votes held 
off the nomination. Still, Congress had had enough of the Surgeon General's 
office. After much rancorous debate, the House voted to defund the office,
saying it was too political and unnecessary.
<p>
Also at play in the budget debate, on the House side, tremendous pro-life 
gains were made in the spending bills under consideration.  Pro-family 
leaders were able to pass more than 10 pro-life-related measures, mostly
dealing with ending or restricting federal funding for abortion.
<p>
However, the biggest pro-life loss came from a Planned Parenthood
gold mine.  Title X of the Public Health Service Act is supposed
to work on reducing teen pregnancy and promoting family planning.
 But the program enacted, favoring condom giveaways and sex advice,
has instead been connected to increases in every teen reproductive
health category, from AIDS to sexually transmitted diseases of
all kinds, to pregnancy rates.
<p>
Although the GOP-headed House Appropriations Committee was able to defund the 
failed title X program and transfer the money to another program for needy 
women and children, a floor fight led to a narrow pro-life defeat, 207-221. 
The Senate also supported the controversial title X program.  And so it 
continues.
<p>
But the biggest victories this year have been in a battle that
isn't over yet.  On November 1, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly
passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, H.R. 1833, by a vote of
288-139.  The historic vote was the first time since abortion
on demand was legalized in 1973 that Congress voted to ban a particular
procedure.
<p>
Doctors use the partial-birth abortion procedure beginning
at 20 weeks and all the way through full term, nine months of
pregnancy.  The baby is delivered all but the head.  If the head
came all the way out, it would be considered a human being.  A
scissors is jammed into the base of the child's skull, and living
brain matter is suctioned out.
<p>
This horrific procedure is still under consideration by the Senate, with a 
vote expected at any time.  Although the outcome is hopeful, the real 
victories have come from informing the American people about what goes on 
behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic.
<p>
Abortion has always been an extremely controversial issue, and joining me 
to discuss current changes taking place in the pro-life battle is Cathy Deeds, 
Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research Council;
and Congressman-doctor Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, who, along with
other pro-life Congressmen, positively impacted the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act vote.
<p>
Thank you so much for joining us. That's a little hard to say ten times fast.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  It is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was at the news conference when you unveiled
this piece of legislation, and at the time, I thought I would
love to see it pass; I don't know if it could.  And here we are
today.  What prompted you to bring this to where it is?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, first of all, I shouldn't take credit. I just
supported the effort.  I think some very thoughtful people came
up with the idea, how do we really show the American public what
abortion is?  And this particular, the worst case of abortion
-- it is all bad, but this worst-case issue is one where we can
actually show -- you can no longer deny what is happening to human
beings and human life with this procedure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are, as well as being a Congressman, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, so you have certainly seen many births.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I personally delivered 3,000 babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Three thousand.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  I delivered seven over the weekend, this
weekend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A hobby.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, it's not a hobby.  I am a citizen-based 
legislator, and I don't plan on being here very long, and I want to keep 
my skills and at the same time be based in my district, based on what I
do, which is a doctor.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is fantastic.
<p>
So did you find -- one thing I found compelling, if you could tell us
a little about with the child, that in these late-term abortions,
the pain sensors in the child, they are not completely developed
in a rather horrible way.  Could you tell us a little bit about
that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Well, I think the important thing
is that this is -- even though others would want us to think that
this is a benign procedure for the infant, both in terms of the
anesthetic that might be applied and also in terms of the maldeveloped
pain fibers, that the opposite of that is actually the case, and
there has been some controversy over the anesthetic, and it is
important that women who are listening to this understand that
we can safely give general anesthesia to a woman without harming
her baby.
<p>
Some of the testimony that has been quite inaccurate
and unfortunate, that they would put forth untruths in terms of
that, could lead women to make a poor choice about needed surgery
during their pregnancy, so they should not do that.  We can give
anesthesia safely during pregnancy.
<p>
But I think more importantly is the fact that the fetus does in fact 
experience the extreme pain associated with this; that the nerve fibers 
are developed and that the anesthesia that a woman might receive locally 
has no impact at all in terms of protecting the fetus from that.
<p>
But why would somebody worry about pain if they're talking about 
terminating their life in the first place?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  And so there is all this paradox of what are we 
talking about and how do we raise the level of awareness of this human
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Of what happens.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Of what actually happens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Cathy, you have been working on this a lot.  What is the 
status right now?  It has obviously passed the House, thanks to the work 
of Congressman Coburn and others.  Where are we?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  What we are talking about, obviously, as we described it, is 
such a horrible procedure. I mean, we are talking about a baby who is 
partially born, and the Supreme Court never addressed that situation when 
they legalized abortion, unfortunately.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  But I think that is why you find -- I mean, we were very, very 
pleased with the House vote.  We had 288 people voting for it.  Lots of
traditionally pro-abortion members crossed over, supported the
ban, I think because of an ad campaign that we are running, really
getting the word out about what this procedure does.  They were
seeing that this is killing a live baby while it is being born.
<p>
So that was the victory in the House, and we were very pleased
about that, and it is --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now we are to the Senate.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Yes, it's coming up in the Senate very quickly, possibly
as early as next week.  So we really have been working on the
Senators.  It is a tougher battle over there, because the Senate
has different rules, and therefore, they are able to amend the
bill, and we fear amendments that would weaken or gut the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a citizen legislator, are you a little surprised
by the difference in the rules between -- especially when it comes
to a horrific thing like this, partial-birth abortions?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, I would say, as one of the freshman Members 
of Congress, I have lots of disappointment in the rules of the Senate,
not necessarily in the Senators that are supporting some of these
critical issues for our country.
<p>
But what we need to do is to change the Senate, in my opinion, and to try 
to get people that are reflective of what our society's views are today. 
<p>
The real issue is, not very many people can say that it is okay to perform
a partial-birth abortion if in fact you know what it is, and the
real issue around abortion is let's not know what it is; therefore,
we don't have to deal with it.  And that is what is so important
about this ban.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, that was what was so interesting
during the floor debate on that, where one of the first things
out was Pat Schroeder trying to say, &quot;Let's not show what
we're talking about.&quot;
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the very first vote out of the box had to be, Oh,
this is what we're talking about; these are the pictures.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  To be on the charts.  There were big charts blown up for
people that may have not seen that.
<p>
But that is what -- I mean, I just need to commend Congressman Coburn 
because he has been such a leader, but especially to have a doctor, a 
practicing doctor, up there, even though this is not, of course, a recognized 
medical procedure, especially the partial birth.  All abortions we don't
think would be recognized, but to have you up there -- and I know
you talked to a lot of Members and Senator Frist on the Senate
side.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  I think that is helpful to some of the Members.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I think the other thing that is important, if I 
deliver a child that is 24, 26 weeks, I am obligated as a physician to
do everything I can to keep that child alive.  And we take the
same child, turn it around in the womb, and pull its feet out
and its body out and then puncture its cranium and suck its brains
out and say that never was alive.
<p>
There is a tremendous paradox. You know, the tension has to build on that, 
and that is why I am very thankful, not so much that we passed this bill, 
that the American public is now willing to look at what we really do when
we abort babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think that has been the biggest victory, frankly, the fact 
that we are just talking about late-term abortions. Yes, they happen; in 
fact, 77 percent of the American people think there aren't abortions past 
the first three months, the first trimester.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  We should say -- I mean, of course, we in the Family Research 
Council and all the pro-life groups, we are opposed to all abortions. I 
mean, every abortion takes an innocent human life.  This particular abortion 
procedure is so heinous, as we talked about, but it is a starting point.
<p>
As we can see, we did get an overwhelming number in the House, and
we hope, we assume, that the Senate will follow along with that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we may see a Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
come up in the Senate as early as Monday.  What do you think,
looking to the next session of Congress, Cathy and Congressman
Coburn, what kind of pro-life activity do you think might come
up next session?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Go ahead, Cathy.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I mean, certainly, as the little piece mentioned,
we certainly have ongoing, unfortunately, ongoing pro-life battles,
mainly in the funding bills that fund Congress to get abortion
restrictions.  We will probably still have to continue with those,
hopefully maybe make some of those permanent, because right now
they are an annual fight, since these are annual funding bills.
<p>
I think we are talking with pro-life leaders and other pro-life
groups about looking at some other proactive or offensive-type
measures that get at the heart of the abortion procedure, other
types of limits.  We are talking about those, but definitely we
would certainly like to be more on the offensive, but we do have
a pro-abortion President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: So we do have a difficult time.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  We also -- we have an absolute epidemic with 
sexually transmitted diseases.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: And although there, unfortunately, are not many 
forward-looking studies on the teaching that we now teach through title X 
funding, the retrospective analysis of that is that every state that spends 
more money on that has a higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, a higher 
incidence of unwanted pregnancy, a higher incidence of abortion, and a higher
incidence of HIV infection and --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It tracks the money.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  What it does is it tracks a loosening
of moral values.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: It gives a false sense of security.  The question to 
be asked is, when you go to doctors' groups who think that our policy is 
fine on AIDS, and you say, &quot;What's the best medical advice that
you would give your patient to prevent them from having a sexually
transmitted disease or getting pregnant or getting HIV?&quot;
they would say abstinence.  Why is that not our national policy
if that is the best medical advice?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is the best medical advice from a doctor, and I hope you all 
were listening. Pleased stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We will look ahead 
toward issues that face Congress in 1996.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am now joined by Jacqueline Halbig,
FRC's Congressional Liaison; Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal
Studies; and back with us is Marty Dannenfelser.  Thank you for
joining me.  I don't feel like I get to see enough of you all,
because everyone is running around all the time, and we're looking
ahead, what is going to happen next?
<p>
Cathy, we haven't talked to you.  We are actually going to be doing a whole 
show on your area in January.  But you are working on some pivotal projects.
 Tell us a little bit about what you see ahead in 1996.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Right.  I see a lot in the area of religious liberty.  I think
that is foremost in Americans' minds right now.  We have a state
of religious discrimination, and Congressman Hyde and Congressman
Istook are both working toward solving that problem by a Constitutional
amendment.  I think it is going to be a very interesting first
part of 1996 in terms of religious liberty.
<p>
Also, we see parental rights, a huge issue; very important to parents to get 
the government bureaucracies to play second in terms of who should decide how
to raise your children.  That is going to be a key issue, and
I also see that in early 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is kind of ironic about the Religious Equality or Religious 
Liberty Act is that a lot of people think, doesn't the First Amendment already 
give me those kinds of rights?  What is your answer to that?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, it does, absolutely.  The problem we are seeing is that
the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment in such
a way that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment mandates
discrimination against religious people or religious organizations.
<p>
That is not what our founding fathers intended, and that is not
what the literal language of the First Amendment would have us
see.  But we see, since the 1950s, increasingly, a sort of trend
by the Supreme Court in this misconstruction of the First Amendment.
 So a Religious Liberties Amendment would not change the First
Amendment; it would, rather, correct these misinterpretations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Legislatively speaking, Marty, what is going to
need to happen to get this kind of religious liberties ball rolling?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we're starting the ball towards hearings.
 There have been some hearings in the House and Senate so far,
and Congressmen Hyde and Istook have now introduced some amendments,
and they are going to be looking at hearings very soon, perhaps
before the end of the year, and then by early next year actually
moving the legislation in committee.  So we are going to have
to have a push at the grass-roots level to try to get positive
action.
<p>
But we do have some very good friends in people like Congressman
Canady, the subcommittee chairman, Congressman Hyde, and Congressman
Istook and others who are pushing for this.  So we are optimistic
about coming together and moving that legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see a lot of support for it on the Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes.  Yes, there is very strong support.  I think that 
particularly this new Congress is very committed to the idea of families 
and religious faith.  They are realizing that people's religious faith
is so instrumental in framing their values, in framing what is
best for society, and that religion should not be put on the back
burner, should not be treated unfairly vis-a-vis every other type
of expression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is the kind of thing that comes up, just this week, a woman 
selling her son to pay a drug debt; last week, a woman cutting out a child of 
another woman because she wants a baby; and people say, how did we get this 
far? And it seems to be a lack of values and faith-based values.
<p>
Now, you are going to work on that, I know, Jacqueline, but what other
issues?  You are working on the Senate side, the House side. 
What issues are you tracking and do you see coming up?
<p>
MS. HALBIG: Well, I am concentrating on education reform as being a big 
issue in the second term of this session, and it is pretty exciting.
 We have before us -- our big goal with FRC is to repeal the federal
role in education -- and we have before us a few bills that will
tackle that.  One, in its embryonic stage, would get rid of the
Department of Education, and that is a first step.
<p>
But probably the biggest obstacle we have to this is President Clinton. 
If we can get through the House and Senate a bill that will get rid
of the Department of Education, we can pretty much expect that
it will be vetoed by President Clinton.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But why would we want to get rid of the Department of 
Education? Some people say we need more standards, not less.  Don't we 
need a federal role?
<p>
MS. HALBIG:  Well, it's interesting.  Ever since the inception of the 
Department of Education, we have seen nothing but a decline in education. 
I mean, that is where all the studies came up that said, &quot;Oh, my 
goodness, we can't even compete with Germany and Japan anymore,&quot; and 
how interesting that that has all happened since the inception of the 
Department of Education.
<p>
So, clearly, education has declined since we have had a federal department. 
So to give power back to the local schools and parents is really where it's 
at.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I remember campaigning for Reagan in 1970-something, and we 
were talking about getting some changes in education.  Marty, you have been
around Washington, I hope, longer than me.  What do you think?
 Can we do that?  We have about 30 seconds left.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think it is going to be very difficult to achieve those 
changes on Clinton's watch, but we have to begin framing the issues and
moving them through Congress and then explaining them to the general
public, and these things will grow as the public understands.
 A lot of this is tied together, empowering parents, not bureaucrats.
 Parental rights legislation, reform of education -- there is
so much from the philosophy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it is a values-based approach to the problems of, hopefully, 
the next century as we are nearing that point.
<p>
We are going to plan on having shows on all of these actually coming up, 
religious liberty in particular. One last thing as we are looking forward to 
a new session. I understand that Patricia Schroeder just said that she is not 
going to be back next time, and not the biggest pro-family advocate
we have ever had. Marty, what is your one thing that you would
say about Pat Schroeder?  Oh, well, sorry, we have to go.  But
we want to hear that.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Okay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take a look at the 
Family Research Council's press conference that took Banned Books Week by 
surprise. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff consistently 
is working on projects that will move the public debate beyond simple 
rhetoric. Charles Donovan, an FRC senior policy analyst, had the chance to do 
just that in a groundbreaking study that checked out liberal allegations
of book banning.
<p>
The report was released during National Banned Books Week in a September 
news conference, and it answers the question, Are classic literary works 
really being banned from libraries? Let's find out as <i>Straight Talk</i> 
brings you Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I am Kristi Hamrick, the Director of Communications for the 
Family Research Council, and we are very excited to have this opportunity,
as Paul Harvey would say, to &quot;tell the rest of the story.&quot;
<p>
This whole idea of censorship and banning books and some kind
of a hostile image of pro-family America, for the rest of America,
is not only laughable; it is not statistical.  I think we have
two good indications of what a pro-family America sees today happening
in our culture among the Banned Books Week concept.  We will have
some original research.  We will have some people talking about
their experience.
<p>
DR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
I don't know whether it was our decision in Family Research Council or the 
National Press Club's. Of course, we are meeting in the First Amendment 
Room this morning, which is totally appropriate.
<p>
Before I get into a little bit of my statement, which I will try to keep 
brief because we are going a little long, I will say that if the
ALA had control of the Second Amendment and not the first, every
child would have a gun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
It is a pleasure to be with you here this morning and to release the results 
of a survey conducted by Family Research Council.  It is an 18-month-long 
project that I undertook with a colleague of mine, William T. Spont.  Our 
basic qualifications are that we love books.
<p>
We noticed a trend, based on personal observation and talking with 
booksellers in New England, whereby a continuing number, an increasing number, 
in our view, of classic works of literature are finding their way into library
discard bins, book sales, used book stores, and the like.
<p>
We had one particular case where we were in a conversation with a New
England bookseller, major bookseller, and she showed us a volume
that was obtained from a library discard.  It was a $600 book
on the commercial market, essentially a rare book which the library
had for some reason chosen to dispense with.
<p>
That and a number of other impressions about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; 
of education and potentially the dumbing down of libraries struck us with 
the idea of conducting a national survey, which is what we did.  We
compiled a list of 100 major classic books of literature.  They
span a wide variety of topics:  art, architecture, literature
-- that is to say, fiction -- science, philosophy.
<p>
We took that list and sent it to over 500 libraries across the United 
States in all 50 states.  The only libraries we excluded -- and we are
talking public libraries -- the only libraries we excluded were
the very largest urban libraries:  Boston, Detroit, Chicago, and
so forth.  We presumed, based on some evidence, that they would
have the vast preponderance of these books.
<p>
We conducted a pilot survey in Massachusetts to test the list.  We also 
sent it to a couple of very good small collections in New England to verify
that the list was an achievable list.  We found that these small
collections both had a very high proportion of the books, approximately
80 percent.
<p>
We then waited for results.  It took two mailings.
 We got 204 responses from 49 states.  We promised -- I should
mention this -- we promised the individual libraries anonymity,
first of all because we don't want to be seen as critiquing or
criticizing any particular institution; secondly is the practical
concern that we wanted to encourage their cooperation.
<p>
I want to praise the libraries for their diligence in responding to 
us. A 40 percent response rate to any mailing nationally is extremely
good.
<p>
But these are very serious people in the libraries.  They
are very concerned about their collections, and a number of them
-- and these really are getting to our results -- a number of
them acknowledged to us in writing, in written comments on the
survey, that in fact classics do tend to disappear over time.
<p>
We found that, on average, the national average for libraries
other than urban libraries was something like 36 of 100 books.
 At least six libraries told us that as a result of our survey,
they went out and purchased books which they believed were on
their shelves at one time but that had disappeared.
<p>
Now, our basic point is not that there is book banning with respect to 
classics. In fact, this illustration of what is happening to classics 
illustrates how you can use the term &quot;banning&quot; quite loosely. 
We would not apply the term &quot;banning&quot; to these books.
<p>
What is happening -- we think it is of much more significant social
interest than many of the other controversies about literature
today -- is what we would call disappearing books.  In fact, we
think it would be more appropriate to have a disappearing high
education in the humanities week in the United States than to
have controversies week-long about whether or not public libraries
should buy Madonna's <i>Sex</i>.
<p>
In any event, let me give you a couple of examples. Einstein. Fifty-four 
percent of the libraries had Einstein's major work on relatively.  A 
similar proportion had Darwin's book on evolution, <i>The Voyage of the HMS 
Beagle</i>. The major works by Kepler on Copernican astronomy, 30 percent. 
Russo's <i>Social Contract</i>, one of the most important bases for the 
understanding of social policy in a democracy, under 50 percent.
<p>
What is happening to these books?  A variety of things happen to them. 
They deteriorate over time.  Books break down; they are discarded.  Some 
are not recognized by librarians as being important to the culture or
as being commercially valuable.  They are put on the discard or
what they call the deselection list.
<p>
Some are stolen. We have one incident with respect to the information raised 
by Focus onthe Family that was a case of theft.  Theft does happen.
<p>
So we concluded in our report that classics are especially subject to
deterioration; that in a time of constricted library budgets --
and I don't know whether they are constricted or not; it is a
point of fact that many libraries say they are -- it makes the
most sense for libraries not to discard some of the most important
works in their collection.
<p>
We recommend a number of steps be taken to reverse this.  First would 
be what we are doing here this morning, more media attention to the fact 
that there is a dumbing down of our libraries taking place.  And we also 
recommend what many librarians told me that they -- and we surveyed many 
of them by phone -- what they really find valuable.  They prize a cooperative
spirit in the community.  They see themselves as servants of the
community.
<p>
The vast majority of librarians are not presenting
<i>Playboy</i> to children, and they have no apologies about it.  They
are not buying it, or if they are buying it, they are putting
it on a reserve shelf.
<p>
So the vast majority of librarians we talked to are very concerned 
about this problem.  They want citizen cooperation. They love people 
who come in and who love books, and they rely heavily not on academic 
groups but on individuals who are simply widely read, many of whom -- 
one librarian told us he dealt with his classics problem by a fellow in 
the community who just loves philosophy.  He said, &quot;Well, go into the 
shelves. Tell me what I've got; tell me what I'm missing.&quot;  The gentleman
came back and gave him a list of major works in philosophy that
were missing.  He went out and bought them.
<p>
This is the way libraries are meant to work: to use all of the expertise of 
the community, to be sensitive to the values of the people in the community,
to make cooperative decisions.  And I want to say in closing that
most libraries do a very, very good job.  Most parents are very,
very concerned about their children.  Most of us, nearly all of
us, are concerned about educational quality.  If we are concerned
about those things, we will not complain about parents who care.
 We will do more to restore and strengthen our library collections.
<p>
Thank you very much.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're going to ask some tough questions about sex and sexual 
politics. Does it matter whether people engage in heterosexual or homosexual 
sex? What does the research reveal?
<p>
Family Research Council examines a broad spectrum of issues
that affect families today.  One of the most controversial is
homosexuality.  Today homosexuals and lesbian activists are a
powerful force in government and in the media worldwide.  At the
heart of the debate is an effort to change the historical definition
of family, from that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood,
and adoption to any kind of relationship.
<p>
Tonight's show will focus on the current status of the homosexual agenda. 
In particular, we will look at the United States armed forces, which was 
highlighted in a key court battle just yesterday.  But more about that 
later in the show.
<p>
First, let's hear what Gary Bauer, president of the
Family Research Council, has to say about another critical issue
featured in the news during the past few weeks:  Bosnia.  Could
President Clinton's peacekeeping mission shape the world's future
in a drastic way?  Gary Bauer provides you with his perspective,
unedited by the media, as he takes you behind the headlines. 
<p>

</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This week one of the biggest news items is Bosnia.  What 
pitfalls do you see for the President and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Harry Truman had said a long time ago,
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill
Clinton ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy as
commander-in-chief to commit American soldiers in all sorts of
places.  It is very hard to extricate them with honor once you've
gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year 
from now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining 
the credibility of the United States is going to be very tough; and at that 
point the American people, I believe, and public opinion generally will 
turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that this will bring the
women-in-combat issue to a head again here in the United States
debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  It will raise the women-in-combat issue again.
 I have noticed that almost every press story filed in the last
couple of weeks manages to show a woman in uniform.  I think,
if you have women in the service on the ground in Bosnia who end
up dying in combat or dying in accidents or become the targets
of terrorists, that you could have another whole debate in the
country about the appropriate role of women in combat, which is
a debate, I think, that is long overdue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that 
Americans will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions.
 But I think once Americans see young women, their daughters,
coming home in body bags, whether it is in Bosnia or the Middle
East or some future conflict that we are not aware of, I believe
at that point public opinion will turn against this idea of complete
equality in combat of women and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Another big news item internationally is Ireland and the 
divorce debate. What do you think will happen to Ireland now that they have 
approved divorce by a very narrow margin?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I were Ireland, I certainly would hesitate before I 
would go down the road that the rest of the West has taken in the last 30 
years. No-fault divorce was hailed in the United States 20 years ago as a 
great advance.  What now we know looking back on it is that no-fault
divorce has resulted in a lot of abandoned women and children.
 And it is harder to get out of a contract with a lawn service
company than it is to get out of a contract with your spouse.
<p>
I think Ireland made a mistake.  That was a very narrow vote.
 The other interesting thing about that vote is that every major
political party in Ireland, every major newspaper, supported liberalizing
the divorce laws.  And yet with all of the establishment saying,
&quot;Vote yes,&quot; only barely half of the country voted that
way.  Half of the country had no representation whatsoever.
<p>
So I think there are still a lot of traditional-values people in
countries like Ireland, certainly here in the United States, and
I think that we still have a chance of seeing a rebirth of traditional
values, in contrast to the vote that took place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family Research Council released a poll where the number 
one finding was that people believe that because of the moral decline,
the country is in real trouble.  There is a very tragic story
about a woman who sold her son because of a $2,000 drug debt.
 What do you think this situation says about the direction America
is headed?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is the outrage of the week,
right?  I mean, almost every week, there is some horrific story
that, just a few years ago, would have been unimaginable.  The
week before this, it was the story out of Illinois about these
thugs literally cutting a baby out of a woman that they murdered.
 Before that, you had Susan Smith sending her children to the
bottom of the lake.
<p>
You know, people come with all kinds of explanations.
 Some people say it's government programs causing these things.
 Other people say it's heartless social policies, or it's poverty
or whatever.  I don't believe it's any of those things.  I think
it is evidence -- all these things are evidence of a country that
has drifted away from its basic belief in God and from a basic
embrace of traditional values.
<p>
Now, when a culture does that, all through history, whether it was ancient 
Rome or ancient Greece or America in 1995, there's a terrible price to pay, 
and we're paying that price now.  Hopefully, Americans will see these things
and rethink the trends of the last 30 years.  But for now, we
are going to continue to reap a terrible whirlwind of tragedy,
family breakup, and horrors that we are already beginning to see
on a daily basis in the newspapers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Anthony 
Falzarano, a former homosexual who has devoted his life to ministering to 
the homosexual community.  Stay with us as Anthony brings us his perspective
on the cultural struggle taking place.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  For thousands of years, homosexuality has been discouraged
in cultures the world over.  Experience, common sense, and considerable
medical evidence show that homosexuality is immoral, unhealthy,
and destructive to individuals, families, and societies.
<p>
So why is America seeing homosexual activism on so many levels?  Why
are homosexuals featured on network TV comedies?  Why are homosexuals
featured on news broadcasts and in newspapers and magazines all
over America?  Why are they so loudly pressing for gay marriage,
gay adoption of children, gays in the military, and special civil
rights?
<p>
The short answer is that this did not happen by accident.
 Gay activists have waged a 40-year campaign to change the culture,
aided by a willing media.
<p>
In 1948 and in 1953, Alfred Kinsey released his famous Kinsey reports on 
male and female homosexuality. Kinsey made the case that homosexuality was 
widespread and not much different from normal sexuality.
<p>
In 1950 the first American homosexual activist group, the Medishien(?) 
Society, was formed. Citing Kinsey and producing many unscientific but 
well-publicized studies about homosexuals, activists began working to change the
moral consensus about homosexuality.
<p>
In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker did three studies comparing a 
group of 30 homosexual men with 30 heterosexual men.  Although that study 
showed clear psychological differences, gay activists and the media have 
misreported the studies as showing that somehow homosexuality is normal.
<p>
The next big steppingstone came in 1973.  After a campaign of intimidation,
the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from
its list of disorders.  The gay lobby within the APA is now trying
to criminalize psychological therapy for those seeking to leave
the lifestyle.
<p>
At the same time, aggressive lobbying extended to more than just organizations. 
It became political, at the grass roots, city by city, state by state. Sodomy 
laws have been swept from the books in more than 25 states.  Gay rights laws
have been passed in nine states and in more than 100 cities. 
Gays are bringing court cases seeking to adopt children, to marry,
and to serve in the military.
<p>
MILITARY OFFICER:  The military's policy on homosexuality does a great 
injustice to the thousands of military personnel who are highly trained, 
dedicated, loyal, and who also happen to be gay.  This policy must be changed 
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In all of these efforts, activists have employed
a flood of bad studies which we can only call gay science.  Here
are the claims:
<p><ul>
<li>Ten percent of the population is homosexual.
<li>Homosexuality is genetic.
<li>Gays comprise a third of all youth suicides.
<li>Gays are a major target of hate crimes.
</ul><p>
Although none of these has been verified by reliable science, media 
reports have persuaded many people that they have.
<p>
Last week an activist group -- Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays -- launched a $1 million advertising campaign to vilify people who 
oppose the homosexual agenda.  The TV ads feature scenes of gays being
beaten, with the image changing to the face of Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, and other opponents of homosexual activism.
<p>
The intent is to say that anyone opposing gay activism directly causes
hateful physical attacks on gays.  The intent is to silence all
critics.
<p>
Homosexual and lesbian activists have made it clear in
recent days that they are in this fight to change the world --
from one that values and cherishes home, family, and heterosexual
marriage as the cornerstone of society to one that says anything
goes.
<p>
With us tonight is Anthony Falzarano, executive director
of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Anthony himself
has been transformed after rejecting a long-time homosexual lifestyle,
and he is here to bring you his testimony and practical insights
regarding today's homosexual community.
<p>
Thank you very much for joining us, Anthony.  You are working with an 
excellent organization and running an excellent group here in Washington, 
D.C., that works with homosexuals, talking to them about what's true. 
There are a lot of messages out there.  What do you see as some of the
biggest pieces of propaganda in the homosexual debate today?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Oh, the number one piece of propaganda that is being
pushed on America today is that people are born gay and that there
is a genetic predisposition to homosexuality, and that is not
true.  There is nothing out there, Kristi, that proves that. 
There is not one bit of information.
<p>
I am a former homosexual. I was gay for nine years until I came to Christ 
and got help from a national organization called Exodus International, and
they helped me leave the gay lifestyle behind successfully.  I
am now married and I have two children, and I have been married
for 12 years, and I am living proof that you are not born gay.
 We are currently helping about 6,000 former homosexuals within
the ex-gay network.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from your experience both inside and out of the lifestyle, 
do you see an aggressive, or more aggressive, push today, or have you seen 
an accumulation of efforts to bring us to the place where we are, especially 
like, for example, in the military?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, the gays in general, they are highly organized.  They 
are much more organized than the church in America.  They are much more 
organized than our government.  They are real grass roots.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Why is that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's real simple.  They don't typically
have wives and children to go home to at night, and they can work
14, 15 hours a day, and they are very organized and very determined,
and they are fighting for their lives right now.
<p>
In the military, with the Clinton Administration now, they are just getting 
license to push homosexuality into the military.  They have been in the
military for years, and they have been underground, thank God,
but now with the Clinton Administration they are just coming out
of the closet in the military, and we are heading for a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You actually were part of some of the efforts to
talk to the American Psychiatric Association.  Do you see that
as being in recent history one of the more disastrous changes
that took place?  Because what it said was, We're going to now
say that this is just a normal condition.  You actually went there
recently.  What has been your involvement with that, and what
have you found?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, what is really under attack
is authority in this country.  Basically, the American Psychiatric
Association, in 1993, was lobbied by the gay activists, the insurance
industry in our country, to push homosexuality out of the DSM-III,
which is the official digest of psychological disorders.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What's in it for them, though?  Why do you think they would 
do something like that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's real simple.  Basically, if they want gay rights, 
and if they can erase from the books that homosexuality is a neurosis, 
that it is a disturbance, then they can claim that they actually are a 
minority, that they are actually born this way, and, as if you are a woman 
or a Jewish person or a Catholic, that you should be able to be protected
under our Constitution.  That is their motivation.
<p>
What happened was, the reason the American Psychiatric Association was 
lobbied by the insurance industry is because if you go for sexual 
reorientation counseling, it takes six months to two years to walk out of 
homosexuality successfully, and we are talking maybe $100 a session.  You 
are talking about $10,000 by the time somebody walks out of homosexuality.
<p>
If they give gay affirmative counseling, that is six or seven
sessions with a psychologist or a psychologist --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To tell you that you're fine.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: -- to tell you you're fine, there's nothing wrong with you; 
you went to the gay lifestyle.
<p>
Well, that happened in 1973.  Now it is blowing up in the insurance industry's 
face because now, before somebody dies of AIDS, they are spending about 
$250,000 a patient before this person dies of AIDS.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When you're looking at talking with a person who is in a 
homosexual lifestyle, in particular, I understand you are talking about 
sexual identity disorder, that there are roots to homosexuality and lesbianism 
inside of a person in their life.  What is sexual identity disorder?  What are 
you seeing?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, 80 percent of the people that come
to Transformation Ministries in Washington, D.C., have been sexually
molested and/or raped as children.  We see that.  We take an informal
poll every six months, and the data is accurate.  It keeps coming
up constant, somewhere between 70 to 80 percent.
<p>
We see the male homosexual did not bond with his father.  We see the lesbian 
did not bond with the mother.  So we see non-bonding with the same-sex
parent over and over again.  We see high levels of divorce, high
levels of alcoholism, very, very dysfunctional family situations.
<p>
I don't know why this is not being reported to the media, other
than there is a 6,000-member gay journalists' organization now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  You know, the gays are in control in Hollywood; they are in 
control of television; they are in key positions at the <i>Washington 
Post</i> now; and they watch everything that is coming into the newspaper 
or television and radio, and they are editing it out.
<p>
A reporter from the <i>Washington Post</i> came to our ministry six years 
ago. He wanted to do a story on us.  After the meeting, he said, 
&quot;This is fantastic. This is news.  We're going to do a story in the 
<i>Post</i> on it.&quot;
<p>
He calls me the next morning.  He says, &quot;Anthony, 
I hate to tell you this, but we can't do the story.&quot;  And I said,
&quot;What happened in the last 12 hours?  You were so excited
last night.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: He said, &quot;My editor's a lesbian, and she killed the 
story.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of one-sided telling of the story of
homosexuality and lesbianism as we have researched, at Family
Research Council, the literature.  One of the big projects that
we did was the Ten Percent Project, which took a look at the research,
the good research which said 1 to 2 percent of the population
was gay at best compared to 10 to 20 that the homosexuals were
talking about.
<p>
One of the things that is missing today, though, is an analysis of the 
good scientific data on homosexuality and lesbianism.  What are you seeing? 
I know we are seeing a repetitive message that it's genetic.  What's your 
answer to the &quot;it's genetic&quot; statement?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's an absolute lie that comes from the pit of hell. 
Basically, we are seeing many people come through Exodus and walk successfully 
out of a homosexual disorientation.  We see them going on to marriage.  We see 
them having children.  We see them out of the lifestyle 10, 15, 20
years.  I have been out of the lifestyle totally now for 12 years.
 I mean, it's doable.  It's hard.  It's the equivalent of coming
off of heroin.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What does it take?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: I mean, you are really turning your life totally over to 
Jesus Christ to realize that you need this higher power -- and I call
my higher power Jesus Christ -- to walk successfully out of a
lifestyle that basically permeates your entire being.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it is more than like a 12-step program.  To leave the 
lifestyle does require that looking outside of yourself.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, finding out the root causes, what happened to you as 
a child; putting together a puzzle of dysfunction in your early upbringing;
finding out what happened with the relationship between you and
your same-sex parent; submitting your fleshly addictions.  Many
homosexuals are addicted to pornography, masturbation, promiscuous
sex.
<p>
I mean, I had a guy in the ministry who had sex with over
5,000 partners, and he was 32 years old.  Now, that is an extreme.
 Many people that come to Transformation and Exodus-type ministries
have never had a sexual encounter, just suffer with the fantasy
and pornography part of it.
<p>
We help all kinds of people.  We help people who are prostitutes, who are 
homosexual prostitutes. But what we see over and over again -- sexual 
addiction, sexual molestation early in youth, and we see brokenness with 
the same-sex parent and great, great dysfunction in the family unit, the 
upbringing.
<p>
And the devil is attacking the family.  He is trying to destroy
the family now, and we must keep our families together.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that's at the heart of it, isn't it?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's an attack on the family. Today it would seem
that what we are doing is we are looking at redefining the family
to include anything that a person might be involved in.
<p>
But for someone that wants more information about your organization, could
you give us a couple of phone numbers?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, absolutely. I think the Exodus number will be appearing 
on the screen. But we are in San Raphael, California, the national ministry 
called Exodus.  It is area code 415 454-1017.  Transformation in Washington
is area code 202 371-0800.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And for someone who wants a little bit more information, Anthony, 
what would you say to the person who is -- we've got just a couple of seconds 
left -- who is considering a homosexual lifestyle and wonders if they're
gay?  In 15 seconds, what would you say to that person?  &quot;What
if I'm gay?&quot;
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Don't believe the lie. Yes, you are struggling with a 
homosexual disorientation. But think of yourself as a man or woman struggling 
with homosexuality disorientation; don't think of yourself as gay.  There is 
quite a distinction between being homosexual and gay.  Homosexual means I 
suffer with this. Gay means coming out of the closet.  Before you come out
of the closet, get some help from Exodus International.  You don't
have to be gay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being with us, Anthony.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a pivotal
and possibly historic event which occurred just yesterday as the
Family Research Council presented evidence denouncing the involvement
of homosexuals in the military in a court case.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  December 5, 1995, could be recognized
as a significant date in the battle over homosexuals serving openly
in the military.  On this date the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>
was heard before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Virginia.  Family Research Council was granted permission, in
an unprecedented decision, to present oral arguments along with
the Justice Department in this case over the dismissal of Navy
Lieutenant Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified homosexual.
<p>
LT. THOMASSON: This policy that tells gay and lesbian service members
that they can go in harm's way for their country but that they
can't &quot;come out&quot; and try to dispel the stereotypes or
overcome the prejudice with which they suffer is absolutely inimical
to the very Constitution that they've all sworn to defend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  He is one of several servicemen who has highlighted
problems with the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; standard.
<p>
Within days of coming to office, the Clinton Administration began
promoting homosexuals and lesbians for open service in the military,
despite a long military history that barred such service because
of its impact on military order and effectiveness.
<p>
In 1993, Congress passed a clear law that prohibited homosexuals and 
lesbians from serving.  But the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations were written to implement the law, and they made the standard
unclear, some say deliberately so, to encourage lawsuits that
attack the law itself.
<p>
ACLU SPOKESWOMAN: For over two decades, the ACLU has worked in the courts to 
bring about change in our nation's policy on the service of lesbian and gay 
Americans, and for the past six months, the ACLU Washington office has played
a leadership role in working with the administration and Congress
to develop a plan that would usher in a new day of freedom for
these service members while ensuring the readiness of our nation's
defense.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Family Research Council was allowed to
testify after arguing that the Justice Department was not going
to uphold the law, which would be their traditional role, but
instead, they were going to argue that the vague standard, &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; would fulfill the requirements.
<p>
That would mean that both the plaintiff, Lieutenant Thomasson, and the 
Justice Department would essentially be on the same side.  And so the
Family Research Council stepped in to make the case for the legal
standard.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I was pleased with essentially what
Professor Woodruff said, because he really set the agenda straight,
and that is that there is a distinction between what the directives
say and what the law says.  The laws are very clear in regard
to this whole issue that homosexuals should not serve.  What the
directives have done, what the Clinton Administration has done,
is contrary to what the American people have long wanted, and
that is to not allow homosexuals to serve.
<p>
And so I feel very good that Professor Woodruff really drew the line in 
the sand for the American people today, representing not only the American
people but the United States Congress.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Each side says that they are confident that they will be the 
victor.
<p>
REPORTER: Are you going to appeal if you lose?
<p>
LT. THOMASSON:  We're not planning to lose.
<p>
FEMALE:  And that's why I'm very confident that
the government side will win, because the implementing or the
augmenting argument from FRC will be helpful in that regard.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And both sides agree on one thing:  No matter which
way the ruling goes, this pivotal case will move on to the Supreme
Court.
<p>
With us now are two individuals who have been at the forefront
of the battle against homosexuals getting involved in the military
in service.  I would like to welcome Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis, a
policy analyst with the Family Research Council, and Melissa Wells-Petry,
an attorney for Family Research Council who has represented FRC
in several court cases.  Thank you so much for joining us.
<p>
You all were obviously both in Richmond yesterday.  What is so pivotal
about this particular case?  Why does this one matter so much?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, this is the first time an amicus, such
as us, was allowed to argue in federal court to point out the
obvious, that the Clinton Administration is not enforcing the
law that passed Congress back in 1993, and that is ludicrous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I used to actually be a reporter covering the courts.
 I've never seen an outside amicus of any kind be allowed to speak.
 I don't know.  Melissa, you're an attorney.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: It's a very unusual situation.  It does happen, but very 
unusually. And there are a lot of unusual things about this case, not to
mention what you brought up in the beginning, is that essentially
the homosexual activist community and the Clinton Justice Department
are taking a united front, and they are going into court and saying
the policy allows homosexuals to serve.  And, actually, the law
does not allow homosexuals to serve, and it has been our role,
it has fallen to us say, &quot;What part of 'No' don't you 
understand?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, when the law was written, Congress was, in
essence, attempting to make it clear after Bill Clinton came to
office, &quot;You're talking within days of getting here about
gays in the military; we're saying that open homosexual service
is a problem.  Here's the law.&quot;
<p>
Why did it even go this far?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, back in the summer of 1993, President
Clinton, as you showed in your video, announced his policy from
the stage at Fort McNair.  It was don't ask, don't tell.  And
then when the law took effect, the law basically took the longstanding
bar against homosexual service and it just codified it; it made
it a law.  And the distinction between what Clinton said at Fort
McNair and what the law says are really night and day in terms
of who should serve.
<p>
The Clintons have created special classes of homosexuals, those homosexuals 
that will remain, quote, celibate and those homosexuals that engage in what 
homosexuals do. And the law doesn't talk about it.  It says all homosexuals 
are homosexuals.
<p>
I think what you're really seeing here, Kristi, is just a basic
power grab by the Clinton Administration.  Now, it's not the first
time that this administration has tried or actually has put itself
above the law.  But, really, what you are seeing here is you are
seeing a situation where the American people and Congress said,
&quot;No, it is a very bad idea to put homosexuals into the military,&quot;
and the Clinton Administration is so committed, for reasons best
known to itself, to that agenda, to putting homosexuals into the
military, to enlarging the homosexual agenda in our nation, that
now there is this power struggle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And there's a power struggle.  You know, Congress passes 
laws. The President is supposed to faithfully execute them.  If he
doesn't do that, what do we do?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who does?
<p>
Bob, you were in policy at the Pentagon and had a long military 
career as well and worked on the policy of gays in the 
military. Some people are going to say, &quot;There have always been 
homosexuals in the military.  Why not have open homosexual service in the
military?&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No.  Well, Melissa and I were a small group of people 
that essentially did most of the background work on the President's group 
that worked in the Pentagon on that. There are a lot of reasons, and we 
discovered many of those during the course of that six-month study.
<p>
Clearly, there are cohesion reasons.  There are military readiness reasons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, explain cohesion for a second.  I don't think people -- 
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  It is what keeps units working, keeps them
fighting together, trusting.  You know, you have to trust the
person in the foxhole with you, in the tank, in the airplane,
to do the types of things and not to be sexually aroused if you're
the same gender under some pretty intimate types of situations.
<p>
We heard from thousands of people when the Army went out and asked
old soldiers and present-day soldiers, &quot;Tell us, have you
ever had a problem?&quot;  And we heard a lot of problems out
there, current and old problems, about homosexuals that were,
quote, in the closet but were discovered to be doing things that
really undermined the trust and confidence you have to have in
one other.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a fact in particular, isn't
it, when you have someone who is in authority over younger men,
in particular?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And I think it's very important to point
out that the fact, whenever you have a rule, whatever that rule
is, there are a certain number of people who don't abide by it.
 There are a certain number of people who evade it and therefore
don't bring the problems that the rule was designed to address
necessarily into the situation.
<p>
But it's a whole 'nother question to say, What would the military be like 
if we removed that rule totally, took all the brakes off, took all the 
restraints off? You cannot compare an army where a few soldiers are breaking
and evading the rules to an army that has no rules.  So that analogy
just breaks down analytically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have more time to talk later.  But the military 
traditionally has said, We want you to not be sexually active with each other, 
men and women, man and man, however you want to do it.  You have found
that to be disruptive now sometimes even with women in the military.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Very clearly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tell a little bit about why the military says to
the people involved in it, Don't sleep together.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, I can tell you that I did some -- and I can't give 
you details -- but investigations during Operation Desert Storm in
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where we had relationships among soldiers,
some of which were senior, which are the ones I investigated,
which in some cases didn't happen but they were alleged to have
happened, and you go down and you talk to the soldiers that are
under this supervisor, this senior person, and there's a lot of
backbiting, there's a lot of distrust, finger-pointing, and just
morale bottoms out.  They don't trust this person because they
think they're off sleeping with the commander or whatever.
<p>
MS.HAMRICK: Right. Sexual politics.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  It's really a loyalty question.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to get more into that.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We'll hear
more about yesterday's court action, more about these kinds of
sexual politics.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I am joined once again by Bob Maginnis and Melissa 
Wells-Petry, both of whom attended and were active in the recent court case, 
<i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. Welcome back.
<p>
Family Research Council is not my first job. I have been in many 
different work environments where there is sexual harassment, in particular 
one where the boss was sleeping with different women in the office.
<p>
It seems to me simple to understand that the same reason I don't want an 
army that sleeps around is the same reason I don't want that going on in my 
own office or the kind of pressure that -- who gets promoted, the people 
who sleep or don't sleep?  What are you seeing, Melissa?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, it should be simple to understand, especially when we 
feel that way about the normal work environment, and there is absolutely
nothing ordinary about being in the military environment.  This
is an organization that has a sense of togetherness, physical
and emotional, that really has no parallel in the civilian world.
<p>
And when you are talking about the remarkable dynamic of sexuality,
it really begins to involve people's, not only their full attention
but their loyalties.  And inside the armed services, one's loyalties,
every soldier's loyalty must be to the mission, not to some little
intrigue that is going on inside the company.
<p>
That is the seed, that pernicious seed, that begins to flower into what 
Bob said was this breakdown in morale across the board.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What have you seen, Bob, in your experience?  You've done a 
lot of investigation.  When there are homosexuals serving in a unit and
they haven't told per se but there's a knowledge that they are
gay, what is happening?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there is a common knowledge amongst especially the 
young, enlisted soldiers when you have especially, say, a sergeant who 
everybody suspects is gay, but the seniors can't quite catch this person in 
the act, and they won't acknowledge it.  And so it has created a level
of tension which is just -- you could break it like you're breaking
ice.  You know, it just shatters once it is discovered, because
everybody knew it.  But it is terribly devastating.
<p>
Any sexual issue -- because most of what I investigated were sexual issues
for senior officials, and I saw a lot of them -- and, invariably,
you would talk to the people and they would tell you what was
going on and how this was dysfunctional.  It was just like the
coffee(?) talk.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  See, that's what is so artificial about a policy that 
focuses only on when you tell.  That's completely fake, because -- let's face 
it; let's have some common sense here -- the difference between a homosexual 
who is unknown and one who is known, that state of affairs can change in the 
twinkling of an eye.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And that state of affairs is very transient, depending on 
the opportunities presented, the emotional appeal that is involved in a 
situation, and so on. So we are talking about the Clinton Administration basing 
a policy on something that not only is fake but is like ephemeral.  It
goes like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's a trust level, too, isn't it? I mean, basically, we're 
saying I will identify myself by the way in which I will have sex and say that 
I will never have sex. Isn't that what we're asking people to say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we are.  We are essentially --
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, under the Clinton regulations, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Under the Clinton regulations.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: They are asking -- like Thomasson yesterday.  They are 
saying, &quot;Why in the world didn't you ask him whether or not he was
going to remain celibate?&quot;  Now, he didn't say anything about
that in the testimony, but that is essentially the expectation.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  But I always find it amazing that celibacy,
which is frankly out of fashion everywhere in public policy --
you can't get anyone -- in fact, people are suing if you try to
include an abstinence-related protocol in your sex education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And suddenly celibacy is in vogue among homosexuals in 
the military?  You know, in every program that has to do with sex, the last 
thing that they are factoring in is celibacy or abstinence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Our Federal Government just spent $400,000 to do an ad 
campaign that is going to advise you to use condoms.  But in the military, 
apparently, no one is going to have to.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Yes. Oh, yes. Celibacy is in vogue there, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet the military provides pornography to the soldiers and 
homosexual pornography now.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: That is a new development.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think of that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: We checked.  About two weeks ago, we went to the 
Pentagon, and we looked at what pornography was on sale at the Pentagon
bookstore.  Now, there are only nine different books of heterosexual
pornography -- there were some empty spaces, so we assume there's
more -- and there were two for homosexual pornography.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: There were sales at the Fort Myer post exchange for 
homosexual flags and bumper stickers, and so forth, to identify yourself.
<p>
Now, this is under the Clinton Administration policy that says homosexuals 
aren't supposed to be serving, and yet you have, at taxpayer expense 
subsidizing this stuff, no taxes being charged for the sale of it, and it's 
out there.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And, of course, it is broader than just -- I mean, when you 
begin to talk about pornography, you are talking about impacting on
the whole --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The whole sexual climate.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: -- moral and social climate of command.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. This isn't going to go away, and we're going to have 
to have you all back. When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family
Research Council's effort to show that the media does not always
present the facts.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back.
<p>
The Family Research Council's director of cultural studies, Bob Knight, 
has been involved in the media for many years, working at one time for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>. In a 1993 Accuracy in the Media press conference, 
Bob presents some facts regarding the homosexual agenda and how the media 
presents it to the public. Let's take a look at his insight as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
<center><h4>Segment from Accuracy in Media Press Conference<br>
June 1, 1993</h4></center>
<p>
MODERATOR:  Our next speaker and I have something in common.
 We both come, figuratively, out of the belly of the beast.
<p>
Bob Knight was a former editor of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. I 
formerly was a correspondent for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, so we 
know the media from the inside out.
<p>
Bob is now director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council. Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the reason we are here today and here to see the video is 
because the media has been omitting what's really important.  They have
done this on a number of occasions.  But in all my years in journalism,
I never saw an issue treated so dishonestly as I have the gay
issue.  And it is what is omitted that bothers me.
<p>
You know, you can pick up the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington 
Post</i>, and I think the information there is reliable.  But it's what 
they're not telling you that is significant.
<p>
They didn't tell you, for example, that Roberta Achtenberg was an attorney 
for the bath houses in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
In 1984, the Public Health Department tried to close those bath houses
because they knew they were a breeding ground for AIDS and were
taking the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young gay men.
<p>
She was an attorney for a group of bath house patrons and managed
to keep them open.  I think this action may have contributed to
the loss of life of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men.  And
yet the media didn't think that was worthy of reportage.
<p>
Similarly, the way they reported on Roberta Achtenberg's role in 
persecuting the Boy Scouts was curious.  They said that right-wing 
opponents had accused her of punishing the Boy Scouts and being against
the Boy Scouts' policies of excluding homosexual scoutmasters.
<p>
This is full public record.  She has been doing it for years.
 She has made no secret about it.  And yet it is left up to debate
whether she actually did it or not.  It almost seems as if her
critics took it up, and yet there is ample opportunity to document
her attitude on the issue.  That was never done.  It was left
as a cloud.
<p>
I will give you a personal example of media bias.
 When I was at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, somebody had written a 
story about gay cruising in Laguna Beach, California, which is a gay
mecca much like Key West.  The gist of the article was that gays
had changed their cruising methods.  They weren't frequenting
the parks as much.  They weren't hitting the public restrooms
as much, although some still were.
<p>
This story went on for 80 inches, which is typical for an <i>L.A. Times</i> 
story. Our motto used to be, &quot;Get it last, make it long, get it 
right.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, anyway, I got hold of the story.  I was editing it, and I
said, &quot;Wait a second.  You know, in this entire article about
gay cruising, you never mention AIDS once.&quot;  And this was
when AIDS was really taking off.  It was the most obvious topic
in the gay community at the time.
<p>
And I asked the editor, I said, &quot;Why aren't we mentioning AIDS?&quot; 
And he said, &quot;Well, we just didn't think it was relevant.&quot; 
AIDS not relevant to a story on gay cruising and whether there's a change 
in habits? Come on.
<p>
This is why we are here to see this video today.  The
media has been systematically excluding information about the
homosexual lifestyle, about the politics surrounding the issues,
about almost everything associated with the issue.
<p>
Another prime example would be the idea that gays are born that way, that 
there are genetic studies that indicate that you are born gay and there's
nothing you can do about it.  The latest study that was touted
was in the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i>. It was by two 
researchers, Drs. Bailey and Pillard(?), and they had done a study of male
twins previously.
<p>
I remember the <i>Washington Post</i> headline.  It
was something on the order of &quot;Study Indicates Lesbianism
Has Genetic Origin.&quot;  What they didn't report was in the
very same edition of the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> was an
article that reviewed all the current literature on the issue
by two doctors and psychiatrists, and they concluded:  &quot;At
present, there is no evidence to substantiate a biologic theory
of homosexuality.&quot;
<p>
Further, they said, &quot;Efforts to do so seem to be more driven by lack 
of satisfaction with the current psychosocial explanations than anything 
else. There is no new medical evidence that is solid to suggest that it is 
biological.&quot;
<p>
But this is typical.  An authoritative article goes unnoticed;
one that supports part of the gay agenda gets heavily publicized.
<p>
What you are about to see on this video is what did not get publicized
in Washington.  I have heard people in the media try to say that
what you see on the video is just on the fringes of the march,
that it really didn't represent what went on that day.  But we
had people out there.  They were all over the mall, and they said
this stuff happened everywhere.  If you were in Washington that
day with your kids, you couldn't avoid seeing obscene acts committed,
anti-religious imagery, topless lesbians, any number of bizarre
sights that were carefully hidden from the major network shows
and from major print media.
<p>
So I think the report, that group out of California that did such a fine 
job with their first gayagenda film and their second, which deals with the 
homosexual agenda in education, have done -- if anything, they have surpassed
themselves.  This is a dispassionate look at what really occurred
that day in Washington.  It deserves to be viewed by every American
so they know exactly what the homosexual agenda is about.
<p>
Thank you very much.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're talking about an issue which has touched each and every 
one of us:  divorce.  As rampant as divorce is across the nation, it is a 
topic that is rarely discussed, perhaps because of the emotional chord of 
regret, heartbreak, and disillusionment it strikes.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> confronts divorce head-on.  We're going to ask, 
What impact has it had on society?  Why has there been such a drastic rise 
in the divorce rate over the past three decades?  And, most importantly, is 
there a way to curb this damaging cycle of family breakdown?
<p>
First, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
Assistant to the President for Government Relations.  After years
of working on Capitol Hill, Marty provides a unique and insightful
look into issues before Congress which affect our nation.
<p>
I had the chance to discuss some of the most current Hill wars with
Marty, so let's see what he has to say, without media editing,
as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today with Marty.  Thank you
so much for joining us.  Marty works on Capitol Hill for the Family
Research Council.  And this last session of Congress was historic,
because for the first time since 1973, we saw an actual limitation
on abortion -- not all the way through yet -- the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.
<p>
Marty, what has it said about Congress today that they are looking at 
banning a procedure that might end a child's life when they are pulled 
into the birth canal and killed moments from birth?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think that this issue was chosen very strategically, 
and it was a very good decision to use legislation like this that focused 
on a particular procedure and forced people to deal with the reality of 
abortion. So many times in the past, the pro-abortion side has been able to 
engage the argument on cliches, and so on, of keeping the government
out and that sort of thing, and not focusing on the child.
<p>
So it is very important that people understand what is going on,
and as you pointed out, most people don't realize that late-term
abortions are a reality.  They believe that they are only in the
first three months and even only for hard cases -- life of the
mother, rape, incest, perhaps a few other hard cases -- and it
is much broader than that.
<p>
This bill is going to land on the President's desk, and the indications 
are that he will veto it.  But it will help to point out that he does have 
a very extreme position that is in line with the most extreme advocates of 
abortion on demand in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that will hurt the President if he vetoes 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think it will.  I think he is probably falling
back on his friends at the major networks to try to put the best
spin on it, and he will say that there wasn't the appropriate
health exception, and of course, we all know that the health exception
they're talking about is a license for abortion on demand.  It's
a definition of health that encompasses any possible social or
psychological circumstance.
<p>
But the President will try to project that he's just so concerned about 
women's health and that he signed such a law in Arkansas, and if only 
that could have been there, he would have signed it, but in fact, his 
allies all know that that was a gutting amendment which the Senate defeated, 
and it remains to be seen.
<p>
I think the grassroots pro-family and pro-life movement know that that is 
extreme, and they are really catching on and getting the word out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that the best thing that happened in the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act debate was that we talked about what's 
actually happening in abortion clinics.  What do you think the take-home 
message is for pro-life Americans as they have seen some success, even
if the President does veto it?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think that the educational issues are very important, 
that it is important to talk directly about the issue, let people understand 
what the realities are, and to use this legislation as a focal point to
show that the license for abortion in this country is so broad
and so extreme that it really needs to be addressed.
<p>
It is an uncomfortable issue for many people.  They would rather not deal
with it.  But this is the type of issue that causes them to take
a second look.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of attention on Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
on his high negatives, on possible ethics problems.  Is his persona going to 
be a problem for Republicans as they are dealing with the budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think it is causing some problems in that it really 
has emboldened the Democrats.  They feel that they have him on the
run a bit, and that once they start digging into even this limited
ethics probe that is now in place, that it might open the door
for a wider probe.
<p>
I think they do have to be careful, though, if they start down this 
road and seem obsessed with this, that their candidates are not talking about 
the issues; that it could have a backlash.  But right now it does seem to 
have energized them, and some of the comments, particularly the reference to
the treatment on the airplane back from Israel and how that might
have impacted on decisions regarding the budget, have been unfortunate
and probably overstated.  I don't think that that really had anything
to do with the decisions on how that budget was handled.  I think
that was the way things were going anyhow, but it is unfortunate
that the Democrats and some of the media had an opportunity to
cast it in those terms:  He shut down the government because he
was mad at the President type of argument.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Representative Enid Waldholtz, a Republican of Utah, is sort 
of struggling with her own values issue right now.  Her husband is going to 
be indicted, and she came forward recently and said, &quot;I'm innocent and
I'm not going to resign my seat.&quot;  What impact do you think
that is going to have on what is going on now?  Any at all? Is
this bad for the GOP or is this just bad for Representative Waldholtz
personally?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, it is certainly problematic for her personally. 
There are some out there now who are starting to make the charge, &quot;Well, 
look at these hypocrites. These were the family values candidates, and 
they're hypocrites.  Some of them have had troubled marriages, there are a 
few divorces, and in one case the spouse of one of the members admitted to 
being unfaithful.  And yet they are trying to say that this somehow
suggests that there's a values problem for that member of Congress.&quot;
<p>
So these are very curious charges, and what people stand for is
not really related to perhaps potential failings of a few members.
 You have to look at the broader issues.
<p>
The same people who are trying to zero in on this are trying to ignore some 
of the other issues that the Senate Banking Committee is now looking at 
and gross inconsistencies in who knew what about Whitewater and related
issues, and many of the people in the press who are looking at
every little iota they can find about Newt Gingrich are very anxious
to avoid the issues of who might have obstructed an investigation
of wrongdoing, and so on, within the administration.  So there
is a double standard that has been there for a long time, and
this continues to be a problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, we appreciate taking your time from up on the Hill. 
Thanks so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill 
Mattox, Vice President for Policy at Family Research Council. He will 
bring us his perspective on divorce and how it will affect almost 1 million 
children this year.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[From marriage ceremony segment]:
<p>
MINISTER:  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder, and
you may now kiss your bride.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Today, when people think of marriage, all too often the next 
word that comes to mind is divorce.  The 50 percent divorce number comes 
from a yearly comparison of the number of new marriages to the number of 
divorces. Overall numbers are not as bleak.  The fact is that one-quarter
of all those who have ever been married will also be divorced.
<p>
Still, divorce links all American lives because, directly or indirectly,
we have all been affected by it.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents got divorced when I was real young.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents were divorced when I was 10 months old.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, the prevalence of divorce may be the factor which creates 
the acceptance and understanding of this phenomenon, one which leads
to an increase in child abuse, juvenile crime, sexual promiscuity,
teen male suicide, and even more broken homes.
<p>
Divorce, amazingly enough, also increases one's chances of health problems. 
The <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> found that either the breakup
of one's marriage or the divorce of one's parents significantly
reduces the average lifespan.  Divorced men who don't smoke have
only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than those who
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
Considering how divorce negatively impacts so many lives, it is interesting -- 
and disheartening -- that the divorce rate has tripled over the last 30 years.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: I just think it's a product of our society in general.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE:  I think there's a lack of commitment, that
marriages are easier to get out of, and there's just not the commitment
to the family that there used to be.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But, as the people who have watched the breakup of their own 
homes or the homes of loved ones can tell you, it's not easy to save a 
marriage. There are no easy solutions to this epidemic problem.  But the
research agrees with those who have struggled through:  it is
worth the effort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy with 
Family Research Council.  Bill has been examining the divorce issue for years 
and has been widely published on the subject of divorce effects on the very 
young, seen not too long ago in the tragic suicide death of singer Kurt
Cobain.
<p>
Bill, welcome.  Thanks for being with us again on <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
You have been tracking the impact of divorce for a long
time.  What kinds of trends are you seeing, especially over the
last 30 years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, in terms of the actual prevalence of divorce, the 
divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has kind of plateaued since that time. 
We have seen a slight decrease since that time in the number of divorces 
in each year.  But it is still a very, very serious problem, and especially 
when you look at this from a historical standpoint, comparing the prevalence 
of divorce today to two or three generations ago.  Many, many more people 
are affected today; many more children are affected today than ever before.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When a lot of the movie industry in the 1960s and
1970s very much glamorized divorce and glamorized let's get out
and be all that we can be, and now we've kind of seen what we
are in divorce.  What impacts happen to the people who actually
divorce?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, you know, this is really one of the
most interesting things about this subject, though it is a sad
note, is that if you talk to a lot of that 20-something generation,
those kids 18 to 30 years old that we have been polling in several
of our public opinion surveys, you find that concern about this
issue is greater among that group than among older Americans,
and I think part of it is because many of them have grown up in
an era where divorce was commonplace, where it was at one point
glamorized.
<p>
And yet they have seen the negative fallout and have experienced 
that firsthand, either in their own lives or perhaps in observing 
the lives of their friends.  And it is not a difficult thing to 
convince them that this is a serious problem and one that really 
ought to be addressed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think one thing that I found interesting.  Family Research 
Council is getting ready, under your leadership, to do a state-by-state 
divorce stats release -- it is going to be coming soon -- that, state by 
state, the statistics are different.  What did you see in that?  I found
that very fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting that there are some significant differences 
between different states and, indeed, different regions of the country.  Oddly 
enough, you can reasonably predict the divorce rate in any part of the country
by knowing the number of days out of the year that a woman can
wear a bathing suit.  Now, I am not suggesting that there is a
correlation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, my goodness!
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But, basically, if you think of the sunbelt region, which 
includes, of course, the Bible belt, what you find is that divorce rates
in that part of the country are dramatically higher than in the
Midwest and Northeast.  The mountain states in the Far West tend
to have higher divorce rates, as well.
<p>
There are some important reasons for this.  One is that divorce rates among 
Catholics, Jews, and Mormons tend to be significantly lower than among 
Protestants, and so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And they're in the northern regions.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Especially in the Northeast and Midwest, you have
a high Catholic population.  So part of the reason why you have
higher levels of divorce in the Bible belt than in, say, states
like Massachusetts -- I mean, get this.  Teddy Kennedy's home
state is number one in marital stability, and Donald Trump's,
New York, is tied for second.  Who would have ever thought it?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the prevalence of a Catholic population is a major 
predictor here.
<p>
But perhaps an even more significant predictor of differences in divorce 
by state is the degree of social integration; that is, how rooted are the 
people living there in a larger community.  And what you find is that in 
areas of the Northeast and Midwest where you have had families that 
have lived in this area, in this neighborhood, for years and years and 
years, the communities are more stable. When couples go to marry, their 
families know each other.  There is a wide circle of people who can advise 
them about whether or not they're compatible and also a wide circle of people 
who can hold them accountable, to say, &quot;Look, we're counting on you
to make this marriage work.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: When you see marriages in less stable areas, more transient 
areas --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Like Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles, or commuter
towns.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Exactly.  What you have -- a lot of military
towns see this quite dramatically -- what you have, then, is situations
where people are quite often marrying without knowing a lot about
each other.  They quite often have dissimilar backgrounds, and
they do not have the community surrounding them to both advise
them and hold them accountable, which is so critically important.
<p>
And, indeed, this is, I think, one of the very important functions
that churches should be providing and, indeed, in some areas are
serving to provide, because we know that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: More counseling, more accountability -
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A discussion of what you're getting into.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right, because of the one things that we do know that
is rather encouraging in terms of the relationship between religion
and divorce is that those who attend church on a weekly or even
more frequent basis have dramatically lower divorce than do those
who attend less frequently or not at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Let's go through just a couple of quick things on that. 
There were an interesting series of dynamics on, if these things are in 
your life, you are less likely to divorce.  What are a couple -- five,
ten -- things that you see with that?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, sadly, even though a lot of young people who have gone 
through the divorce of their parents are worried about this, quite often 
they are at higher risk of divorcing themselves, partly because they 
haven't seen good role models in their own home.  And again, this is why
the role of the community is so important, and the role of churches,
to model good marriages, so that those who haven't seen it at
home can at least know what it is that they are striving for.
That's a significant predictor.
<p>
The age at which one marries often has a significant effect. The younger --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We were talking about this the other day.  So the 
50-year-olds and the 18-year-olds, they've got different sets of resources.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.  Those who marry in their teens are
at greater risk, in part because the maturing process has not
quite often taken full root, and so the marriages are more fragile.
<p>
Generally speaking, if you can make it through that first eight-year
period, that is when most divorces occur, is during the first
eight years of marriage.  There is also, then, a kind of upturn
when men and women hit mid-life crisis in their forties and whatnot.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But if couples can make it through those kind of critical 
early years, then the chances of long-term success are much, much greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I think what was interesting -- now, obviously, I just 
want to state Family Research Council would not want a battered woman or 
someone in a domestic violence situation to continue to be injured.  We 
are talking about marriage-strengthening patterns and things that
are generally true.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Oh, no question, and I think this is a very, very important 
point. If you look at public opinion data about adults, say, a year, two 
years, three years after the divorce has occurred, quite often what you find 
are folks who have very serious regrets, who believed that -- they believed
this lie, that divorce was going to be liberating; it was going
to make their lives easier.
<p>
And yet what they discover is that quite often they have merely exchanged 
one set of problems for another.  And many of them, at that one, two, three 
years out point are saying, &quot;Gee, we wish we had tried harder.  We
wish that we had given it a better shot, because maybe we could
have worked something out.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, as a person who married later, I can definitely say dating 
can be not all it's cracked up to be.
<p>
But marriage provides a lot of benefits that I was not aware of.  We were 
looking at the video piece. Health benefits. What are some of the 
surprising collateral benefits of marriage?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting, and I guess the important point there to make, 
as well, is that the health benefits, though they are present for both men and 
women, they are especially present for men.  Men benefit significantly from
marriage in any number of different ways.
<p>
As you pointed out, there is a lower correlation for things like lung cancer 
as well as stomach cancer, less alcoholism, less depression -- all sorts
of health benefits that are associated with stable marriage. 
And it comes in part from the fact that they've got someone to
help encourage them to adopt good health patterns, to regulate
their diet, to encourage them to exercise, that kind of thing.
<p>
And there is a certain stability that comes into their lives that
isn't always present in cases where one is living alone, especially
if they are still dealing with the emotional fallout of a divorce
or a painful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it is funny. I saw Zig Ziegler speak, a motivational 
speaker, business leader, talking about how men who were kissed on their way 
to work made more money than men who were not, which was an interesting 
statistic.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But I appreciate your being with us, Bill, and I would
encourage people to call Family Research Council for more data
on this.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss divorce.  We will talk to some people who are practically
examining this issue state by state, and we will examine some
proposed changes in legislation which discourage an &quot;easy
out&quot; of marriage.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would now like to 
welcome Larry Huff, Director of State and Local Affairs for the Family 
Research Council; and two individuals with whom Larry works closely:  Randy
Hekman, Executive Director of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis
Mansfield, Executive Director of the Idaho Family Forum.  Gentlemen,
welcome.
<p>
Randy, you have had an interesting career.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: That's true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You have been a judge, a father of nine, lots of --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Not nine, just 12.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Just 12!
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We've got to get that number right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gosh, I demoted you.  I have to -- and as a judge, what
can you tell us about how no-fault divorce has affected us as
a culture?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, as we've already heard from Bill Mattox, it has 
impacted lives, certainly mothers' and fathers', but especially kids'. 
Seventy percent of children that are currently in juvenile facilities 
today have come from broken homes.  In fact, most of the people that a 
juvenile court judge -- and that was the kind of judge I was for 15 
years -- are from families where there has been divorce, or no marriage 
in the first place, but most of them divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
And you are in Idaho; you are in Michigan.  What prompted you all to say, 
&quot;Divorce reform is something we're going to take on&quot;?  Because 
it is certainly not the thing that is on the top of a lot of people's
lists.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  It really isn't.  In fact, if you were
to go through most of the state legislatures, you'd find that
most people would look at you, and they would say, &quot;Well,
why do you want to get rid of no-fault divorce?  Why do you even
want to engage in the debate over this?  It seems like you're
looking for an issue.&quot;  And that has not been the case.
<p>
We think the issue is already out there.  It's on every street corner,
it's in every broken family, it's in every bottle of booze; that
there's a divorce that is sort of divorcing, in a sense, the physical
from the spiritual across our culture, and it's happening family
by family.
<p>
So our thought was, if we were really to deal with the social ills 
that are involved in Idaho, which is a very conservative,
very pro-family kind of state that still is seventh in divorce,
along with Alabama, then we'd better engage in the debate now
and in essence be a point person on it.  So that's why we jumped
in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you seeing nationally, Larry?  Family
Research Council is taking on a divorce reform project.  But why?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it is largely due, Kristi, to the fact that
there is just a recognition across the country increasing that
families who stay together are a model for a prosperous society
and virtuous society, and that that is the model that works, and
a recognition that with the breakdown of families comes the breakdown
of America, and it's beginning to impact more and more lives,
and when things impact us personally, I think it moves us to want
to make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to ask you all, a lot of people, they think, 
Yeah, divorce is bad.  Okay, what are we going to do about it?  Okay, 
try harder.
<p>
But you all are doing some things, some real things, to change how 
divorce works in America.  Please describe that.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You see, back in the late 1960s, early 1970s, folks thought, 
well, you know, there is such acrimony in our courtrooms, and we have such 
a problem with divorce.  People are showing up.  They want to get a divorce,
and one of them has to pretend that they've been wrong or done
some sort of faults.  Let's eliminate that charade.  Let's just
have no-fault divorce, which means that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But they had to do that why?  Because you couldn't get a 
divorce --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You couldn't get a divorce without showing some
fault.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  So the husband or the wife would admit to fault. They said, 
&quot;Let's do away with that.&quot;
<p>
Well, we now have no-fault divorce, which means that either party can get 
a divorce from the other party for any reason at any time. What that means 
is that it is legally easier for a person to divorce their spouse, even if 
they've been married for 20 years, than it is to fire someone that you hired 
last week. There is no legal way to stop that party from leaving.
<p>
The net result has been significant injustice for parties.  It has resulted
in women, particularly, losing major economic strength.  In fact,
one study shows that women lost like 72 percent of their income
following divorces.
<p>
No-fault divorce actually also hurts existing marriages. You don't 
really want to invest in something unless you feel that it is going to 
be worth my investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But you can't hold onto your spouse. They can turn away and 
walk away for any reason at any time. Why invest in that marriage? 
As a result, existing marriages are hurt through no-fault divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how will we change that?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, we're hoping in Michigan -- in fact, there is a
bill in the legislature in Michigan -- and our hope would be that
early next year we are going to see the first state in the Union
to reverse no-fault divorce.
<p>
What it would do, it would allow divorce based on mutual consent; that if 
both parties truly want the divorce, fine.  But if only one wants it -- the 
husband wants out so he can marry a new model, for example -- he can't just
walk away and get that divorce automatically.  He will have to
prove fault against that spouse of his or else get that spouse
to agree, and for both of them to agree, and basically, there
is going to be a financial transaction at that point to get --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: And that's the way it ought to be.  The man that deserts the 
person that he has committed his life to and the children that they have 
spawned through that relationship, it seems to me that he ought to own up to 
that commitment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So we are talking about a two-tier system.  If we
both agree, we both sign out, we're out.  If we don't agree, then
there's going to be some money changing hands.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, if they don't agree, there is going to have to be a showing 
of fault under those circumstances.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would shy away from calling it a two-tier system.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would say, more importantly, that it
is the logical consequence of a covenant relationship; that we
have covenanted together to be one, and we're going to march ahead,
and if you want out, well, you know what?  There's a price for
everything, and that price may be that you just don't have an
easy out, whether it's the husband or the wife that leaves.
<p>
And in fact, what we're doing in Idaho is we're watching Michigan,
and we're hoping that, depending upon the movement of the governor
and the legislature in this, that would see Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, and other states come up, but we are definitely ready
to roll on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So there are a lot of states watching what is 
happening there?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, there are other settlement formulas that are out there, 
aren't there, Larry, some saying that if there is a divorce that 
children's standard of living cannot change?  What are some of the other
options that people are looking at in a divorce formula?
<p>
MR. HUFF: There are a lot of disincentives built into divorce in 
different fashions, and what we found is that actually a lot of those end
up trying to reform marriage laws instead of reforming divorce
laws, and creating different types of marriages and this kind
of thing, and giving the courts a lot of latitude dealing with
what happens to the kids, and some of that is positive and some
of it is not.  But what we really want to focus on again is instituting
justice back into the divorce laws.
<p>
The number one product of government should be to produce justice, and that 
is just not happening in our divorce laws.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what does the opposition say? It sounds reasonable.  You 
know, divorce is the number one impoverisher of women and children.  So why 
would I not be in favor of this?  And I'm sure you're not going to tell
me that your whole legislature is saying, &quot;Yes, let me sign.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, a lot of them are.  Frankly, legislation doesn't
happen -- with all the possible things to enact into law, legislation,
even if there is general agreement, doesn't happen unless the
heat is turned up a little bit and the public seems to want it.
<p>
Frankly, the biggest obstacle is the public is just getting aware
of what this issue is, and so part of our job is to inform the
public, and the media has been helping us in Michigan to do that,
and I'm grateful for this program to do the same.
<p>
But the only opposition that we have seen, frankly, has been a number of 
family lawyers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They are earning their keep with no-fault divorce, and they may 
have some concern that if things change, maybe they'll have a hard time 
earning their keep.
<p>
It is interesting that back when the law changed in 1972 from fault to 
no-fault, the lawyers opposed that change, as well.
<p>
Interesting -- the feminists -- there are many feminists,
believe it or not, who favor a return to more of a fault system,
because women typically -- again, men get really beat up by no-fault
divorce as well, but a lot of women do, especially those that
have custody of the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And get exchanged for the trophy wives.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That's right, and they end up -- no-fault divorce says, Hey, 
we're just going to be even split, everything right down the middle.  But 
the typical woman earns 75 cents on the dollar for every man, and so 
following that divorce, that is why women's income plummets, typically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the man's generally goes up, I think, what, 40 percent?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, that's one study.  I've seen other studies suggest
that it's even or it may even go down a little.  Nobody really
wins big time through divorce; few people do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right. But nobody gets hurt like the children.
<p>
MR. HUFF: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk a little bit more about
that in just a moment and, Dennis, hear more about what is happening
in your state, as well.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i> following this commercial break. We will hear more about 
the tragedy of divorce, both nationwide and state by state. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we're talking about divorce and the 
crippling effect it has on individuals, as a nation and as a whole.
<p>
I am joined once again by Larry Huff from the Family Research Council, 
Randy Hekman of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis Mansfield of the
Idaho Family Forum.  Welcome back.
<p>
Larry, when we're taking a look at divorce, it's hard not to look at 
children. It's not just about a man and a woman.  There are, a lot of 
times other, other people involved.
<p>
What have you seen when it comes to divorce reform?  Are children going to 
be better off?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, we think they will, Kristi, because, as you mentioned, in 
the wake of these breeches often lie kids with broken hearts, and
the opponents of moving back to a system that requires more justice,
these opponents say, &quot;You know, if you do this, you are going
to reinstitute bitterness and acrimony back in the process.&quot;
<p>
I think that's just really a naive view, because when people get
divorced, unfortunately, there's going to be bitterness there,
and what we have now is that bitterness is transferred to the
custody battles, and in those custody battles the kids are often
the ones that just really get hurt and get caught in the vise
between this acrimony that is there between the parents.
<p>
And so we believe that settling this issue at the beginning of the 
divorce proceedings will really take some of the pressure, at least in
the divorce process, off of the kids.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a fault system, will the parent found at fault have 
fewer, perhaps, privileges in terms of the children?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  I really think that changing it more back to a fault system 
will actually give more clout to the more innocent party.  See, under 
current law -- just think through with me for a minute -- under the current 
law, where you can leave your spouse at any time -- let's take a classical 
example. The man does leave his wife and children that he has been married
to, say, for 15 years.
<p>
Right now, she is required to negotiate with him. He already has what he 
wants, which is the divorce. And so she needs to come to him and say, 
&quot;Look, if I can't have you and the family back together, at least give 
me the house, enough money to survive this experience, and custody of the 
kids.&quot;
<p>
And he could come back to her and say, &quot;Hey, look.  Don't
push me too hard or I'll go for custody of the kids.&quot;  And
I have seen illustrations of that in real life.
<p>
If we change the law like we're hoping to do in Michigan, he does not 
automatically get the divorce he wants.  He will be required to negotiate 
with her.  And again, she can say, &quot;Look, if I can't again have
the family together, at least give me these three things.&quot;
 He will have to pay a higher price, you might say, to get out
of the commitments he has made.  And that's justice.  That's the
way it ought to be done.
<p>
Now, let's not sound sexist here.  Often -- in fact, I have some 
illustrations where men come home from work and are aghast.  Their wife, 
their children are gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. It happens.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  The divorce has been filed.  Next thing they know, they're 
obligated to be paying child support.  Wife is now living with her boyfriend 
with the kids, and he has to subsidize it and gets to visit with his kids at
McDonald's every other week.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's sad out there, especially for people who don't want 
the divorce.  What if you don't want a divorce?  Can this change result in no 
divorce?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think what it really does, it results in the opportunity
for discussion, because right now, when that spouse leaves and
the divorce papers are sitting there on the table and the husband
comes in from a camping trip and his kids are gone or the wife
comes -- there is no discussion.  You know, that decision has
been made.  They're out the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: What we're hoping for is that there's an opportunity to 
come back to not necessarily a rekindling of that spark that happened
but at least civil discussion that may ultimately lead to reconciliation.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You know, it could be done, though.  There's a group
called Retrovive(?), which is a Catholic-oriented group.  These
consist of folks who have been to the brink of divorce.  Many
of them have been through divorce and have worked themselves back
together, the word &quot;rekindling.&quot;  I mean, they have
rekindled the relationship; they are more in love now than they
have ever been.
<p>
They then mentor other couples whose marriages are on the ropes, and 
they have an 80 to 90 percent cure rate, believe it or not.  That is an 
amazing --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a phenomenal --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they're around the country. It's a big group.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  And even those that aren't in an official capacity -- my wife 
and I have poured ourselves into two families, one that was divorced for nine 
years, the husband and the wife.  They remarried and they have had now five 
years of marriage that has been outstanding.
<p>
Another that was separated, husband and wife, for a year and a half.  We met 
them through a series of Providential occurrences, acted as agents to bring
them back together.  They've been married now for two and a half
years.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Great.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the things that we have seen here at Family Research 
Council looking at the data is partnering troubled couples with healthy 
couples --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that that is a tremendously successful thing to do. And 
there have been even discussions of requiring some counseling in a 
no-fault/fault situation. Is there consensus for that, Larry, on a 
national level?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For requiring counseling?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes.  There are a number of states introducing divorce reforms 
of all types, and the most popular divorce reform is to require counseling 
both on the front end and what they call so-called reality therapy for 
those who want to divorce.  Before you get a divorce, you just need to 
understand some of the implications.
<p>
The one caveat that I think we all have a consensus on is that we want 
that to be done -- we think it is a good thing to provide it, as long as 
it is done by people who are in the business of counseling; that is to say, 
private-practice people, the church, people like that, not government 
counseling. We don't think government counseling is the proper solution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The government's good at taking your money,
but saving your marriage?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  No, not good.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  It's just not under their purview; it is just not a
positive thing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And wouldn't there need to be a bias in favor of saving 
the marriage?  I think one thing I am concerned about is, in the 1970s and 
1980s, there was a bias toward counseling to get out.  You know, &quot;You're 
right; you're stressed.&quot;
<p>
MR. HUFF: Self-actualization.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.  Really, no-fault divorce has that same bias.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We give all the legal clout to the party
that wants to break the relationship now and no legal clout to
the party that wants to preserve the relationship. It shouldn't
be that way.  If marriage is that important to our culture, which
it is, if anything, the presumption should go the other way. 
We need to change that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think it takes too much to the therapeutic 
state of mind that we would require counseling? Are you at all 
concerned about that, that we're a little -- are we headed into 
psychobabble land?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  Well, no, I don't think that's the case, but I do think 
that it goes back to the issue of communication.  For example, we were 
talking earlier about communities who have made a decision in our clergy 
to come together and say, &quot;This is our basic understanding of the
covenant of marriage.  Let's have counseling before marriage.
 Let's have counseling before a divorce.&quot;
<p>
What these covenants have been -- in fact, I think the entire state of 
Michigan may ultimately move towards that.  Isn't that right, Randy?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They're looking at it, yes.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  In fact, the clergy are coming down there and saying, 
&quot;Look, you cant' leave me, as a Methodist, move over to that guy who 
is a Presbyterian and get married without going through this type of 
pre-marriage counseling.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That is not legislatively induced.
MR. MANSFIELD: No.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they've done it in communities -- Peoria, Illinois; 
Modesto, California; Louisville, Kentucky; certain communities -- all 
the religious leaders of all denominations have come together and said, 
&quot;Look, we can agree on two things. We think marriage is great; we 
think divorce is bad.&quot;  And so let's just commit that we will not 
intentionally marry someone in our churches, our synagogues, whatever, 
unless these folks have first gone through four months of premarital 
counseling, mentoring with an experienced married couple, some premarital
testing, maybe some conflict resolution discussion.
<p>
It has been amazing how the numbers of divorces, like in Peoria, have 
gone down 20 percent from the year they instituted this, and stayed
at a lower level, and in other communities that have done it.
 We're thinking of doing that for the whole state of Michigan,
by the way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But again, totally outside of the legislative control.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There has to be that private-public partnering.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  We really view it as two rails on a road that brings the 
locomotive of our culture down in a quick way.  One is law, one is culture. 
Our belief is that if we can help encourage the clergy to realize that those
two things are true -- marriage is good and divorce is bad - 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: -- and then have accountability with it, the locomotive that 
we have sort of attached our culture to can have a smooth trip.
<p.
Right now, I am telling you, there are all sorts of curves and problems up 
ahead, and we've got to take a leadership position.  Quite frankly, the 
legislative leaders and federal leaders are not even talking about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: No, they're not.  And I was wondering, Larry, on a state 
level, are there some states that are not interested in this at all?
 I mean, you look at a state like Nevada.  They make a lot of
money from the divorce machine.  I mean, they practically advertise
it.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Well, it is easier to get a divorce in Nevada than
in any other state in the Union, and the divorce rate in Nevada
is higher than any other state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: An interesting connection.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes, there is a nexus there. And, yes, I think that we have a 
ways to go in shaping a consensus that justice needs to be reinstituted. 
I mean, some folks still are just not interested.  But again, I think there 
is an awakening, and I think folks are beginning to perk up and say, 
&quot;Wait a minute.  We have a responsibility here.&quot;
<p>
I mean, again, healthy marriages are the basis of civilization, and it has 
been so for centuries, and just a recognition that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is &quot;justice&quot; the word for it?  Is that the 
phrase that you are taking forward?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it really is. Yes, it is.  I mean, again, we want people 
to recognize their duty and their responsibility, and the law is a teacher, 
and the purpose and the product of law should be justice, and that's what
we must reinstitute into the divorce process.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That seems to have been almost the unspoken thing, that the law 
became the enemy of marriage rather than the advocate of it.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think you're right.  Also, I think that in what Larry has 
talked about regarding justice, that needs to be the point of discussion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about this.  When
we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family Research Council's
efforts to shed some light on an interesting and possibly criminal
issue related to the famous Kinsey sex reports.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight, has been 
investigating the famous Kinsey reports and, with the supportive work from 
Dr. Judith Reisman, wrote and produced a documentary which provides shocking 
evidence that the Kinsey Institute could have ben involved in the sexual 
abuse of children as part of the famous Kinsey human sexuality studies.
<p>
Just last week, Bob was asked to participate in a news conference called
by Congressman Steve Stockman.  It was an attempt to spur the
government to further investigate those possible criminal allegations
involving Dr. Kinsey or other sex researchers working with him.
<p>
Let's take a look at Robert Knight's insights as <i>Straight Talk</i>
brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From a press conference held December 7, 1995, on the Child 
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995]:
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE STOCKMAN: Today we are going to be dropping a bill that 
asks that Congress to look into whether there was any violation of the 
law regarding a study by Kinsey.
<p>
I as a public servant have no greater duty to this country than to protect 
the most innocent, and that's the children.
<p>
We are not accusing anybody at this point of anything. We are asking 
merely that we look into the study to see if there was any criminal 
activity.
<p>
What I as a government official would like to do is to find out if the 
government was involved in molesting or manipulating poor, young children for 
the benefit of so-called pseudoscience.
<p>
We are not here to ask for anything more than to look into whether criminal 
activity may have been taking place.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Hi.  I'm Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies
for the Family Research Council, and I'm writer and director of
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>, which is a half-hour documentary video
that we just released that exposes the use of children in these
sexual experiments.
<p>
It is founded on the work of Dr. Judith Reisman, who has been courageously 
trying to uncover this mystery for more than 15 years, or about 15 years. 
I mean, talk about tenacity. Dr. Reisman has been at it for more than a decade, 
and she has been ignored.  The scientific establishment has chosen not to
take up her case, and it is time they did so.
<p>
This bill, the Children Protection and Ethics in Education Act, merely asks 
Congress to let some light into the Kinsey Institute and try to determine
what happened to these children about 50 years ago in Alfred Kinsey's
famous sex studies.  He has clear tables of data revealing systematic
molestation of children.
<p>
Most recently, because of statements made by Dr. John Bancroft, current 
director of the Kinsey Institute, we have reason to believe that what Dr. 
Kinsey wrote and what the current Kinsey Institute is saying are quite at 
odds. At the very least, we have a scandal of accuracy, and at worst, we
have a scandal of criminal molestation of children in the name
of science.
<p>
We are asking Congress -- and we commend Representative Stockman, who 
is bringing this forward, along with 41 of his colleagues -- to do 
something that should have been done years ago.  Dr. Reisman pointed it 
out, that there really is no statute of limitations on crimes of this 
magnitude.  The Nuremberg laws were clear. You can't sweep something 
under the carpet for 50 years and hope it stays there.  The truth 
eventually will come out.
<p>
We have high hopes that with Congress now opening the door, and perhaps 
with some cooperation from the Kinsey Institute, we can get to the
bottom of this.  I have more hope for that than I did before,
because Dr. Bancroft broke silence on the topic.
<p>
I just mentioned earlier that he said there was a problem with the data. 
Specifically, Dr. Kinsey wrote that there were nine pedophiles who 
collected the data on the children.  Dr. Bancroft now says there was one
elderly pedophile, now dead, whose name he refuses to reveal.
<p>
We are asking Dr. Bancroft to come out with this man's name. 
Surely, if you can uncover priests molesting children, oh, 10
years ago, 20 years ago, you can uncover the name of a guy who
was supposedly responsible for much of this research 50 years
ago.
<p>
It may lead to the unraveling of the mystery.  It may tell
us how the children were obtained for the experiments, where they
got them, whether parents gave permission, where the children
are now, which ones of the children are in need of care.  This
is a traumatic experience these children went through if in fact
the data is accurate in these tables.
<p>
So Family Research Council commends Representative Stockman, Dr. Reisman, 
and everybody who is trying to get to the bottom of this, and we wish for 
a speedy resolution of this problem.
<p>
Thank you.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
One week ago today, the most exceptional minds on welfare policy and 
the most successful front-line workers met together for the Family 
Research Council's &quot;A World Without Welfare Symposium.&quot;  The 
purpose of this extraordinary event, put together by FRC policy analysts 
Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, was to talk about a world without 
the failed safety net of government but with the loving support of a 
dependable community. If you have ever asked yourself, &quot;Is there a way 
to help people really do better?&quot; please stayed tuned.
<p>
But first, let me share with you an insightful conversation I had with one
of the key symposium speakers, Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Dr. Gulker
is the founder and president of Kids/Hope/USA, which is a revolutionary
volunteer service model that helps people get involved in the
lives of needy children and families.  He has also authored several
books about real volunteerism, written from hard experience after
founding Love, Inc., an international network of over 300,000
church volunteers.
<p>
Let's hear Dr. Gulker's perspective on one-on-one support rather than 
anonymous welfare subsidies.  It's a story you're not likely to read in a 
lot of media outlets, as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're here today with Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Thank
you so much for being with us on Behind the Headlines.
<p>
Your program, Kids/Hope/USA, is revolutionary.  How did you get started in 
this kind of unique partnership program?
<p>
DR. GULKER: I had done a lot of work with church volunteer programs, because 
I just have the absolute conviction that within the larger Body of Christ
we have the most awesome potential to get to children and families.
 When I researched Kids/Hope/USA, however, I found that there
were some changes in program models that we had to look at; that
the experts I had talked to had very clear feelings about what
the local church could do.  Virtually everyone said, &quot;Get
these folks to come alongside young children at that time in their
life when their values are being formed, their self-esteem is
being developed.&quot;
<p>
Yet when I went to the churches and asked hard questions about what a 
program model could look like, the pastors were saying, &quot;Virge, 
please don't set up another agency or program.  You need to do this. You 
need to help us reach these children and families.  But we have so many 
agencies coming to us already, saying, 'Give us your money, give us your
prayers, give us your best volunteers,' and somehow that is going
to build up the church.  In reality, it's not building up the
church; it's weakening the church.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My own church has caring ministries, a person who makes sure 
that you get a meal if you're sick or a ride to the doctor if you need
one.  It's a volunteer program.  Are we talking about a formal
volunteer program that is overseen in the church?
<p>
DR. GULKER: What I offer a church is a system that will show them how to
recruit, train, supervise, and affirm their members specifically
for relationships with at-risk kids who are identified within
the local elementary school.
<p>
We are not putting together a pool of church volunteers; we are putting 
together those individuals from your church, for example, who really catch 
the vision for a child.  And it is really a manageable vision.  We're not 
saying we want 20 or 50 hours a week.  We're saying, &quot;Give us an
hour a week for at least a semester, and you can change the life
of a child.&quot;
<p>
We are getting reports back from teachers and school personnel that are 
so extreme, I don't even dare to put it in our literature, because no one 
would believe it.  These teachers are saying that after two sessions with a 
church volunteer, they see significant academic and behavioral improvement 
in these children.
<p>
And I think it is important for the listeners today, too, to recognize 
that for so many of these young children, especially elementary school 
children, that the primary need is not food or clothing.  Those needs may be 
present, but the primary need is to have someone come alongside them and 
affirm them; someone to say, &quot;Billy, Judy, Samantha, Jasmine, you have 
value. I care about you. I love you.&quot;  And the best way to express
that love is just to put an arm around the child and be there
for them.  The results are incredible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what the church does is a local church says, &quot;We have 
a concern for children,&quot; and they would choose a neighborhood school, 
I am assuming --
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- a single school, an elementary school generally --
<p>
DR. GULKER:  Yes, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And then you come in and say, &quot;All of you in
this church who are concerned about the children in the school
that is your community program, community school, we're going
to help you help these kids.&quot;
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right. In fact, we actually get involved a little earlier than 
that. Once they express interest, I don't ask them to make a commitment to 
do it.  I ask them to form an exploratory team.  We gather some folks
from the church and community and, together, we look at two questions:
 One, does the church have access to these children?  And to find
that out, we need to go into the elementary school.
<p>
I wish you could go with me on some of those visits to school as the 
principal, teacher, social workers, et cetera, sense that this collection
of people might be coming into the school to help them love the
children.  It is amazing what an impact that has on them.
<p>
The second question for us is, does that church have the commitment
and the capacity to do this kind of work?  Because we are not
just asking them to collect food baskets; we're looking for some
long-term relationships.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you define commitment and capacity?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  For me, first of all, it means finding
out whether or not a church really wants to pull this off.  Again,
because we're dealing with relationships, we dare not engage a
child if we're not serious about maintaining it.  I don't want
a church member or a church coming back saying, &quot;Well, Virge,
you didn't tell us that these kids don't smell so great,&quot;
you know, or that they're coming from homes where there's dysfunction
and so forth.
<p>
I had to find ways to really prove commitment and
capacity, and what I look for are a number of things:  One, I
want them to pay a part-time director.  Now, in churches that
ranges from a reasonable wage to a nominal fee for a church member.
 We always want someone from that church to direct the program
so we can develop and maintain relationships.
<p>
There is a modest budget that we ask the church to provide, and many 
of those line items can fit within the existing budget.  I ask, also, 
for a fee for my organization.  It is based on church size.  It ranges
from about $2,500 to $8,000 depending on the size of the church.
Right now we are working in churches ranging from about 150 members
to 3,500.  We are working experimentally with an inner-city church
with 30 members, and for them that fee is less.
<p>
Another commitment criterion for us is the willingness of the pastor to 
be one of the volunteers.  I cannot exaggerate the importance of a pastor
who puts his rear end on that little chair next to that child.
 The school and the church know at that point that they are committed.
<p>
We want a minimum of 10 volunteers who can go into the school.
 We recruit those volunteers plus substitutes; also, one prayer
partner for every adult-child relationship.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Earlier, you said that your program costs each church that 
participates a fee.  What does your program provide to the churches for 
that fee?  I am sure it doesn't underwrite the whole cost.  But what
would they receive?
<p>
DR. GULKER: It is generally about a third of what we need to set up a 
program in a church. But for that money, we offer the presentations to 
appropriate church audiences; we work with that exploratory team; we 
train the leadership team, the director; and then we provide the training 
through a Christian child psychologist for the volunteers who go into the 
schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The statistics on father absence in the inner cities
and in homes across America are brutal.  Clearly, this is a tremendous
social pathology.  Because of that, do you see a need for more
male volunteers?  Are you seeing the problem of father absence?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Our request now as we go into churches is that 60
percent of the volunteers be men.  I have nothing against women;
I married a woman.  But the reality is that I am so convinced
that Christian men can be God's gift to this culture if they are
willing to respond.
<p>
As we have men going into the school coming alongside these children, 
the children at first are mystified. Some of them, candidly, have no 
idea what a father model is like.
<p>
One school superintendent who reads to all of the kindergarten students 
in his district reported recently that after reading a story in a kindergarten 
class, a little girl came up to him and just looked at him very quizzically, 
and finally she said, &quot;So this is what it's like to have a daddy?&quot;
<p>
I don't know that the men in our audience, for example, know that if they
make that connection, they will never be the same, absolutely
be changed, guaranteed.  We will train you at two levels:  first,
relationship building, and second, the specific methods and materials
for working with that child.
<p>
Teachers who refer students are giving us, first, a list of positive 
characteristics of this child, because that is what the relationship will 
build around.  We need a specific objective for the child, plus we need 
periodic progress reports so that we know if we are proceeding in that child's 
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would be an example of an objective for a child?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Aside from relational issues, a child may need help
in learning simply to read or to read with greater proficiency.
 We have had a number of children who don't know how to spell.
 We get second and third graders who cannot read, and again, if
they don't master that skill soon, they are not going to make
it.  The probability of welfare dependence, unemployment, drug
usage, all of those personal and socially destructive behaviors,
increase in a much greater level for these children who are not
mastering those skills.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How does a volunteer achieve relationship objectives? Is 
that accomplished by then just showing up?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  A quick story.  One of our volunteers, who is
one of the wealthiest people in her county, was matched with a
child who is from one of the poorest families.  The teacher said
to her, &quot;Betty, this child has lots of needs, including some
academic.  The primary need is for someone to let him know that
he has value.  Simply by being with him, by being a kind adult
role model, you are going to communicate that to him.&quot;
<p>
Betty noticed that her little boy needed shoes, and she said to the
teacher, &quot;May I buy these shoes?&quot;  The teacher said,
&quot;Please don't do that because it is going to have a devastating
effect on the family if you do that.&quot;  Betty could buy this
boy a shoe store; she is that wealthy.  Yet she needed to understand
that the boy's greater need was for love.
<p>
I talked to her recently, and she said that as she entered the school 
recently, the boy saw her at the end of the hallway, and he threw his arms 
open wide, and he began to run down the hallway shouting her last name:
 &quot;Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews!&quot; to love her, and when
he approached her, he just wrapped her in the biggest hug.  She
was impacting his life, because suddenly he felt good enough about
himself to accept her love and return that love to her.  It is
amazing how quickly that happens.  Children are wonderfully resilient.
<p>
We get terrible referrals sometimes:  the mother of a third-grade
boy who, after having another baby this past November, went to
court, decided she didn't want the third-grader anymore, and gave
him away.  He is now living with his grandparents, and we have
a man working with him.
<p>
I think it is important for us as Christians to recognize that Christ can 
use us to be the redeeming factor in the lives of these kids.  Without our 
involvement, we will lose a generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will bring you the 
highlights from the Family Research Council's symposium, &quot;A World 
Without Welfare.&quot;  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are bringing you a one-of-a-kind welfare symposium, 
where those who are tackling our current welfare problems all over the 
country gathered to strategize on the kinds of changes needed to help
broken lives.  Let's take a look.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: We do have quite a lot of work before us before we can say the 
phrase, &quot;World Without Welfare,&quot; and mean more than the title of a 
one-day symposium. This day will be devoted not only to arguing that the 
welfare state needs new limits but to outlining what will be required
of us, and social conservatives in particular, if we are to realize
those limits.
<p>
We are asking for a return to the vision of our founders, and the fact that 
calls for relimiting government and rebuilding civil society should sound so 
radical to our modern ears is really a testimony to how far wrong we have 
strayed, especially in the last 30 years under Great Society programs.
<p>
One of the founders' most important insights is that the freedom of 
individuals and the vitality of communities are not competitive but 
intertwined, and that assumption has staked out a large plot of common 
ground to be shared by conservatives of all stripes.
<p>
Of all the speakers here today, Dr. O'Lasky is probably the one who needs 
the least introduction.  His work has dramatically redefined the terms of
the national welfare debate.  Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Marvin O'Lasky.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
DR. O'LASKY:  Thank you all very much. Thank you, Jennifer.
<p>
Let's start out by thinking about all the people here who are not only 
well intentioned but also intent on seeing good results, who understand 
the difference between effective compassion and what is well intentioned 
but often does exactly the opposite of what it sets out to do.
<p>
The essential problem of the welfare system now is that sometimes it 
succeeds in keeping people fed, but it kills dreams.  It kills the helping
dream of many Americans.
<p>
There is good news around the country. Folks here in this room who are 
doing it know it, that we are recovering the lost tolls of charitable success. 
We are seeing a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.
<p>
We are living in an era with many heroes who, I should say, are ordinary 
people who become heroic as they show through hard suffering with, that the 
American dream of compassion is not dead.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We are showing you some 
highlights from last week's World Without Welfare Symposium.  Now we have
the chance to hear from Dr. Virgil Gulker, whom I spoke with earlier
in the show.  He has more to tell us about the need for volunteers
to touch the lives of those trapped in poverty.  But it's not
as hard as you might think.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995.]:
<p>
DR. GULKER:  I want to thank Jennifer E. Marshall and the Family Research 
Council for convening this very singular gathering.  I know of no other 
similar gathering that I have heard of or attended around the country. I 
think they are giving us an opportunity to discuss the critical issues
facing all of our communities, the church, and especially the
poor.
<p>
I look at the 350,000 religious congregations in this country
-- average membership roughly 100 people per congregation -- and
I think of what those 35 million Christians could accomplish.
 Their potential is awesome.  Yet I hear so little about the role
the church and its members can play in this process of reaching,
reconciling, and healing lives.
<p>
The experience of Love, Inc., says very clearly that there are Christians 
in every community who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love, 
if they are approached, if they have the appropriate training, and if
they are affirmed for that relationship.
<p>
As Jennifer said, what I learned with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 
volunteers was that we don't need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic 
people, people like me and like many of you, who are prepared to come
alongside someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.
 The church is that sustainable local organization.
<p>
If we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed to
link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people.  The church simply giving out food or money or clothing
is not going to make it.  That is the same kind of commodity distribution
that the welfare system has tried for so long, and it has not
worked.
<p>
We are the Body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight's show gives you some highlights of
FRC's &quot;A World Without Welfare&quot; Symposium.  We now hear
from Don Everly, founder of the Commonwealth Foundation and the
National Fatherhood Initiative, as well as Robert Woodson, founder
and president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
dedicated to empowering low-income families.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: The panel he will moderate includes spokesmen from both the 
think-tank world and the grassroots, and together they will explore what 
we might be able to do to foment a new social revolution, even while 
recognizing the limits of New York and Washington to address matters of the
heart.
<p>
So please join me in welcoming Don Everly, who will make
a few introductory comments, and then we will hear from our panelists.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY:  I wanted to talk -- actually, being the wrap-up panel, we 
probably carry some obligation to try to tie together the day.  Actually, 
the interesting discussion this morning about libertarianism versus 
traditionalism sort of centered on an idea that I think is actually very 
important.
<p>
There are very important arguments to be made within public policy. There 
is also very important work to be done beyond this more sterile and
fragmented debate about the actual cause and effect of the rise
of the central government and what you can actually expect if
the central government pulls out, and that is to promote social
change by nongovernmental means.  It is sort of libertarian means
to traditionalist or moral ends, if you will.
<p>
I asked that the panel be entitled &quot;Building a New Social Movement,&quot;
or I would actually prefer &quot;new social movements,&quot; plural,
because I think social movements are very different than political
movements.  They tend to be very dynamic and grassroots and independent
often of political and policy affiliations, and I want to talk,
just to set the stage for discussion, about a few of those things.
<p>
But I ask that we consider this whole question of how we, as we
are moving into this very critical period with government retreating,
can actually conceptualize and try to implement broad-based social
change through social movement. So I really compliment the FRC
for stepping into this important arena.
<p>
So I think, having set the stage, I am going to encourage the panelists 
to move in any direction they wish with this, but the suggestion was that 
we use this panel to kind of talk about how we might work as leaders
-- moral, spiritual, social, community leaders -- to orchestrate,
direct, summon forth the kind of social change on a society-wide
basis.
<p>
I will first make the introductions very briefly, just
by giving you my own personal perceptions of these very distinguished
people.
<p>
Bob Woodson really is the founding father of the American
neighborhood empowerment movement and has brought more insight
to the changing concepts and techniques of how to reclaim neighborhoods
and empower people and empower families as well as anybody and
been a voice for that, bringing into our public debate a concern
for the empowerment of neighborhoods and families.
<p>
Moving along, Ronald Moore -- and again, you have his bio with you -- I 
have been hearing so much about the program in Mississippi, as I am
sure you have, Faith and Families, and we are very, very eager
to hear about the innovative work that is being done there to
sort of throw public leadership behind the importance of churches
in providing community-based charity.
<p>
But let's start with you, Bob, and we'll move right across the table.
<p>
MR. WOODSON: Thank you. Since I run an organization that conducts 
conferences, I will take seriously the charge to be brief.
<p>
The National Centers aids low-income people in 38 states to achieve 
greater independence and self-sufficiency, and we do this by going around 
the country and studying not dysfunction of low-income people, but we 
study their capacities and their strengths and identify them as the
experts, and we have learned some things out of that experience
that I will share with you that will constitute my remarks.
<p>
But I think [there are] some principles that should guide our work.
 Bill Bennett, not too long ago at a conference, said that liberals
look at low-income people as a class of victims and conservatives
tend to look at low-income people as aliens.  I think this is
true, that some of the principles that we follow, that we find
very useful, and that the goals should be not to protect people
but to give them the capacity to protect themselves.
<p>
The second principle is the low-income neighborhoods over the past 30 
years have seen $5 trillion worth of poverty programs parachuted into
their communities by professional providers, with the requirement
that they participate.  Now I am witnessing conservative paratroopers
strapping up, prepared to parachute in, with an emphasis on what
we as outsiders can do for those people inside, and I think this
needs to be rethought and challenged.
<p>
The other principle that we can do is that we need to be careful to strip 
labels from people. I think it is possible to be appalled at one group 
attacking another group because of their race or their religion.  We ought
to be upset about that, without having to identify the race of
the villain or the race of the victim.  We ought to be against
violence and insensitivity and bigotry, regardless of the perpetrators.
<p>
Another point that I think would be critical, and that is to not
just offer charity to poor people but use the considerable political
and economic strength of churches and church-goers and others
to remove the kinds of government barriers that prohibit faith-based
organizations from properly serving their own peers.  I think
professional credentialing is the primary barrier that low-income
providers have that is enshrined in state and local and federal
policy; that certification is not synonymous with qualification.
 It is elitist, and those elitists are not just liberals.  Poor
people have to confront conservative elitism, too.
<p>
And so, therefore, if conservatives really wanted to make a difference 
in terms of empowering people, they should work as we have done with the 
National Institute of Justice, Clint Boleck(?), World magazine, and 
Christian broadcast, when many of the groups that we help have transformed
the lives of thousands and thousands of hard-core drug addicts
by using Jesus Christ and the gospel.  But yet they are confronted
with state policies that require them to have master's degrees
as providers.
<p>
But yet it is very difficult to get conservative politicians interested 
in such an issue, and therefore, I think a group like this and others 
ought to look at ways that they can mobilize to remove the barriers.
<p>
The other thing we can do as a principle is to look upon some of these 
local providers not as objects of our charity but teachers of us, because 
many of them have overcome some of the greatest difficulties that life
ever serves up.
<p>
Secondly, they do not believe in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation attempts 
to restore you to what you were before. Grassroots people do not believe 
in rehabilitation. They believe in transformation.  They don't want the 
person to return to what they were before; they want them to return to a 
new person, to become a new person.  They are the experts at this, and 
there is a lot that we can learn.
<p>
I would like to see scholars sit at the feet at some of these experts, 
question them, explore with them how they were able to do what they do, 
and make low-income providers the experts.  It is quite possible today 
for people to be experts on poor people, be they left or right, and never
talk to a single poor person.
<p>
The other thing that I think you can do is to stop studying failure and 
study success.  Conservative scholars look down their nose at capacity 
studies of poor people. This ought to change.
<p>
And finally, I think that we need to remove the barriers that separate 
people across the divide, that we need to disaggregate poverty. Some 
people are poor because of external circumstance.  For people like that, 
a helping hand is all they need.  But the kind of poverty that troubles 
most of us is caused by moral and spiritual crisis, and that can be saved 
not by some outsider coming in offering a helping hand, but that outsider
should strengthen local providers.
<p>
What I find troubling about a lot of mentoring programs, it assumes 
that people, institutions that are indigenous to those communities do not 
have the capacity to heal.  So, therefore, I think, before you rush to 
recruit volunteers to go into low-income neighborhoods and reach out for a 
child, you ought to first determine whether or not there is a local antibody
that is resident in that neighborhood that is already doing that,
and what can you do to strengthen that local antibody to reach
that child.  Because sometimes, if I were to come into your home,
walk past you to tutor your child, take them to the zoo, and then
buy them shoes, what does it do to your relationship to your child?
<p>
So let's not assume that all low-income people are not responsible
parents or there are not institutions indigenous that could play
a constructive role. I will end on that.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  We continue
to bring you the Family Research Council's World Without Welfare
Symposium.
<p>
Now we will hear from the Reverend Ronald Moore, who
pastors two churches and is the field coordinator for the Mississippi
Faith and Families Program.
<p>
Then FRC's Jennifer E. Marshall, the symposium's creator and organizer, 
will give her insight into the day's successes and our welfare state's 
future.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
REV. MOORE: Good afternoon.
<p>
So many times, we are concerned about being politically
correct.  Since I'm a Baptist preacher, I don't have to worry
about that.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
If I was an atheist this afternoon, I would tell you that man perhaps 
crawled up out of a slime pit; in his crawl, he lost his tail; that man 
wasn't created, he evolved. But I am not an atheist; I am a Baptist 
preacher. So God created man.
<p>
If I was Black Muslim today, I would tell you to put all
your faith and trust in Honorable Elijah Mohammed.  But my Bible
tells me that my Savior was born in Bethlehem. Elijah Mohammed
was born in Georgia.
<p>
My Bible tells me that my Savior would die one Friday afternoon on a 
cross. Elijah Mohammed died in a hospital. My Bible tells me that my Savior 
would get up the third day morning. Elijah Mohammed has been dead a long 
time. He hasn't gotten up yet.  So all of my faith and trust is in Jesus 
Christ. I believe that Jesus Christ changes lives.
<p>
A few years ago, before Kirk Fordice was elected governor of Mississippi, 
many people were wondering, what are we going to do about this decadent 
mess that we have in this state.  We are the poorest state in the Nation.
 We have the highest rate of unemployment.  We have the highest
rate of teenage pregnancy, and we have more children being born
out of wedlock than any other state in the Union.  So we've got
some problems.
<p>
But finally, our governor, after riding through our state, looking at this 
decadent mess that we have, going from housing complex to housing complex, 
going from community to community, just threw up his hands and said, 
&quot;Listen. Government created this mess.  Maybe government can help fix 
it, but not alone. Government can only help.  But this problem has to be 
turned over to an entity that has been empowered to change not just conditions
but change the lives of individuals.  This needs to be turned
over to an entity that doesn't just treat the effects of problems
but can treat the cause of the problems.&quot;  He asked the local
churches to become involved in the lives of welfare recipients.
<p>
You know, we have spent, someone said earlier, over $5 trillion
in this war on poverty, and in Mississippi we have had every job
training program that you can imagine. We have had every food
program, every program that you can imagine to help the homeless
and help children that have been born out of wedlock, and we're
still in the same condition we were in some 15 years ago.
<p>
So what needs to be done?  Well, first of all, we realized that we had
to get the churches involved, that we needed some positive grassroots
action from the local level to engage the lives of these AFDC
families.
<p>
The governor of our state asked all of our churches -- we have 5,500 
churches in Mississippi -- to adopt at least one welfare family.  We 
have 55,000 AFDC recipients in Mississippi, and out of that 55,000, if you 
were going to see the profile on a particular family, you are probably 
going to find out that these families, 80 percent are African-American 
mothers. You are going to find out that they read perhaps on a sixth, seventh, 
or eighth grade level, and most of them have four to five children, and
they haven't worked in the last 10 or 12 years, and they have
all been on AFDC all of their lives.
<p>
So he realized we had a problem and realized that we needed to work with 
these AFDC recipients. So what must we do?  Well, we asked the churches to 
become involved. We asked every church to adopt a family.  And in Mississippi,
we have the only state-church-family partnership right now in
the Nation.  The program is called Faith and Family.  We ask that
each and every church would adopt one family that has been referred
to that church by the state.  Each and every family is an AFDC
family.
<p>
We ask the church to adopt the family, determine the needs
of that family, and address those particular needs.  Each and
every church has some idea of how they are going to address a
particular need of a particular family because those families
are normally centered around that church.  Normally, the church
members are aware.  They know these particular individuals.  And
the churches are only interested that can provide that one-on-one
intervention.
<p>
In Mississippi we have case workers that work for the state. Each case 
worker has about 250 clients that they simply call up and say, &quot;How 
are you doing?&quot; and they hang up the telephone.  We want to reverse 
the ratio. Why not, instead of having one case worker to 250 welfare clients, 
give one church with 250 members one AFDC family?  And you have 250 people 
seeing about one family.
<p>
We have been able to change some things with
that, because we have jobs programs in our state that have spent
$300,000 to $400,000 and have yet to put anybody to work.  We
have other programs that have worked with the poor, that have
worked with the homeless, and we have seen no results of their
work, basically because they have been trying to work with individuals
from the outside, and the church is able to work with them from
within.
<p>
We don't want to change just the condition; we want to
change the person, because if you change the person, the person
can change their own conditions.  When you walk into housing complexes,
you can walk in some apartments, in one apartment, walk into three
others without ever going outside, because you have people who
live there who don't care.  They have no hope, they have no responsibility.
 Since there is no responsibility, there is no sense of accountability.
 So we realize that there has to be a great change.
<p>
So as the church adopts the family and begins the program to change the
life of this family, to upgrade this particular family, to change
their life from a life of dependence upon the government to a
life of self-sufficiency, they move through that with a series
of courses.
<p>
Each and every church has gone about doing this differently.
 Some of them have taught basic hygiene, grooming, preparing resumes.
 All of this is taught, however, from a Biblical perspective.
<p>
In the past, in our jobs programs, they have been able to go to
school, sit there for an hour to hear what the teacher has to
say, and leave.  They go back the next day and the next day, and
they are in the jobs program some 10, 15 years, and they never
find a job because no one has really met the total needs, or the
real need hasn't been met.  So we have been able to address the
real need of the family.
<p>
This has really upset a lot of people because they really don't 
understand the concept of what we are trying to do in Faith and 
Families. No one is trying to proselytize families.  We are trying to 
take them and ask the church to find out what their needs are, introduce 
them to a divine entity. Hopefully, they will accept that.  If not, teach 
them other life-coping skills that this family can leave a life of 
government dependence to a life of self-sufficiency.
<p>
And it is so simple.  It is simply going back to the basics, because, you 
know, you have young ladies who are on AFDC, who have never worked.  She 
becomes 18 or 19. She has a child.  She moves out of the home of her mother, 
moves into an apartment, and she is asked to take care of that apartment.
 She receives a welfare check of $96 a month, a utility voucher
of $86 a month.  She is given a Medicaid card and given $306 of
food stamps and said, &quot;Listen.  Live your life.&quot;
<p>
We put her in that apartment.  We expect her to take care of it.
 But she doesn't know how to wash dishes.  She doesn't know how
to comb a child's hair.  She doesn't know anything about proper
grooming.  She knows nothing about health and proper hygiene.
<p>
So, consequently, when that child leaves home, he goes to school
and he tears up the classroom.  Consequently, when she leaves
home, goes to try to find a job, she will go into the person's
office who is going to hire her or interview her with five or
six earrings in her ear, six or seven in the other ear, an earring
in her nose, with braids all in her hair, because she has no concept
of what proper grooming should be like.
<p>
So we are asking the churches, have asked the churches, and the churches 
are doing this.  We are just simply going back to basics.  We'll teach 
them how to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am&quot; and &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; how to carry yourself, how to
dress properly, how to spend your food stamps.  And, finally and
hopefully, we try to get them to accept Christ or try to get them
to change their total concept of the religious community.  Hopefully,
they will join the church.  But we cannot proselytize.  If they
decide to, that's fine.  If not, we don't worry about that.
<p>
But the state, the church and family working together, we have been
able to take girls who have never worked in their lives, who have
been parts of other jobs programs, who have worked with those
programs who have not been able to find employment for them. 
We have been able to put each and every one of these families
to work.
<p>
In the state of Mississippi now, we have about 190 churches
involved in Faith and Families over this one-year period.  Out
of that 190 churches, we have a total of about 200 families involved.
 At this particular time, eight families have been moved totally
off of welfare; another 55 are about to come off of welfare. 
We have another 206 churches about to enter the program.
<p>
If we can take every church in Mississippi and adopt five families,
we would have half of our AFDC population off of welfare and into
a work environment within a one-year period.
<p>
And not only that; we are addressing the residual effect of what has 
happened, because when you train the mother to go home and train her 
children -- and, interesting enough, what is so good that our church 
members have been able to see, we have been able to see a young lady that
we have taken into the church and train her in life-coping skills,
teach her how to take care of herself, and go back home with her
and watch that young lady take Clorox, take detergent, and clean
up that filth that she had been living in for the last 10 or 15
years.  It is remarkable how, when that change takes effect in
her life, that she will go back,and instead of passing the telephone
from apartment to apartment, she'll take sheetrock and nail it
up to the wall, take masking tape and mask it, paint the house,
because she realizes, she has learned that she needs to be responsible,
that she has to be accountable; that if she wants to go up, she
is going to have to be able to change her attitude.  And we have
been able to do that with each and every family that we have adopted.
<p>
The state's role in this program is simply to refer families to
the churches and to offer the ongoing technical assistance.  The
case management entity stays involved, because they are the advocate
for that particular family.
<p>
Now, one problem with our program, and you might find this in your state. 
There is a huge welfare bureaucracy in Mississippi, and they have tried 
everything that they could do to tear down Faith and Families, because the 
case workers feel that they are going to lose their jobs and that the
churches are going to become case managers.  The social workers
feel the churches are going to become social work entities.
<p>
So, a few months ago, they started sending us families with sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade educations, and everybody was saying,
&quot;Listen.  There is no way you're going to be able to place
these people.  They can't do anything.  Most of them can't read,
they can't write, they don't know how to talk.  What are we going
to do with them?&quot; And our governor was a little worried about
that.
<p>
Within the last month, we put together a database of about
15,000 families in Mississippi.  Each of these 15,000 families
have a specific need, and that need is they need domestic workers.
 They need someone to come into those homes that can wash dishes,
that can clean floors, that can wash the windows, that can take
care of children, and we're going to refer these sixth and seventh
and eighth grade clients; we are going to train them and refer
them to those people who need domestic workers.  Domestic work
in Mississippi is not like it was 40 years ago.  Domestic workers
make $250 to $350 per week.  Most of them have medical and dental
coverage.
<p>
What I am simply saying is, every individual can find
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of dignity.
 It develops dignity, it develops accountability,   it develops
responsibility, and their moral and their ethical lives are changed,
and I am not talking about a temporary change; we are talking
about a permanent change.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY: Very good.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: I just want to close by saying that I think, in
the end, we are going to adopt our answers by default, because
there is no alternative strategy, and at the moment we really
sort of have two competing alternatives.  Either we create an
underclass and we treat them as wards of a custodial state and
we just spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while we ask them
to leave us alone, or we can begin restoring functions to neighborhoods
and communities and to churches.
<p>
I think the fate of our experiment with self-government really depends on 
our capacity to begin renewing a sense of responsibility but across all 
income brackets, coupled with a renewed commitment to our founding fathers' 
faith that all men, every single one is created equal to live up to those
responsibilities.
<p>
[Applause.]

</ul><p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> is celebrating Christmas with you, sharing 
the sights and sounds of the holiday season throughout our Nation's 
Capital. It's easy to forget sometimes that Washington, D.C., is a city
of many people with lives and families and special traditions
of their own.
<p>
We will be showing you how a very special organization
makes a difference in the lives of children who are not fortunate
enough to share Christmas with their parents.  These are the children
of adults who are incarcerated.
<p>
And we have a surprise guest, Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of 
Focus on the Family, a best-selling author and psychologist, and a man who 
has been a powerful voice for family, reaching millions every week.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development. In his many travels across
the United States, Phil has had the opportunity to talk to Americans
face to face, building relationships on behalf of FRC.  But his
career, like his brother, Merlin Olsen, began on the football
field as an award-winning athlete.  His work with children's sports
camps and charities led eventually to Family Research Council.
 So join me as Phil Olsen shares his experiences through the eyes
of a caring citizen, not a politician, as we take you behind the
headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited that Phil could join us today on Behind 
the Headlines.  Phil, you and your staff travel around the country.
 You meet a lot of people, real Americans.  At this time of year,
what is uppermost on people's minds?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, Kristi, we do get the opportunity to travel quite a 
bit. As you know, we have a field staff that represents the Family Research 
Council, and we have the opportunity to travel around the country and meet
with our donors and our supporters, and it is truly a phenomenal
opportunity for us to get a chance to meet these people.  And
there are a number of things on their minds.  They are very concerned
about the direction that America is headed.  They are very concerned
about the impact that decisions that are being made here in Washington,
D.C., will have on their families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, Family Research Council, under your staff, does a poll 
of the people who support us. What did they say were their top concerns in 
the poll that you all did this year?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Actually, we did a poll earlier this year, in January and February, 
and it is important to us as an organization that is representing families in 
America to find out what families in America think are important, the
issues that are important to them.
<p>
We were interested to discover that, this year, the most pressing issue on 
people's minds has been education, you know, what is going to happen in 
terms of the education of their children.  And parents are very concerned
about the Federal Government's intrusion into the education of
the young.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Any surprises in the poll as you were taking a look at it?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Not really. I think that issues that are important to America -- 
sanctity of life, abortion, pornography, health care -- a lot of these are 
near the top of that list, as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Phil, you have had a very broad career:
 one of nine; you were a football player with the L.A. Rams and
with the Broncos; you have worked for network television.  You
have spoken, you have worked with kids.  You have seen people
who are very wealthy, people who are very poor.
<p>
What common themes, though, do you see?  Are these people facing the same 
kinds of problems on the different ends of the spectrum?  What are people
really struggling with?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think we all face the same problems. I mean, some might have 
more money than others, and maybe the ability to buy some success or to buy 
some relief, but I think, in the final analysis, Kristi, we are all faced 
with the same challenges, and that no amount of money, no amount of
power or prestige or opportunity can really make up for failure
in the home.  No success really can make up for failure in the
home.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is that what is driving people, a concern
over the success or failure of their homes?  Is that the kind
of common challenges you are seeing?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think so, and I think that people -- unfortunately, too many 
people -- are listening to the messages of our culture, and our culture 
does not tell them the truth.  And I think that there is a lot of 
frustration there as people chase solutions that they think are going to 
provide them with the kind of happiness and satisfaction they seek, only
to find, when they get there, that there is nothing there but
an empty bag.
<p>
I think there is a lot of frustration, a lot of disappointment, in our 
society, and I think that that is another reason why people are coming back 
to issues that affect the family, because they realize that in the final 
analysis, they need to protect their family.  They need to protect their 
children. They need to try to create a situation and a circumstance where 
they can provide for the needs of their children without the fear of
intrusion from the outside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There are a lot of people out there who may be in their 
sixties and seventies and eighties who would define themselves as liberals 
or moderates, or on all different sides of the political spectrum.  Are you 
finding that, though, the presence of children and people kind of grappling
with home failures are bringing them back more toward a conservative,
pro-family side?  As you look at our constituents, have they come
from a lot of backgrounds to a pro-family perspective, or have
they always been there?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think that's a good point. I think that our constituents 
are across the spectrum.  I mean, you find them in every walk of life 
and in every financial circumstance, and I think that is one of the 
things that excites me, that we don't represent a small group of 
constituents out there; we represent Americans who, across the board, 
believe in the same kinds of things that we do.
<p>
We are talking about traditional Judeo-Christian values. We are talking 
about the values that have proven themselves over time.
<p>
One of the things that excites me about being involved
here with the Family Research Council, Kristi, is the fact that
every time we embark upon a research project, or every time we
validate research that has been done by others, it tends to validate
Biblical principles, principles that have been proven over thousands
of years to work.  And that is an exciting thing for me.
<p>
I think that our constituents out there are coming to realize the very
same thing.  They know what works.  They know what doesn't work,
and too many times out of bad circumstances or bad experiences
where they have seen things that have happened either in their
family or in other families.  It only brings back even that much
harder the message of the importance of protecting their family
and their children and their future.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: If you would describe a pro-family American, how would you 
describe that person? What are they like?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, that's an excellent question. I think that to me a 
pro-family American is just that; he is pro-family. He is focused on 
the welfare of his family and of other families as well.  I think that 
these are people that we are seeing out there, and most of them are not 
only interested in what is best for their family but in trying to do 
things that would benefit other families, as well.  And so I think that 
that, maybe in a nutshell, would capture that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in Behind the 
Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi. It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we will be taking you on a 
Washington, D.C., Christmas journey, and we will also be joined by Prison 
Fellowship's Mark Morgan, whose Angel Tree organization is brightening the
lives of many, many children, especially during this holiday season.
 Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  All over the Nation, families celebrate Christmas
and the holiday season with their own unique traditions.  But
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> would like to 
share with you a glimpse into the many celebrations throughout 
Washington, D.C., as we take you on our own special tour of Christmas in 
the Capital.
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Each year, the National Christmas tree lighting ceremony, 
which originated on December 24, 1913, draws people from around the world. 
<p>
Christmas and the holiday season have special meaning to each of us.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas is a time for me and my family to get together and
come across the oceans and see how everybody has grown over the
year.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means a time of the year in which
everyone develops a sense of joy and happiness and finds pleasure
in doing for others to a degree to which afterwards you might
regret, but in any case, while Christmas is going on, it's a great
time.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Good will to your fellow human being and an
extra day off of work.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means time with my family and my friends and just 
a moment to reflect on life and be thankful for what I got.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas means to me sharing time with my family, going to 
church, and buying lots of gifts for my kids.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas to me is a time of giving and have thanks. Christmas 
is every day.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: It means the spirit of giving, and we are celebrating the 
birth of Jesus Christ, and that is what it should be about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ministries and outreach programs throughout Washington, 
D.C., help create some extra special Christmas memories in many lives.
<p>
[From Angel Tree celebration segment]:
<p>
SPOKESMAN: Angel Tree is a wonderful ministry of Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. It gives moms and dads that just happen to be away from their 
boys and girls at Christmas and who are in prison, it gives them an 
opportunity to fill out an application and to ask nice people, like the 
Congressional wives, if they wouldn't please buy a present for you so that 
you know that your mom and dad that can't be with you love you very
much.
<p>
And so that is what Angel Tree is all about.  These presents
are from your father or your mother that can't be here today,
and it says that your mom or dad loves you very much and that
Jesus Christ loves you very much, and we hope that this makes
your Christmas just a little brighter.
<p>
[Gift-giving segment.]
<p>
SPEAKER: So who did Jesus come for?
<p>
AUDIENCE: Everybody.
<p>
SPEAKER: All people, everybody from every land.  And whose Son is he?
<p>
AUDIENCE: God's.
<p>
SPEAKER: The Son of God.  Very good.  And that is the true Christmas 
story.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Mark Morgan, the National Project 
Coordinator for Angel Tree Ministries of Prison Fellowship,. We just caught 
a small glimpse of how this ministry is impacting children's lives, and
Mark is here to tell us more.  Welcome, Mark.  Thanks so much
for being with us.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Thanks, Kristi.  It is great to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope by now that everybody has seen this little triangle 
somewhere in their church or in their community. But in case they 
haven't, what is Angel Tree?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Angel Tree is a gift-giving program for the children of 
prisoners at Christmas time.  It is an inmate-initiated program, where 
our local staff people all over the country take applications into
federal and state institutions and in some places county jails
and give those applications to inmates who fill them out, give
us the name, age, birth date of their children, and we pass those
out by location, almost by ZIP code, even, to churches and groups
in the community where the children are living.  So even federal
inmates, say, in Washington State, their children living in Georgia
will be served by people living in Georgia in that area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it got started -- inmate initiated.  Someone said at one 
time, &quot;Wow, I wish somebody could give a present to my child&quot;?
 How did it get started?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It started 14 years ago by a lady named Mary Kay Beard who 
was herself an inmate in the Julia Tetwiler(?) prison in Alabama.  She and 
several other women were incarcerated, and she noticed that the women 
were stockpiling like little soaps and toiletries, shampoos and things, 
that churches and volunteers would bring into the prison, and these women 
would stockpile them and then at Christmas time gave those as Christmas
gifts to their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And when Mary Kay was out and now working as the Prison 
Fellowship area director in Alabama herself, she and another woman said, 
&quot;We've got to do something for the children of prisoners at 
Christmas time.&quot;
<p>
So in two malls, one in Montgomery, Alabama, and one in Birmingham, 
Alabama, they set up an angel tree and put paper angels, cut out in 
the shape of angels, on the tree with the names of about 500 children in 
the area, and then people, passers-by in the mall, would come and take the 
angel off. And so that year, over 14 years ago, 566 kids got gifts from 
their parents in prison on behalf of church volunteers and also passers-by 
in the mall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Community and --
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Community members.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, today, though, you are serving up to a million?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We think there are nearly a million children who
have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Prison Fellowship volunteers and churches and organizations 
across the country this year will minister to over 470,000 children,
we think, who have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I was very intrigued, reading a little bit about the program, 
that if your father was incarcerated or your mother was incarcerated, you 
have a six-times-more-likely chance to also go into a life of crime,
and often beginning in the third grade.
<p>
I hadn't thought of it like this before, but are you at Prison Fellowship 
looking at Project Angel Tree as a way to turn children from a certain path?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Definitely.  Angel Tree is merely just a present
-- it is more than just a present under the tree, but it starts
out as a present and it becomes a year-long involvement in the
life of that family through the volunteers in the community that
are getting involved through Angel Tree.
<p>
We see Angel Tree as being a foot in the door for year-round ministry to 
these families. Because the children are likely to end up in prison, many 
of the inmates who are in prison there now say that they also had
a parent or a sibling in prison.  And so we see a huge cycle of
crime, and we are trying to break that family cycle and get in
and close the gap that is caused by the incarceration; also make
an impact on the child's life.
<p>
We are doing more than just Christmas Angel Tree. We are now involving 
kids in other projects throughout the year to try to make an impact.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The first time I heard about Project Angel Tree was on a Dr. 
James Dobson -- and we get to meet him a little bit later in the program 
-- on a broadcast where they said, &quot;We need more presents.  We
have a tremendous shortage.  Mail little Walkmans to the Angel
Tree headquarters.&quot;
<p>
I mean, the coordination for prisoners and volunteers and delivery, that's 
a lot of people.  I mean, how have you guys handled the growth from 500 
presents in a mall to a million children today?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, it is a logistical challenge, and we --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Nightmare?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Not a nightmare totally, but it is a great challenge for us. 
If it were not for over 14,000 churches and some 75,000 volunteers that
get involved in this program -- we think it is the largest program
of its kind that is ministering to children of prisoners involving
so many people, nearly a million volunteers a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do you get hooked up, though, because you all -- now, 
do all the names come to Prison Fellowship?  You are the disseminators.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Right.  We have an office in almost every state,
and they receive the applications, and then they recruit churches
throughout the year, and volunteers, radio stations, businesses,
Christian Bible studies, and so there is a large group of people
that are offering throughout the year to get involved during the
Christmas season, and then we provide them with training materials,
a video tape about the program, the posters, and all the materials
that they need to run the program, and then they call -- 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Then do a lot of these people stay involved throughout
the year?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They do.  They are now getting involved in the families 
throughout the year, not only just buying the gift and bringing it back 
and delivering it, by either having a party that we saw in the video or 
delivering door-to-door to the families.
<p>
When you deliver door-to-door or bring them into a church through a 
church party, you've got an instant contact and you have been face-to-face 
with them, and then it is easy to continue ministry by sending birthday 
cards or providing food to the families during the holiday times when it is 
tough.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know some friends of mine, and I have heard this story
regularly.  They are getting in their car, and they are driving
to deliver some gifts, and it is getting a little scary.  And
then they get there, and the reception that they receive is so
amazing.  I mean, is it the kind of thing that some of the volunteers
are having some adventures in trying to deliver this?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We see that a lot of times.  There are some children that 
live in areas of town that you normally wouldn't go into.  But we call
ahead to the families.  We ask our volunteers to check, to pick
a time that they know is going to be a lot better, maybe on a
Saturday morning when there is better daylight, and they go to
the families.  They are knocking on doors and they don't seem
to see any response.  But then you look up and see coming out
of the second-floor window all these faces peering out, looking
for you, waiting for you to show up, and then running down and
receiving you.
<p>
When you take gifts in to these families, often they have no tree. If 
they do, it's a Charlie Brown Christmas tree, you know, the typical very 
small tree, and rarely are there any gifts under the tree, and so we 
also try to provide care-giver gifts, whether it is just a food basket or 
something.  But we really see that these people want us to come into 
their homes. They don't trust anybody. Nothing has ever been done for 
them, many times.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  And so it is great to see somebody caring for them and actually 
smiling and saying that they love them and giving the gifts on behalf of 
the incarcerated parent and in the name of Christ.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you kind of had an experience like that.  You were trying 
to find a house, and it was a little bit tough.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What happened?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I was with a friend of mine from work with Prison Fellowship, 
and we had decided to deliver gifts in Southeast D.C.  We went across 
the bridge into Anacostia, and it was after a time that I had personally 
been a victim of crime, and I was a little wary of going into the area we 
always hear about being the crime capital.
<p>
And as I approached the house, there were four young guys standing there, 
but they were really strong looking and had their hoods pulled down over 
their heads and their coats really wrapped around tight, and they asked us
what we wanted and what we were doing there, and I said, &quot;Well,
we're here to deliver gifts to Robert's family.&quot;  And these
kids -- they looked like men -- they immediately melted into teenagers
and into children, and they said, &quot;That's us.&quot;  The
oldest kid said, &quot;That's me.  That's my family.&quot;  And
so they took us into the house and we sat around and passed out
the gifts and mentioned that we really wanted to come in at Christmas
time, and it was just an amazing story.
<p>
But you see these kids that are putting on a strong persona and are --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And they're kids at heart.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They are truly kids, but because Dad is not there, they are 
having to defend the family, and they are watching their home front, and 
so it is something we have to be careful of.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is the 800 number, very quickly, for people who want to 
get involved?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  398-HOPE.  Great.  We are going to be looking forward to 
hearing more.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to 
hear about the Angel Tree program and Prison Fellowship.  We'll let you know 
what you can do to help touch the lives of those who are incarcerated and 
the families they left behind.  Stay tuned.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I am joined once again
by Mark Morgan of the Angel Tree Ministry of Prison Fellowship,
an organization which gives hope to prison inmates and their families.
 Welcome back.
<p>
We were talking a little bit through the break about Prison Fellowship, 
and frankly, you know, you look at Angel Tree.  It is a program that is going 
to give gifts to the children of prisoners.  But, you know, every year, there 
are so many people you could give to.  Why would you give to those families? 
Why target those children?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, a lot of times I, myself, wonder why would we want to 
do something for an inmate specifically. But these people are people who have 
been, whether it is circumstance or by choice, they have chosen to be part of 
crime, and they are now part of that, but their families are suffering, and 
there is a huge number of children in this young children demographic
now, this wave that is coming, and if these children fall in the
footsteps of their parents -- our prisons are overcrowded now
-- there is not going to be any place for these kids, and we want
to get involved before they get involved in hurting others who
are victims, you know, to victimize others, and we also want to
get in there and just share love with them to change them, to
get them involved in a better way of life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is kind of ironic, statistically speaking, is 
just today in the <i>New York Times</i>, for example, they were talking 
about the ending of one crime wave, the beginning of another, as the baby
boomers have gotten older, and maybe they don't want to run and
climb in and out of windows so much.  The crime rate has gone
down, but they are predicting a massive increase of crime as the
children of the baby boomers hit the teen years, a 21 percent
increase among youth crime, which is frightening if you think
about children on street corners.
<p>
But my question is, have you seen through this project any of these children's 
lives changed? Are you seeing children getting involved in ministry, children
frankly having a relationship with the faith community and with
a personal faith that is changing their lives?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: There are churches and groups that have adopted their Angel Tree 
families and are involved with them year round.  They are now involved
in the churches, and we have quite a few Angel Tree recipients
now who are actually involved as Angel Tree volunteers themselves,
who are going out and ministering to others in their own peer
group to share how the ministry and how Prison Fellowship and
Angel Tree has touched their lives.
<p>
We even have -- one of my favorite stories is of a camp that has sponsored 
Angel Tree kids for the last five or six years now up in Maine.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  There are children from New England that
get to go each year, and one of the children's names is Bo Price.
 He was a camper for several years as an Angel Tree child.  He
got involved, volunteers were involved in his life.  His grandmother
and he were involved very heavily in the church they went to that
ministered to them, and he ended up being the top student in his
school and is probably going to be involved as a camp counselor
at this camp in the next year or so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is fantastic.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So he has turned his life around.  We got in at a
time where he was young enough and it was a time where we could
minister to him.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And vulnerable.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And ready to be reached out.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Definitely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What about to the people in prisons? I mean, I am
assuming it has to touch the children.  But does it make your
ministry into the prisons work better?  It certainly is a practical
step to show them that you care about them and their families.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I mentioned earlier that Angel Tree is a foot in
the door for year-round ministry for the families.  But it is
also a foot in the door in the prison systems for us as Prison
Fellowship, started by Chuck Colson over 17 or 18 years ago now --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Very impressive.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- has grown in the prison system.  But inmates are still 
wary of going into the chapel programs and into any volunteer-led programs 
sometimes. But when an inmate finds out that his kids have received gifts
from Prison Fellowship, that somebody has actually done something
for their family, has actually dared to go into the area where
they live, has dared to cross the threshold of their home, has
gone in and given gifts to the family and spent time with the
mother or the grandmother, whoever is taking care of the kids,
many inmates just say, &quot;I can't believe you actually did
something for me.&quot;  And they are more open and receptive
and will then go into the Prison Fellowship Bible studies or marriage
seminars where their marriages can be restored.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Is this one of the biggest doors that you have?  I mean, 
Prison Fellowship works certainly one on one in the prisons and in Bible
studies and in a lot of practical things to show people that there's
a life for them beyond the bars.  But are you finding that Angel
Tree is one of the better ways to get through to their own heart?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It sure is.  In a sense, it is a cup of cold water
presented in Christ's name to the families, to the inmates.  Even
the volunteers that get involved really see how easy it is to
be involved in ministry.  And because of that, more and more inmates
are getting involved in the prisons, in the Bible studies.  The
church behind the walls of the prison is growing, and that is
great, because there needs to be a place of comfort and rest for
inmates behind the bars, because there is a lot of stress and
struggles for them.  But also for the families, it is a great
ministry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are seeing statistically -- at Family Research Council, 
we like statistics -- that father absence is one of the key sources of a 
problem in the child's life, not that they don't need their mother, but 
there generally is one care-giver, and the dad is missing.
<p>
How has Angel Tree helped fathers maybe re-engage in the child's life?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We are working more and more to do that, because when 
inmates are released from prison, they go back into their homes, into 
their families, and want to immediately assume the role of father again. 
However, their children, if they have boys, those boys have assumed that 
responsibility and that role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And even the mother who is working and holding down two or 
three jobs is taking care of the family, and all of a sudden, the father 
wants to come back in and assume his responsibilities.  There is a lot that
they need to know, and through some of our other programs, through
Angel Tree and some of the communications we are getting -- we
have a booklet that we give to the prisoners when they fill out
their applications.  We are using those as tools to try to train
the parents, you know, to parent from prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ah, that is fascinating.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So there is an area of parenting from prison that the inmates 
need to assume their responsibility, and Angel Tree is a chance for them 
to again be a steppingstone into the family again, to bridge that gap, to 
speak to their children through a gift and through a note written on their 
application saying that, &quot;Just wanted you to know that&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That I have been thinking about you.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- &quot;that I'm thinking of you, that I haven't forgotten 
you.&quot; And a lot of times the kids will say, &quot;I told you my daddy 
wouldn't forget me,&quot; or, &quot;I told you my mom wouldn't forget 
me.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, in addition, for those people who get involved,
a gospel message is given with each gift.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right. Angel Tree is different than other Christmas gift-giving 
programs in that it is done in the name of Christ and in the name of an
incarcerated parent.  Some of the materials we have developed
through American Bible Society have been -- as a gift from them,
they gave us Scripture pieces to give to all of the Angel Tree
children, the care-givers, and also the inmates this past year,
both in English and in Spanish, to those families that we have,
and they have allowed us to print on the inside just an easy step-by-step
tool of what is Angel Tree. It is the Christmas story.  These
different pieces -- there are three of them for the kids that
are age-appropriate.
<p>
But it also gives us a chance to share the Christmas story and what is 
the Christmas gift and to lead them in a knowledge of what Christmas is all 
about, that Jesus was given as a Christmas gift, and that He is love, and we 
try to introduce love into those facilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: These children don't get to see a lot of that, do they?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: No. As I said, the kids on the street that I ran into and other 
families that I have delivered to and that I have been involved with, even
the kids who come to some of the camps that we are having Angel
Tree kids at, there is such a solid, Don't mess with me, this
is who I am, this hard outer shell, but after just a couple of
kind words and a little trust-gaining, they just melt, and they
are so eager for love and eager for a positive role model, because,
as you mentioned, Dad or Mom is gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: After five and seven years of working with this on the outside, 
on the inside, what has surprised you about this ministry?  What do you think
people need to know?  Maybe they didn't expect this.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I am amazed at how Angel Tree has grown on its own.  It is 
not a program that we can even really control or manage because the
word of mouth on the inside of the prisons has just grown that
this is a program you can trust in; they're going to work and
do something for your kids.  And also, on the outside, more and
more churches are getting involved.
<p>
But as we see the number of children rise, there are, as I said, nearly over 
a million children of prisoners, maybe 2 million, we think, that we need to 
minister to.  And so, more and more, we need more and more churches and
volunteers and groups and organizations to be involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It has got to be kind of scary for a guy -- he is in prison --
or a woman, thinking that his children are going to totally forget
him.  I would think the fear level would be high.  Just as a practical
matter, I was wondering, after Angel Tree, do you see more children
coming to the prisons?  Do you see a physical connection made
through the gift connection?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We have, and a lot of churches are providing transportation for 
the family to the prisons to reconnect that group there so that they can do 
that, and also, you mentioned something else, if I can backtrack just a 
little. At Christmas time, the suicide rate is very high in prisons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is a lonely time during the holidays for inmates.  And so 
Prison Fellowship and Angel Tree provides a link to their families and gives 
them a chance -- because a lot of inmates have expressed that they are 
worried about their families during the holidays.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I can imagine why, yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: They are depressed and lonely, and then they are thinking 
of their families.  And so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Let's make sure you give the 800 number one more time.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Sure. It's 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay, 1-800-398-HOPE. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial break, 
we will hear from Dr.James Dobson, who, through his ministry, Focus on the 
Family, has impacted thousands of lives.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
Just recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Dr. James 
Dobson of Focus on the Family.  Dr. Dobson and his staff are touching 
lives all over the United States through his ministry, which helps people 
strengthen their own families and deal with the struggles of family life.
<p>
Dr. Dobson is also making an effort to be a good influence on government, 
advocating a pro-family agenda through his daily radio show and 
publications. They reach millions every week.  Now let's hear what Dr. 
Dobson has to say to us.
<p>
Dr. Dobson, it is a privilege to be with you today. You come to 
Washington regularly, and I know you have been involved here for years, 
back in the 1970s and the 1980s in the foundation of Family Research 
Council. Why are you here in Washington, D.C.?  Why are you involved?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: Kristi, I come here because so much of what happens to the 
family is linked to what government does.  I wish that were not true. I 
really wish government would stay out of the family.  But they don't,
and as a result, the policies of government are very, very important
to the stability of the family, first of all, financially, of
course, through the way the family is taxed, but then now the
moral issues, you know, of abortion and the possibility of gay
marriage and other things.  All of those kinds of policies are
being discussed -- parental consent for abortion -- many, many
things that we care about, and there is only one way to influence
that system, and that is to come here.  So that's what brings
me to this city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the media elite are trying to insinuate that 
the family values issues in the next election have run aground a little, 
that it maybe is the economy. You look at the polls recently in terms of 
the numbers on the balanced budget, and they are saying, &quot;We want 
our programs more than our tax cuts.&quot;
<p>
Do you think people are losing interest in things like partial-birth 
abortion and the family tax cuts? You know, is the media elite correct?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  No.  I think that is the message the media elite would like 
people to believe, and frankly, that is what both political parties would 
like people to believe, even the Republicans, if you listen to them. They
want to talk about money, as though that's the only thing that
Americans care about.  They want to talk about taxation and about
deficits and about reorganizing government and about long-term
debt and interest rates and that sort of thing.
<p>
Well, those things are important.  You know, the economy is important to 
the family, too.  But there's a whole lot more that's out there.
<p>
What this city does not know, Kristi -- and I know you are aware of this
-- but what this city doesn't know is that there are multiple
millions of people out there who are not represented by the <i>Washington
Post</i> and not represented by the <i>New York Times</i> and the media 
establishment, who are just good people trying to raise kids and trying to 
maintain family life, and they are very alarmed by what is happening to
their children, by the influences of Hollywood, by the rock music
industry, by the filth that's out there, by the violence that's
all around them, by the drugs, by the gangs, by abortion, by all
these moral issues that are there.  And they are really waiting
for politicians, somebody, to step forward and speak for them
and their concerns.
<p>
Their greatest concern is not the country. Their greatest concern is their 
own little family.  And so the larger financial issues are important, yes, 
but they don't represent all of the concerns that are out there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right now on Capitol Hill you have this clash of the Titans in 
the budget project.  We have soldiers possibly going to Bosnia any day now
and people shipping out all the time.  We have Medicare debates
going on with this whole discussion that we are trying to steal
from the elderly.  And it's Christmas time.  I mean, that's a
lot to be throwing at people at Christmas time.
<p>
What is your sense? You talk to more people probably than most of us in a 
year, in the mail and in your conversations.  Are people feeling overwhelmed
by all these crises in government?  Do they want to see resolution?
 Are they looking for something different at Christmas?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: I really believe that most people are not terribly concerned
about crises in government.  They are concerned about crises in
their private lives.  They are concerned about how to keep their
family together, how to get through tomorrow, how to pay the Christmas
bills, and how to keep their kids moral and how to protect their
family from the influences of a culture in the wake of a moral
free-fall.
<p>
That is what is on people's minds.  Yes, they watch to some degree what 
CNN says and what they hear from this city, but it is much more personal 
than that.  And I think, this Christmas, people feel the way they have -- 
I am generalizing, but the people I know and that I hear from feel the way 
they have for many, many years.  They are looking to put meaning into 
Christmas. They are looking to get in touch with their kids and their families
and to add the spiritual dimension.  And this city is sort of
important but sort of &quot;out there.&quot;  That is at least
my impression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is out there, actually.
<p>
DR. DOBSON: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've got a big schedule.  I just wanted to ask you one 
last question.  When you go home to Colorado Springs, what do you hope 
you were able to accomplish here today, during Christmas time?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Some of the meetings that I am having today are frankly 
confidential.  I have been asked not to talk about them, certainly not 
in advance. But I can just tell you there are some high-level meetings 
that deal with the pro-life agenda and how to advance it, how to protect 
that little unborn child.
<p>
Now, we just recently had a wonderful experience, of course, on Capitol 
Hill with the passage of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, which would 
ban that horrible procedure where little children, little babies, full-term, 
viable babies are killed in a horrible way, and we are very grateful that 
that legislation passed.  But that is only the beginning.  We've got a lot 
more work to do.  So that is the primary thing I am here working on
on this trip.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for standing up for life and thanks for being with 
us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Thanks for having us.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> brings
you some holiday cheer from the Family Research Council staff.
 Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff works very 
hard for today's families, and we very much value Christmas in this 
important family season.
<p>
Tonight let's hear from some of the Family Research Council staff
as they share the meaning of Christmas in their lives and some
of their own special holiday plans.  Please watch with me Home
Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
FRC STAFFER: What Christmas means to me?  Well, Christmas means to me a 
time of getting together with family, celebrating the holiday, spending 
time with your loved ones.  But most of all, Christmas is remembering why 
we have Christmas.  It's the birth of the Christ Child sent here
to save us from our sins and to take us to heaven.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Family, being together with the family and sharing and caring.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: To spend some time with my mother, which it has
been a long time since I've had Christmas with her, so I will
spend some time with my family and have fun.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: My family used to always get together, and my dad used to 
always read the Christmas story the night before, on Christmas Eve, and
we would always get together with our family on Christmas Day.
 So family is the main thing of Christmas for me, and snow, too.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Instead of doing gifts for each other, we're going
to go and -- and, as a matter of fact, our families, instead of
buying gifts for us, they're going to send us the money, and then
we're going to find a place that is really special, and that's
going to be our Christmas.  So that's kind of special.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Christmas means that I get to go home and spend time with 
my family, and it means that I can eat my grandmother's cooking,
and it means that I get to go to my home church and I get to visit
with the people there and hear my minister speak, which is something
that I have missed since I have moved here.
<p>
But Christmas also means that there is going to be peace that whole day, 
and that it is so quiet, and that maybe it will snow.  And what I'm going
to do that is really special this year is I'm just going to sit
down and enjoy my former home with my parents.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I think the thing that comes instantly to mind is family, you 
know, being around family and having them near to you at that time of
the year.  It is particularly important to have them in a group,
and I think the other thing, the second thing that I think about,
obviously, is that it's to celebrate the birth of Christ, and
that's important to me.  So those are the two things that come
to mind.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Just to always remember the spirit behind
Christmas.  It is the birth of Christ.  It is not the sharing
of presents or the Christmas tree or the lights or the cookies.
 It's that Christ was born and it's a time to celebrate.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I guess Christmas to me means, it definitely is the meaning 
of eternal life for me.  Without Christ coming to Earth, we wouldn't
have eternal life, and that is the meaning of Christmas to me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  My family.  Going home and just being with my family.
 I mean, that is really what it means to me, and all of my cousins
getting together and everybody just hanging out, and that's it.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  It will be just a chance for everybody to get back
together from all over the country, from both coasts, and come
back to the heartland.  And I miss the snow.  It's going to be
a white Christmas there.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas?  This Christmas I'm going to go to Tennessee and 
spend it with my family.  And, also, what Christmas means to me is I think 
about people in other countries that can't celebrate it because they don't 
Jesus and never heard of Him.  A lot of them are my friends on the other
side of Planet Earth.  So I think about them during Christmas.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas is the coming of the Savior who saves
us from our sins, you know, and to save us all.  What does it
say in the carol?  To save us from Satan's power when we had gone
astray.  Tidings of comfort and joy.  Is there anything better
than that?
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Well, I will be celebrating Christmas
with my two little girls, Miosh(?) and Kianshay(?), and now since
my mother has passed, it means a lot, because I usually spent
Christmas with her.  But other than that, it's just a happy celebration
day for me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  This Christmas I am going to visit my
family in the Middle East, so I will be much closer to where Jesus
was born, and I am really looking forward to being with them after
having not seen them for so long, and looking forward to being
in the kind of land that Christ was born in 2,000 years ago.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> is looking at the industry behind the get-rich-quick fantasy,
gambling.  It reaches farther than most of us are aware, touching
many lives, and it leaves behind not a trail of sparkling lights
and wealthy patrons but the darker side of our culture:  crime,
broken dreams, and dying economies.
<p>
Stayed tuned for the insights of those fighting this billion-dollar business. 
You may be surprised by what happens to those cities and states that embrace 
the dream that gambling offers.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, who spearheads FRC's 
government relations strategy.  After years of working on the Hill, Marty's 
contact list reads like a who's who of those congressional leaders who are 
changing government as we know it.
<p>
In recent weeks, the battle for controlling the future direction of the 
American government has been fought over the budget. Join me as Marty 
Dannenfelser shares a perspective gleaned from the closed meeting 
rooms where tough negotiations have been taking place, Behind the Headlines.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're talking about the budget today, and it's kind of 
interesting.  Lately, reports of the budget negotiation are a little bit 
like the weather.  You know, they are very vague and there's a large room 
for error.  And, day after day, we come in and see that there's a budget 
negotiation but nothing has been decided, and yet government continues. How 
is it possible for us to have no budget and yet have government?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, the Congress traditionally passes a budget
each year, but that budget is really only a blueprint.  What really
affects what gets spent is what is known as the appropriations
process, and if they do their job the way they are supposed to,
they should pass 13 appropriation bills every year that fund the
entire government.  Usually there's a few agencies in each bill
that are funded, like the Department of Health and Human Services,
Labor, and Education, for instance; three very big departments
are funded in one bill.  Department of State and others are funded
in other bills, foreign affairs in some other bills, and so on.
<p>
So those appropriation bills are generally moving forward.
A few of them have been vetoed by the President; two or three
of them have been stuck in Congress.  So when they don't pass,
they have kept many of the major services in those bills funded
by what is known as a continuing resolution, which is a bill that
allows funding to continue, usually at a lower level than what
it would otherwise be funded at through the appropriation bills,
usually the lower of what either house has passed or last year's
level, whichever is lower.  But they can construct that however
they choose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So then we have the budget, which is sort of a blueprint 
of what it is that we can spend; and then we have appropriations bills, 
which are kind of like checks that we write out; and then a continuing 
resolution, which authorizes spending at last year's levels?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: For the most part. There have been a number of programs 
that the House, in particular, has voted to zero out that are still being 
funded at 75 percent of last year's levels.  Now, that may be about to
change, because the House in particular and Congress in general
are now talking very seriously about targeted appropriations,
which I think is a very good idea, to get the President's attention
in the overall budget negotiations, that things like Americorps
will be zero-funded.  The idea of paying volunteers just should
not be done.  It just does not make sense at a time when you've
got these huge deficits.  But that's one of the President's pet
programs, but I don't think the general public is clamoring for
the Federal Government to pay volunteers when there are millions
and millions of volunteers around the country doing things to
help people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the media is encouraging everybody
to hang tough, you know.  Don't compromise.  Let's take these
disagreements out on the campaign trail.  And we hear talk that
we could just continue funding the government with continuing
resolutions and then debate it all out during the election.  Is
that a good idea?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  No, not really.  I think that keeps things largely 
on automatic pilot.  I think one thing that the voters said in 1994 is 
they wanted change; they wanted things to be done differently.  And to 
continue largely the status quo would not be what the voters want.  So I 
think that they need to start getting more serious about the process.
<p>
One thing in terms of what you said about the budget.  If they want to 
make substantive changes in law -- for instance, the family tax relief
that we have been very strongly advocating -- they do need to
pass some separate bill so that can be part of a larger budget
package, what they call a budget reconciliation package.  And
we hear so much about entitlement spending.  If they want to do
anything to stop or reduce the level of automatic spending, they
need to pass a law to change it.  Otherwise, that automatic entitlement
spending will continue.
<p>
So that is why a budget reconciliation bill is important if you want to 
make those kinds of fundamental changes.  But the things that the people 
in Congress can control are the purse strings and the annual appropriations. 
That is where they can really control it if they stick to their guns.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it seems that, every year, you have to fight the budget 
process two times:  one, to fight for the budget, which is the blueprint;
a second one to fight for the actual spending.  Is that the way
it works?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. You can pass what is called a budget resolution, 
which sets -- it is a blueprint. But in order to enforce those areas of 
agreement, you need what is known as a budget reconciliation bill, 
which actually changes the law in the important areas to effect those 
changes. Then you carry them out throughout the year through the appropriations 
process in terms of the spending levels.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Although the President and the Congress seem to be winning 
at different points, is there a danger that the public says, &quot;A pox 
on both your houses; we don't want anything to do with either of you in the 
next election&quot;?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, they have been getting pretty frustrated,
I think, with the people in Washington, both at the executive
level and the congressional level.
<p>
We have had the phenomenon for many years, though, of many people saying, 
well, they hate the Congress but they love their Congressman.  That changed 
a little bit in the last election cycle, but it would be a very
interesting question to see how it plays out in this year.
<p>
It is really a matter of framing the issues, because people overwhelmingly
want a balanced budget, but then again, the President senses there
are certain programs that they don't want to see cut, and in fact
what Congress is proposing does not cut some of those programs
but does in fact reduce the rate of growth in the programs, such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So here we are having a little bit of fiscal constipation, 
you might say, and we wonder what is going to happen.  Could that energy 
be redirected so that we have a third party?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Possibly, but I don't think the history of third 
parties in our country has been a very good one.  There have been a 
few that have been fairly competitive, but I think that most people 
sense that it is the two major parties that are most likely to elect 
their candidate, and ultimately, you have to impact those parties and 
get their attention.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Initially, the pollsters and the pundits said that 
President Clinton finally looked Presidential.  Now they think that 
Congress is doing a little better.  Is President Clinton the winner in
this budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think right now it has become more equalized. For 
a while, I think Clinton was winning. The Republicans let the debate get 
off of the big-picture argument about balancing the budget and into some 
of the specifics that Clinton wanted to talk about, Medicare and education 
and some of those types of things.
<p>
I think the tax relief issue, too, has not been emphasized enough, 
that families know that they are being squeezed, and one of the reasons 
they are being squeezed is by over-taxation.  So the idea of family tax 
relief needs to be promoted, that this is really part of the package, and 
they need to make that point more effectively.  There are some very
good charts that are put together that show how every state and
families in each state will benefit.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  About a week ago, President Bush gave an interview where he 
said that his one regret or miscalculation, you know, the biggest one that 
he had, was in deciding to go ahead and raise taxes after that &quot;Read
my lips:  No new taxes&quot; promise.
<p>
But Bill Clinton ran on middle-class tax relief.  The Republicans were 
very clear two years ago that they were here to fight for tax relief. 
Could they make a mistake, all of them, if they neglect pro-family tax
relief?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think there's a tendency sometimes
when people are in Washington for a while to start listening to
this inside-the-beltway chatter, particularly what you might call
the media elites.  And you're right; the media elites never like
tax relief, and they have no identification with family tax relief.
<p>
I just heard about one of the economically oriented groups that
did a focus group in Michigan, and one of the things that was
most clear was that the people wanted the tax relief, and I think
that people have seen that.  As you noted, President Bush and
some others have seen that, particularly when people have been
promised tax relief or that there would be no new taxes and then
the politicians went back on their word, they really do react
adversely to it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There are a lot of different budget items on the table. 
Who has more to lose if these promises aren't kept?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think the President has more to lose,
because he is much more visible to the country.  The members of
Congress have their individual constituencies.  They have a better
opportunity to talk one on one with their constituents and to
show them what they are doing.
<p>
So I think that the risk is really for the President, and if there is a 
down-turn in the economy, we could have something of a recession -- and 
we are starting to see a great deal of uncertainty in the stock market, 
and so on -- the President is the one who is going to be held accountable.
 He tends to  benefit from economic growth whether or not he is
responsible for it, but he also is the one that is held accountable
if things start to go downhill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, you are up on Capitol Hill every day, and it has been 
a tough year for the people up there.  They have worked practically through 
Christmas. They closed and opened on the same day the next session.  Tell
me, what is the mood up there on Capitol Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think they are getting their breath a little bit. 
I think they worked really hard, you know, and an intense schedule
during the first year, and I think the fact that they have now
had a little bit of time to be with their families, to be back
home with their constituencies, I think some of them are going
to be refreshed, and I think you are going to see them come back
with a renewed aggressiveness, particularly with this targeted
appropriation strategy that I think is going to be the main focus
of particularly the House people.  They see that as the lever
to really get Clinton's attention in the overall budget negotiations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So they have a renewed aggressiveness.  For what?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  For getting spending under control, basically
Congress saying, &quot;We're going to balance the budget, with
you or without you, and if you're not going to cooperate in a
larger budget agreement, then we are just going to target the
appropriations.  We are going to fund those things that the public
really wants and that we feel are important, but we are not going
to target the nonsense like Americorps paying volunteers and Goals
2000 to intrude on local education and things like that.
<p>
So I think once they start doing that and they let the President know
they are serious, he is going to have more of an incentive to
negotiate with them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us, Marty. We 
appreciate your time.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you. It was a pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we'll show you a side of 
the gambling industry you probably haven't seen and present a roundtable 
discussion with those who are fighting the billion-dollar business state 
by state. Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Gambling segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  These cities invoke images and
sparkling lights, slot machines, poker tables, and money, money,
money.  In fact, these two cities for years have been the premier
meccas for those hoping to win the jackpot of their dreams.  Yet
currently 25 states are battling to get a piece of the action
by legalizing or expanding gambling in their own communities.
<p>
The gambling industry promotes itself as pure entertainment, as
well as a provider of economic development and tax revenue increases.
It may all sound like merely fun and games, but studies indicate
the contrary.  Each year, Americans lose more than $35 billion
in gambling.  Low-income families spend five to ten times more
on lottery tickets per capita than middle-income homes.  And among
those who bought the tickets, few were winners.  They lost three
times as much to gambling than those in the upper income brackets.
Compulsive gamblers had an average gambling debt of $43,000,
and to pay for those debts, 85 percent have stolen from their
employers.
<p>
Personal debt and embezzling are not the only things
that follow the gambling industry.  For example, over and above
the monetary costs that individuals and cities suffer, Gulfport,
Mississippi, saw at least 200 percent increases in rape and robberies,
as well as drastic increases in burglary, larceny, and arson.
<p>
With all that in mind, is the thrill of the jackpot worth the
chilling consequences gambling brings to a community?
<p>
To answer that question and many others, in our next segment, <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i> presents a roundtable discussion
involving Family Policy Council leaders from several states battling
the gambling industry.  They are concerned about gambling's impact
on individuals and communities.  The Family Policy Councils work
to research key issues, such as gambling, and inform their states'
representatives and citizens of their findings, which touch the
lives of families, sometimes very negatively.
<p>
So please stay with us as we begin this engaging discussion.  You won't want 
to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back.  We are here with some of the leading experts 
on gambling, especially at the grassroots level.  They have been working on 
it for years, a very impressive roundup here at <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. But first I would like to introduce to you 
Larry Huff, who is Family Research Council Director of State and Local 
Affairs.
<p>
Larry, you have been working with these gentlemen and, I know,
have become an expert in your own right on gambling.  First, who
are we talking to today?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Okay, Kristi.  This is Paul Scianna, president of the Missouri 
Family Policy Center. To my left is David Zanotti, president of the 
Roundtables of Ohio. Michael Geer is here beside you, president of the 
Pennsylvania Family Research Institute.  And beside Michael is Mr. Bill 
Brooks, president and executive director of the North Carolina Family
Policy Council.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for being with us today. You all have come 
a long way, I know.
<p>
Frankly, though, just to start off, what's wrong with a few lottery 
tickets?  Why are you all upset by a little bit of gambling? It doesn't 
really hurt anybody, does it? Don't hit me.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, in short, I think the problem is that gambling in the 
long term has very negative impacts on two main fronts:  one, economically,
and two, socially.  And I think that is the problem that is being
borne out again and again in studies that we see, is that in spite
of all the projections that are made about the good things that
gambling will do for a community, the long-term impacts again
are very detrimental to the economics of a city and to the city's
social problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And is it to the economics of a city, or are you 
seeing it to the economics of the state?  Where is the breaking point? 
Does it stop at the border of the town that has brought gambling in, 
or does it spread out further? What are you all seeing?
<p>
MR. GEER:  I think it really spreads across the state.  But, you know, there 
was a late state senator from Pennsylvania, Alphonse Deal(?), who said that 
gambling takes the clothes off the backs of the children in his district and
the food off of their table.
<p>
So when we talk about economics, whether it is in city or a community or 
across the state, the real impact is on the very lives of children and of 
families in those communities; and as lawmakers in our state of Pennsylvania
who are considering the possible expansion of gambling, they have
to recognize that if they allow that, they are going to be taking
the clothes off of children's backs and the food off of their
tables.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But how has that happened?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it happens in a number of ways.  Number one, those who 
directly involve themselves in gambling, it is just not a winner's kind
of activity.  Gambling happens -- the reason why these businesses
exist is to take the money out of people's pockets.  So instead
of a husband or a wife or a father going down and spending their
money to buy food or to buy clothing for their family, they will
be spending it on a get-rich-quick idea, going down to a casino
or buying lottery tickets or whatever.
<p>
And it is proven time and time again, although there are some people who win, 
far and away, most people lose, and it can be an addictive behavior that 
will lose significant amounts of money and again take the money away
from them.
<p>
Additionally, then, it goes beyond that to take money out of other 
businesses in the community.  They call it economic development, but 
what has been shown in community after community where they do have legalized 
gambling -- casinos or riverboat casinos -- is that the other businesses in 
the community dry up. They go out of business, and that means jobs for 
people, and those jobs are lost, and again, those families go hungry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, I am a former Pennsylvanian.  My parents are still
there.  There has been a lottery there for a long time, a lot
of corruption that we have seen time and time again.
<p>
MR. GEER: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The balls injected with water or fluid. What
are some of you guys seeing?  I mean, it would seem like gambling
doesn't bring a clean sheet of money in; it brings a lot of dirty
money in with it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, Kristi, one of the most interesting arenas of 
corruption when it comes to gambling is political corruption. In fact, 
it is probably the most dominant and the least talked about form of 
corruption.
<p>
The casino industry has become a major political funding machine in the 
United States of America, and what they do is they use their influence once
they get into a state to then begin to manipulate the legislature
according to their own whims and wishes, which is very dangerous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do they do that, though?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Political contributions, and that has been --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So legal manipulation.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Absolutely, the legal manipulation. But what ends
up happening is situations like you have in Atlantic City, where
it starts legally, and then, the next thing you know, you have
a mayor being dragged off to prison because of the fact that it
gets illegal pretty quickly because of the influence peddling
that accompanies these large contributions.
<p>
But back to your earlier question. There are two basic themes about 
gambling, particularly about casinos, which is the rage right now, and 
that is, number one, casinos don't work.  I think everyone around the 
table agrees. They don't work as a means of economic development. And 
secondly, casinos cannibalize local economies.  They simply destroy 
human beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, some people would say, though, you
set up a casino, you get the tax revenue, you have people there
using the dry cleaners, shopping at the grocery store --
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No, that's not true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  -- and it doesn't bring business in?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No. Statistically, in fact, Robert Goodman, a professor from 
Massachusetts University, has a great new book out called <i>The Luck 
Business</i>, where he documents over 20 years of research.  Historically, 
this is the third wave of gambling in the United States.  And it helps, I 
think, to go back to a little bit of history.
<p>
Gambling has been here since the time that the boats first got here in the 
1600s. It had its first wave until about the Civil War, where the culture 
basically had enough of gambling and began to outlaw it at the state level.
<p>
The second wave began in 1931 when Bugsy Siegel succeeded in Nevada,
where he launched the first casino enterprise.  And it stayed
that way until 1976, with only one state in the Union having casinos.
Then in 1976, when Atlantic City came forward, this began the
third wave, which we are in the heart of.
<p>
After 20 years of experience from 1976 until 1996, what we now have is 
enough documentation to find out that casinos don't create jobs.  They 
actually destroy jobs.  In Atlantic City, within 10 years of the time that 
casinos came, one-third of all the restaurants were out of business.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, why is that?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Because the casino is like a giant sponge.  It sucks up the 
revenue. It sucks up the local dollar.  It sucks up the family.  And it 
leaves nothing in its wake but destitution.
<p>
MR. GEER:  They compete with the local restaurants.  For example, many casinos 
use as a draw to get people into their establishment low-cost dinners or 
oftentimes free drinks or low-cost drinks, to the point where they are not
only -- I mean, they are competing with the local restaurants
for their own business as well as then cleaning out the wallets
of those people who come in there who have no money to spend anywhere
else.  They can't buy a shirt at a department store or go get
a cup of coffee at the local diner.
<p>
So it is not only in Atlantic City but in Mississippi, in Illinois, you see 
these restaurants drying up, and other establishments as well.
<p>
MR. HUFF: With the advent of legalized gambling in Atlantic City in the last 
25 years, they have gone from something like 2,100 businesses outside of
the gambling arena to like 1,100 businesses.  So we have about
reduced in half the number of businesses that are really putting
back into the economy instead of sucking out of the economy. 
Those legitimate business have been cut in half since gambling
came in in 1976.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: You know, and Dave mentioned that gambling has been around since 
the boats got here. But I find it rather interesting that the Virginia House 
of Burgesses, which was the first representative body of the new world, among 
their first orders of business, they passed stern laws against gambling,
drunkenness, idleness, and immorality.  And so it has always been
here, and we are talking about the impact that it is having on
families.
<p>
The majority of Americans approve of some form of legalized gambling, 
but they don't want it in their own backyard. So if it's in some distant 
city like Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it's okay, but they really don't 
want it in their own backyard. And one of the reasons why is when you begin 
to increase the access to gambling, the folks who gamble the most -- 
statistics -- there is a U.S. Government study that shows that lower income
people lose, on the average, three times more as a percentage
of their income than do middle and upper class people.
<p>
So for a middle-class person who could afford to travel in years past
to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, their gambling money was discretionary
spending money.  For the folks who are gambling today and buying
lottery tickets -- which, again, lower income families buy five
to ten times more lottery tickets than middle-income families
-- for them, this is not discretionary spending money.  This is
just as likely to be food money, clothing money, their rent money,
or whatever.  And so you have a desperate person in an act of
desperation.  Once they lose this money, they only find themselves
in a more desperate state.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it's a tax on the poor, basically.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is.  It is the most regressive tax on the poor in 
America's history.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, there are cases, studies, in Massachusetts, for example, 
in some of the poorest neighborhoods that show that families making less
than $10,000 a year are buying more than $2,000 a year in lottery
tickets.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  So it's a very regressive tax. And, also, back to the point 
that there's only a certain amount of money in circulation in an economy. 
A good example of what Michael Geer was talking about is, down in Virginia,
a border state to North Carolina, where they put the lottery into
effect back in 1988, the retail markets in the southeastern corner
of Virginia, down in Virginia Beach and all that area, which is
a pretty large area, over a million people, the retail merchants
saw their sales just plummet.
<p>
So they asked their local Economic Development Board to do a study, and they 
came back and they said, &quot;You've lost $430 million in a three-year 
period.&quot; They were able to, at that particular point, put the numbers 
on that.  Once the lottery or gambling becomes integrated into the
economy, then it's much more difficult to go back and establish
a base line and see what the effects are.  But in this particular
instance, they were able to very well document the loss to the
local retail merchants.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we haven't even talked about the implications of crime 
yet on the community.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to look at more of 
the cost of gambling to a town, to a city, to a state. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. We are looking at the issue of gambling and its tremendous 
negative impacts on a community, on a city, on a family.
<p>
Larry, you've got some interesting information there, taking a look at 
gambling.  What do you have for us there?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes, Kristi.  The attorney general of the state of
Maryland, just in October of this year, last month, just released
a report measuring the impact that gambling would have on the
issue of crime, and I want to read you a brief quote.  He said
this, quote:
<p><blockquote>
&quot;The impact would be this.  Casinos would bring
a substantial increase in crime to our state.  There would be
more violent crime, more crimes against property, more insurance
fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug-
and alcohol-related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse,
and more organized crime.  Casinos would bring us exactly what
we do not need, a lot more of all kinds of crime.&quot;
</blockquote><p>
And again, this is the attorney general of the state of Maryland, who 
based this -- this is the executive summary of a long study that they
had done there in their state, with scientific measurable outcomes
on the impact that gambling has on communities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And do we believe that?  What's your perspective?  Do you 
think that crime really is a variable?
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  I think that crime definitely is a variable.  It increases 
crime. Some of the attorneys general around the country have said that. I 
think in Connecticut the attorney general up there a number of years ago 
made some very definitive statements about that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet crime is not our only problem.  When we are talking 
about crime, we are talking about an industry that sucks people into 
itself, and we have pathological gambling, compulsive gambling.  What are
you all seeing on that?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, I think again what is happening is you have people -- as 
we said in the last segment, it is a regressive tax on the poor, and when 
folks are already having a difficult time, and then they get into gambling 
as a regular habit, that puts them in a more desperate situation, and
being in those desperate situations, then they are more inclined
to be involved in desperate behavior. So I think it is just a
regression all the way from tantalizing involvement to seeing
the roots of that fleshed out in crime.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Kristi, in Ohio, our attorney general serves with our governor 
on a coalition to prevent casino gambling from passing on a statewide ballot
initiative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And we have been battling that since 1989.  We are looking at it 
again this year.
<p>
When you talk about crime, you have to understand that gambling
is an addictive form of behavior.  Everybody knows that.  Not
everybody gets hooked, but the percentage of people who do exhibit
the same criminal tendencies as other people in addicted forms
of behavior, and that especially applies to matters like property
crime.
<p>
Crime in Atlantic City went up 300 percent with the advent
of casinos.  Now, they can blame it on people, but I've got news
for you.  The correlation just is not there.  When you have a
situation where people need money to take care of their fix, they're
going to hit property crimes; you're going to have petty crimes
and this sort of thing, the aggravated personal -- these are very
much in-your-face crimes.
<p>
The other form of crime that is very aggravated with casinos and with 
expanded gambling is embezzlement, the white collar crime, where people 
who are law-abiding, decent, middle-management types suddenly, because 
of their fix, start stealing from their employer.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My understanding is that you also see, maybe through some 
of the crime issues, a decrease in property values in the areas surrounding 
casinos, even stretching 10 miles and 20 miles out away from that facility.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: That's an excellent point, and it is almost never brought up
in the debate.  That is the fact that when a casino gets in or
riverboats get in your backyard or back puddle, depending on what
it might be, suddenly the crime factor drives tax rates up because
of enforcement, which drives property rates down.  So people that
were sitting in cozy little suburbs suddenly find a new reason
for flight, and their property values go down.  So a casino in
your neighborhood could be a disastrous idea.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the issue, I know, that you all are looking at on a state 
level, people are fighting the tax issue, and yet there is a direct 
correlation between the influx of gambling and the increased cost of law 
enforcement and prison kinds of monies.
<p>
Does this resonate with the lawmakers you are talking to at all, that 
you are going to be caught paying more in police protection, more in 
prisons, more in property crimes?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it really depends on what is influencing the
legislators.  I mean, many of them are willing to look at the
debate and to understand the facts and to understand the empirical
evidence, as David has pointed out, and everyone else here, about
the reality of it.  Many of them, though, are influenced by political
contributions and other things that tend to blind them, if you
will, purposefully, to some of these factors.
<p>
But studies have been done in Alabama and in a number of different states, 
in Mississippi, in North Dakota, that indicate that, for the amount of tax 
revenue that comes into state or local officials, to the tax coffers,
they are spending more in terms of dealing with the compulsive
gambling.  When you have embezzlement, you have a situation where
there has to be money involved in that, or the social costs in
terms of helping those who are compulsive gamblers themselves,
a psychological addiction, as well as the cost of adding additional
policemen.  There is not a city that has allowed casinos in it
that has not had to significantly beef up their law enforcement
staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. GEER: Nobody wants more policemen if the reason for more policemen is 
because they have more crime, and that is what this will invite.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the costs don't always balance out, do they?  The costs 
to a community in lost property values and increased crime.
<p>
MR. GEER: Well, again, these studies indicate that actually more money is 
spent in tax dollars than they bring in, and so it is a loss.
<p>
MR. HUFF: I think the perfect example of that is in Mobile, Alabama.  Mayor
Mike Dow, who was in favor of bringing gambling in because he
thought it would enhance the economic situation in Mobile, commissioned
a study of 41 social service executives, and they found that the
impact on the cost for the city of Mobile would be $15 million
for one city alone in social service costs to counter the problems
that gambling would effect.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: This brings back up, Kristi, the issue of good public policy. 
It is not good public policy for any government agency to advocate that 
people throw their money away.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That sounds logical to me.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy, especially then when you consider 
the incredible costs that accompany this kind of compulsive behavior.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  And that is one of the ironies, too.  Many times
gambling is sold on the back of school kids.  The first thing
they will do is tell you that the lottery is going to benefit
education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And the national study shows that states that earmark some 
or all of their gambling revenues for education, less than 4 percent of 
the education budget goes towards schools.
<p>
Just last year in Missouri, less than 2 percent of the state's education 
budget came from gambling revenues, and we have the lottery and riverboat 
gambling. That amounts to a little bit less than $5 per month per student 
enrolled in public schools in grades K-12, and there is a tremendous price
tag that comes along with it.
<p>
I would just like to revisit a second this issue of the crime, because 
the industry does talk about the fact that the crime rate does not increase. 
See, they talk about in terms of crime rate, and that is the amount of 
crime per person coming through, and they say if you have an influx
of a large number of people anywhere, crime will increase.
<p>
One of the things that we have seen in Missouri is, for instance,
the little town of Branson that has a population of 33,000 people
has an influx of 6 million tourists a year, and their crime rate,
which is the incidence of crime per the number of people coming
in, has not substantially increased at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And Branson is a family town, country music and --
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: Yes.  So it is not the quantity of people coming through 
as much as it is the quality of the people that you are attracting.
<p>
The New Jersey Crime Commission said, after reviewing all the statistics,
that, in their opinion, it was inescapable that casino gambling
is a magnet for street criminals.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was interested, when I was a reporter and Indiana 
was looking at a lottery, I asked one of the state officials if they were 
going to have a state fund for compulsive gamblers.  Since we say, well,
we'll have a drunk driving program, are we going to have a state
compulsive gambler program?  And he didn't answer my question.
<p>
But what are you finding at the state level?  Who helps these
people?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, that's really kind of one of the unfortunate
things, at least in my view, in terms of how this fight has gone
on, because there are compulsive gambling organizations that have
arisen that are helping those people who are caught in addictive
gambling.
<p>
In Pennsylvania, though, what they have done is struck
a deal with those who want to bring casinos and say, &quot;You
just give us a million dollars a year and we'll keep quiet about
opposing this.&quot;  And so they, in the interest of wanting
to help people, they think if they get money in that they are
going to be able to help people, and yet they are not standing
in opposition to this.
<p>
You know, as we talk about all of these statistics that are out there, 
I think it is the anecdotal things that we hear about.  I don't think 
there is any of us that does not know someone, somewhere, who has been 
caught in the web of addictive gambling, whether it is a businessman who 
might be listening to this who knows one of their employees who is 
embezzling. I talked to one in Erie, Pennsylvania, who had a woman who 
worked for him for many, many years.  She got caught in embezzling and
then ended up having to be fired.
<p>
So there are many people who hear these statistics, and they think, 
Well, it's not going to affect my family.  But the reality is that it 
will. And so all of us who hear these things have to realize that these 
are real people who are getting caught in this.  These are real damages
that will be caused to my communities, and I'm going to have to
stand up and stop it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: You know, Michael, the thing that a lot of people aren't 
seeing now but are going to see more and more of is the issue of how this 
affects my family, my children, because statistics show that where casinos 
are, kids start showing up, and gambling is on the rise with those young 
people.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Some of the statistics that we have seen, for example, in 
Atlantic City, there was a survey that found that 25,000 teenagers or 
minors were ejected from casinos in a single year, and 230,000 were denied
admission.
<p>
If gambling is there in a community, the teenagers will want to take 
advantage of it, just as they see their parents setting an example 
and gambling themselves.  If the state is saying it's okay, then to 
teenagers, yes, that's okay; the state has said this is a fine thing for 
us to do.
<p>
And when you get down to the level of how it impacts families, it really 
destroys families. We have several chapters of Gamblers Anonymous in North 
Carolina, not started because we have gambling in North Carolina legally,
but from people who have moved down from states that have gambling,
and they have set up Gamblers Anonymous chapters because that
is the only way that they are able to continue to deal with the
problem once they recognize that they are compulsive gamblers.
 They have to be in a support group to be able to deal with that
problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there's a lot of human destruction
going on out there in the name of good government.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> 
is going to talk about some of the gambling initiatives at the local level
in each of these states.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are talking about gambling and the tremendous impact
it has on families at the state and local level.
<p>
Larry, you have worked on a lot of these gambling issues.  Where is the 
fight now as we are looking at it?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, Kristi, clearly, with lotteries in 37 states and casinos 
in 23 states and initiatives in a host of other states to bring the same 
to their own state, it is clearly on the state level.  I mean, there is a 
big push to legalize casino gambling probably more than anything else in
almost every state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: They came at Ohio in 1989 in the legislature and their 
attempt failed.  In 1990 they went to the ballot and got beat two to 
one, thumped royally.  They came back again twice in the legislature,
and now they are back again with another ballot initiative for
1996, again riverboats.  The proposal changes a little bit every
time.
<p>
But, really, what is happening in the country is the evidence
is beginning to crest against them.  They have probably hit their
high-water mark, provided that citizens are not intimidated by
their big revenue and their big sales pitch.
<p>
You know, there is gambling in 23 states as far as the casino type, but 
there are only 10 states that have it, aside from the Indian reservations,
which is now a federal issue.  So they need more states, but they
are having a tough time to get them.  Since 1994, they have been
getting beat up on the ballot regularly.  So citizens are beginning
to have an impact, but they've got to get involved.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And it is important, too, that you look at the standpoint 
that, up until now -- and the information, as Dave said, is becoming
more and more readily available, and it goes against the industry,
because states have been in this very unique position of having
to both promote and regulate gambling.  They have become so dependent
upon the revenues that they have had to promote it; by the same
token, they have had to regulate it.  And so the evidence as it
begins to mount now is going to begin to show that the decisions
that they have made in fact have cost them more money that they
make them.
<p>
It is like nutritionists say that you could eat celery
and that you would actually burn up more calories chewing and
digesting celery than what you would get nutritionally from it.
And that's the same thing with gambling.  It looks like the coffers
are full, but in the end the states are going to starve to death
if they continue to rely upon it for revenue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is astounding.  So, basically, the money -- it is 
all administrative, all, who knows, corruption, whatever, all legal fees, 
and very little in actual revenues.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is the social costs associated with it as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And it is important to note that, again, it is the money 
that it sucks out of the economy that would be spent on bread and milk,
on carpet, on furniture, on refrigerators.  Anyone who owns a
small business in the retail side, anyone who is in the restaurant
business, and certainly anybody who has an employee base of manufacturers
should fight this thing tooth and nail because they are a massive
loser, a massive loser.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. GEER: And this is not a little boy crying &quot;Wolf!&quot;  I 
mean, there is evidence.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Certainly.
<p>
MR. GEER: This book is full of the evidence of every community that has 
adopted these, with all of the promises that were made of economic 
revitalization, and it has not worked.  And it is those businessmen, those 
businesswomen who own the restaurants, who own the refrigerator/appliance 
stores or the clothing stores, (who) are the ones who are paying the
price now.
<p>
As for those communities that don't have it, those people need to step up 
to the plate and say, &quot;We're going to fight this with our dollars, 
with our influence, and get involved.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the book again is <i>The Lucky Business</i>, for 
those of you just joining us, with Robert Goodman.
<p>
So it is not the savior of a city?
<p>
MR. GEER: Not at all.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  You know, Kristi, one of the things that we have seen in 
North Carolina, for example, as the evidence has been presented -- David 
was talking about how it takes a lot of money to sell lies, but in our 
case, all we have been able to do is to actually present the evidence
to legislators and to others who would listen on the gambling
issue, pointing out how it impacts the poor, it harms the poor,
it creates compulsive gamblers, and it destroys retail businesses.
<p>
I was testifying before a Senate committee a couple of years ago,
and back in the gallery were sitting all the convenience store
owners, and they were there to testify in favor of the lottery
bill.  Well, when I presented the evidence that I shared a while
ago about Virginia, there was this little buzz that started back
in the back of the room, and after the meeting I was able to give
them more information.
<p>
They came back this time in our legislature and were against. They 
had taken a position actually against the lottery privately. Publicly, 
they had set their numbers so high as to what they had to get to sell 
tickets, so they knew nobody would buy it.
<p>
So that was an interesting case of where a group of retail businessmen 
actually looked at the numbers and said, &quot;Yes, this is really 
true,&quot; and they checked with their cohorts in Georgia on the other 
side of us and in Virginia with the convenience store people, and they 
found out, yes, this is a real revenue loser for our businesses.  So that 
is the kind of thing where just getting the information out to people and
letting them see what the facts are can really make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Has the Federal Government saying that gambling
on the Indian reservations and all these newly discovered tribes
looking for newly discovered gambling licenses, has this impacted
you all negatively as you are looking at the gambling issue? 
In some ways, the Federal Government seems to have thrown its
weight in that area on the behalf of the gamblers.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, we have seen the situation develop in North Carolina 
where we've got one tribe who is looking for recognition.  They happen
to be a tribe that is located, if in fact they are a tribe, right
on I-95, halfway between North Carolina and Florida.
<p>
MR. GEER: Just coincidentally.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, coincidentally.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Between New York and Florida.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: But we have the Cherokee Indian Nation in western North 
Carolina, and we are somewhat perplexed as to how federal law deals with
this whole area, because federal law says that the Indians can
do in a state what the state allows.  Well, we only allow bingo
in North Carolina for charitable purposes.  Well, they have been
running bingo for years, but now, all of a sudden, they have decided
that they are going to put in casinos, and they simply have gone
in and put in two casinos.
<p>
I have been out there and looked at them, and they are the same kinds of 
casinos they have in Cripple Creek, Colorado, and some of the others. They 
have all the games and the one-armed bandits, electronic now -- there is 
no arm. But they are basically doing what we think is in violation of
the federal law, and there is a real squishy area there as to
who prosecutes.  The North Carolina attorney general says it is
not his responsibility because it's a federal law.  But yet, then
you rely on the federal district attorneys to prosecute, and so
far we haven't seen anything coming out of this administration
to indicate that they are going to do anything about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is not surprising.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: This is also a tool that the industry uses against states as 
well. They pressure states and say, &quot;If you don't bring gambling in, 
then some Indian reservation will have it, and you're going to lose the chance
at getting the revenue as well.&quot;  And it is just that pressure,
that extra lever that they use to pry it in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So we are probably going to see a more federalizing, then, 
of the gambling issue, perhaps.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, the Indian question is going to have to be dealt with, 
because as the waves of gambling go, historically, once you hit the high-water 
mark, then you see things begin to roll back.
<p>
What is tragic, absolutely tragic, is what our government, with our tax 
dollars, has permitted to let happen to the Indian people.  I mean, we thought 
what happened to them the first time around was bad.  Look at what we are 
doing to them this time.  It is a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very disappointing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  And it is all going to come back, because the 
negativities of gambling will cycle.
<p>
There was an instance just in northern California. You all probably heard 
about the Pomo Palace incident on an Indian reservation just a few months
ago, where they ended up in a shooting war for 11 days, I believe
it was, or 11 people were seriously injured.  They were up and
down the streets just like in the wild, wild west that started
out over a fist fight, which started out over an election over
who would control the Indian casino, the Pomo Palace.  People
ended up dead and wounded in the streets over this matter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing. You know, obviously, we are going to have to
keep watching this.  It is not going to go away.
<p>
I would like to thank my guests for being with us today.  Please stay

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes a look at 
issues involving what some in our country see as the greatest tragedy we 
have allowed to permeate society since slavery, the sorrow of abortion. 
<p>
The pro-life movement held its annual March for Life on Monday, January 22, 
coinciding with the anniversary of the infamous <i>Roe v. Wade</i> Supreme 
Court decision. It's a case which tears the heart of our Nation in two. 
Since then, the pro-life and pro-abortion movements have been bitterly
locked together hoping to influence government and impact the
lives of Americans in the struggle.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> will bring you guests who are taking a look at 
where our country has been and currently stands in this abortion battle.  But 
the conflict goes much further than official Washington, and so we will be
talking with the new wave of pro-life activities.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to show you some of the March for 
Life participants, who are rarely allowed to express their views in the media. 
We hope to show you some faces that look familiar, because they are
the faces of your mother, your sister, or your neighbor, someone
who has an opinion with whom you can identify and not be embarrassed
by the radical tirades so often portrayed in media coverage.
<p>
Let's hear why these individuals marched for life, reasons you probably
won't read in the newspapers or see on broadcast news, as <i>Straight
Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>

<p>
[March for Life segments follow:]
<p>
MARCHER:  I don't know if I can, but I had two children out of wedlock, 
and it was my choice, and my husband and I now are proud parents because
we chose life and not abortion, and I'm sorry.  And my husband's
here for a personal reason from an older experience, and we just
think that if we could get everybody to listen to us and to know
that conception is the time that life begins and that it's not
later on, and these partial-birth abortions are the worst thing
I could ever imagine or think of.  There are plenty of us out
here who would adopt babies and who would take babies and who
can't have them, and that's why we're here, just to be heard.
<p>
MARCHER: We're hoping this makes a big impact on all the politicians
that are against the new bill that they're trying to pass.
<p>
MARCHER: Just not enough education for women, and that's why they make
the choice.  The doctors don't tell them enough and nurses don't
tell them enough, and they don't have enough education to know
that they're killing somebody and not taking a bloody mass out
of them.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as a viable alternative to this, to 
abortion?
<p>
MARCHER:  Lots of women who are raped decide that that's what they want 
to do because it was under such a vile circumstance.  But if you can just 
hang in there for nine months, just for the baby, and give enough of that 
of yourself, there's plenty of people out there who would adopt babies. I 
know there's lots of kids in foster homes now, but the problem is trying to
be solved, and there are responsible people out there who would
love to have the children.
<p>
I guess the most beautiful choice would be to raise your child, no matter 
what circumstance the child was conceived under.  Children just bring a 
great joy to your life, and I can't explain it.  You have to -- I don't 
know -- if you're a mother, you know.
<p>
MARCHER:  This is an issue that affects so many women, and what we believe is 
that, in the situation of a crisis pregnancy, the solution is to eliminate 
the crisis and not the child.  Abortion has not been the solution for women
that NOW and other so-called feminists claim it has been, and
we're here to say that you can choose life and be there for both
the woman and the child.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as the alternative for women [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER:  All kinds of situations, solutions: helping them through legal 
means, keeping their jobs, child support enforcement, getting the men in on 
this, you know, because they're half responsible, aren't they?
<p>
MARCHER: I'm here because I wanted to speak out against abortion.  I think 
that it's wrong, and I came to speak to our Congressman about it, but
I was really disappointed about the way it turned out.  The march
is going better, though.  It is more positive, and I think it
is lifting everybody up.  It's really great.
<p>
MARCHER: I'm definitely in support of getting rid of abortion.  I don't 
think it should be an option that is supported by our country.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as alternatives [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER: That we should educate young women and young men of how to protect 
themselves from getting in a situation that might cause an abortion.
<p>
MARCHER: I think adoption is a good idea.  If you can't take care of the
child, I'm sure there's somebody out there that would really like
to.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today because I'm on the battlefield for
life.  I am adamantly against death by abortion, and it's a life-and-death
issue.  You can't deny it.  If there's life in the womb, you have
to go in there to kill it, and that's what these abortionists
do, and they say, &quot;When does life begin?&quot;  It doesn't
matter.  They don't go in there and kill the life until the life
is there.  So, basically, it is a life-and-death situation.
<p>
The definition of abortion, according to Webster's dictionary, is
the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of a developing
human.  If there's death, there had to be life, and if there was
life and now death, it's murder.
<p>
The basic thing is that all women know, when they have sex, that they have 
run the risk of becoming pregnant.  They should be ready to accept the 
responsibility for their actions.  We have alternatives of adoption, we have 
crisis centers.  Every archdiocese of New York, especially our Cardinal
has said, Any woman that becomes pregnant, we will take care of
you, and if you don't want the baby, we will put it up for adoption.
 And a lot of the other bishops have said the same thing.  The
alternative is there.  You accepted the sex situation.  You're
pregnant; accept the responsibility.  Be a human being.  Don't
kill the human being within you.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today to march for life because of the sanctity and the 
beautifulness of life, and I'm so glad to see this huge crowd.
<p>
MARCHER: We are here, the marchers, because we do not agree in abortion, 
and so we would like to see the laws changed so that abortion would be 
stopped and outlawed in our land, because it is murder.  No matter how
small that little fetus is, it is a human being, and they have
not been given a right to live.  Their right has been snuffed
out before they even get a chance to protest.  People are taking
their rights from them, and as I said, they are humans.  They
are gifts of God, and they have every right to be born.
<p>
I do not wish any person, woman, teenager, that has had an abortion, I
do not condemn them.  God loves them as well as He does everyone
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our discussion about abortion and where the debate
is taking place today.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho! <i>Roe 
v. Wade</i> has got to go.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  January 22, 1996, marked the 23rd anniversary of a decision 
that became one of the most famous and controversial court cases in our 
Nation's history, <i>Roe versus Wade</i>. Jane Roe, a pseudonym for Norma 
McCorvey(?), challenged Texas' 1857 statute making abortion illegal, and 
she won, bringing us to what pro-life advocates battle against today,
the legal authority for women to abort unborn children.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS:  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and in the hour of our death.  Amen.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To remind the Nation of this landmark decision, thousands of 
pro-life activists from across the United States marched from the White 
House to the Supreme Court steps, hoping to stir the hearts and minds of
our country's leaders and citizens.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Mr. Policeman(?), tell me why unborn babies have to die.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Included in this year's March for Life was Norma McCorvey
herself.  Just a short time ago, Ms. McCorvey rocked the pro-abortion
movement by denouncing her 1973 decision and by announcing that
she had embraced the faith of so many of those who had prayed
outside the clinic doors she had helped open.
<p>
Has this stand against abortion forced women and men to consider the 
ramifications of abortion?  Or has the Nation accepted abortion as a 
viable means of birth control?  The 1996 March for Life participants don't
think so and, in marching, are sending their message loud and
clear to a nation and a world.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Pro-choice, that's a lie.  Babies never choose to die.
<p>
MARCHER: I love you, Mom.  Thanks for saving me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you could see, this year's March for Life was extremely 
successful in bringing individuals from across the Nation.
<p>
So to fill us in on why the pro-life movement is not giving up in the 
face of a pro-abortion Presidency and the liberal elite, we are talking to 
Cathy Deeds, Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research 
Council, and Frederica Mathews-Green, a syndicated columnist and author of 
<i>Real Choices</i>. Welcome.  Thanks so much for joining me.
<p>
Frederica, you've been looking at abortion -- I read a very interesting 
article of yours in <i>Policy Review</i> -- as a societal issue, and I found 
it interesting about your background that you were involved in Feminists for
Life, which to some people is probably a little bit of a non-sequitur.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  A contradiction in terms, that's right.  Well,
one of the reasons I came to Feminists for Life was that, 20 years
ago, I was a feminist for abortion.  So I have had a complete
change-around on the issue, and because of that, I am particularly
interested in persuasion and in helping people to turn around
and to begin to envision America without abortion.  We don't have
to go on with the status quo.  So I'm more concerned with that
than with politics, which kind of represents the two arms of the
movement, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's true.  What accomplished your change on the issue 
of abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I read a description of an abortion in <i>Esquire</i> 
magazine, of all places. A doctor had asked to observe an abortion when a 
friend did one, and he described the woman lying on the table, and the 
doctor took the needle and stuck it into her abdomen, and then he began
to see how that the needle began to jerk and shake as the baby
died.  It was such a horrifying description to me, and at that
time I thought it was just a glob of tissue.  It never occurred
to me there was actually a baby in there fighting for its life.
 And that turned me around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And that is pivotal, and we got to meet you. In your book, 
you were talking about why women were choosing abortion and why they were 
then, some, choosing not to have abortion.  As the pro-life movement kind 
of assesses where it is, what is moving the discussion from abortion to life?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think that, paradoxically, one of the good
things that happened was that we had some losses.  I know this
sounds ironic, but I think that the fact that the Casey decision
was in some ways a setback for the pro-life movement, that we
had Bill Clinton elected President, that we took some punches
in the last few years, has allowed our friends on the pro-choice
side to begin to examine their own ambivalence.  And we're starting
to see this come out in some magazine articles and some other
places.
<p>
And as they begin to look at their ambivalence, they begin
to admit what I had to admit, that it actually is a child, and
is this really what we want?  Do we want an America where a million
and a half unborn children are being killed every year?  That
begins to open doors toward finding some solutions, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You are noting ironically now that we have the most
pro-abortion President in the history of America, signing on the
anniversary of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, within days of his being sworn in,
a series of executive orders to take abortion even further.  And
yet abortion numbers have been going down.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN: Abortion numbers have gone down just very slightly, 
and it's one of those things you don't want to make too much of because
there are so many factors that might be influencing this.
<p>
One of the most hopeful, I think, is that polls done recently of teenage
kids say they're choosing abstinence at a much higher rate than
ever before.  The rates of children that are in high school that
are having sex before marriage are dropping and dropping.  Who
knows?  Maybe they are just coming to their senses.  But I would
certainly hope that that is one of the factors.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And then, hand-in-glove with the societal changes, we see 
change, Cathy Deeds, up on Capitol Hill.  Cathy has been up there for
quite a while.
<p>
The strategy on the issue of abortion in in some ways a hostile 
legislating environment has been interesting. It has not been a 
straight-up, let's-go-for-the-constitutional-amendment approach. 
How would you describe the strategy today as it parallels
and tracks the sort of change in abortion attitudes in the culture?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I think we have a unique situation in the 104th
Congress because we have a pro-life Congress.  The majority of
the Congress is pro-life.  That has not been the case for years
and years.  So there are some things we can do because of that.
<p>
The problem is, as we have been talking about, we have a pro-abortion
President.  So although Congress may pass very strong pro-life
bills, they will not get past this abortion President.  So we
really have to look at issues of consensus.  There are many issues
like federal funding, for example, that the majority of people
oppose their tax dollars being used to fund abortion, those kinds
of things, and Congress has passed some of those measures this
year, and a few have gotten to President Clinton when it's in
another bill.
<p>
But I think if we look at issues in this current political situation, 
where we have the majority of the people, that's a possibility.  But it 
is a difficult situation.  We have a pro-abortion President who will veto 
a straight pro-life bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in some ways a growing legal availability of
abortion has created some discomfort and led us to some consensus-possible
ground on partial birth.  The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act --
Cathy, we want you to give us an update on that -- was fascinating
because people who had never cast a pro-life vote in their entire
lives said, &quot;I'm not in favor of taking children who are
viable outside the womb,&quot; which would be the majority of
those children who are pulled from the womb, a Metzenbaum scissors
stabbed in the base of their skull, and living brain tissue extracted,
killing them, and then removing the child.  And a lot of people
cast a vote for life on that.
<p>
Cathy, what is the status of that bill?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, we talked about that a little bit on this
program a month or so ago, and yes, it's very exciting that the
bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate,
by a narrow margin, but it did pass.  The Senate added some minor
amendments that we were able to support, but therefore, the House
and the Senate have two different versions of the bill, so it
has to be worked out, and most likely the House will take the
bill up again and then it will go to the President.  I am sure
of the timing, maybe a month or so.  And, of course, he has vowed
to veto this bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  It is just incredible to think -- I mean, we have done a 
tremendous, I think, education campaign.  A number of people have seen the 
ads that actually depict this procedure.  We have talked about that, 
actually seen what's happening.  This is a partially born child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  The Supreme Court never addressed the issue of a partially 
delivered baby.  Clearly, most people think that is wrong, and as you said, 
so many entrenched typically pro-abortion members supported a ban on this.  
And yet President Clinton, who is such an extremist on this issue, is still 
going to veto this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  You know, the majority of Americans are not even 
aware that abortion can take place after the first trimester.  They think 
that it is only in that first three months, and they are appalled to know 
that there is no legal reason why you can't pull a nine-month child out and 
kill them.
<p>
What other kinds of consensus, Frederica, do you see as possible
as you look at the way that society is going on abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think one of the things that is starting to
emerge is the voice of women who have had abortions who are experiencing
terrible grief.  I believe you will be talking about that later
in this show.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  But if you have had 33 million abortions now, I 
believe, in America -- and because of the repeat factor, I am not sure exactly 
how many women that involves -- but that millions and millions of women who 
have been told that abortion was a gift to you; it's a blessing; you
should rejoice; you have no right to sorrow; you have no right
to grieve -- and they grieve in silence, but you can't keep that
inside forever -- and I am seeing a rising tide of abortion grief
breaking forth as women talk about it.  I think this may become
a really overwhelming force.
<p>
So this is something that again will continue the change in the public feeling 
about abortion.  One of the problems we've had is, we've been saying, 
&quot;It's a baby,&quot; and they're saying, &quot;No, it's a woman's 
right.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  When women start saying, &quot;No, it broke my 
heart,&quot; that shoots that argument apart.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to hold up Frederica's book, <i>Real Choices</i>.
It's the kind of book that you have to encourage people to read,
because it's the heart behind the event.
<p>
It is interesting that when I was a reporter, I interviewed a psychologist 
who was not a person of faith at all, who said that he got involved in 
post-abortion counseling because women were testing as having been sexually
violated when they reported having had an abortion experience,
women who had not been raped, not been molested, and yet this
abortion was a violation of them.
<p>
Cathy, we don't have a lot of time.  Any other bills besides partial birth 
that we need to be watching?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  There's a number of funding restrictions that we're trying 
to get enacted that are, unfortunately, bottled up in some of the 
appropriations bills that are stalled in the Senate or that the President 
has vetoed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So people need to be writing --
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  So we are working on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have to encourage people to get some pluralized(?)
sentiment in letters and read the book.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: And also, you know, we are somewhat discouraged on the federal 
level at times with a pro-abortion President, but certainly efforts could
take place on a state level, and the state legislatures are restricting
abortion funding, and there's lots going on at the state level.
So people can watch that, too.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fantastic.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we speak to an attorney
who represents those whose lives have tragically been affected
by the malpractice of abortion doctors.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would
now like to welcome Helen Donovan, an attorney who represents
individuals and their families who have been severely affected
by the mistakes which are sometimes fatal made by abortion doctors.
 It is a whole new kind of malpractice suit, and thank you so
much for joining us, Helen.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have seen some of the different random cases.  I think
one of the big differences now is this is not random at all. You represent 
one of several attorneys in a national perspective who are saying there 
are malpractice issues taking place here, and there is something we need 
to be looking at.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: They are taking place all over the country.  Ours is a small
firm, Amshoff, Donovan and Smith, and we represent women all over
the country.  There are attorneys in every state who are representing
women, but our goal is to more or less go out there and say, wherever
you are, we would be willing to look at your records and see whether
you may have a legal claim.  We don't take cases unless there
is merit to them, meaning there was malpractice, there was negligence,
there was a lack of informed consent, there are real damages.
<p>
There are many women out there who, unfortunately, have been violated
somehow, but they may not have a case.  But I think everyone would
be surprised at how many thousands of women there are out there
who do have real legitimate, alive claims, in the sense that they
meet the statute of limitations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of malpractice issues and abortion, do you find that 
that as a surgical procedure, given that I know your firm initially just 
looked at malpractice in general and now is looking at some of this 
specifically, is there a higher rate of incidence in abortion cases, in 
abortion practices, than other kinds of surgical procedures?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it would be hard to say that.  One of the problems with
the whole abortion issue is the statistics and reporting.  We
know there are deaths out there, and we know they are not reported.
We know there are sterilizations, as in life-saving hysterectomies,
that don't go reported, in all different ways of reporting, whether
they don't get reported to the vital statistics bureau or whether
they have no requirement to report them at all, you know, they
are a clinic or a doctor's office.  So it is very hard to say.
<p>
Because the procedure is so underregulated and there are many
physicians who are operating, you know, like they moved to a new
town, changed their name, and got their license renewed, I would,
in general, say that there are more complications.  Some of them
are uninsured.  Many of the physicians are uninsured, so they
just can push the woman out and that's the end of it, and they
know that she's not going to come back to their clinic when she
starts to have an emergency situation.  She is usually going to
go to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are the typically kinds of injuries that you are 
seeing? Or maybe it is not typical. But what is kind of the breadth of 
injuries?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, there is a range.  We see some conditions where the 
woman started to hemorrhage a couple of days after the abortion.  She ended
up going to the emergency room and they did another D&amp;C on
her.  Very traumatic for her, probably not a big-time case.  She
may have had retained parts.  That is very common.  She may have,
unfortunately, passed the head of the baby in the toilet.  She
is certainly traumatized by that, but it is going to be difficult
sometimes for us to find a doctor to say, &quot;Yes, that was
a breach of the standard of care, equals negligence; you've got
a malpractice case.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: And the other gamut would be death.  There are numerous 
fatalities out there, and those occur in hospitals as a result of clinic
abortions and as a result of doctor's office abortions.  Doctor's
office abortions and clinic abortions kind of get mixed together,
because many places the people presume that's an abortion clinic.
You know, it has the names on it like a clinic.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.  It has kind of the look of the traditional clinic.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  It is listed under &quot;Abortion services&quot; in
the Yellow Pages.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: It turns out that it is actually operating as a doctor's 
office, which means it doesn't have to meet any of the state requirements 
for an ambulatory surgical facility if that state has a regulation
that says abortion clinics and/or ambulatory surgical facilities
will have the following services available.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So they're sort of making it appear they have one set of 
services and having a completely other set.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, it's a doctor's office, so it has nobody measuring the 
standards or anything like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what kinds of cases are you looking at, then,
in terms of that?  What are some of the horror stories you have
seen with your own eyes?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, certainly we have a number of death cases on our docket, 
and I am reluctant to talk about our cases before there is a judgment or a 
settlement; one, because we never want to be accused of taking our case to 
the media.
<p>
But I do look in the papers and track as many other cases
as I can, and I am sure many people are familiar with the recent
conviction of the New York physician who killed a woman.  Well,
he had five -- his license was already revoked and he was appealing
it, so they still let him practice medicine, and he had numerous
other violations, and he is one who had changed his name and moved
to a new part of town.
<p>
I just heard of a terrible situation in Florida where apparently a 
girl may be facing a number of amputations because of complications.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  She was a diabetic or she had a circulation problem 
following the abortion?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I am not familiar with all the facts.  Actually, a news source
called me and asked me about that one.  Numerous young girls die
from abortion.  In Chicago, a 13-year-old; Alabama, 18-year-old;
Houston, Texas, 15-year-old and immigrant.  And that is also very
common.  Young girls who are very afraid, who aren't going to
ask lots of questions, and who also may not have a good understanding
of their own medical history.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who probably wouldn't know the questions to ask even 
if they asked a lot.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Right, or maybe they don't understand the informed consent 
form, but they're not going to ask, &quot;Yeah, I'd like to really talk
to the doctor about this informed consent form.  I'd like to have
him explain to me what perforation means or what hemorrhage means.&quot;
You know, they are not going to go into the details that that
might require.  Or if they do ask, they are going to be told,
&quot;Oh, don't worry about those.  That never happens.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What have you seen in terms of jury reactions and
judge reactions to the emotional trauma issues?  I mean, so often
pain and suffering is the jury button to push, it would appear.
So for a person who did pass a head, did pass limbs, and was
traumatically faced with the fact that there is a person inside
myself who has died and I am very traumatized by that, are juries
and judges at all empathetic to that for these women?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it varies.  There are some precedents where women 
who did pass the baby afterwards did recover for emotional damages,
and that would be sort of strictly emotional images.  There are
other cases where that gets no sympathy.  I would say that judges
and juries vary as Americans vary, and it is very difficult to
predict in any case how it is going to go.
<p>
Many people have no sympathy for the woman who chose an abortion, 
regardless of the fact that this is medical care provided in their 
community, and it is obviously substandard, and you would think that 
everybody would be just as concerned about this procedure as any, but --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time yet, but have the feminists
and some of the liberal women's organizations come alongside you?
 I mean, this would seem like a women's health issue; yet my understanding
is that women have distanced themselves from it.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Well, I would say that the radical feminist movement would 
like us to just shut up and go away.  We are often portrayed as just
harassing doctors and clinics and things like that, which is hardly
the case.  We cannot afford, both money or resource-wise, to prosecute
any case that is not meritorious.
<p>
So we hope in the long run they will see that they have as much interest 
in protecting women from unsafe clinics and doctors as we do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you would.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will be talking to a man who took
it upon himself to help women in crisis pregnancies.  Please stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about abortion and its 
effects on individuals' lives, and I am joined by Woody FitzHugh, a golf 
professional who has a testimony of his own and decided to given women a 
viable option to abortion.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Thank you, Kristi.  Nice to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for being with us.
<p>
You have been interested in the pro-life movement for quite a while, but 
how initially did you decide to get involved in creating an alternative? 
We will get into what the alternative is in a second.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Okay. Well, the transformation in my life I owe to two 
people who inspired me.  Firstly would be Jesus Christ and secondly is
my wife, who has stuck me all these years and been very supportive
in everything I've done.
<p>
It was actually in 1994 when, as Bill Clinton became President and he 
signed a fetal tissue research bill on June 10, I just had a furious 
feeling towards him and I wanted to something to help the situation, 
and I began studying about the situation and found out that it seemed 
to be considered by most people to be a women's issue.  We all know, 
if you think about it, that it's not just a women's issue.  There is a 
man involved every time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: So I felt like I could do something, and I wasn't going to 
go shoot a doctor or anything, so I felt like as I grew and matured as
a Christian that that is when I felt like I heard from God in
not to be a fanatical way but in my own spirit that I ought to
do something to help this situation, and that is how the idea
came about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the idea was -- now, to go back to your man comment 
for a second, did you feel like, look, I don't care if I'm not allowed 
in here, that I want to get into this issue?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  I feel like this is the most
heinous crime that has ever befallen this country, and there has
to be something done to stop it.  We are losing babies every 20
seconds.  We are losing entire generations at a time, and there
seems to be no one out there standing up and saying, &quot;Hey,
this is really wrong.&quot;  I mean, I know there are many of
us who are, but according to, if you read the liberal media and
what not, they have control, and so you very seldom hear anything,
and I just felt a great desire to get involved and do what I could.
<p>
I mean, I am one person.  I am not an expert, as the other panelists
were, but I felt a desperate need to do something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, you are a golf professional, and you have a long 
history in sports.  And so what did a sportsman decide to do?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Well, I was at a golf tournament at the time it happened, 
and I had a revelational experience in which I felt that the best
thing for me to do was to be an open home in which the women could
come as an alternative to abortion and be protected, have shelter,
have services rendered to them, have a Bible study perhaps or
some kind of a training program, job training and some nursing
care, and so that is how the idea began, and two years later --
we actually purchased the house on January 22, 1994, the anniversary
of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and now we just passed our second year, and we
are very close to opening the doors.  About another week, we will
be letting the girls in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And what is so fascinating about your story, Woody, is 
that -- I mean, here you are, a man in your community that has been 
involved. You took your own money and you bought a house to make a place 
for women and their children, which is pretty amazing.  I mean, what has 
been the reaction of the community to your gesture to reach out to these 
women?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: We have had so much support from really everyone that
it has been a wonderful experience from the very get-go.  We have
had laborers, construction workers, wanting to help, donating
their time, helping to build the entire house.  We actually had
to renovate the entire house.  It was an 1891 hotel which was
very dilapidated at the time that we took possession of it, and
so it needed all kinds of work, and the volunteers just came from
all the churches and all different kinds of walks of life, and
laborers, and we have doctors now who are going to deliver the
babies for free; we have nurses who are going to go check on the
girls; we have just support from every angle, and it has been
a wonderful thing.  It is very exciting to see it unfold.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And where will the girls come from?  How will girls
hear that this is a home that they can come and live in -- right?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Right, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And stay and get some training and some support, and you 
don't throw them out when they have the baby; you are going to help 
them segue into the community.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  We have job training, as I said, and they 
will be learning to do some kind of vocational skill, and we will allow 
them to stay at least six months after the pregnancy comes to term, and 
we will do that to help get them back on their feet, because the worst 
thing to do is just to shelter them until the baby is born and then say, 
&quot;Thanks a lot. See you.  Next girl, come in.&quot; We want to make a 
change in their lives.
<p>
We want to save the children, and we want to give them a good start in 
their lives beyond the time that the baby is born.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  How will girls come to you?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Sorry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we want to give a phone number, too.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Yes.  The girls will come to us from the various pregnancy 
centers as well as from any church counseling.  Pastors, if they find out 
that a girl in their church has gotten pregnant, they will send them to us. 
And, basically, crisis pregnancy centers throughout the area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This is very exciting.  For anybody that wants more information, 
they can call us at Family Research Council.  Thank you so much, Woody,
and to all my guests.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council, has to say regarding the abortion issue 
in his speech given to those involved in this year's March for Life.  Don't go 
away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We now bring you
a portion of the speech given at the March for Life Rose Dinner
by Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.  Gary
presents thought-provoking insights into the abortion debate.
Let's take a look as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you our Homefront News.

<p>
[Segment from March for Life Rose Dinner follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you very much.
<p>
I want to talk to you this evening not only about the direct subject
of the sanctity of human life but also about our country and the
relationship of the sanctity of human life to America and to its
future.
<p>
I fell in love with America a long, long time ago, as
I know each and every one of you did, too.  And so it's worth
it for us tonight to think about our country and about its hopes
and dreams and about its fears and nightmares.
<p>
You know, there's that great old book that I am sure all of you are very 
familiar with, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens, and you may 
remember that the book begins with that wonderful line, &quot;It was the
best of times and it was the worst of times.&quot;
<p>
Now, the line was obviously written about England and France many years 
ago, but I believe it is a perfect description of America in 1996.
It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.
<p>
You know, there are many ways that you can measure a great nation.  You
can measure it by the strength of its military or the growth of
its economy or the gleam of its cities, and by those measurements
the United States is a great nation.
<p>
But you can also measure a nation by how many of its children cry themselves 
to sleep at night, and the fact of the matter is that tonight in America 
too many of our children will cry themselves to sleep.  Too many children
abandoned, too many children without a father's arms to comfort
them.  Too many children already exploited through pornography
or slaves to drugs or sexually abused.
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, by those measurements, the United States is in danger 
of becoming something other than a great nation.  And to top it all off, 
1.6 million of those children, this year and every year, will not
even make it out of the womb alive, and by that measurement, we
are in danger of becoming something less than a great nation.
<p>
I believe there is a sense in the United States today that we
are all one wrong turn away from a disaster.  And so what in the
world happened to this shining city upon a hill that the founding
fathers wanted and tried to give to us?
<p>
I think the first thing that happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our streets and our 
neighborhoods and our communities.  How ironic that that would happen here,
of all places.  Every one of us has in our pockets, or you ladies
in your purses, money that says, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot;
and the phrase has become as cheapened and as devalued as the
money it is printed on.  Lincoln called us the almost chosen people.
<p>
But to listen to the experts today, you would think the greatest
danger facing America is that men and women of faith like you
may actually go into the public square and assert God's word on
issues like the sanctity of human life or what it is we owe to
those who are more disadvantaged than us, and I am here to tell
you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, that unless you go into the
public square, America will not survive in the next century.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The second thing that has gone wrong is that we have neglected
and failed as a culture and a society to pass on the great traditions
of our culture to our children.  We could spend all evening talking
about that issue alone.  Our children sit on the shoulders of
giants.  And yet the research shows that most American young people
have no idea of the sacrifices that have been made for the liberty
that they have today.
<p>
I think the third thing that has happened is that we have allowed 
Washington, D.C., and the people in Washington to become our masters 
instead of our servants.  And I don't point to any particular party; I 
point to both parties.  It's time for us to remind both parties that our 
liberty comes from no man; it comes from God.  It doesn't come from the 
President of the United States; it doesn't come from the Speaker of the 
House. It comes from God, and it is guaranteed to us by the original
contract with America, the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The fourth thing that has happened -- and perhaps this should be at the 
top of the list, because all of these really are related to one another
-- is the issue that brings you here every year, that in this
country we have allowed the sanctity of human life to evaporate
and slip through our hands, and we pay the consequences every
day, not only in abortion but in city streets that we are fearful
to allow our own children to walk on.
<p>
Now, it is impossible to come to Washington, D.C., and have a dinner like 
this and not have a speaker like me turn to the question of politics.  And
so I know in an audience like this that there are both Republicans
and Democrats, and I want you to have patience with me because
I am going to insult you both.  Let me begin with the Democratic
Party, because that is the one that is easier for me to insult.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
You know, I grew up in a Democratic home, a blue-collar family, and 
whether you are a Democrat or not, you have to concede that the Democratic 
Party, over the years, has been the party of the little guy.  They were 
there at the beginning of the civil rights movement.  They were there to 
build a safety net for the poor in the United States, and they deserve great 
credit for being there for the little guy and when working men and women 
were organizing in the factories of America.  It is a great history and 
tradition that the Democratic Party has.  But on this issue, they have 
abandoned the littlest guy of all.
<p>
Let me share some letters with you. Here's a letter written back in the 
early 1970s. &quot;While the deep concern of a woman bearing an unwanted 
child merits consideration and sympathy, it is my personal feeling that 
the legalization of abortion on demand is not in accordance with the values 
which our civilization places on human life.  Wanted or unwanted, I
believe that human life, even at its earliest stages, has certain
rights which must be recognized:  the right to be born, the right
to love, the right to grow old.&quot;
<p>
Now, that couldn't have been said better by Nellie Gray or Jim Dobson. 
That was written by Ted Kennedy in 1971.
<p>
Here's a telegram in 1977, an open letter to Congress: &quot;As a matter 
of conscience, I must oppose the use of federal funds for a policy of 
killing infants.&quot; The sender of the telegram is referring to the 
effort in Congress at the time to subsidize abortions, and he called it 
killing infants. Was that written by Jesse Helms?  No, that was a telegram 
sent by Jesse Jackson on September 6, 1977.
<p>
Here's one written in 1986: &quot;In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal 
funds for what is the taking of a human life.  It is my deep personal 
conviction that abortion is wrong.&quot;  Signed by then Senator Al Gore,
now the Vice President of the United States, who is sent by President
Clinton all over the world to promote abortion on demand.
<p>
And speaking of President Clinton, here is a letter in 1986 signed
by then Governor Bill Clinton:  &quot;I am opposed to abortion
and to government funding of abortions.&quot;
<p>
What happened to these men between the time that they wrote these letters 
and today is that they sold their souls for political gain, and they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
Now, what about the Republican Party?  Well, all during the 1980s, the 
Republican Party provided the leadership for the pro-family and pro-life 
movement, and I was proud to serve in the Reagan Administration during those 
years. But having said that, I also don't have to remind you that there
are some party leaders, some pollsters and pundits in the Republican
Party walking around with their finger up in the air trying to
figure out which way the wind is blowing and ready to sell you
out on this issue.  And it just doesn't come from those in the
liberal wing of the party.
<p>
So I am here tonight to say to the National Democratic Party and to the 
weak-kneed Republicans, of which there are some, that if neither of you 
know how to turn saving babies into a winning political issue, the American 
people may eventually decide that neither of you deserve to be the governing
party of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break. Stay tuned to

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at Congress 
in 1996 and asks, with the budget in limbo, are you getting all the government
you're still paying for?
<p>
With the primaries already under way and members gearing up to defend their 
seats, what issues will be at play?  Tonight's guests give us their predictions. 
You won't want to miss hearing their inside perspectives from those
who work closely with Congress on both the Senate and the House
sides.  And you will hear from one freshman Congressman from the
class that the media tells us is terrorizing the politicians living
inside the beltway.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> invites you to hear from Gary Bauer, 
president of the Family Research Council.  A political veteran, Gary not 
only shares with you some of his predictions on the 1996 issues; he offers some 
hope for the future of the American family.  There are steps we can take to make 
a difference.
<p>
Although Gary is seen on various newscasts and quoted in many
newspapers, for the full story, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind
the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Gary, we are in an election year, and it is always
interesting how the way people campaign isn't the way they necessarily
govern, and there is always new information coming out.  What
do you see in the budget debate this year that sort of highlights
that phenomenon?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, this is one of the serious problems facing the 
country, because I think the American people, by and large, have concluded 
that Washington doesn't speak the truth; that the politicians in Washington, 
D.C., play fast and loose with the facts, and now we have some recent 
evidence that I think is pretty disturbing.
<p>
Both sides in the budget debate were assuming and predicting that the Medicare 
Trust Fund would run a surplus last year.  The estimates were it would be as 
high as $4.7 billion.  Now that the Medicare debate is over, we discover
that instead of a $4.7 billion surplus, there was a $35 million
deficit.
<p>
Now, clearly, the Clinton Administration had to know that by the time the 
debate was going on.  These figures come in every month.  Right about the time 
the debate would have been at its peak, the Clinton Administration had to know 
that this massive deficit was going to appear, and yet they did not announce
it until after the debate was over and, not coincidentally, their
side had won.
<p>
So I can certainly understand the cynicism level that you see among the 
American people, which is a very disturbing thing for a democracy when, 
particularly, citizens and young people decide that they can't trust those who 
would lead them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have seen that people mean a lot of things when they talk
about balancing the budget, and in the same way they have meant
a lot of things when they talk about being pro-family.
<p>
You wrote a book that deals with that, Gary.  Tell us a little bit about it.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, I just got real tired of people who believe
in traditional values being smeared and stereotyped as being bigots
or extremists or radical right or Christian right, all these terms
we hear thrown around.  I look at the agenda that we believe in
and that most of the people who support us believe in, and it
is a pretty mainstream agenda.
<p>
So we decided to write a book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, in which we 
would describe what America would look like if my side won, if we were the 
Hollywood movie producers, if we were running the school boards and had the 
White House and the Congress and the university presidencies, and so
forth.
<p>
I think the America that I describe in that book is an
America that 80 percent of the American people want; that is,
a country with safe streets and schools that work and traditional
values and kids who are being raised the right way again.
<p>
Our hope is this year that a lot of people will read that book and
it might help provide some context for them as the debate goes
on in 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of my favorite things in this book
is the yes or no questions at the end that really help people
understand exactly what is happening.  Why did you put those in?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, one of the hardest things to pin down is an
American politician.  I don't know if many of our listeners have
ever written to members of Congress or not, but if they have,
they will find that almost no matter what position they take,
the member of Congress, when he writes back, seems to find some
way to actually agree with them even though, when you look at
the voting record, they are voting against many of the things
their constituents are writing about.
<p>
What we try to do in this book is, as you point out, at the end of each 
chapter, give a couple of questions that a citizen can ask somebody running 
for school board or for Congress or the Senate or for the Presidency
that are very clear, have yes or no answers, and leave very little
wiggle room, as we call it in Washington, D.C., for a politician
to be able to deceive or to get around the truth.
<p>
And again, our hope is that a lot of citizens, armed with these questions 
and with the facts, will be able to make more valid judgments about
who is speaking for them and who is not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, right now, Hillary Clinton also has a book out, and 
she's on the author's circuit.  Yet her vision of family is very different
from the vision you describe.  How is that impacting you?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, there is a really telling quote in Hillary Clinton's
book that you really have to think about, and as we all thought
about it, it became more and more disturbing.  Mrs. Clinton says
in her book, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
<p>
When you read the book, you discover that what she means is that
she has a vision that government ought to play a major role in
the raising of children, whether it is government day care or
government intervening in education or government making judgments
about what should or should not be taught, and so forth.
<p>
Our vision is diametrically opposed to that.  We believe that parents are
the first and most important teachers that a child has; that they
bear the ultimate responsibility for what those children ought
to be taught.  And so we kind of welcome the fact that Mrs. Clinton's
book is out at the same time as ours, and quite frankly, I would
be quite happy if I could engage her in a debate about American
families and American children and the proper way to go.  Kids
don't need more bureaucrats in Washington; they need more people
who love them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't government have a role?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, certainly there are things that government can do
to make family life easier, and we can probably all tick them
off fairly easily, whether it is lowering taxes on families so
that hard-working mothers and fathers can keep more of what they
earn or something like educational choice, which would enable
parents to choose the schools they want to send their children
to.  So there are things that are reinforcing to what the average
mother and father is attempting to do.
<p>
The problem comes up when government attempts to replace those parents, to 
have a bigger role than the parents or the family has in the nurturing of 
those children.  We have 100 cases of that, examples of that.  We look
at programs like welfare, which might have been very well intentioned
but in fact have in many ways destroyed the inner-city family.
<p>
So a lot of what government does ends up being very hurtful, and
many of the good things that government could do to help families,
it just doesn't do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you hope to accomplish with <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I realize Americans are busy.  There are 101 challenges and 
time demands, and so forth. I would be happy if I could just get a large number 
of average Americans to read this book, have a better sense of what the 
pro-family movement is all about, and perhaps be just a little bit more 
educated when they look at public policy issues and look at those who are
attempting to get their votes.
<p>
You know, with all the influences that are on us, all the paid advertising, it 
is tough to know how much influence a book like this can have, but I know that
Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family has set a goal of distributing
a million copies of this book by the end of the year, and I think
if that actually happens, it could have a major impact on the
public policy debate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Dr. James Dobson has partnered with you, and Focus on the Family 
has published <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, hopefully, to put forth a positive 
image. Do you think that this book could help with the cynicism that is really 
rampant in American politics today?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Cynicism is really a killer in a democracy.  People have got to have 
some degree of faith in their government, in those who would govern them.  I am 
an optimist about the ability to reform Washington and to turn the
country around, and so if <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, if that book
in some small way gives people a sense of how things could be
better, then I think it would be a very positive contribution
to the debate this year and beyond.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us today, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> begins
our discussion of the congressional year ahead.  Please stay with
us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. To begin our look ahead at what Congress has in store for 
1996, I am joined by Bret Bernhardt, Legislative Director for Senator Don 
Nickles; Marshall Wittmann, Director of House Relations for the Heritage 
Foundation; and Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's Assistant 
to the President for Government Relations.
<p>
Welcome to the show, gentlemen. Predictions are such a fun thing to do. It 
is the beginning of an election year, and yet the end of the legislative 
session.
<p>
Let's just kind of go around.  Marshall, what do you see as sort of 
the top five, top ten issues that you think are going to be really hot in 
Congress?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, I think the main issue is going to be the
divisions between Clinton and the Congress, liberal versus conservative,
on every issue, I think, coming down the pike.  Congress will
try to remind the American people that Bill Clinton is a liberal
and they are conservative.  So you are going to see issues like
immigration, you are going to see issues like tax limitation and
the balanced budget amendment be revisited in the House of Representatives.
Education may be another issue.  Another key issue will be the
partial-birth abortion veto, which has already passed the Congress.
We expect Clinton to veto it.  There may be an override fight.
<p>
But every issue, you will see Congress reminding the American
people that Bill Clinton is no conservative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And who is going to win that?  I mean, I think we have seen 
that Bill is pretty good when it comes to telling that kind of story. 
How do you think they are going to be able to play the game?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, the ultimate decision will be made by the American 
people in November when they vote in the election, and I think that they
will be the major arbiter of who wins this fight.
<p>
The past year we have seen the first skirmishes in trying to make 
government smaller.  Now, Clinton might have won the first round, but I 
think the most important round will be fought in November.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marty, what do you think?  You have been on the Hill a long 
time, and welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. What do you see as moving 
the Congress forward in 1996?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think we are going to see some continuing focus 
on the budget, balanced budget.  With the governors' recent conference, there 
seems to be a renewed focus on a possible balanced budget agreement that
would be between the President and the Congress.  So I think that
is going to happen.
<p>
The question of what is going to happen with family tax relief is of great 
concern to Family Research Council, and some other policy matters that are 
still unresolved. We have had the Labor-HHS bill stalled in the Senate. We 
have some important pro-life concerns on that legislation.
<p>
I think Marshall is right that there are going to be some bright lines drawn 
between the President's rhetoric and his true positions on some issues.  The
challenge in some cases is going to be getting these through the
Senate.  I know Bret is well aware that there is quite a challenge
on the Senate floor with the amendment process and the lengthy
debate, and so on, that it is much easier to control the process
in the House and get some very stark legislative proposals brought
up, and certainly the partial-birth bill moved much easier in
the House than it did in the Senate, but it has passed both and
will be onto the President's desk sometime soon.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bret, I do want to hear your predictions as well, but 
the bright line -- they always say it is a little harder to draw a
bright line in the Senate than the House.  Would you agree?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: Yes, I think that is right.  In the Senate it
takes roughly about 60 votes to get something through that is
very controversial because of the filibuster that is able to be
done by the Democrats in the Senate.
<p>
I think you will see -- and I agree with what Marty and Marshall have said 
here -- that in the Senate you will probably -- and I would imagine the 
House to a great degree, also -- moved as consensus items here initially,
and as we have seen with the welfare with the governors having
put together a consensus bipartisan-type package, that will probably
begin moving here fairly soon, and that could be then the sparkplug
that then gets the budget negotiation ignited again.
<p>
And then later on we will move into some areas in which we define the 
Republicans' agenda and get us ready for the elections in the fall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are nonpartisan, of course, Marshall.  However, in 
terms of defining the Republicans' agenda, that is a lot of items on
the table.  How would you define it?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, you know, one thing we have to make clear is that Bill 
Clinton wasn't exactly telling the truth when he tried to cast himself as 
Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address.
<p>
What will happen is that there will be a number of issues.  It might be 
through the appropriations process, where we try to show that Bill Clinton
is on the side of big government, and Republicans and conservatives
want smaller government.  It might be on the issue that Marty
touched upon, family tax relief.  And it might be on these important
social issues such as the pro-life issues.  It may be on the issue
of racial preferences.
<p>
So there will be a number of issues that will come down the pike, I expect, 
this year that Congress will try to make that distinction, because, as we know, 
Bill Clinton is a very good talker, but you have to look at what he does and
not what he says, and Congress will be trying to point that out
to the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is very ironic. In one week he makes a very wonderful, 
warm speech, and in another he brings us back Dr. Henry Foster in a program that 
won't talk about teen sex, just teen pregnancy, which was a tad surprising.
<p>
But tax relief, everybody from the <i>Washington Post</i> to the <i>New
York Times</i> tells us that we could all get along without tax relief.
Is that your assessment, Marty?  Is tax relief holding us up
on the budget?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we don't believe it is holding us up. The 
question is, with those people who want to get rid of tax relief, is their 
agenda to really reduce the deficit or is it to have more money available 
to spend on more social programs?  I think that the answer is the latter, 
that they really want to use that money to spend it.
<p>
There is some talk of trying to separate the two, do the budget reduction 
first and then come back to the tax package.  But I don't think that is 
likely to happen.  I think that, particularly in the House, the leadership
is committed to doing that as a package if there is to be a package,
and there has been discussion on the debt limit bill of at least
doing a first installment of family tax relief and probably at
least capital gains reduction of some sort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, a lot of people are reporting that there probably will 
not be any budget agreement made, that we will just live on continuing
resolutions, spoon-fed every now and then, until the election,
and then that will be one of the shining lines drawn.  Do you
all agree with that?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: I think that if that is the case, if we don't get a budget 
agreement, we will continue on in that process.  But I think, as I said 
earlier about the welfare agreement being the catalyst for producing a 
budget agreement, you could have a situation where you will have room for 
a tax cut, and if you get in the area of $150 billion, say, we have
plenty of room for the child tax credit, capital gains, and a
few other items that we have had in the contract and other items
we have been pushing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the new kids in town, sort of courtesy of Mr. Forbes, 
has been the flat tax.  Does this draw any lines for us, or do you think the 
welfare reform, the pro-family tax relief, and some of the other thing -- 
immigration -- will supersede?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the flat tax will be an important issue in the 
election.  I don't expect that Congress will overhaul the tax code this 
year.  But what the flat tax points out is how much money has gone from the 
family in Washington, and you have all these special interests in Washington 
who play the tax code, except Mom and Dad back at home at the kitchen table
don't have those lobbyists at Family Research Council fighting
them.
<p>
But what the flat tax does is draw that distinction between
those for big government and those for smaller government.  And
I think that will be debated.  It will be the great debate of
1996.  But I don't think there will be any congressional action
other than hearings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think the flat tax is as big an issue, like devolution 
was, like let's make government smaller, let's make the tax flatter?  Does it 
have that kind of power?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT:  I don't think it does as much as smaller
government.  We tried this in 1986, and a lot of blood was let
in coming up with that 1986 package.  It started out as a flat
tax, and look what we ended up with.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: So I think there is a lot to be said. It is going
to be a long ways before we get to an actual flat tax.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Marty, as you kind of look at the war of 
the issues?  Where do you think pro-family Americans are really going
to be looking?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think a lot is going to really focus on the 
cultural agenda, what are our children learning, what kinds of influences 
are affecting them in society, what kinds of dangers are they exposed to 
in the area of crime and drugs and things like that.
<p>
I think there is still very deep underlying concern about issues like that, 
and I think families are going to look to see what is the government doing 
to make the world and the country a safer place for their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Can they offer anything?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Government?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For the family.
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: What government can do is get out of the way. So often 
government makes decisions, whether it is in terms of Goals 2000 education, 
whether it is in terms of the tax policy, where they tell moms and dads what 
to do, how their children should be educated.  In large part government needs
to stop being an obstacle to families, and over the last 40 or
50 years we have seen that time and time again, whether it is
values or economic issues like taxes.  Government steps upon the
territory that should be the preserve of the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are kind of coming to the end of our time.  Marshall, 
we wanted to ask you quickly, I think it was very much a surprise to people
yesterday when Pat Buchanan actually won in Louisiana, and by
no small margin. What is your assessment of that?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, more than anything else, it underscores the volatility
of this election period.  We saw that in 1994; to some degree
in 1992.
<p>
The other interesting part is the role that social conservatives
played in that vote.  If you look at the vote, the reason that
Buchanan did so well because of the strength of social conservatives.
So people of faith and family are having an impact and will have
an impact this year, and those people who ignore them do so at
their peril.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I don't think that is a surprise to any of the people 
here. Thank you for being with us.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a children's
issue that has a lot of parents worried:  education.  What do
the upcoming semesters hold for America's students?  After this
break we'll find out. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would like to
welcome guests who have the inside track on our country's educational
issues:  Amy Myers, Press Secretary and Government Relations Director
for the Eagle Forum; Hans Meeder, Professional Staff for Long-Range
Policy and Planning from the Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee; and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy Analyst
for the Family Research Council.
<p>
Thank you for joining us.  Thank you for having a smaller title.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
We are taking a look at all the issues coming up in 1996.  We have looked 
at the Hill. But education is very near and dear to a lot of people's hearts.
Hans, why don't we start with you?  Where do you see education
issues going in 1996?
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, I think that the key that we are going to have to work 
on in 1996 is that President Clinton is continuing to have a barrage of lies 
about what creates quality solutions for our children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give me an example.
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, he basically has created a Goals 2000 program
to basically have federal control over curriculum content and
the direction of education reform.  They continue to put money
into programs like the Title I program and Head Start, which are
30 years old, have been reformed five or six times, and still
the studies show that they have no lasting impact on our children
for good, and if anything, they might actually perpetuate some
bad practices.
<p>
And yet, at the same time, what we see really works
for kids at the local level are parental control and involvement
over education, strong local commitment and flexibility, and a
strong focus on academics.  It is really not that complicated.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So how do we get there?  Give me a quick one on
how we get there.  Then, Amy, we are going to ask you.  How are
we going to achieve it?
<p>
MR. MEEDER: It is not one silver bullet that will fix it, but the first 
step that we are going to work on is identifying how many federal programs 
are out there, what the federal role really is, and then start a process 
of trying to turn back as much control locally as possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amy, what do you see?  We are looking at education in 1996.
What is going to come up?
<p>
MS. MYERS: Well, I think you will see a lot of issues that come up.  Whether 
or not they go anywhere, we will see.  The House of Representatives tends to 
be a little bit more favorable toward parents and local control, whereas the
Senate is still a little bit behind schedule on that.  And, of
course, you have President Clinton, who thinks that only Washington
knows how to control education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. MYERS: I think through the appropriations process we might see the 
defunding or cutting back on a number of programs that a lot of 
conservatives feel are detrimental to the --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How about Goals 2000?  A lot of concern for that.  Do you think 
we will see a cut in Goals 2000?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  Well, we did see a cut in the House version of the appropriations 
bill, which was zero funding. In the Senate version it was fully funded. So 
we probably will not see Goals 200 eliminated.
<p>
It is a two-fold process. You eliminate funding as well as repeal the law. 
Goals 2000 does not have a lot of money in it compared to other programs. 
However, it does have a lot of the federal strings.  I think that is what 
is most concerning to a lot of American families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To have you do this analogy quick for me, Jennifer, you said 
one time that if you look at every educational dollar, the government throws
in a few pennies and then controls the spending of the rest.
How does --
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  That is right.  It is something like on the order of 6 
to 7 percent of the Federal Government contributes to local education; 
yet I don't know how much percentage of the actual mandates and regulations 
are actually coming from the Federal Government. So you can tell that they 
have really got the beast by the nose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been kind of interesting because
some states have said, &quot;Okay, we won't take that federal
money,&quot; and I am sure parents in those states initially think,
you know, we've lost all this money, when they have lost a fraction
of what it takes to run local schools.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: That is right.  Something like $2 per student per year, 
something that you could buy a sandwich with at McDonald's, and what you 
have to do for that money is form a state school improvement panel,
form local panels, revise your curriculum, submit proposals to
the Secretary of Education, for $2 per student.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: Ridiculous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think is going to come up in 1996?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, we hope that there will be a great discussion on the 
federal role in education, and we are especially looking forward to 
consideration of the back-to-basics bill, which would shut down the Department
of Education and block-grant those programs for a period of four
years.
<p>
What we would really like to see, and this would mean an
end to the federal role in education, would be a tax cut at the
end of that time to return the money to the people who are putting
it in the pot right now, so they could run education at the local
level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Hans, what does your organization see as
the likelihood of that?  Do you think long term -- even in 1996,
short term -- we could see the end of the Department of Education?
I have heard its death knell before.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Well, the thing that we have to realize, most Americans 
don't really know the difference between -- I hate to say this -- but
between local, state, and federal involvement, and that is why,
when the President starts talking about extreme cuts to education,
which, at the most, we are talking about one-half of one percent
of national education spending, is what we are talking about reducing
at the federal level, but when he starts throwing that kind of
talk around, people get very nervous, because most people are
very supportive of education in general, and we have seen polling
that shows that of the general public, only about 19 percent right
now support eliminating the Department of Education, and almost
80 percent oppose it, and a lot of it because they don't understand
what the Department of Education at the federal level really does.
<p>
We feel that in order to do it successfully, we have to undergo
a very big education effort to show people the massive proliferation
of programs.  Just to let you know, the Department of Education
itself has about 250 education programs, maybe a little bit more
than that.  But we are in the process of identifying several more
hundred education programs already spread across the Federal Government.
<p>
What our members don't want to do is get rid of a couple hundred
programs and an agency and yet still have the Federal Government
very involved in education, and then we all think the problem
is solved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Because they have put those programs maybe under 
Agriculture or under another department.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Same thing, but just a different way of paying for it.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Hundreds of programs have cropped up over the last 40 years. 
Basically, any Congressman or Senator that wanted to say they were for 
education created a new program, and we have multitudes of Indian ed programs, 
science programs. Unfortunately, very few of those programs are really 
focused on basic academics, the reading, math, and science, and many of
them are just kind of special interest buyoff programs.
<p>
So we feel that before we can really move on restructuring the federal
role, we have to know what is out there and then educate the public
on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Phyllis Schlaffly has been a real leader in that. 
I mean, she has worked very hard on education issues. What is her 
perspective on the back-to-basics approach?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  I think that we and Phyllis have said that the back-to-basics
approach is a good step in the right direction.  It does not eliminate
the federal role in education; however, it does definitely move
us toward that direction.
<p>
We don't think that there is a constitutional role for the Federal 
Government to be involved in education, and that is how we would 
eventually like to see things end up.  Given the current Congress and the 
current President, we don't see that as a realistic goal in the 104th 
Congress.  You don't have a Senate that will do anything and you don't 
have a President that will sign it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's the hard part.
<p>
MS. MYERS: Yes. But we would like to see an end in the federal role in 
education, and just to add on to what Hans had said, I know that their 
committee has shown well over 660 programs throughout all of the agencies
in the Federal Government that are involved in education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One thing we know about government is it grows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
Thanks so much for being with us.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear from one of the 
freshman class of lawmakers, Congressman Dave McIntosh. Please stay 
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I had the opportunity to speak with an influential 
House freshman, Congressman Dave McIntosh, Republican of Indiana.  Let's 
hear what he has to say about our country's year ahead.
<p>
Thank you very much for being with us today, Congressman McIntosh. You 
have been one of the most influential freshman Congressmen, and as
you look at this year ahead, what do you see coming up on Capitol
Hill?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think it is going to be a year
of challenges.  I represent Indiana, so I like to use the movie
Hoosiers as an example.  I think the freshman class are the small-town
team, the myelin players, and we are in the big leagues now for
the championship.
<p>
All the press is saying, &quot;Oh, they're bound to fail, they're bound 
to buckle and give up on their principles.&quot; But we are at halftime, 
and we are reassessing where we want to go, and everybody knows the 
fundamentals are there, and if we stick to what we told people we cared 
about in the last election, it will carry us on to victory, ultimately, if 
not before November then after November, because I think the American people 
want to see the changes that they voted for in the last election, less
government -- and even President Clinton has agreed with us on
that -- but even more than the budget and the tax issues, which
I think are important, they want to see a reaffirmation of the
family and of faith as being important in our public lives.
<p>
And so you are going to see next year a renewed effort to focus on
those issues and say it is time that we have a constitutional
amendment that will allow school prayer, that will allow freedom
of religion in our public lives.  It is time that we look at our
welfare program, not just as a budget matter but as a program
that is devastating families and driving people to divorce, driving
young children into a terrible family situation, and we have to
fundamentally get rid of that system and change it.
<p>
The other one that I am going to be looking at is the marriage penalty 
that is not only in our tax code but in also a lot of government pension
programs and benefits, where they tell somebody, &quot;Look, if
you were only divorced, you would be getting more money.&quot;
And to me that is just wrong to say to people, &quot;Because
you are married, you are going to be penalized.&quot;  It undermines
the family and the basic institution of marriage in our community.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are you concerned that the budget debate will have
a negative effect on family issues?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think what you are seeing now is the freshmen who 
were new to Washington -- and I have enjoyed getting to know my colleagues.
They are so committed to the principles that they believe in.
A lot of them were not politicians.  You get people like Steve
Largent, who was a football player and had never run for office
before, did this because he believes in the future of the country.
That is typical of a lot of our colleagues.
<p>
They are determined to not back down on our promises, and what I think we need 
to do is say, &quot;Look, the President has stopped us from getting
to a balanced budget, but now we can get some of the things done.&quot;
The rest of it, we need to go back to the American people and
say, &quot;We took it as far as we can.  Give us another round
of support and we can, to use the Hoosiers analogy, we can win
the game in the end.&quot;  But it is going to take the support
of the people and the voters and people to get involved next year.
<p>
One of the things that I tell folks at home in Indiana -- because
they will come up to me and say, &quot;Hang in there. You're doing
what we sent you to.&quot;  I'll say, &quot;Thank you, and I need
you.  I need you to help me build support in the community, to
get out there and ring doorbells with me, talk to people, and
let the community know there is a plan to get us back on the right
track where we restore families, build strong communities from
the bottom up.  But it is going to take everybody, not just 40-some
members of the Congress or 200-and-some members of Congress but
everybody in the country to do that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The media and the people inside the beltway have really 
demonized the freshman class and blamed them for the impasse in the budget 
debate. What is your perspective on that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think, ultimately, that is a convenient excuse for 
people. There is one thing that has happened.  The media and the people in 
Washington don't really know what to make of the freshmen, because we are
not willing to paper over the differences and say we are balancing
the budget when we know we are not.  We are saying, &quot;At least
let's be honest.  If we're only getting half a loaf, let's tell
people that.&quot;
<p>
And so it has been hard for them to figure out how to work with us as a class. 
But I think, ultimately, you had Presidential politics coming into it. President 
Clinton, I think, did not want a balanced budget, so he vetoed the effort
we had.  Senator Dole, President Clinton views him with suspicion
because he is running for President.  And there were some larger
forces involved in it.
<p>
But, ultimately, we need to say, let's get what we can.  But if it isn't the 
real thing, if we haven't really balanced the budget, haven't given the 
families their tax cut, let's not paper that over but take it to the voters
in the election next year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it has been interesting watching the budget debate. 
There have been a lot of kudos coming to the freshman class as having really 
advanced the discussion of a balanced budget, and then you have the 
<i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and the pundits on 
Saturday and Sunday morning saying, &quot;You know, great advancement of the 
issues, but if you could just get rid of those tax cuts, we would all
be on the same page.&quot;  What is your response to that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: It is typical Washington, actually.  What has 
happened is, as the negotiations have gone, spending keeps going up every
step of the way, and what they are saying is, as you take more
and more for Washington's budget, let's get rid of the provisions
that help the family budget.  Put aside your tax cut that allows
the average family to get something out of this balanced budget.
<p>
We did some studies in my home town in Muncie on what the typical
family would benefit from the tax cuts.  They make about $25,000.
Oftentimes both parents will be working.  They have two kids,
and they would pay about a third of their money in taxes, either
to the Federal Government, to the state, or to local property
taxes.
<p>
If we had a $500 tax credit, instead of paying a third
or roughly about $8,000, they would only pay $7,000, and that
is a huge difference.  That is $1,000 that they don't have to
turn over in their paycheck.  It is a pay raise that they see
right away that, each week, adds up, and eventually, they are
able to save for their family and be able to have a better lifestyle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Looking at all the issues on the table - we have
tax cuts, welfare reform, school choice, religious liberty --
what is your perspective on what the top three issues really are?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think you are going to see at this
point a balanced budget, an honest balanced budget, with the family
tax cuts, a religious freedom amendment that says we need to have
the ability to have prayer in school.  We need communities to
be able to have a creche scene at Christmas.  Our faith is important
to us, and you see that a lot in the freshman class, where people's
personal faith is what guides them, and they bring that forward.
<p>
And then I think the third major issue is in education.  A lot
of us would like to get rid of the Department of Education, certainly
get rid of Goals 2000.  But, fundamentally, on the positive side,
what we need to do is say that parents and communities can do
a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
<p>
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And working together with good teachers, we will be able to teach
our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be creative
-- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply not
what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think is the untold story of the freshman class?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: A lot of us would like to get rid of the Department 
of Education, certainly get rids of Goals 2000.  But fundamentally, on the 
positive side, what we need to do is say that parents and communities can
do a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And, working together with good teachers, we will be able to
teach our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be
creative -- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply
not what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, what are you looking forward to in 1996?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it is going to be a year where, in reality, 
we are ahead at half-time.  The President has said it is the end of the era
of big government.  Families count.  I am not sure he means it
totally, but he has said that and, basically, delivered a State
of the Union speech that could have been Ronald Reagan's.
<p>
I worked with Ronald Reagan for a while.  Probably the difference is 
Ronald Reagan would have meant it.  But it is nonetheless a consensus
now that we are moving in the right direction.  I am optimistic
that on some things we will be able to pass them in Congress and
the President will sign them.  Other things, I think, we will
have to once again, as I said, take it to the election.
<p>
But I have a lot of optimism about that, because I think you are going
to see a lot of people who started to get active in 1994, were
never that political, realize that the future of the country is
going to be at stake, and it is one of those times in our country's
history where we can renew government and set it on a new course.
<p>
The other thing that I am looking forward to is actually in 1997,
and it is not political at all.  It is the national Promise Keepers
meeting.  We had a regional event in Indianapolis at the Hoosier
Dome there, and you had 60,000 men coming together and reaffirming
their faith.
<p>
What I tell people is, this is a revival that can happen in our country. 
It is not government, it is not politics, but it is real because it is 
people in their own lives and in their own communities.  What we can do 
in government is make sure we stay out of the way, that we don't block that 
from happening. And I think that is going to be an exciting event for the 
entire nation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of 1996, after the election, will the story of 
this year's Congress be one of further realignment in a pro-family 
direction or of a swing back to the way that it has been, a little more 
politics as usual?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it could go either way at this point. I 
think the fundamentals are there.  You have good leaders who stand up for 
family values. But the real critical decision is going to be on election day,
and I certainly hope that we have further realignment in a pro-family
way.  I think you will have a lot of politicians talking about
it.  The challenge will be to get people who say, &quot;That's
my first priority, is the family and reestablishing the family,&quot;
so that we can really realign the priorities here in Washington.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, thank you very much for being with
us.  Best of luck to you, and we look forward to seeing what comes
ahead.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: Thank you very much.  Congratulations
on all the good work you all do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary 
Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has to say on CNN's 
<i>Crossfire</i> almost one year ago regarding an issue which continues to 
permeate our country's political world, abortion.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Gary Bauer has often had the opportunity to appear on
many network news programs, and it interesting to see that Gary
was fighting the same battles regarding the abortion issue on
CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> during an appearance almost one year ago. So
let's take a look at a brief news clip as Gary presents some thought-provoking
arguments. <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Crossfire, March 23, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MODERATOR: Gary Bauer, as a Democrat, I certainly
wish you every success in saddling the Republican Party with your
views on abortion.  But isn't Senator Specter right in saying
that you will help reelect President Clinton if you insist on
pushing the Republican Party to adopt your views?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Right.  Well, in all due respect to Senator Specter, whom I have
worked with on many occasions, including the confirmation of Clarence
Thomas, which I hope you are still very proud of, sir, I think
that Arlen Specter is wrong about that.
<p>
The great growth in the Republican Party since 1980 has been based on 
Reagan Republicanism. That is not a fringe.  It means small government, low 
taxes, a strong defense, family values, and the sanctity of life.  That's
the kind of Republican winning all over this country.  That's
the formula for victory.  That little office over at the DNC that
Lynn Cheney(?) talked about is an office that would love to see
us abandon that winning formula.
<p>
MODERATOR: Well, why not be just a little bit cynical?  I know you might not be 
up to this, but there are a lot of Republicans who would like the pro-life
forces within the party to just be a little bit cynical, a little
bit strategic, and lie low for a bit, as some are doing, as Ralph
Reed does on alternate weeks, and wait until -- you know, organize
your forces, as you do, and then wait until you have a Republican
President and a Republican Congress, if that happens, and then
pop back up and say, &quot;Now here we are.  Now let's call in
our chips.&quot;
<p>
MR. BAUER: You know, Mike --
<p>
MODERATOR: Wouldn't that be a cleverer strategy?
<p>
MR. BAUER: No.
<p>
MODERATOR: Since you must admit that abortion is more controversial within 
the Republican Party than small government, low taxes, and all those
other things you listed.
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think the American people are sick of clever. I think I may 
be unusual in Washington, D.C., but I don't believe in stealth candidates. 
I believe that candidates win when they state what they believe and state it 
with conviction and stick to it regardless of polls.  That is what worked 
for Ronald Reagan twice, and I believe that Ronald Reagan, four months
ago, won his third landslide victory when candidates that ran
on all of his philosophy swept into office all over this country.
<p>
Mike, I want to be really clear about this.  I believe the Republican
Party ought to have an open door to anyone who wants to walk in
the door.  But the party has to stand for something, and I believe
at that core --
<p>
MODERATOR:  Why should anyone vote Republican who believes that a woman's 
right to choose is important as you believe that a fetus' right to life is, 
if the Republican Party platform says that abortion is murder and should be 
illegal with no exceptions?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, the fact of the matter is that 60 percent of the 
American people in a poll just this week by the <i>Washington Post</i>, not 
a conservative newspaper, found that Americans either want, in the case of 27 
percent of them, an end to all abortions, or in the case of 33 percent more, 
restrictions on abortion.  You can win an election with that 27 percent and
the 33 percent that believe abortion on demand is a mistake and
needs to be restricted.
<p>
The fringe here is the position that the Senator takes, which is no 
restrictions at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us to 
hear how you can get more information on Gary's book or the issues
affecting you and your family in the upcoming year.
<p.
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive a copy of Gary's book, 
<i>Our Journey Home</i>, or more information about our guests or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be celebrating Valentine's Day with a new slant
on what many consider to be true romance: abstinence.  Saving
sex for marriage seems to be an increasing trend, and we will
meet some people who will explain this not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon.
We hope you will join us again as we continue to bring you perspectives
not often seen in the media and exclusively seen here on <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight's
<I>Straight Talk</I> celebrates Valentine's Day by taking a look
at romance with a newly rediscovered twist.
<p>
When you think of romance, you may think of flowers, candlelight
dinners, and late night walks with that special someone.  In recent
years in our culture, it also means a night that ends with a sexual
encounter.  All too often this sexual experience takes place between
two people who don't share a lifetime commitment to marriage.
<p>
It may seem harmless, but tonight we'll talk to those who
don't think so as they share their personal experiences.  <I>Straight
Talk</I> will discuss the wave of abstinence that is sweeping
the country among teens and young adults who are looking for love
in all the right places.
<p>
But first, we invite you to hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary has experienced many elections
throughout his years inside the beltway, and he shares with us
his views on the Iowa caucuses and how the results indicate what's
ahead in New Hampshire.  Although you've heard a lot of predictions
by now on what will happen between now and Super Tuesday, when
the Republican nominee will probably be known, Gary brings a unique
perspective from the pro-family frontlines as <I>Straight Talk</I>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thanks for being with us today on Behind
the Headlines.  It was interesting in the Iowa caucuses how prior
to the election everyone said that Dole had to have 30 percent
to survive.  Then he gets 26 percent, but it's the great unreported
story.  What's your take on why Dole's showing -- a poor showing
-- of 26 percent is so un-talked about?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think, first of all, Kristi, the thing that
strikes me once again is just how bad the conventional wisdom
in Washington, D.C., is, and I say that as a person that obviously
works in this city and has been here a good long time, but the
pollsters and pundits, even those on the conservative side, really
get out of touch with the grassroots.  I think everybody thought
that Dole would do quite well in Iowa.
<p>
He did win, but it is, I think, an extraordinary warning
to his campaign that 26 percent of the vote in, what, his third
or fourth campaign in Iowa -- this is not a sign of strength.
Someone said &quot;many more victories like this, and he'll be
limping into San Diego.&quot;  So I think it is a sign that the
Dole campaign has some real challenges ahead and that he has to
deliver a much more aggressive and a much better message for the
future than he has been able to deliver so far.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Pundits agree that the race was for number
two.  Dole appeared to have one locked up; the question was how
big was his margin.  And then Buchanan wins the number two spot,
and nobody wants to talk about it.  Why do you think that is?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, Washington and the press corps generally
has an aversion to Pat Buchanan that is, I think, pretty obvious
to even the untrained eye.  It reminds me of this same aversion
that they had to Ronald Reagan.  People forget, you know, the
Reagan presidency was tremendously successful, and he is a beloved
figure in many ways now, but back in 1976, when he was taking
on Gerald Ford, people laughed at Ronald Reagan.
<p>
He was considered to be unelectable.  The Washington establishment,
including a good number of conservatives, thought that he was
splitting the party.  He was losing a lot of money.  He was in
debt.  He lost the first five primaries.  Even when the public
began to respond to him and he began to have success, Washington
and the press corps was in denial about him.  They still couldn't
believe that the American people responded to his message.
<p>
I was struck by the fact that Buchanan and Alan Keyes, the
only two candidates really aggressively promoting a pro-family
message, that if you put their two votes together in Iowa, they
would as a team, they would have won the Iowa caucuses.  So once
again, I think the message out there is that people are hungry
to hear about these issues and hear about them in a very articulate
and heartfelt way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  CNN reported in an exit poll that 42 percent
of the people who voted for Pat Buchanan said that conservative
values were the reason they chose him.  What do you think that
means for conservative issues as we watch this electoral cycle
unfold?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think that if the party doesn't get the message
now, they'll never get it.  What these voters want, these new
voters that have poured into the Republican party in the last
15 years, is a candidate who is willing to speak with as much
passion about the right to life issue, about the family, about
protection of culture, et cetera, as much passion about those
things as they do about flat taxes and the budget deficit.
<p>
So far, a lot of Republican candidates have only talked about
the economic matters and then almost as a throwaway line have
said, &quot;well, yeah, and I'm pro-life,&quot; and so forth.
That might have worked 20 years ago in the Republican party.
It doesn't now.  People are hungry for this message, and I think
Buchanan's success will force the entire party to fashion a message
better than they've done up until now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you interpret Alexander's third place
win and the fact that he leaped over both Forbes and Gramm?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think Alexander is benefiting from sort
of the fact that he's not the other guys.  He hasn't engaged in
a lot of negative advertising.  He has conducted a pretty upbeat
campaign, and if voters got turned off by one individual or another
-- certainly many got turned off by the incredible negative advertising
Forbes has done -- Alexander was a place that they could turn
to and not really worry about being embarrassed about their vote.
Whether he has legs to make it through the next six weeks when
there is an incredible number of primaries and you really have
to start delivering a vision for the country is unclear at this
point.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was watching the pundits yesterday, and I
very much agreed with one who said that Forbes' fourth place showing
indicated that money can't buy everything.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Yes, you know, the Family Research Council doesn't
endorse candidates, but I must admit that personally I was pleased
to see that a candidate can't do well just because he can write
unlimited checks.  That is a disturbing thought to me, that somebody
can take $20 million or $30 million and buy a Senate seat or buy
a governor's race or buy the presidency.
<p>
I think at the end of the day the American people will want
more than good advertising.  They are going to want to know that
the candidate shares their values, and serious questions arose,
on the social issues about whether Steve Forbes shares those values,
in the last three or four days of the Iowa caucuses.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Here at the Family Research Council media office,
we get normally at least 100 calls a day, often more, and in the
last week the number one question asked of us, for you, Gary,
is how do you interpret Gramm's plummet so that he took only a
five place position in Iowa?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I was happy to say that you can't buy
the presidency, I was also very sad to see Phil Gramm's fall on
these hard times, as he clearly has in Louisiana and Iowa.  Senator
Gramm is a good and decent man.  I think that he probably miscalculated
about where the center of gravity is in the Republican party.
Gramm led the way defeating national health care.  He deserves
great credit for that.
<p>
He has been incredibly articulate on economic issues, but
I think he didn't understand or has not understood up until now
that on these social issues you have to address them.  You have
to convince the voter that you are committed to these things,
that you are willing to do something about them, and his inability
to do that opened the door for Buchanan and some of the other
candidates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the themes that the media has not reported
and almost ignored exclusively is the common man theme of working
class Americans concerned for their families.  How will they support
them?  Where is the money going to come from?  Buchanan's numbers
show that in the last three primaries, but particularly in Iowa,
the majority of his supporters, almost 90 percent, made under
$70,000.  How do you interpret the common man theme in this electoral
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think there is.  You know, the Democratic
party demagogues these issues.  They take working men and women
who are really hurting, and they try to play class warfare over
it, and they try to suggest that a few more government bureaucracies
and a couple thousand more bureaucrats will make it all right,
and we all know that is foolish.  It hasn't worked.
<p>
But there are some in my party that are kind of cavalier
about this sort of issue.  They sound like they don't really care
that America's basic industries have had to downsize in the last
20 years, and they act sort of neutral over the question of whether
American companies start building their plants in places like
Mexico and China and so forth.
<p>
I grew up in a blue collar family, and I know how those people
think, what they strive for, what they care about.  A lot of those
people play by the rules.  They are the backbone of the country,
and I hope my party will fashion a message for them that is attractive.
I think Pat Buchanan is doing that, and I think that is why in
Louisiana and Iowa he did so well among voters making less than
$30,000 a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Everyone is packing up and leaving Iowa today,
heading off to New Hampshire and around the rest of the country.
We should know in the next six weeks who is going to be the leader.
How would you advise candidates about getting legs, building
legs, taking their campaigns forward?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think for all the candidates the basic
message is this:  that the American people are interested in smaller
government and lower taxes, traditional values, the sanctity of
human life.  Mold those things together.  Put together again the
Reagan coalition that really won three landslide elections, two
Reagan elections and then George Bush on Ronald Reagan's coattails
in his first race.  Put that coalition together again, and that
is 55 to maybe 59 percent of the American people.  That is a majority
in any race, and it is the road to victory for the Republican
party.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <I>Straight
Talk</I> discusses the new sexual revolution.  Stay with us to
hear why teens are committing themselves to abstinence.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In the beginning of the sexual revolution,
our cultural leaders, from liberal university professors to movie
stars, first questioned marriage, said love should be free, said
we didn't need that kind of commitment.  But free love turned
out to cost everything, from dreams of growing old with one faithful
partner to sometimes life itself.
<p>
So our society went looking for band-aids to cover the symptoms.
Sometimes a temporary fix came in new drugs for the latest twist
on sexually transmitted diseases, like chlamydia and syphilis.
Then came AIDS.  Now they are pushing condoms, saying sex should
be safe, but safe sex can be risky to your health and your heart,
and so the pendulum swings back.  Generation X polls indicate
a new revolution, a time for a love that is real and lasting and
pure, a love that sees sex as a celebration of two lives shared
together forever.
<p>
Are these ideas controversial?  They are the foundations
of Family Research Council's Save Sex for Marriage campaign, which
featured young adults who have committed themselves from this
day forward to save sex for a lifetime love in marriage.  The
campaign appeared in national magazines such as <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
<I>Seventeen</I>, and <I>Teen</I>, and the response isn't what
you may think.
<p>
Many young adults called and wrote FRC actually thanking
the pro-family organization for speaking for the growing number
of people who don't want to be a statistic of one night stands
and broken dreams.  Relationships are very important to the generation
which best understands the tragedies of divorce, fatherlessness,
and abandonment.
<p>
Today not everybody is doing it.  There is a resurgence toward
abstinence, in part because it is easy to see that so-called safe
sex isn't safe and it isn't enough.  In fact, in a recent survey,
84 percent of sexually active teenage girls said that the topic
they most wanted information on was how to say no to sex without
hurting the other person's feelings.
<p>
Research also indicates that the sexually active struggle
with the untold story of emotional ties difficult to break, and
in a sexually predatory environment, many people are looking for
a way out, as well as a way to tell a real love from a line.
<p>
Among America's youth, virgin is no longer a dirty word.
The new sexual revolution isn't about sex at all.  It is about
saving it.
<p>
As you can see, a whole new sexual revolution is afoot, and
to help us understand why, I am joined by Juliette Pierce, an
abstinence educator who created her own successful program called
Choices from the Heart; Mike Griffin, a high school teacher who
has implemented abstinence education for students at Bishop McNamara
High School; and Gracie Hsu, a Family Research Council analyst
who has studied teen sexuality and written a number of pieces
redefining today's sexual attitude.
<p>
Welcome to the show, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining
us.  I am in very sacred company here, the experts.  You all have
been looking at issues of teen sexuality for a long time, and
we were talking before the show started.  I had a sex education
program where we had to learn how much it cost and where we could
buy it and had pop quizzes on that kind of thing.  I imagine that
you all wouldn't want to see that taught in some of the programs
you are working with.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  No, you would not be getting that in Mr. Griffin's
sex ed course.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would I be getting?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, I am teaching at a Catholic school, which
focuses on a lot of things from the Catholic teaching, but even
more specifically to the sex education issue, you get a values-based
curriculum.  The kids need to know the plumbing of sexuality in
the body; more importantly, they need to know how that relates
to their life.  Oftentimes kids do know some of the plumbing,
but when it comes to choices, they do not know them.
<p>
I'll give you an example.  The other day in my class, I had
a freshman who was telling us the ABCs of the female reproductive
cycle, and when asked the question &quot;how long is the entire
woman's menstrual cycle&quot; gave me the answer of four days.
Now there is a good chance from the numbers that this kid may
be sexually active, which, as I said to the girls in the class,
is a bit scary, that the kids do know the plumbing, but they don't
know the values, and they don't know some of the moral issues
that lay at the heart of human sexuality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that as well, Juliette?  You were
working with AIDS and HIV teaching.  Did you find as you were
looking at the mechanics of disease and sex that values was totally
missing?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I did.  In fact, I talked to a group of youngsters
about don't you want to be involved with someone who loves you,
and the response that I got was what do you mean love?  I don't
want anyone to lie to me.  It was as though they would be insulted
if someone insinuated that there was love involved, because then
they would realize that that wasn't real at all, and they would
prefer the person be honest with them.  So there was a real lack
of values involved.
<p>
So what I try to do with Choices from the Heart is to talk
to them about why it is they choose to be sexually involved. 
What is the reason behind it?  So let's not treat the symptoms
by giving them ways to protect themselves, but let's talk about
how they can really do some introspection, look at the motivations
behind why they are sexually involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would you say are the top one, two, three
reasons why kids are having sex and having it very young these
days?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I can tell you that I've gotten a separate
set of responses from males and females.  From the females, the
answers range from trying to lay a foundation for a relationship,
trying to solidify a relationship, peer pressure, and then thirdly,
just wanting to feel grown up, and that was the way that they
were doing that.
<p>
The males, on the other hand, had a whole separate list of
responses.  Their responses ranged from peer pressure, feeling
like they were left out if the fellows, quote, unquote, knew that
they were not sexually active, to, you know, the whole idea of
being able to conquer someone and what that is about for them,
and then, lastly, probably just wanting to be involved in a relationship
and making it something that was very special between themselves
and that other person involved.
<p>
But if you will note from those top three responses, there
are very few areas where the males and females agree on the reasoning,
which was a real red flag to say to them, look, there are two
separate agendas being promoted here.  You know, who do you think
is going to win when both people have an agenda and they don't
share the same goals in being sexually active?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Common sense relationship skills.
<p>
Gracie, there is a lot of discussion on abstinence programs,
and we are certainly talking to two people who know how to run
a good one.  What does the research show about how do we help
kids restrain their sexual impulses?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, the number one reason why kids become sexually
active is because they don't have a good support base, or at least
that support base is collapsing.  So, of course, the best prevention
is to have two parents in the home who love the kids and who will
raise them with an expectation that they will save sex for marriage.
But beyond that, if there is sex education in the schools, which
we don't completely come down on, but if there is, then we want
it to be in abstinence-based programs, because those programs
have shown to work.
<p>
In complete contradiction, the contraceptive-based approaches
actually show that there is more sexual activity, more exposure
to sexually transmitted diseases, and an increase in teen pregnancy,
and that is not what we are looking for.  We are looking for success,
because what contraceptive programs do is that they make equivalent
not having sex the same as having sex as long as you don't have
any of these outcomes, and we know that when you have sex, even
if you don't get pregnant or get an STD, that you are going to
be suffering long-term with broken relationships, in marriage,
with a more difficult time to have sexual satisfaction, things
that really do impact kids' lives on a long-term basis.
<p>
But if I could just give a little pitch to some good abstinence
programs, for example, Best Friends, right here in the city, has
just done a recent evaluation, and it showed that only 1.1 percent
of all the girls that have been through this program have gotten
pregnant.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a relational program, where you
pair girls up with an adult to provide a little more support.
<p>
MS. HSU:  Right, and there is also the positive peer pressure
that comes about, because they will say I'm your friend, and you
cannot do this, and I will hold you accountable.  And that's really
what this is all about, and we would like to see that kind of
thing replicated, because it really has to do with positive relationships.
If they have a good father figure, you know, or a good mom who
is willing to lay down the rules and hold them accountable, then
you know that you are going to have a far better -- not just in
terms of being abstinent, but a better kid in terms of character
development, being able to have self-control and self-discipline.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the people on the left say that the
reason why kids are getting pregnant is they just don't know enough
about condoms, and they are going to hand them out everywhere
we go; we're going to make them free; we're going to subsidize
them.  Ironically, we spend about $10 for every condom-based program
to any $1 or less than $1 on abstinence.  Do you find that kids
have heard of condoms?  You know, have they heard of contraceptives?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, definitely.  Let me say one thing.  Teaching
in a Catholic school, there are a lot of things that may be different,
but in terms of teaching this issue, I don't think what I'm teaching
is anything different than could be taught in a public school,
and make no mistake about it:  from dealing every day with teenagers,
promoting condoms as well as the abstinence message sends a double
message.  You can't have it both ways.
<p>
I had one of my students last year who, when I described
Joycelyn Elders saying we want to teach abstinence but we also
need to teach them what to do in the back seat and that is using
latex condoms, you know, they said to me, they said, &quot;Mr.
Griffin, what are they saying?  They are saying on one hand, you
should be abstinent and wait until you're married, but on the
other hand here's a bunch of condoms.  You know, what are the
condoms for, to abstain with?&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And the kids ask the questions.  We need to, as adults, realize
that they need some guidance, and that's why I could not agree
more with what Gracie said.  As a teacher, I know that ten times,
maybe a hundred times, more important than what I do is what goes
on in the home, and that's where the public schools might take
a lesson from the Catholic schools in which our job is to support
what the parents are being taught, and the parents want values
taught.
<p>
They don't want to turn their kids over to sex educators
and health educators in the public school who have their own agenda
and their own set of priorities for these kids.  They want values
taught to them, and even if parents may not have made all the
right choices themselves, they want something different for their
kids, and they want some help.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, you work with some kids that are
really troubled.  If the home is broken down, what do you think
a person like yourself can tell them?  We have about a minute
left.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  What I do is I talk to them about what their
goals and aspirations are.  What is it that they would like to
see in terms of their life, and then let's talk about the choices
that you're making right now and how that plays into your ability
to realize those goals and dreams and aspirations.  So even if
their home life is such that they really can't see any support
or reinforcement, but I'm saying to them I know that's what you're
seeing, but what about your life?  You have some degree of control,
and let's talk about how you can make the best choice.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  These are exciting programs.  Please join us
after the commercial break as we continue to discuss why young
people need to hear that saving sex is the best way to save themselves
from physical consequences and emotional heartache.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk</I>.  I am
joined again by two people who offer more to teens than the choice
of using or not using a condom, abstinence educators Juliette
Pierce and Mike Griffin, and we are joined by Rob Anderson, a
medical technician and body builder who was featured as a model
in the Family Research Council Save Sex campaign.  Thanks so much
for joining us, you all.
<p>
These guys are some professionals, Rob, but I know you work
with kids regularly and have used body building even to help meet
people and as an inroad.  What do you find when you're talking
to kids really helps them say I want to take control of my sex
life, as well as my physical life and my mental life.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, the thing I've found most important
is developing a relationship with the kids, getting to know them,
and I think the most important thing is credibility.  When they
know that you've taken a stand and that you have made a commitment
to abstinence and that you are doing the same thing that you're
talking to them about doing, they really appreciate and respond
to that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you find that it has called a more open
communication maybe than you were initially comfortable with to
kind of take that stand?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, yes, it got real open.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I really had no intentions of ever modeling for a poster
promoting abstinence or anything like that, and you know, when
people who knew that I took that stand asked me would you do that,
I thought, my goodness, but the opportunity presented itself and
I said if I'm really going to take a stand, I might as well take
the stand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Very visible, too.
<p>
In your work, do you find people like Rob who stand up and
who is an athlete, does that make a difference when you see other
people, other adults, taking a stand?  Juliette, what do you find?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  It makes a tremendous difference, because I
can tell you that in the earlier part of actually introducing
Choices from the Heart, I felt like I was the lone voice crying
in the wilderness, and there were so many people who felt very
passionately that I was wasting my time.  So to see someone like
Rob say that, you know, I believe in this enough to go public
with it and to talk about it is very important, and I think youth
can identify with someone who they know is not too old to have
any fun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Or want to, anyway.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Exactly, exactly.  And they say if this person
has made this decision, then maybe I should think again about
the choices that I've made.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.
<p>
Being in a faith-based school, Mike, I wonder if it is different.
Probably people assume there are lots of role models around.
What has helped support your efforts?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, it is definitely role models, and Rob
won't be leaving the studio today until he agrees to come to Bishop
McNamara to talk to my kids.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, yes, they need role models, and they do sort of assume
-- you know, we were talking before the show; a lot of people
assume Catholic school, all of a sudden these kids will have gotten
this education already, but they need role models, too.  They
need people who will walk the walk, and that is one of the things
that I have found helps the effectiveness of my program.
<p>
Some days I'll walk in there and I feel like I am fighting
every single cultural attitude out there, but the one thing that
I have is I'm walking the walk, and I can tell them this is what
I stand for, and kids today, if they need anything, it's someone
who will stand up for something.  In a society where so often
they see people bend their own morals just to fit whatever they
want to do with their life or their particular immediate goal,
to see someone who will stand up for values is something that
they will take with them forever, and that will make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We've been talking a lot about saving sex and
abstinence, and I think we have to emphasize that we are not talking
about people who maybe have never had sex.  We're talking about
people making a decision from today forward.
<p>
Rob, when you're talking to kids, do you see a lot of kids
discouraged, you know, saying I'm sorry, I had sex; I can't do
what you're doing; it's too late for me.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I've seen a lot of
kids like that.  I went to one group downtown, and this one girl
said, you know, &quot;I understand you're telling me that I have
a choice, but sometimes you get in situations where you don't
have a choice,&quot; and I was just devastated.  I mean, I didn't
feel like I could say anything.  But talking to those folks, I
always try to emphasize that it is from this day forward.  A commitment
to abstinence, like you said, isn't -- you can't commit to the
past.  You can only commit from this day forward, and hopefully
I can be encouraging to folks that way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, what do you say to the kid who says
&quot;look, I can't do it; it's too late for me&quot;?  What's
your response?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I tell them from my own personal experience.
I tell them that at 22 I came to the realization that, you know,
I was tired of having my heart broken, and I realized that there
was a direct correlation between the amount of involvement that
I had in a relationship and my ability to recover after the relationship
was long over.
<p>
So what I do is I share with them that this is something
that you can do, and what you have to do is really make a decision
and then look at your lifestyle, look at the company that you
keep, look at the choices that you are making, and let all of
those things correspond or reinforce your decision to be abstinent
from this day forward.
<p>
So that means that if you are involved with someone and that
person has not taken the same stand, then chances are that that
relationship is going to go through quite a bit of tension, because
you are going to be fighting against, you know, someone who wants
to be involved with something that you don't.  So I encourage
them to involve themselves with individuals who are of like mind
so that they are already lessening the chances that they will
be faced with compromising situations, and to think through a
date.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, right.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  So if it means that John can't walk me to the
door tonight because long good-byes lead to early good mornings,
then John can't walk me to the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  And try not to spend a lot of time alone with
that person, because you know that chemistry alone is going to
cause you to interact with one another, but if you are in the
company of others and everybody is on the same page regarding
their commitment, then chances are you're not going to be involved
in those compromising scenarios.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, I have to say, in talking with my students,
some of the most powerful and persuasive moments when I can see
the benefits of abstinence come from those who may have been sexually
active.  I was in my classroom the other day, and I felt like
Rob; I felt like I wanted to break down when one of my 16-year-old
students looked at me and said, &quot;you know, being involved
in this game and in this lifestyle, sometimes it's gotten to the
point where I'll be talking and a boy will be talking to me, and
I'll even in the back of my mind ask myself, you know, why is
he messing with me?  Why is he even talking to me?  What's he
got on his mind?&quot;
<p>
I thought how sad to be 16 and so cynical, but how realistic,
too, and what the kids need to see is, as you said in the opening
piece, the sexual revolution, all of these great rewards that
are supposed to come from this type of living and from this activity
just don't cut it.  They don't happen.  They don't make it.  So
sometimes those kids who may have been in this situation can be
really powerful.
<p>
So I try to bring some of my seniors, maybe who have been
sexually active and who as a result of the course have chosen
abstinence, come back, talked to the younger kids, and tell them
I know, I've been there, and I can see why that's a lie; that
lifestyle, and those goals, and those promised rewards don't end
up materializing.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  The other piece of that, too, that I want to
add is that there's a misconception that intimacy means physical,
and one thing that I reinforce to them is you can be intimate
with someone and hold their hand, because intimacy is your willingness
to commit to knowing what's going on in my heart and what's going
on in my mind, and if you are willing to do that, then you can
look at me, and I'll feel as close to you or even closer than
if we were actually physically involved.
<p>
So let's look at what intimacy really is and the commitment
that it takes to get there and not just reserve it for something
that is physical, because truly that is where we have missed the
boat.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in taking marriage out of the equation,
we've lost the fact that sex is the culmination of an intimate
relationship, not the evidence of it.
<p>
We don't have a lot of time left, but one thing that we've
looked at, and I wanted to see if you all agree with us.  So much
discussion of AIDS and death and the down, how sex can kill, as
the Family Research Council has looked at data, we've said, look,
it can't be all about death.  We're not telling them don't get
a disease.  We're telling them there is something good out there
if you have the skills and the self-confidence to wait for it.
<p>
Let's go around quickly before we get to the end.  Rob, what
would you tell kids in terms of why it's a joyful, enjoyable thing
to wait, rather than just the AIDS.  I mean, we know sex can kill.
What don't we know about how good it can be to have a more stable
relationship?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, I'd say that I waited, and it was worth
the wait.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I just got married this December.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Congratulations.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  And that commitment to save sex for marriage
is now a new commitment to stay committed to my wife for the rest
of my life, and I would just say that that commitment just yields
peace in my heart from knowing that I'm not bringing a whole lot
of baggage into my marriage relationship, and my virginity was
a gift to my wife on my wedding night, and it was a blessing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.
<p>
Mike, what would you say, the positive side?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, that's why I get really personal with
the kids.  I tell them, you know, the reason why I'm waiting is
so that when and if I get married I can look at my wife and say
I loved you even before I knew you, and I committed myself, and
if I want to go all the way with marriage, I want an all-the-way
way to celebrate it, and that is through sex in marriage, and
the rewards will come after that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's fantastic.
<p>
Juliette, what would you say, the positive?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I would let them know that the choices that
they make today will give them the ability to make choices in
the days ahead, but if you don't make the right choices now, then
you don't have the ability to make the choices in the days ahead.
So to draw the correlation between the right now and then, and
every young person has goals and aspirations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  No matter what they are or how bizarre they
may be, they all have them.  And wouldn't it be great to know
that all of those possibilities are available to you and that
absent of something tragic, you have the ability to live out those
dreams.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope that people will call us to hear more
from you all.  Thank you so much for coming.
<p>
When we return, <I>Straight Talk</I> will bring you some
individuals who have committed themselves to saving sex for real
love.  They have their own unique reasons and experiences, and
you won't want to miss them.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <I>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</I>.  I would like to welcome some
very special individuals to our show, Kate Gilchrist, a young
woman who, although formerly sexually active, has committed herself
to saving sex for marriage, and Maggie Kuhn and Scott White, each
of whom are waiting to share themselves with their lifetime love
in marriage.  Thanks to you all for being here.  We really appreciate
your time.
<p>
We see a lot of discussion, especially in the world of numbers,
about Generation X and what people think and what people feel,
but you're the people everybody is really talking about.  How
do your peers see sex?  Do they think it's insignificant whether
or not sex takes place, or are they concerned about issues of
the heart?
<p>
Scott, how about you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think a lot of kids think that sex is just
something that they can do in high school that there really aren't
any consequences with what happens afterwards.  They really don't
see the long-term effects of maybe a pregnancy or maybe an STD,
but it really just depends on what circle of friends that you
get into, with some kids getting involved with different things,
where you see some that completely stay away from sex and that's
not even an option, but other people just think of it as a casual
thing on the weekends.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that most people, Maggie, appreciate
the consequences?  Are they thinking about AIDS?  Are they thinking
about anything?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think a lot of time people, especially high
school students, are just so excited about the freedoms that they
have in high school.  It's just getting older and knowing that
you're your own person.  I think a lot of times people don't really
think about the consequences, because they're so caught up in
doing what I want to do, and they don't really think about whether
or not this is what they want to do.  They're thinking about,
you know, what's great for right now, and they're not always thinking
about the long-term consequences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think, Kate, that there's not enough
information out there, or do you think it's the way it's told,
or do people need more of a personal approach, someone to come
alongside.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think that there is plenty of information
out there, and I think that it is an individual's own choice.
I think it is a lot the age that you're at in high school.  You
go through, like, this rebellious stage where it is easy to just
totally go against your parents, even if they talk to you about
it all.  I really don't think that a one-on-one would work.  I
think it really just depends on the individual itself, because
I know that I wouldn't have accepted a one-on-one from anybody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What helped you make your decision to say from
this day forward I'm going to save sex for marriage?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I got sent away to a program for two years,
and I realized that God had really just taken me out of the whole
situation that I was in and placed me in a place that could just
help me get my priorities straight again, and when I was able
to come back home I was so different that I did not want to even
resort back to sex, because I realized how much God had just done
for me when he pulled me out of that whole situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in your circumstances, it would have been
faith that made a key difference.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Yeah.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Among your friends who are saving sex, what
do you think is making a difference?  What's helping people make
that kind of decision?  Scott, what do you think?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think that a lot of kids, really, they don't
want to see sex as -- it's the ultimate gift that you can give
your husband or your wife, and that's just something that you
can really -- that's the one thing that you can hold onto and
that nobody else can take away, and it's really your decision,
because a lot of things in this world, you really can't count
on, and that's one thing that you know that you can have and that's
going to be your decision to give up or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What about you, Maggie?  What do you think
is helping people when they make a decision to save sex?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think it's very much a personal conviction.
I think you hear so much about sex in our society.  It's so common.
It's just something you have to decide on your own, and I think
for most of my friends and for myself, I think it's just having
faith in God's plan and knowing that sex is perfect when it's
within marriage, and you just have to wait, and you know, it's
hard to wait, because we're all human.  We want immediate answers,
and we want immediate intimacy, and sex seems like such an easy
way sometimes, but really it works in the opposite direction,
and when you really wait, sex is just created for marriage, and
that's how it's the best.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all are talking about a lot of people
have to make up their own minds, but Scott, you're on a council
in your high school to kind of bring some abstinence-based programs
in. Do you think a peer group approach works better?  What motivated
you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  A lot of kids -- the council is just a student
advisory council, and they're basically what Fairfax County, which
is the high school system I go to -- they're using that as a forum;
they're now using abstinence as an option, whereas before it was
more geared toward safe sex.  Most people are just really -- the
approach they are trying to do is just a peer-based group, and
they are trying to use peers as saying, look, this is going to
be an option instead of just worrying about safe sex, or no sex
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you guys think about the culture that you
live in, you know, the movies, the music, is any one thing more
difficult to take than any other?  Where does the most pressure
come from in terms of kind of saying, hey, it's no big deal, have
sex, whatever?  Maggie, what is your impression?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I can't really single out one specific type of
media or one specific area of our culture.  I think it's all over,
and that's what is so overwhelming is that it's not just one area.
It's not one thing you can turn off.  It's everything.  It's
in music.  It's in television.  I mean, you read about it all
the time, and that's what is so overwhelming is that our society
just -- it's just common.  You know, having sex before marriage
is seen as totally normal, whereas saving yourself until you're
married is just -- well, it's not spoken of, really.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It really isn't, is it?  Kate, now that you've
made even a chance of plan, are people respecting your change?
Are they saying great job?  What's the response of people?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  A lot of people at my high school -- it's
a public school, you know, not a lot of Christians around there
-- they don't understand why I can't have sex, as long as when
I get older it's not as it is now, you know, just a lot of different
people and stuff, and people at my church and at youth group where
we go to, they really accept it and they just think that it's
great, and I'm really affirmed by that, and there are people at
school that, you know, they're, like, that's just amazing that
you can do that, you know.  It's hard.  It seriously is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Where do you think some of the biggest pressure
comes from, if you kind of look -- is it the whole pile-on of
the culture?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think it's everything.  I think that there
is a lot of peer pressure in the schools, and not only in the
schools, in the music that you listen to.  I know I listen to
a lot of R&amp;B and stuff, and every song that you pretty much
hear, every slow song, is about, like, somebody's legs or having
sex with somebody, and seriously it is, and it's just like, whoa,
what does that put in my mind, and t.v. shows like <I>Melrose
Place</I> and <I>90210</I> and just shows like that.
<p>
I mean, it's just like relationship, relationship, having
sex with one person and another.  It's just crazy stuff, and it
just all really just fills up your mind.  I think it's how much
you accept it and how much you watch that stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sure.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Like, I just choose not to watch those t.v.
shows.  One, my mom won't let me, but, two, I just choose not
to, because I see a reason why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How can any of you defend yourself?  You've
made a decision.  You know, what do you do to defend yourself,
maybe, from the culture or even from the peer group that might
say, you know, hey, it doesn't matter.  Scott, what can you do?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  Well, I think it's really like Maggie said before.
It's a personal conviction, and that is just the basis, I think,
of my walk and knowing God's plan for me.  He knows that whatever
happens, if I'm supposed to get married or not, that He has just
called me, and He has just said I'm not supposed to have sex right
now, and that's just one of those things that you just kind of
take to heart and you just really think about, that you don't
really have -- that is not an option for me right now to worry
about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have very little time left.  Maggie, I'm
going to let you close us out.  What advice would you give someone
who is kind of struggling right now?  How would you encourage
them to make the kind of decisions that you three have so courageously
made?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I would just say to just step out for a second,
step out of your life and look in and look at what you're doing
and really, you know, question your actions.  I think so often
people just act without thinking, and when you really get down
to it and think about having sex before marriage, it honestly
doesn't make sense.
<p>
I just think so many people if they just took a step back
and actually looked at what they were choosing to do, whether
it be just like a quick decision or even if they think, okay,
well, I really love this person, I think they really need to just
stop and think about what they are deciding and remember that
sex is a lot more than a physical thing.  It has emotional ties.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's really personal.
<p>
Thanks a lot.  Thank you for joining me, and when we come
back, there will be more <I>Straight Talk.</I>
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  FRC staff is often asked by the media to
present their views on issues affecting families today.  In December,
Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy, gave her view on
the increasing cyberporn threat.  So let's take a look at an excerpt
from an <I>NBC Nightly News</I> cyberporn story as <I>Straight
Talk</I> brings you some Homefront News.

<p>
[Segment from <I>NBC Nightly News</I> follows:]
<p>
MS. PAULEY:  A different kind of government shutdown in the
news tonight.  What happens when smut and freedom of speech collide
on the Internet?  Today Americans who use the CompuServe on-line
service found they were subject to another country's rules.  Here
is NBC's Fred Francis[?].
<p>
MR. FRANCIS:  Because CompuServe has a global reach, it says
it was forced to block -- some say censor -- access to 200 sexually
explicit discussion groups on the Internet to appease a German
prosecutor who found the material pornographic.
<p>
In the dark alleys of cyberspace, where pedophiles can prey
upon very young children, it is common on the Internet for sexual
predators to roam free.  This man was charged and convicted for
luring children through the home computer.  Even adults are often
enticed by raw and raunchy pictures and text.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  It's going to take laws like Germany has, saying
we are not going to tolerate child pornography; CompuServe, stop
serving it to your subscribers on a silver platter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <I>Straight Talk</I> continues after the break.
Stay with us to hear how you can get more information regarding
the issues and trends affecting you and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <I>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</I>.  If you would like
to receive more information about our organization, tonight's
guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be discussing one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?  We hope
you will join us next week to find out as we continue to bring
you a unique pro-family perspective not often heard in the media
and exclusively seen here on <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>. Thanks for watching.
