<h3>Executive Overview of <br>
<em>The Role of Recycling in Integrated Solid Waste Management to
the Year 2000</em></h3>
<p>In a period of seven years (1985 to 1992), recycling and yard
trimmings composting became an important part of integrated
municipal solid waste management. Municipal solid waste (MSW)
recovered for recycling and composting in the United States
increased two and one-half times in tonnage in this period, while
doubling the rate of recovery from 10 percent to 21 percent of
total MSW. In spite of this rapid growth, the path to the year
2000 is one of great challenges because recycling and composting
as currently practiced have limits that will be reached in this
decade. </p>
<p>As recycling and composting mature as solid waste management
techniques, community leaders are challenged to be visionary in a
time when technology, costs, and environmental concerns are
constantly changing the shape of solid waste management. This
study is designed to focus attention on understanding the options
while making decisions that reflect community values and goals.
The remaining years of the 1990s will be an era of recycling
realities, with recovery for recycling and composting moving from
21 percent of total MSW generated in 1992 to a potential national
average range of 25 to 35 percent in 2000. There are several
important factors to be considered:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>There are practical limits to increasing
        recycling from residential sources. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>Successful communities achieving recovery levels greater
        than 35 percent of generation have very comprehensive
        programs in place, combining curbside collection,
        composting, multi-family programs, drop-offs, buy-back
        centers, existing private scrap infrastructure, and often
        unit-based pricing on solid waste to be managed by
        conventional landfill disposal.<br>
    </dd>
    <dd>To reach national average recovery scenario levels of 25
        to 35 percent, curbside collection will need to double by
        2000. Expanding curbside programs to double the 1992
        coverage of about 78 million people will be a formidable
        task, leading to more costly programs. In addition,
        multi-family dwellings, drop-off centers, the
        conventional scrap infrastructure, and programs in
        non-urban areas will be even more important in the years
        ahead if the scenario range is an important goal.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>Materials recovered from commercial,
        institutional, and government sources will be a vital
        part of total recovery for recycling. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>While a majority of municipal solid waste generation is
        from residential sources, recovery of recyclable
        materials from commercial, institutional, and
        governmental sources of MSW is absolutely essential,
        because these sources will account for over half of the
        materials projected to be recovered for recycling and
        composting in 2000.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>There are costs to increasing recovery. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>Program costs will have growing influence over the
        decision-making process at the local level. The reality
        is that recycling at the community level is not free and
        usually does not reduce the costs of total solid waste
        management. In fact, it increases costs in most
        communities. Since collection costs dominate total costs,
        emphasis on reducing collection costs is important to
        pursue. This will require innovative collection
        techniques, which are just beginning to emerge. Revenues
        from recovered materials help to offset costs, but will
        fluctuate with scrap markets.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>Composting of yard trimmings is a key component
        of achieving recovery levels of 25 to 35 percent of total
        MSW. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>New yard trimmings policies such as restricted disposal
        at landfills are projected to result in a significant
        decrease in yard trimmings entering MSW in 2000. More
        community composting programs will increase recovery.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>The quantity and composition of municipal solid
        waste are continually changing; source reduction measures
        may accelerate changes in the last half of the 1990s. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>There is a growing awareness of the need for source
        reduction as a preventative strategy; as a result,
        community educators, businesses and manufacturers,
        government, and institutions are focusing attention on
        this important measure. Their combined efforts are
        playing a vital role in reducing the growth of MSW
        generation. </dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>Overall, recovery for recycling saves energy and
        reduces solid wastes landfilled.</strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>The obvious benefit to recycling is the reduced
        dependence on landfills for disposal. The most
        significant potential energy and environmental effects
        are realized when the recovered materials are utilized in
        place of virgin materials in manufacturing processes. </dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>The optimum solid waste management system for
        each community will be determined by its individual
        situation with respect to quantity and composition of
        MSW, infrastructure, cost structure, and community goals.</strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>The decision-making process should begin with identifying
        problems and determining the level of effort and
        expenditure the community is willing to support. Adding
        community-based infrastructure for recycling and
        composting (at increased cost) can achieve up to 35
        percent recovery nationally using commonly practiced
        techniques. </dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>For communities to achieve higher overall
        recovery (or diversion) goals, other municipal solid
        waste management technologies must come into use. </strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>Consequently, several components of integrated solid
        waste management beyond source reduction, recycling, and
        composting of yard trimmings will have to be utilized
        where diversion goals are above 25 to 35 percent.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>A 30 percent national average recovery scenario
        for recycling and composting in the year 2000 would only
        offset the total projected growth in MSW generated
        (driven by increases in population and economic growth),
        leaving the remaining solid waste to be managed through
        other integrated solid waste management approaches and
        emerging technologies.</strong> </dt>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) is the sponsoring
organization for this comprehensive study of the role of
recycling and composting of municipal solid waste (MSW) to the
year 2000. The advisory group consisted of KAB's Solid Waste
Committee and an industry group of sponsoring organizations.
Because of the diverse nature of representatives on Keep America
Beautiful's Solid Waste Committee and the industry advisory
group, this is probably the most thoroughly peer reviewed report
on MSW and recycling ever to reach the public domain. Ultimately
the findings, observations, conclusions, and content are those of
Franklin Associates, Ltd., which is the independent research
group responsible for this report.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The Purposes of this Report The primary purposes of this
report are:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To provide information about municipal solid waste (MSW)
        generated from residences and commercial activities. In
        this report, commercial MSW includes wastes from retail
        and service establishments, institutions such as schools
        and government agencies, and packaging from industrial
        sources. </li>
    <li>To define the potential for recycling and other means of
        recovery and diversion from landfill as solid waste
        management options. </li>
    <li>To provide information for local, state, and federal
        officials and for the private sector to use in carrying
        out effective planning for the role of recycling and
        composting in the context of integrated municipal solid
        waste management. </li>
    <li>To project where recycling/composting and solid waste
        management could be in 2000, considering current and
        emerging technological developments. </li>
    <li>To determine the energy required, solid waste generated,
        and environmental emissions to collect and process
        recyclables compared to the energy used in the
        manufacturing process by using recycled material versus
        virgin material.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Target Audiences and Intended Uses </h3>
<p>The principal audience for this report is local community
officials responsible for managing and for planning municipal
solid waste programs in their communities. Many other persons in
the public and private sectors may find the report useful also.
While this report provides basic information that can be used in
municipal solid waste planning, it is not a planning document
that will answer every question for every community. In using
this report, certain facts should be kept in mind:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>The data in this report are restricted to municipal solid
        waste (primarily residential and commercial,
        institutional, and government wastes). Construction and
        demolition wastes, industrial process wastes, wastewater
        treatment sludges, etc. may also be managed by
        communities, <em>but they are not addressed in this
        study.</em> </li>
    <li>Most of the data on waste characterization and management
        are national averages. Circumstances in any particular
        community are likely to be different. The local
        &quot;mix&quot; of residential and commercial activities,
        variations in the management of yard trimmings, and the
        urban or rural nature of the community are some of the
        factors contributing to local variations. </li>
    <li>Regional data are presented in some of the chapters,
        e.g., economics and markets for recovered materials.
        Within any particular region, however, there will be wide
        variations in local conditions due to some of the factors
        named above.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Scope of this Report </h3>
<p>This report provides information on the total municipal solid
waste stream and integrated solid waste management of MSW.
Emphasis is placed on residential MSW and recovery for recycling
of residential MSW as a management tool. In most areas, local
officials have the most direct responsibility for residential
MSW. Consequently, most of the report emphasizes solid waste from
single-family homes, with less emphasis given to multi-family
homes and commercially collected solid waste, i.e., MSW from
businesses, institutions, governments, public facilities, and
other non-residential sources. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the emphasis on residential waste management,
the role of commercial waste management and recycling is vital
because commercial waste constitutes about 43 percent of all MSW
generated Even more important, commercial sources accounted for
about 55 percent of materials recovery for recycling (excluding
yard trimmings composting) in 1992. </p>
<p>The scope of the report also includes information on
infrastructure, the economics of MSW management, markets for
recovered materials, and the comparative energy and environmental
consequences of the various waste management options. It examines
the average range of what can be accomplished with recycling
along with the associated estimated costs to the year 2000, and
includes some regional analyses, especially for solid waste
management costs and markets for recyclable materials.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Characterization and Management of MSW </h3>
<h4>MSW Characterization </h4>
<p>Potential recovery for recycling and composting can best be
estimated from a knowledge of MSW quantity and composition plus
where it is generated. Twenty separate products or product
categories plus yard trimmings were analyzed in this study; they
were selected because they were already recovered in measurable
quantities in 1992. Collectively these are referred to as
&quot;the selected recyclable products and materials.&quot; These
commonly recycled products and materials constituted about
three-fourths of total MSW in 1992. (While these
products/materials constitute three-fourths of MSW, this does not
mean all of these materials are in fact separated or recoverable,
as will become evident in later discussions.) </p>
<p>The recovery of these products and materials was already
significant in 1992, as shown in Table 1. Recovery for recycling
and composting as a percentage of total MSW was 21 percent
overall in 1992, with recovery of residential MSW at 17 percent
of residential generation and recovery of commercial MSW at 27
percent of generation (Table 1). The sources of recovered
products and materials are illustrated graphically in Figure 1. </p>
<p>A projected national average scenario of 30 percent overall
recovery for recycling and composting from residential and
commercial sources is shown in Table 2. In order to increase
recovery for recycling and composting from the 1992 level of 21
percent to an assumed 30 percent in 2000, the current recovery of
32 percent of these products and materials would have to increase
to 42 percent, including almost 23 million tons from residential
sources and 32 million tons from commercial sources (Tables 1 and
2). Recovery of recyclables from commercial MSW is absolutely
essential, because this source would account for 58 percent of
the recyclable products recovered for recycling in the year 2000
scenario (Table 2).</p>

<p>Furthermore, reaching the level of 30 percent recovery of
total MSW for recycling and composting in the year 2000 would
require a doubling of the number of single family households
served, from 27 million in 1992 to 54 million households, nearly
two-thirds of all single family households. </p>
<p>Table 2 shows that the quantity of yard trimmings in MSW is
projected to decline significantly by the year 2000, representing
only 10 percent of total MSW versus 17 percent in 1992. This
projected decline is due primarily to local and state bans of
yard trimmings at landfills. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Table 2 also shows that composting of yard trimmings is a key
component of achieving national average recovery levels of 25 to
35 percent of total MSW. Most yard trimmings are from residential
sources. The 8.4 million tons of residential yard trimmings
projected for composting in 2000 constitutes 27 percent of the
projected total recovery of products plus yard trimmings from
residential MSW. </p>

<h4>MSW Management </h4>
<p>A profile of solid waste management from a national
perspective for 1985, 1992, and 2000 shows how solid waste
management has changed overall and is likely to change in the
future (Table 3). </p>
<p>The alternatives for managing material categories are shown in
Table 4. Most materials can be recycled in part, but composting,
energy recovery, prepared fuel, and landfill will continue to
play important roles once the practical limits of recovery for
recycling are reached. </p>

<p><em>Residential MSW includes wastes from single and

<p>Key observations about MSW are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>The past decade has seen significant changes in the ways
        municipal solid waste is managed. </li>
    <li>In the United States, there has been a strong trend
        toward integrated solid waste management, i.e., the use
        of two or more management techniques such as recovery for
        recycling and landfilling. </li>
    <li>Recovery of total MSW for recycling and composting
        reached 21 percent of generation in 1992. The 21 percent
        breaks down as: 11.3 percent product recovery for
        recycling from the commercial sector; 4.1 percent product
        recovery from residential buy-back, drop-offs,
        traditional scrap processors, etc.; 2.5 percent product
        recovery from curbside collection; and 3 percent yard
        trimmings for composting (Figure 1). </li>
    <li>The majority of MSW generation is from residential
        sources; the majority of MSW recovery is from commercial
        sources. </li>

</p>
<h3>The Role of Source Reduction Activity in Solid Waste
Management&#151;The Effects on Quantity and Composition </h3>
<p>Source reduction is increasingly important as a solid waste
preventative strategy. Nearly every entity and individual can be
or is engaged in some source reduction activity. As a
consequence, the solid waste stream is continually changing in
quantity and composition. Therefore, the community solid waste
management official should anticipate that changes will take
place in the future. Different types of source reduction
activities are discussed in this report. </p>
<p>Competition among industries that manufacture and companies
that sell products and packages means that they are more or less
continuously involved in source reduction activity. This takes
the form of product or package &quot;design for the
environment,&quot; lightweighting, combining materials together,
and using alternative materials or configurations. This leads to
almost continuous small changes in the quantity and composition
of the products and packages manufactured. </p>
<p>From the perspective of the community official, several
signals may be important. Successful source reduction activity
may introduce more of one family of materials into solid waste,
while reducing others. For example, flexible packaging (e.g.,
film) may displace certain types of rigid packaging (e.g.,
boxes). </p>
<p>Offsetting these factors is the observation that both
population increases and economic growth lead to more products
and packaging being produced (both existing and new products).
Consequently, this growth may offset even significant source
reduction measures, so that MSW generation may continue to grow. </p>
<p>Community educators, businesses, governments, and institutions
are focusing attention on source reduction measures. Their
combined roles are having an effect in reducing total MSW
generation (or at least slowing its growth). These entities have
taken measures to reduce and reuse products in everyday activity. </p>
<p>Individuals can have a significant impact by such actions as
reducing the disposal of yard trimmings via backyard composting,
by extending the life of products, and by reusing products when
possible. Consequently, there are source reduction measures that
can be undertaken at any level of human activity.</p>

</p>
<h3>Infrastructure </h3>
<p>Options for Recovering Products and Materials from MSW for
Recycling and Composting A summary of the various ways by which
recyclable materials can be collected and processed from
residential sources of MSW is listed below. (Commercial recovery
for recycling generally takes place via private sector activity
in response to market demand for recyclables.) Options described
in this report include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Curbside collection and materials recovery facility (MRF) </li>
    <li>Drop-off center </li>
    <li>Buy-back center </li>
    <li>Delivery to scrap dealer or processor </li>
    <li>Collection at transfer stations and/or other disposal
        sites </li>
    <li>Yard trimmings compost facility </li>
    <li>Multi-family collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key observations for residential MSW are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>All mechanisms of collection and processing are very
        important. In fact, traditional scrap collection systems,
        e.g., paper drives, still account for a great deal of
        recovery. Recovery for recycling from drop-offs,
        buy-backs, and deposits accounted for 4.1 percent of
        total MSW. </li>
    <li>Recovery for recycling from curbside collection accounted
        for 2.5 percent of total MSW, but is the only current
        means to capture a relatively high percentage of many
        products in residential MSW. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Economics of MSW Management Alternatives </h3>
<p>Six solid waste management options were evaluated for
residential MSW&#151;landfilling only, waste-to-energy, yard
trimmings composting, a base case curbside recycling program for
single-family residences, an expanded curbside recycling program
for single-family residences, and a combination of
recycling/composting with landfill. The average total solid waste
management system costs and revenues for five of these options
are summarized in Table 6. It is important to note that these are
based on national averages; local costs can vary widely. Also, it
is important to note that these values are for new infrastructure
in all five cases.</p>
<p><strong>Table 6<br>
Summary of Costs of Various Solid Waste Management<br>
Alternatives for Households MSW*<br>
(in dollars per ton)</strong><br>
<img src="table6.gif" alt="Table 6" align="bottom" width="560"
height="342"><br>
* In an average metropolitan area of 500,000 population.<br>
** Processing costs at waste-to-energy plant including ash
disposal; revenue is from sale of energy.<br>
&#135; From Appendix H.<br>
<em>Source: Franklin Associates, Ltd.</em> </p>
<p><br>
<br>
Special note should be taken that a relatively high recovery rate
was assumed for each case, i.e., that capture of material is
close to a maximum for a well designed program. Said another way,
lower recovery rates will result in higher costs per ton for a
recycling program. </p>
<p>The model metropolitan area analysis represented in Table 6 is
based on 155,000 single-family homes served and 185,600 tons per
year of household MSW managed. In terms of total solid waste
management system costs for one year, the costs are about $13 per
ton, or $2.45 million over landfill only for the base case
curbside recycling scenario. This translates to an increase of
$1.31 per household per month of total MSW managed. </p>
<p>The comparable differences for the expanded curbside recycling
scenario are an increase of $3.13 million, about $17 per ton or
$1.68 per household per month. For composting, the values are
$2.89 million, or $16 per ton, or $1.55 per household per month
increase over landfill only. Waste-to-energy is the highest cost
option at $47 per ton increase, or $4.70 per household per month. </p>
<p>These scenarios were also expressed in terms of increased cost
ranges over conventional landfill costs in dollars per household
per month (Figure 6). The costs are expressed in ranges to
demonstrate the variability of different program designs and
local circumstances. The data in Table 6 also show how costs
behave as different recycling scenarios are displayed. The most
significant observation is that total collection costs increase
in dollars per ton when two collection systems are used. This is
true for both the landfill and recycling system, because the
collection systems are less efficient (Table 6). For example, it
takes more stops and longer to fill a refuse truck when
recyclables are separated out. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Figure 6. Average metropolitan area household solid waste<br>
management cost increases with yard trimmings composting<br>
and/or curbside recycling (Added cost over landfilling only) </h4>
<p><img src="figure6.gif" alt="Figure 6" align="bottom"
width="405" height="167"> </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Curbside collection costs in non-urban areas were found to be
more costly than in urban areas. For example, the system solid
waste management costs for base case curbside collection costs
are $17 per ton in a non-urban area compared to $13 per ton in an
urban area, or 30 percent higher. The economics of rural and
small city recycling beyond curbside collection were not examined
in detail. However, programs in which citizens and businesses
provide their own collection and delivery to drop-off locations
may be the most effective type of program applicable in these
areas. </p>
<p>All systems for managing solid waste are evolutionary in
nature. While the pattern of multiple truck collection of
recyclable and compostable materials and trash now used will
likely continue through the balance of the 1990s, technology and
economics will require more innovation in the near future. Thus,
planning for the future must consider how collection techniques
can be developed to drive costs down and yet capture the
components of the waste stream in a usable fashion. </p>
<p>When, for example, a multiple service truck is devised that
combines recyclable materials, compostable materials, and trash
in one collection step <em>and retains the quality of the
recyclables</em>, the economics of integrated solid waste
management can change dramatically. Municipal decision makers
should consider how such a system may change the &quot;status
quo&quot; system that will likely continue for most of the
balance of the 1990s. </p>
<p>The principal observations on the economics of recycling
alternatives are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Collection and transportation costs dominate. </li>
    <li>Curbside collection for recycling adds total direct costs
        to a conventional MSW management system. Revenues
        fluctuate, but partially offset costs. </li>
    <li>Yard trimmings composting is the most cost efficient
        alternative. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Markets for Potentially Recoverable Materials </h3>
<p>For the past decade, there has been great concern about
adequate capacity for utilizing recovered materials and access to
regional scrap users and plants. In fact, &quot;markets&quot; has
been the principal focus of attention for those seeking to
increase recycling. Several industries have established new or
expanded capacity to utilize recovered products and materials,
and either actively seek or at least accept materials that become
available from community programs and private sector activity.
Other markets are in an emerging or potential status. </p>
<p>A detailed overview of the 1992 generation and recovery of
recyclable products and yard trimmings in residential MSW is
given in Table 7. The general status of the market for each
material is also included. It is important to note that
established markets (manufacturers' capacity) exist for eight of
the materials, which constitute 27.8 million tons of the 46.6
million tons generated (60 percent of the total tonnage of
recyclable materials). This does not mean that 100 percent
recovery is possible or that recycling capacity exists for all of
the tonnage, but it does indicate that there is certainly an
established demand for the materials being collected. </p>

</p>
<p>There are several key observations and conclusions related to
markets for materials and products in residential (and
commercial) MSW, as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Scrap markets are, by their nature, commodity-like and
        have fluctuations in demand. Consequently, the value of
        materials recovered from MSW can vary widely, especially
        at the point of generation and collection. For example,
        in 1994 the market demand for many recyclable materials
        increased and market prices have risen dramatically. But,
        true to the cycles of the past, there will be a decline
        to follow. The message for communities is that
        residential collection programs should be designed for
        the long term, recognizing that there will be
        fluctuations and volatility in prices. Communities with
        existing recycling programs will benefit (short term)
        when these price &quot;spikes&quot; occur. However,
        increased recovery efforts of all kinds quickly follow
        price increases, and increased recovery will tend to
        drive prices down. </li>
    <li>Manufacturing capacity to utilize recovered materials
        exists or has been put in place in the last few years.
        The fact that the capacity exists to utilize recovered
        materials establishes only that demand can exist. At the
        community level, however, the economics, distance to
        market, infrastructure, and quality of material are
        limiting factors. The most critical market requirement
        for recovered materials is that they meet the quality
        specifications of those manufacturers that utilize
        recovered materials. </li>
    <li>Recovery of recyclable materials from commercial sources
        is based on market demand and generally cost-effective
        recovery techniques (including avoided disposal costs of
        the generator). </li>
    <li>Recovery of recyclable materials from residential MSW has
        tended to follow a pattern in which collection and
        processing have been carried out first. Industries have
        established capacity to utilize recovered materials in
        response to growing supply. </li>
    <li>Considering both total U.S. and regional capacity, the
        products that offer the strongest market potential in
        residential MSW are newspapers, corrugated boxes, glass
        containers, steel cans, aluminum cans, PET plastic
        containers, HDPE plastic containers and, on an emerging
        basis, magazines and mixed papers. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The Role of Recycling and Composting in Integrated Solid
Waste Management in 2000 </h3>
<p>By the year 2000, the generation of MSW will likely have
increased from 203 million tons to 215.5 million tons (Figure 7). </p>
<p>Three projected scenarios for the year 2000&#151;25 percent,
30 percent, and 35 percent recovery for recycling and
composting&#151;are summarized in Table 8. The immediate
observation for the highest recovery rate is that about 50
percent of the recyclable/compostable materials would have to be
recovered to reach a 35 percent overall recovery rate. Fifty
percent is a high recovery rate and represents the practical
limits of recovery for most of the products in the recyclable
product category. A summary recovery analysis for the 25, 30, and
35 percent scenarios is given in Table 8. </p>
<p>The reason that 50 percent recovery of the selected products
is difficult to achieve on a broad basis is a result of three
factors that influence recoverability:</p>

</p>
<ol>
    <li>Citizen access to a collection program </li>
    <li>Citizen participation in the program </li>
    <li>&quot;Capture&quot; of the material from participating
        households. </li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a newspaper program may have the following
profile: 90 percent access, 85 percent participation, and 90
percent capture. The recovery potential is 69 percent (0.9 x 0.85
x 0.9). Most products in residences will have significantly lower
recovery potential (see analysis in Table 9). </p>
<p>The practical maximum residential recovery percentage was
estimated for 11 product/material categories and further
evaluated for curbside collection based on four factors that
could introduce constraints on recovery. They are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Infrastructure to collect and process materials </li>
    <li>Market capacity to utilize recovered materials </li>
    <li>Quality of recovered products/materials </li>
    <li>Economics of recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following observations can be made: </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>The economic considerations have a common theme: recovery
        of residential materials via curbside collection is
        generally more costly than conventional landfill
        disposal. </li>
    <li>The quality of recovered materials can substantially
        affect recovery programs that are not operated to meet
        market specifications. </li>
    <li>Within the residential recovery potential, there will be
        adequate market capacity on average in 2000 to utilize
        essentially all of the materials recovered from
        residential sources, with few exceptions. Regional
        situations can have a dramatic effect, however, and need
        to be considered carefully in any community program.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final analysis, the most critical factors are the
infrastructure to collect and process the materials considered
for residential recycling or composting, and the economics of
starting and operating those programs. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the role of curbside collection in 1992 and 2000
was evaluated using a series of estimates and assumptions (see
Appendix K for details). The results of the calculations are
summarized in Table 10. </p>
<p>In 1992, curbside collection of recyclable products was an
estimated 5.1 million tons, which was 2.5 percent of total MSW
generation (and 4.4 percent of total residential MSW generation).
To achieve a 30 to 35 percent recovery of MSW by 2000, a doubling
of tonnage recovered by curbside collection would be required
(10.0 million tons). At the level of 10.0 million tons, curbside
recovery would amount to 4.6 percent of total MSW generation, or
8.6 percent of residential MSW generation (Table 10 and Figure
8). In essence, the population served by curbside collection
would need to double between 1992 and 2000 to achieve this level,
from an estimated 27 to 54 million single-family homes, about
two-thirds of all single-family homes. The expansion of curbside
collection to thousands more communities and millions more homes
is a substantial undertaking, requiring expansion of programs in
non-urban areas where costs of curbside collection may be higher
on a per-ton basis. Each community will need to consider its own
goals carefully. </p>
<p>In addition, there must be substantial expansion of other
types of programs including multi-family housing, drop-off
centers, paper drives, and traditional scrap facilities. Programs
such as drop-offs in non-urban areas must be expanded or put in
place as well. In essence, a national average recovery scenario
means that all types of recovery efforts will be important on a
broad geographic basis. </p>

<p><br>
<br>
The principal conclusions to be drawn from this analysis are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Curbside collection captured a relatively small amount of
        total MSW in 1992 (about 2.5 percent). </li>
    <li>With a doubling of curbside collection and processing,
        capture in 2000 would be about 5 percent of total MSW.
        This means that, on average, curbside collection alone
        cannot achieve a major diversion of MSW from disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the 25, 30, and 35 percent
recovery for recycling scenarios apply to a community, a
metropolitan area, a state, or a region in roughly the same way.
The recovery range identified generally defines local, regional,
and national potential. Some communities have been more highly
successful and reach above 35 percent recovery for recycling and
composting. However, many other communities achieve far below
this range (some because yard trimmings composting is not
feasible), and may even choose not to make the investment and
incur the costs of residential collection programs. </p>
<p>In addition, the commercial sources of MSW are extremely
important; they account for well over one-half of all recovery,
and will continue to do so. Thus, programs to inform and educate
businesses, institutions, and government about recycling are very
important. </p>
<p>Residential recovery is, however, where most communities can
put infrastructure into place; but it is difficult to achieve
higher levels of recovery for recycling from residential MSW
alone for the following reasons: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Most of the recycled products will be at or near their
        limits of recovery in a 30 percent recovery scenario,
        although a few of them can be pushed somewhat higher. </li>
    <li>The selected recyclable products (exclusive of yard
        trimmings) constitute 55 percent of all MSW in 1992 and
        61 percent in 2000. Thus, to achieve total MSW recovery
        rates in excess of 25 to 35 percent, the capture of
        selected products from residential (and commercial)
        sources would have to be at unsustainably high levels. </li>
    <li>Yard trimmings composted constituted a significant part
        of recovery from residential sources in 1992 (about 40
        percent as much composting as recovery of products from
        residential MSW). Under the 30 percent recovery scenario
        in 2000, composted yard trimmings would still be 37
        percent as much as the selected products recovered from
        residential MSW.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, recycling and composting as defined in this study are
clearly only a part of MSW management and will likely be peaking
out by 2000, absent dramatic changes in technology and
infrastructure to collect and process MSW. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>State, Regional, or Local Recycling or Diversion Goals </h3>
<p>Diversion or recycling goals may be established in a community
or state. These fall into two general classes: (1) diversion or
recycling goals of 20 percent to 35 percent; and (2) diversion or
recycling goals of 35 percent to 70 percent. </p>
<p>In the first instance, diversion of 20 to 35 percent can be
achieved with materials recovery and yard trimmings composting
(or by eliminating collection of yard trimmings). The logistics
and costs of materials recovery become problematic above 25 to 35
percent for the reasons discussed previously. </p>
<p>There are several other management and technology options that
deal with a large segment of MSW in a useful way, but are not
recovery for recycling as defined here. These are listed below in
no particular order of priority because each community may have
circumstances that lead to choose one or more. They are: </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Source reducing yard trimmings (through backyard
        composting of grass, leaves, and brush, or by leaving
        grass clippings on lawn) so that they do not enter the
        MSW collection system. </li>
    <li>Converting the vegetable (i.e., non-animal) portion of
        food waste to a compost or feed for animals. </li>
    <li>Converting paper and other compostable organics, e.g.,
        food waste, to a mixed waste compost. </li>
    <li>Converting paper and/or plastics to a prepared fuel for
        use in an industrial boiler. </li>
    <li>Waste-to-energy combustion in an MSW-dedicated boiler
        plant.</li>
</ul>
<p>One or more of these options may be needed to reach almost any
diversion goal above 35 percent by 2000. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Energy and Solid Waste Consequences of Recycling and
Landfilling </h3>
<p>All human activity, including recycling, has some resource and
environmental consequences. Recovery for recycling usually saves
energy and reduces solid wastes landfilled. The most obvious
benefit to recycling is diversion of recovered materials from
conventional disposal, i.e., reduced dependence on landfills. </p>
<p>Each of the solid waste management alternatives was evaluated
in terms of net energy consumption (or savings) and related
environmental emissions, particularly the net amount of solid
waste ultimately landfilled. For example, landfill as a disposal
alternative requires minimal fuel for collection vehicles and
landfill equipment, but provides no municipal solid waste
diversion from landfills. In contrast, recycling diverts waste
from landfills and, while recycling requires additional energy
for collection, processing, and transporting materials to market,
energy savings are often realized by the increased use of
recovered materials in the remanufacturing process. </p>
<p>Landfill disposal requires relatively little energy, about 0.5
million Btu per ton of residential municipal solid waste
landfilled. Once landfilled, however, the energy
&quot;investment&quot; and emissions associated with the original
manufacture and use of the product are lost. By contrast,
waste-to-energy facilities will capture the heat value in the
organic materials with attendant releases to the air, water, and
land (via ash). These releases may be similar to or less than
power production from coal, and, as in other power plants, must
be controlled. </p>
<p>Emissions to the air, water, and land avoided due to the
increased use of recyclable materials in remanufacturing is
primarily due to the reduction in energy use (versus
manufacturing with virgin raw materials). Unlike energy and solid
waste, which can each be presented as a single value (i.e., Btu
of pounds of waste discarded), individual emissions comprising
atmospheric and waterborne emissions cannot be meaningfully added
together. Also, these emissions are site-specific and may occur
far from the community from which the materials were recovered. </p>
<p>From the standpoint of energy resources, the most significant
effects are not from the collection, processing, and shipment of
recovered materials. Rather, the most significant effects are
realized due to the increased use of recovered materials in the
manufacturing step. Approximately 1.5 million Btu of energy are
required to collect, prepare for shipment, and transport to
market one ton of recyclable materials typically collected
through a curbside collection program. The total energy conserved
through the increased use of these materials in remanufacturing
is over 18.3 million Btu per ton of recyclables recovered. </p>
<p>Based on 5 million tons of recyclable materials collected
through curbside programs in the U.S. in 1992, and an average
annual residential energy consumption per household of about 100
million Btu, the annual energy conserved is equivalent to the
energy requirements of 840,000 residences. Most of the energy
conserved is derived from recycling aluminum, some plastics, and
newspapers. Typically, the energy and/or environmental benefits
occur outside the community from which the material is recovered
for recycling (except for reduction of landfill requirements). </p>
<p>The environmental analysis allows communities to begin to
identify and understand the energy and environmental tradeoffs
associated with different solid waste management alternatives,
and provides some perspective on the relative magnitude of net
energy requirements and environmental releases of each
alternative. </p>
<p>A summary of energy and landfill requirements for two
alternatives&#151;landfilling and base case recycling&#151;is
shown in Table 11. </p>

<h3>Key Observations </h3>
<p>Recovery of materials for recycling will continue to grow in
the context of an MSW management technique. At the same time, the
practical overall limits are in the range of 25 to 35 percent
recovery for recycling/composting. This could possibly be
achieved by expanded residential curbside or equivalent programs,
but would require doubling the number of single-family homes
served. Recovery from commercial waste for recycling is an
absolutely vital part of the materials management options. The
most promising area of research is to reduce collection costs
without sacrificing the quality of materials recovered. </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>There are costs to increasing recovery. Program costs
        will have growing influence over the decision-making
        process at the local level. The reality is that recycling
        at the community level is not free and usually does not
        reduce the costs of total solid waste management. In
        fact, it increases costs in most communities. Since
        collection costs dominate total costs, emphasis on
        reducing collection costs is important to pursue. This
        will require innovative collection techniques, which are
        just beginning to emerge. Revenues from recovered
        materials help to offset costs, but will fluctuate with
        scrap markets. </li>
    <li>It will be important to expand existing recovery
        techniques or introduce other techniques as a way to
        reach diversion goals above 35 percent. The most
        promising options may come from diverting yard trimmings
        from MSW, composting food waste, converting paper and/or
        plastic to a prepared fuel, and other techniques that may
        become feasible by the end of the century. </li>
    <li>A 30 percent recovery scenario for recycling and
        composting in the year 2000 would only offset the total
        projected growth in MSW generated (driven by increases in
        population and economic growth), leaving the remaining
        152 million tons of MSW to be managed through other
        integrated solid waste management approaches and emerging
        technologies.</li>

</p>
<h4>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
amount of garbage generated annually in the United States is over
200 million tons. The safe and efficient management of this waste
calls for creative, integrated approaches. Composting is one
approach that is being used in backyards and on a municipal level
to reduce organic wastes. </h4>
<p><br>
<img src="wdycomp.gif" lowsrc="lwdycomp.gif"
alt="Woody Woodpecker with Compost Pile" align="right" hspace="0"
width="304" height="236"> </p>
<h4>What is Composting?</h4>
<p>Composting is the aerobic (oxygen-dependent) biological
process by which plant and other organic materials decompose
under controlled conditions. The finished product is a dark
brown, partially decomposed form of organic matter similar to the
organic matter in soil.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Why Make Compost?</h4>
<p>Disposing of leaves, grass clippings, and other garden refuse
is often a problem for homeowners. This material can be turned
into useful compost very readily. Returning these organic
materials to the soil perpetuates natural biological cycles, and
is an ecologically sensible means of using organic wastes. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>The Value of Compost</h4>
<p>Good compost consists of a small amount of soil along with
decomposed or partially decomposed plant residues. Although
compost contains nutrients&#151;nitrogen, potassium, and
phosphorus&#151;its greatest benefit is in improving soil
characteristics. As a soil amendment it improves texture and
aeration, increases the soil's ability to retain water, and
decreases erosion. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>How Compost Forms</h4>
<p>Composting changes the nutrients in raw organic material to a
form that can be absorbed by the roots of growing plants.
Microorganisms such as soil bacteria and fungi accomplish this
task by secreting enzymes that break down the material. The
activity of these microorganisms can generate temperatures inside
the compost pile in excess of 130&#176; F&#151;high enough to
kill most weed seeds and disease organisms. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>What Materials May Be Composted?</h4>
<p>Many types of organic materials can be used for
composting&#151;grass clippings, manure, leaves, corn stalks,
pine needles, sawdust, wood ashes, and many other kinds of plant
refuse. Twigs should not be added unless they are chipped because
they decompose very slowly. </p>
<p>Most organic household garbage can also be composted. This
includes fruit and vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and egg
shells. It's best to avoid fats and meat scraps because they
decompose very slowly, create unpleasant odors, and attract
vermin. A good compost pile has no odor and does not attract
flies or rodents. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Making a Compost Heap</h4>
<p>Locate the heap in a convenient but inconspicuous location.
Select a level, well-drained spot, preferably in full sun. Since
the compost pile needs to be kept moist, a convenient source of
water is helpful. Compost should never get soggy wet or the
decomposition will stop. Compost piles function best when about
as moist as a wrung-out sponge, and provided with many air
passages. </p>
<p>The size of the pile may vary greatly with the amount of
material available, but should be at least three feet wide and
three feet high. Anything smaller will not decompose properly. </p>
<p>The top of the pile should be left flat or with a slight
depression in the center to catch rain or added water. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Types of Enclosures</h4>
<p>A compost bin is not necessary but does make it easier to
build and maintain a pile. Woven wire, cement blocks, lumber,
snow fence, hay bales, railroad ties, or bricks can be used to
enclose a compost heap. Whatever you use, make sure there is
adequate air movement through the side. </p>
<p>Construction of one removable wall allows easy access for
turning the pile with a shovel or pitchfork. Some people build
adjacent bins, turning the material from one to the other. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Constructing the Pile</h4>
<p>Begin the pile by spreading a 6- to 8-inch layer of organic
matter directly on the ground. A layer of brush on the bottom
will hold the pile off the ground and help aerate it. Materials
that tend to mat, such as grass clippings, should be placed in
layers only 2- to 3-inches thick. Moisten, but do not soak, the
layer of organic material. </p>
<p><img src="compost.gif" lowsrc="lcmpost.gif"
alt="Diagram of Compost Pile" align="left" hspace="5" width="302"
height="162"> Organisms that are largely responsible for the
breakdown of the organic materials require quantities of
fertilizer. So, over the layer of plant materials, sprinkle about
1/2 cup of garden fertilizer to promote rapid and thorough
decomposition. </p>
<p>Next, add a layer of soil l- to 2-inches thick. The soil
contains the microorganisms that help start the decomposition
process. </p>
<p>Continue to alternate the layers of organic materials and
soil, adding water periodically, until the pile is a maximum of
five feet high. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Care of the Pile</h4>
<p>The compost pile must be kept moist (but not soggy) for proper
heating and decomposition. A well constructed heap should begin
heating up in a few days. Turning the pile weekly to move
composted material out of the hot center and replacing it with
partially composted material from the sides greatly speeds the
composting process. </p>
<p>You may keep track with a thermometer and turn the pile when
its center begins to cool off. The length of time required will
vary with size of pile and time of year. As material decomposes,
the pile should shrink to about half of its original height. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Using Compost</h4>
<p>Normally, compost will be ready for use in four to six months,
depending on the types of organic materials used and the climatic
conditions during the composting period. When the compost is
broken down into a homogenous mixture; no undecomposed leaves or
other material may be seen; and the pile stops heating, it is
ready to use. </p>
<p>Compost can be used as &quot;top dressing&quot; for lawns, for
mulching around landscape and garden plants, or anywhere that
additional soil is needed. </p>

<p><br>
</p>
<p>You've decided it's time you, your group, or class did
something to improve the community. That's a good idea because it
can encourage other people to do the same and show them why it's
important to take pride in their city or town and not litter. </p>
<p><img src="beach.gif" lowsrc="lbeach.gif" alt="Beach Cleanup"
align="left" hspace="5" width="337" height="206"> You may have a
project in mind already. If not, there is one waiting right now
to be discovered. It could be a cleanup or graffiti paint-over,
the restoration of a neglected park or historic monument, turning
a vacant lot into a community garden, or volunteering to
&quot;adopt&quot; an area and keep it clean.</p>
<p>If any part of your project includes cleaning up litter or
removing a pile of trash, there are several important things you
should know before getting started.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Why People Litter</h3>
<p>Research conducted by Keep America Beautiful, Inc. has found
that people litter because they feel no sense of ownership for
the property; because they believe someone else will pick up
after them; and because litter has already accumulated. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Dealing With Illegal Dumping</h3>
<p>Some people also dump garbage, old appliances, tree
branches&#151;anything that fits in a car or truck&#151;in
less-traveled places or somewhere where they think they won't be
caught. This is illegal dumping. It may also happen because
material has been banned from a landfill without an alternative
plan, or because people think the cost to dispose of their
household garbage legally is too high. </p>
<p>This can be combated through cleanups, restricting access to
places where people can drive in and dump, and asking area
residents to report suspicious activity. </p>
<p><img src="grafcln.gif" lowsrc="lgrafcln.gif"
alt="Graffiti Cleanup" align="right" hspace="0" width="252"
height="243"> <br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Your Project Can Change Attitudes</h3>
<p>Changing attitudes about waste and its handling reduces litter
and dumping. Your project can help in two important ways.
Removing litter or graffiti and cleaning up the area will make it
less likely to attract more waste. And involving people helps
them appreciate the environment more and learn that their actions
matter.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Where Can I Get Help?</h3>
<p>You should make a special effort to contact local or county
public works, highway, or sanitation departments well in advance.
Officials may be able to send a truck to pick up bagged litter or
big items or provide paint to cover graffiti. </p>
<p>Businesses can be asked to donate snacks and drinks, or buy
flowers your group will plant nearby. Also contact local Scout
troops and youth organizations and ask for their participation.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Ideas to Make A Project Work</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Be creative in selecting a project. Restoring an old
        monument, for example, is an opportunity for students to
        learn about local history and write a report.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Select a project whose benefits will be enjoyed by many
        people.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Get permission from the government agency responsible for
        the land or the property owner.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Visit the site. Knowing that there are large objects
        makes it easier to plan their removal.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Take &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; photos.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Tell your local newspaper, radio, and television station
        about the project and the positive impact it will have.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Keep a diary, complete with names and phone numbers,
        should you decide to do the project again.<br>
    </li>
    <li>After the project, write thank-you letters to anyone who
        donated goods or services, and to public officials who
        involved their departments.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Be sure to thank everyone who volunteered.<br>

<h2>Keeping rivers, lakes, and beaches free of litter is up to
all of us.</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
<img src="fishing.gif" lowsrc="lfishing.gif" alt="Men fishing."
align="right" hspace="0" width="381" height="260">No one likes to
see litter, especially when we find it at the beach, in our
favorite lake, or along the banks of a quiet stream. And although
many of us do our part by handling waste wisely, litter and
debris in our water still causes many problems. </p>
<p>Birds, fish, turtles, seals, and even large whales may become
entangled in it. Or they eat it because they mistake it for food. </p>
<p>Floating litter fouls boat engines, leaving boaters stranded
on the water or facing expensive repairs. </p>
<p>And litter is an eyesore that not only spoils the beauty of
the smallest stream and the widest sandy beach, but invites some
people to add more because they think that no one cares. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>What's the Answer to Marine Litter?</h3>
<p>The good news is that there are things we can all do to stop
litter before it ends up in our community's waterways or along
beaches, regardless of where we live. While many people think the
things we find along the shore are dumped by ships at sea, much
of it actually comes from our own careless attitudes and improper
waste handling practices much closer to home. </p>
<p>There are also laws against dumping into the water. In the
U.S., it's illegal for boats of any size to dump garbage in
lakes, rivers, bays, and up to three miles out to sea. Violators
can be fined up to $50,000. There is also an international treaty
among nations prohibiting ships from dumping trash in the oceans. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Bringing It Back Is The Best Policy</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>If you own a boat, keep a supply of litterbags aboard.
        Ask your guests to use them, just as you would ask them
        to use a life jacket.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Encourage the marina where you dock or the town where you
        launch your boat to put litter receptacles out.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Save tangled fishing line, which can trap birds and
        marine animals, and dispose of it properly. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Re-stock your tackle box beforehand instead of buying
        items and opening them while you fish.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you see another boater dumping trash overboard, notify
        the Coast Guard or local marine police.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>We Can All Help Keep the Water Clean</h3>
<p>You don't have to own a boat or be a fisherman&#151;there are
things everyone can do to keep America's waterways and beaches
clean:<br>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Bring an extra bag to the beach and set an example by
        picking up any litter around your blanket or towel.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Handle waste properly and always use litter baskets.
        Litter is often blown about by the wind and can end up in
        the water.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Pick up litter around storm drains. Storm drains can
        carry rainwater and litter from streets directly into
        waterways.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Boy or Girl Scout troops can give out litterbags at
        public boat launches.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Find out if you, your group, or business can adopt a
        section of stream or river and pick up litter several
        times a year.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Ask your parks department to place litter containers in
        parks or at public beaches if none are there.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Take children on a picnic near the water. Tell them why
        it's important to handle waste and litter wisely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping America's parks and open spaces clean is everyone's
responsibility.</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
We all have favorite places outdoors that offer unlimited chances
for fun and recreation&#151;whether we walk, jog, play sports,
ride a bike or even a surfboard. Favorite places also give us
enjoyment because of their natural beauty. Popular or quiet, each
of these areas should be treated as though they're our
own&#151;because they are. </p>
<p><br>

<h3>&quot;This Land is My Land&quot;</h3>
<p>America's most majestic national parks have something in
common with our own library and City Hall. They all belong to the
public&#151;you and me. In fact, over one-third of America is
&quot;public land.&quot; Local, state, and federal agencies set
this land aside for many uses, including transportation,
education, and recreation. Other areas protect nature, wildlife,
and sites of historic significance. Public lands help every
community meet civic and cultural needs.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Who's Responsible?</h3>
<p>Keeping these areas clean is up to us. But research done by
Keep America Beautiful, Inc. found that many people feel
otherwise. Believing that &quot;someone else&quot; will clean up
after them is one attitude people use to justify littering or
dumping garbage. Having no sense of ownership is another. As a
result, millions of tax dollars and many hours are spent annually
picking up trash. Money is also spent removing graffiti and
repairing vandalism caused by people who don't respect public
land. </p>
<p>Showing respect for public lands such as parks and areas set
aside as open spaces can also mean hiking only on designated
trails, not picking rare flowers or plants, and not disturbing
wild animals.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>You Can Make A Difference!</h3>
<p>The most important thing you can do is to set an example for
others, especially by not littering. If everyone followed our
example, tax dollars could be used for everything from new
playground equipment to important community services. You can
also:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Ask family and friends to set examples.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Teach children why it's important not to litter.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Follow park rules.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Remember that public areas are yours to enjoy and care
        for, even though you may be on vacation or in another
        community.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Hike only where there are trails. Some areas, especially
        sand dunes on beaches, can be eroded if too many people
        walk over them.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Have your school class make a list of different public
        areas and what they are used for. Visit several to see
        how they serve the community's needs.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Invite someone from a local park or nature center to
        visit your class and speak about the importance of caring
        for public areas and using them wisely so that others can
        also enjoy them.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you belong to a civic organization, club, or
        recreational sports team, organize a group project to
        repair playground equipment, build benches, or enhance a
        neglected area. Work in cooperation with your local parks
        department.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Pick one area and learn about the plants and animals that
        are found there. Why do you think it's important to take
        care of their home?</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Can I Do More?</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Ask a camera club if it will sponsor a photo contest,
        using public areas as the subject. Camera stores can help
        contact club members.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Loan an inexpensive instant camera to a school. Students
        can take a picture of a favorite outdoor area and write a
        story telling why it's special.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Call the local Parks and Recreation department and
        volunteer to help organize a &quot;Pride in Public Parks
        Day&quot; cleanup. Speak to businesses, youth groups,
        churches, and civic groups about such an event and ask
        for their participation.</li>

<p><br>
When was the last time you saw someone littering? It may be hard
to remember. But litter just doesn't appear&#151;it's the result
of careless attitudes and waste handling. Is there anything you
can do? Knowing more about litter and where it comes from is a
good place to start. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Why People Litter</h3>
<p>Research by Keep America Beautiful, Inc. found that people
litter because: </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>they feel no sense of ownership, even though areas such
        as parks and beaches are public property.<br>
    </li>
    <li>they believe someone else&#151;a park maintenance or
        highway worker&#151;will pick up after them.<br>
    </li>
    <li>litter has already accumulated.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>&quot;Litter-known&quot; Facts</h3>
<p>Motorists and pedestrians are often blamed for litter. There
are actually seven primary sources:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>household trash handling and its placement at the curb
        for collection<br>
        <img src="litflwr.gif" lowsrc="llitflwr.gif"
        alt="Litter around flowers." align="right" hspace="0"
        width="261" height="192"> </li>
    <li>dumpsters used by businesses<br>
    </li>
    <li>loading docks<br>
    </li>
    <li>construction and demolition sites<br>
    </li>
    <li>trucks with uncovered loads<br>
    </li>
    <li>pedestrians<br>
    </li>
    <li>motorists<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Litter is blown about by wind and traffic or carried by water.
It moves until trapped by a curb, building, or fence. Once litter
has accumulated, it invites people to add more. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Litter and Your Taxes</h3>
<p>Litter is a costly problem. Highway departments spend millions
of tax dollars and many hours annually picking up
litter&#151;money and time needed for more important services.
Local, state, and federal governments also spend money removing
litter left by careless park visitors. </p>
<p>Clean communities also have a better chance of attracting new
businesses than those where litter is common. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>What Can I Do?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><img src="dispose.gif" lowsrc="ldispose.gif"
        alt="Woman disposing of litter properly." align="right"
        hspace="5" width="281" height="220">Set an example for
        others, especially children, by not littering.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Carry a litterbag in your car.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure trash cans have lids that can be securely
        fastened. If you have curbside trash collection, don't
        put out loose trash in boxes.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Tie papers in a bundle before placing them in a curbside
        recycling bin.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you own a business, check dumpsters daily to see that
        top and side doors are closed.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you or a member of your family is involved in a civic
        group, scouting, or recreational sports program,
        encourage the group to &quot;adopt&quot; a spot in your
        town and maintain it on a regular basis.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Make litterbags for your bicycle, and give them to your
        friends, too.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Report areas where people have illegally dumped garbage
        and debris to your local highway, public works, or
        conservation office, and ask that the material be
        removed.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Volunteer to help organize a cleanup.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Can I Do More? </h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Ask the organizers of a festival, fair, or other outdoor
        event in your community to make it a
        &quot;litter-free&quot; event. This can be done by giving
        out litterbags at entrances and making sure that everyone
        who attends knows that it is a &quot;litter-free&quot;
        day. Affiliates of Keep America Beautiful have organized
        litter-free concerts, fairs, and minor-league baseball
        games.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Cover open loads on all trucks.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you are a contractor, ask your chapter of the National
        Association of Home Builders about the <a href="bab.html">&quot;Build
        America Beautiful&quot;</a> program.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Encourage a school to start a &quot;clean campus&quot;
        program. This could include placement of trash
        receptacles, litter pick-ups, and projects in which
        students track litter's origins.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Ask marina operators if your Boy or Girl Scout troop or
        civic group can pass out litterbags to boaters. Public
        boat ramps are also good spots to give away litterbags.</li>

<h2>Garbage Pizza</h2>
<p>This sample lesson plan was taken from <em>Waste In Place</em>.
If you would like to order the complete curriculum guide, please
see our <a href="stuff.html#WIP">catalog</a>.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>describe the composition of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW); <br>
    </li>
    <li>identify items within each waste category; and<br>
    </li>
    <li>visualize the amount of waste and categories of MSW.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="wdy-pza.gif" lowsrc="lwdy-pza.gif"
alt="Woody Woodpecker with Pizza" align="left" hspace="0"
width="246" height="199"> <br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Students will construct a garbage pizza (a three-dimensional
pie chart) representing all of the waste thrown away in the
United States, with a slice for each waste category.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p><em>For pizza dough:</em> mixing bowl, spoon, rolling pin,
pizza pan, 2 cups flour, 2 cups salt, 1 cup water, oil or
shortening.</p>
<p><em>For pizza &quot;sauce&quot; and toppings:</em> school
glue, red food coloring, small paint brush, waste items from
these categories: paper, yard waste, wood, metals, glass, food
waste, plastics, and other waste (e.g.. rubber, leather,
textiles. misc. inorganic waste), polyurethane or lacquer
(optional)</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Vocabulary</h3>
<p>garbage, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), trash, volume, weight</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol type="1">
    <li><img src="msw.gif" lowsrc="lmsw.gif" alt="MSW Chart"
        align="right" hspace="0" width="358" height="464"> </li>
    <li>Before class, have prepared a &quot;Garbage Pizza&quot;
        crust, using the following recipe: Mix 2 cups of flour, 2
        cups salt, and 1 cup water (adjusting water per altitude
        and/or humidity) until a stiff dough forms. Knead as you
        would a bread dough. Flatten the dough into a well
        greased round 12&quot; deep dish pizza pan, pressing the
        edges up the inside of the pan. Flatten out slightly
        until it looks like a pizza pie. Cut the pizza into the
        same slices or sections to look like the Municipal Solid
        Waste by weight pie chart template included in this
        lesson. Using a fork or knife, puncture each slice
        several times before baking to avoid expanding air
        pockets. Bake at 350&#186; F for 40-45 minutes, or until
        golden brown. Check the pizza every 10 minutes or so and
        re-cut the sections. (If you do not cut the pizza before
        cooking, you will need a chain saw after it is done!)
        Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Dough
        should be hard and dry. Mix approximately 4 oz. of white
        school glue with approximately 2 oz. of red food coloring
        (adding a drop of blue food coloring will darken the red,
        but is not necessary for a successful &quot;sauce&quot;)
        until you achieve the desired red tomato sauce look.
        Apply sauce with a small paint brush (an apron is highly
        recommended). Allow to dry thoroughly. Label the
        underside of each slice with the correct type of waste
        and % it represents. A permanent marker works well. This
        makes it easier for students to glue the proper waste on
        the proper slice.</li>
    <li>Ask the students to define the words GARBAGE and TRASH.
        Garbage refers to only the organic or food waste thrown
        away. Trash represents broken, discarded or worthless
        things (e.g.. rubbish and other forms of refuse which are
        not food). Brainstorm with students and list on the
        chalkboard all the waste items thrown away at home or
        school. Use the following categories: paper, yard waste,
        metals, glass, plastics, wood, food wastes, and other.</li>
    <li>Introduce the concept of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). MSW
        is made up of trash and garbage from household,
        commercial, and institutional sources in a community. Ask
        the class if the items listed on the board would also be
        found in a community's MSW.</li>
    <li>Draw a circle on the board. Explain to students that we
        are going to pretend that all the waste thrown away in
        the United States will fit into this circle. This circle
        is filled with waste from all of the categories (paper,
        yard waste, metals, glass, plastic, wood, food waste, and
        other waste). Show students how much paper is thrown away
        by drawing a slice for paper (see chart included in this
        lesson). Repeat this demonstration for all eight
        categories. Reinforce the fact that the biggest slice,
        marked &quot;paper&quot; means that there is more paper
        than any other item in MSW. The next largest slice is
        yard waste, etc. Ask the students why it might be
        important to know the amount and kinds of waste thrown
        away. By knowing what kinds and amounts of things are in
        MSW, communities can plan better programs to reduce the
        amount of waste disposed (e.g., office paper recycling,
        telephone book recycling, yard waste composting), and
        plan better waste handling options (e.g.. waste-to-energy
        incineration, sanitary landfilling).</li>
    <li>Announce that the class is going to make a garbage pizza
        (with garbage and trash). Collect the items you need for
        the toppings, or have the students bring them from home.
        For example: 
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>paper: newsprint, shredded paper, boxes,
                wrappers;<br>
            </li>
            <li>yard waste: grass, sticks, leaves, potpourri;<br>
            </li>
            <li>metals: paper clips, staples, can, small
                hardware:<br>
            </li>
            <li>glass: marbles, sea glass;<br>
            </li>
            <li>plastics: foam cup, plastic fork, bread clips,
                jug lids;<br>
            </li>
            <li>wood: tooth picks, building blocks;<br>
            </li>
            <li>food wastes: egg shells, pasta, pretzels, dry
                cereal;<br>
            </li>
            <li>other: rubber band, candle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Show the students the &quot;pie chart&quot; pizza
        dough. Glue the waste items onto their corresponding
        pizza slices with uncolored glue or a hot glue gun. For
        an added touch after the glue has dried, spray the
        garbage pizza with polyurethane or lacquer, available at
        your local hardware store. </p>
        <p>Share the garbage pizza model with other classes or
        the entire school. Have students team-up and teach
        students in other grades about the MSW using the garbage
        pizza model. </p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Set up a table with items from the eight categories of MSW:
paper, yard waste, metals, glass, plastics, wood, food wastes,
and other. Make signs for each category, and have students
separate the waste items into the appropriate piles.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Enrichment</h3>
<p>Ask students to look through magazines for pictures of items
from each MSW category. Have each student draw a garbage pizza on
poster board and glue the pictures on the appropriate sections.
Display the posters in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Plan a classroom project to reduce the amount of paper in MSW.
Discuss ways students could reduce paper use and waste at school
(e.g.. don't waste paper, use both sides of paper, start a reuse
box for all kinds of paper, start a paper recycling program, ask
the principal if the school uses recycled paper, etc.).</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Developing the concepts of waste stream and source separation
by refuse generators</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to (1) make a mixed waste stream which
becomes difficult to separate, (2) make a flowchart and graph of
the waste flow, and (3) discuss solutions to the problem.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>We all produce trash and we all must take responsibility for
it. The U.S. produces about 209 million tons of garbage per year.
No single MSW management option alone can manage all of our
nation's waste. For example, recent U.S. EPA research predicts
that recycling and composting&#151;now 24 percent of all MSW
management activity&#151;can possibly be increased to 30 percent
of MSW management activity by 2000, though this will in fact
still require some significant changes in social behavior and in
other key social and economic factors. However even if we
accomplish this, American communities will still face over 156
million tons of garbage that will have to be managed in other
ways.</p>
<p>That is why the EPA, as well as many states and communities
across the nation, now actively pursue what is called an
integrated waste management approach to MSW. The integrated
approach offers communities five different waste management
options to choose from depending on their own specific needs and
the prevailing economic and environmental conditions they face.
The primary options (described in detail in the sections that
follow) include source reduction, recycling, composting,
landfilling and waste-to-energy (combustion). </p>
<p>Most communities use several of these options to manage their
waste stream, and many use all of them to some extent. The
important thing in an integrated waste management approach is
that each element of a community's waste stream is handled in the
most effective, cost-efficient, safe and environmentally
beneficial manner realistically practicable in that community.
This way, increments of progress can be sustained in an overall
MSW management program that lasts for the long term. Each of the
integrated waste management options entails both benefits and
costs, which will make it more appropriate in some situations and
less appropriate in others.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol type="I">
    <li><strong>Begin this activity by discussing</strong> with
        the students the concepts of &quot;throw-away
        society&quot; and &quot;one-use only,&quot; &quot;one-way
        flow&quot; of natural resources. Discuss the different
        kinds of materials that we throw away. 
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Give each student a copy of the student sheet
                &quot;GENERATED REFUSE COMPOSITION,&quot;
                included. Divide the class into ten groups and
                assign to each group one of the refuse materials
                on the handout.</li>
            <li>Explain to the class that they will compose one
                kilogram of refuse similar in composition to the
                waste projected for the year 2000. 
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Each group will determine the number of
                        grams of its assigned substance that it
                        will add to the container of one kilogram
                        of mixed waste. For example, paper will
                        represent about 43.4 percent of the
                        refuse stream in the year 2000; to make a
                        total of one kilogram of waste, 434 grams
                        of paper will have to be added. The paper
                        may be composed of shredded newspaper,
                        computer paper, cash register receipts,
                        or whatever types of paper the group
                        feels will be thrown away in the year
                        2000.</li>
                    <li>Students from each group will then bring
                        to class the discarded material that
                        their group will add to the container.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Each group will add its refuse</strong> material
        to the container and briefly explain what it represents
        and why it was chosen. 
        <ol type="A">
            <li>After each group has added its portion, mix up
                the contents thoroughly. Give each group of
                students a scoop of refuse on a large piece of
                paper. Ask each group to separate the materials
                that are reusable from those that are not
                reusable; have them use tweezers, plastic spoons,
                spatulas, or other small instruments to separate
                the waste.</li>
            <li>Ask the students: 
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>What materials were separated out as
                        reusable by your group?<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>How can these materials be reused?<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>What happens to waste that cannot be
                        readily sorted (such as shoes: leather,
                        rubber soles, cloth, and metal eyelets)?<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Was it difficult to separate the
                        materials? Why?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tell the students that our refuse (or waste) all
                flows into one &quot;mixed&quot; stream like the
                one they generated. We throw everything (paper,
                glass, plastic, etc.) into one container; the
                mixed waste is hauled away and disposed of. Why
                isn't it separated after it is collected? Could
                separation be done by a machine? Which would be
                easier to separate the materials before they are
                put into the container, or after?</li>
            <li>Today there are recycling successes that have
                taken many years to build across the country. One
                that is very familiar is the collection of
                aluminum cans. Sixty-two percent of all aluminum
                cans are recycled. Manufacturers buy cans and
                recycle them because it requires 95% less energy
                to produce new aluminum from old aluminum rather
                than processing new material. 
                <p>Glass and steel have been recycled for many
                years, too. Using recycled glass containers
                allows manufacturers to reduce the temperatures
                of their furnaces, saving energy, and prolonging
                the life of glass manufacturing equipment. </p>
                <p>Thousands of businesses nationwide collect and
                sell valuable metals to the steel industry, and
                today millions of tons of metal are being
                recycled. </p>
                <p>Paper recycling helps conserve resources, too.
                Today, approximately 30% of new paper is made
                from recycled or recovered paper, conserving
                resources and reducing air pollution. </p>
                <p>While recycling can save energy and resources
                in the manufacturing process, getting recyclables
                to market and then processing them into new
                products also uses energy and generates waste
                which must be managed. The use of fuels and the
                environmental impact of preparing, collecting,
                sorting, and transporting recyclables should be
                considered when developing a program,
                particularly if markets are not close to home.
                For example, making new newsprint from old
                newspaper saves energy in the manufacturing
                process, but often the collected paper must be
                shipped to other cities for processing, using
                fuel and resources. Over 20% of newsprint
                collected in the U.S. for recycling is currently
                sold in the Far East. Glass, plastics, paper, and
                steel must be collected, processed, and
                transported to a market, and that takes energy. </p>
                <p>Together with the students, explore some
                implications of increased recycling and list them
                on the board. Some possible effects of recycling
                include reduced environmental problems and new
                business opportunities. </p>
            </li>

        <p><img src="garbsal.gif"
        alt="Sample PAPER graphic presentation" align="right"
        hspace="0" width="343" height="357"> </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Each group is to develop a graphic</strong> and
        oral presentation to describe its material in the waste
        stream. Students might use photographs (taken locally or
        cut from magazines), line drawings, and labels. (See
        illustration &quot;PAPER&quot; for an example of a
        finished graphic presentation.) 
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Each group is to trace the waste stream for its
                material. (For example, paper starts as trees
                which are cut, processed, and manufactured into
                various paper products for use; glass starts as
                sand; and plastic starts as petroleum). Some
                waste streams have no recycling possibilities;
                some have significant recycling possibilities.</li>
            <li>Have each group use the student sheet &quot;RANGE
                OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS,&quot;
                included, to show which waste management
                option(s) could be used for its refuse material.</li>
            <li>Have the groups post their newsprint charts.
                Allow each group to explain its chart and present
                any particularly interesting information about
                its material. (Focus on recycling opportunities
                in your own community.)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Extension</h3>
<ol type="I">
    <li><strong>Assign each of the ten groups a different refuse
        material</strong> than it had in the first investigation.
        Each group will have expertise about several different
        portions of the waste stream (from the student sheet
        &quot;GENERATED REFUSE COMPOSITION.&quot; 
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Tell the students to assume that $2 billion to $4
                billion will be provided each year to promote
                recycling.</li>
            <li>Each group is to examine its waste stream and
                develop the best way to recycle the waste
                material. The recycling method is to be logical,
                effective, and cost-effective. The group is to be
                prepared to give the reasons for their
                recommendations. In preparation for its class
                presentation, each group will do the following: 
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Examine and discuss in detail the waste
                        stream chart (developed in the previous
                        activity) and make any necessary
                        modifications.</li>
                    <li>Brainstorm ideas and then discuss the
                        recycling procedure:

<h3>Taking care of our environment is a big job.</h3>
<p><br>
It's so big, there's something for everyone to do&#151;including
you! No matter where you live, there are many things you can do
around your neighborhood or at school, such as setting an example
by not littering, helping clean up a spot, and learning about
safe ways to handle trash.</p>
<p>You can start by choosing one or more of these ideas. Some are
simple. Others will need the help of a parent, older family
member, or teacher. You can involve your friends and family in
all of them.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Always set an example</strong> by not littering,
    no matter where you are.</p>
    <p><strong>When you put out the trash</strong> at home, make
    sure that garbage can lids are on tight, and that all of the
    trash goes into the can.</p>
    <p><strong>If your parents own a car,</strong> make
    litterbags for them.</p>
    <p><strong>Keep your yard clean</strong> and free of things
    that can blow into the street and become litter.</p>
    <p><strong>If your school playground doesn't have a litter
    basket,</strong> have your teacher ask the school to put one
    out. Your class can make and put up posters reminding other
    students to put litter where it belongs.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask a parent or teacher</strong> to take you or
    your class to a recycling center or sanitary landfill. Many
    recycling centers or landfills will let you see how trash is
    managed. List the different kinds of items that the recycling
    center collects, and how each one is prepared for shipment.
    At the landfill, list the kinds of equipment you see, and
    what each does.</p>
    <p><strong>Make a bulletin board</strong> that has pictures
    of areas that are clean, and those that are spoiled by litter
    or trash. Write a story about the difference between the two,
    and what can be done.</p>
    <p><strong>Whenever you visit a park or beach,</strong> carry
    out what you bring in&#151;keep unwanted items in a bag or
    backpack until you can put them in a litter basket.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask an older family member or teacher</strong> to
    find out who keeps your city's parks and public areas clean.
    Have your class write letters inviting them to come to the
    school and speak about the importance of not littering. Learn
    more about how you can take care of your community's public
    lands by reading Keep America Beautiful's brochure <a
    href="tca.html">&quot;Take Care of America.&quot;</a></p>
    <p><strong>Have everyone in your class or youth group</strong>
    write a letter to a different business to ask that they help
    keep the city clean by keeping the lids on dumpsters closed.</p>
    <p><strong>If your family puts recyclables in a bin at
    curbside,</strong> tie up loose papers that could blow out.</p>
    <p><strong>Draw a map of your neighborhood or school</strong>
    and identify areas where there is litter. Are they near busy
    roads, businesses, or places where people gather?</p>
    <p><strong>Make a list of things that could be done to stop
    litter.</strong> Learn more about litter by reading <a
    href="tips.html">&quot;Tips for Preventing Litter in Your
    Community.&quot;</a></p>
    <p><strong>Contact a forest service or conservation district
    office</strong> and find out if they offer free tree
    seedlings to plant in parks or other public areas. Look in
    the telephone directory under &quot;Government
    Agencies.&quot; <img src="wdy-rake.gif" lowsrc="lwdyrake.gif"
    alt="Woody Woodpecker with rake." align="right" hspace="0"
    width="212" height="215"> </p>
    <p><strong>Learn how grass clippings, leaves, and some food
    scraps can be turned into a reusable material like soil</strong>
    by a natural process called composting. Read about it in <a
    href="compost.html">&quot;Backyard Composting&quot;</a> and
    make a chart that shows how composting works.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask your teacher if your school can make a small
    model of a sanitary landfill. </strong>Your class can fill it
    with items from home. Predict what will happen to each item
    before it is buried. Before the school year ends, dig up the
    site and see what actually happened. The model can be made
    with the help of someone from the city's public works
    department or a landfill.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Place your Award Information Sheet, Summary, and

        for correspondence. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Writing Your Summary</h4>

right-hand corner of the first page of your Summary. Add your
city and state and the corresponding number/letter of the
category you are entering.</p>
<p>Write your summary, answering the questions below. (HINT: This
is the most important part of your entry, and is read carefully
by the judges.) Summaries must be typed and answers must be
numbered to match the questions. Use no less than 3/4 inch top,
bottom and side margins on standard 8 &#189;&quot; x 11&quot;
paper, with a type size no smaller than an 11-point font. (This
text, for example, is an 11-point font.) (HINTS: Using paragraphs
makes your Summary easier to read. Judges also look for content,
as opposed to length.) </p>

        the motivation for your project/program? </li>

have demonstrated lifelong leadership in raising public awareness
about litter prevention, roadway and community beautification,
the solid waste issue, and the need for citizens to participate

public lands. The award, created in 1988, honors an American
Indian who between 1970 and 1980 became one of the most
widely-recognized figures in public service advertising history.
Iron Eyes Cody symbolized the need for a renewed environmental
ethic in America. Since 1988, 5 outstanding volunteer men have

acknowledge the former First Lady's many litter prevention and
beautification activities. Since then, 41 outstanding volunteer

<h3>1996 Deadline: October 15, 1996</h3>
<p><em>Following are the 1996 guidelines for KAB's Take Care of
America Awards Program (the deadline for these awards has already
passed). The 1997 Take Care of America Awards Application will be
available here in mid-1997.</em> </p>
<p>&#160; </p>
<h4>Public Lands Stewardship</h4>
<p>Under the leadership of Andrew H. Davison, KAB's public lands
stewardship program began to encourage and recognize public lands
stewardship activities in 1984. Mr. Davison, a dedicated servant
to the protection and preservation of public lands, had a
distinguished career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
beginning in 1970 at a water resource project in South Dakota. At
the time of his death in 1989, he was chief of the Recreation
Section, Natural Resource Management Branch at the Corps
headquarters in Washington, DC. As chairman of KAB's National
Advisory Council and Public Lands Stewardship Subcommittee, he
was instrumental in the development and implementation of KAB's
Public Lands Stewardship Program, which grew from 5 to 500 annual
projects. KAB dedicates this awards program to Mr. Davison's
memory. </p>
<h4>The Award</h4>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc.'s &quot;Take Care of
America&quot; Awards program recognizes communities and groups
for outstanding programs and/or projects that promote public
lands stewardship and develop a sense of citizen ownership of
local, state, and/or federal managed public lands and resources.</p>
<p>In 1984, Keep America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) established a
Public Lands Stewardship program following a recommendation by
its National Advisory Council to encourage volunteer, hands-on
activities in the cleanup and maintenance of local, state, and
federal public lands, and to build public awareness for personal
responsibility for proper waste handling. The program is directed
and the awards are judged by KAB's Public Lands Stewardship
Subcommittee. In 1994, KAB renamed the program &quot;Take Care of
America&quot; and has set goals to increase awareness about
public lands and increase the number of public lands activities
from 500 to 1500.</p>

alt="Keep America Beautiful - Use Less Stuff" align="bottom"
width="531" height="133"> </p>
<p>On November 21, 1996, Keep America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB),
along with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and 30 other
organizations, will participate in the 2nd Annual Use Less Stuff
Day (ULS Day), a national program that will highlight the
importance of reducing waste&#151;an especially significant
problem during the holiday season when it's estimated that
Americans throw away an extra million pounds of trash per week!
The program is administered by the <em>Use Less Stuff Report</em>
located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
<p>The idea behind ULS Day is to bring waste prevention, or
source reduction as it is formally known, to the attention of the
public. Waste prevention can be practiced effectively on a
corporate, community, or personal level. </p>
<p>On a local level, communities and organizations around the
country such as KAB and its affiliates will support ULS campaign
efforts by mounting their own public awareness campaigns designed
to increase public awareness of waste prevention. Businesses have
the opportunity to demonstrate significant waste reduction
success in the areas of products, processes, and packages. And,
consumers can use less stuff during the holidays through a
variety of actions, such as buying products that come with less
packaging; send guests home with leftovers stored in reusable
containers and bags; and wrapping gifts in Sunday comics or
colorful magazine pages. </p>
<p>Follow these holiday tips and you'll not only conserve
resources&#151;you'll save some money, too. Now <em>that's</em> a
great gift!</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Gwinnett/Shreveport">Keep America
Beautiful Affiliate Reduces County&#146;s Waste Stream by 10%</a></h2>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. affiliates aren&#146;t thought of
as authors. But two, Georgia&#146;s Gwinnett Clean &amp;
Beautiful, Inc. and Louisiana&#146;s Shreveport Green, are just
that.</p>
<p>Gwinnett Clean &amp; Beautiful, whose ambitious recycling
program has reduced Gwinnett County&#146;s waste by 10% despite a
25% increase in population since 1992, wrote the book on
recycling.</p>
<p>Shreveport Green, an accomplished educator, wrote the book on
how to teach young people about the environment.</p>
<p>Over 2.5 million pounds of recyclables pass through Gwinnett
Clean &amp; Beautiful&#146;s collection and processing center
every month.</p>
<p>The affiliate, in partnership with end-user recycling
industries, has 210 drop-off locations in the county. It also
processes and markets recyclables from the county&#146;s curbside
program. A perennial winner of state and national awards, the
center is self-sustaining and operates with no government
funding.</p>
<p><em><strong>&#147;I don&#146;t think the average citizen in
the county has a clue as to what Gwinnett Clean &amp; Beautiful
is doing for them,&#148;</strong></em> said Wayne Hill, Chairman
of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners. <em><strong>&#147;They&#146;re
recognized as a national leader and they do a tremendous job for
us.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p>Hill said the commissioners also recognize the significance of
the affiliate&#146;s ability to return $32 in benefits and
cost-avoidance for every $1 the county provides. <em><strong>&#147;They
are one of the best bargains that&#146;s happening in this county
today . . . I&#146;ve never been disappointed in them and I
don&#146;t expect we ever will be.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p>Over 8,000 students in Shreveport schools were reached by
Shreveport Green trainers in 1996, who used activities from Keep
America Beautiful&#146;s <a href="teachers.html"><em>Waste in
Place</em> and <em>Waste: A Hidden Resource</em> curricula</a>.
The lessons helped the city&#146;s future leaders understand that
litter is preventable and solid waste can be managed safely.</p>
<p>Shreveport Green also trained 30 teachers to use the
curricula.</p>
<p>All 72 schools joined in a Clean Campus program sponsored by
the affiliate and McDonald&#146;s; over a dozen local restaurants
have worked with the affiliate to educate 50,000 students
annually for the past five years.</p>
<p align="left">And, The Home Depot, General Motors, and State
Farm Insurance co-sponsored its school Earth Day and Make A
Difference Day projects.</p>

Volunteerism</a></h2>
<p align="left">Bridge clubs have disbanded. Movie theaters are
empty. And dogs walk themselves.</p>
<p align="left">None of the above has actually happened yet in
Columbus, Ohio. If it does, the city&#146;s Keep America
Beautiful, Inc. affiliate will most likely be responsible.</p>
<p align="left">That&#146;s because Keep Columbus Beautiful can
document the involvement of a full 5% of the city&#146;s
residents in the past year&#146;s programs. If you live in the
city, chances are good that someone you know was among the 34,692
volunteers who donated over 134,000 hours to a Keep Columbus
Beautiful program.</p>
<p align="left">There were 64 separate cleanups held by the
affiliate, ranging from the city-wide <a href="glad.html">GLAD
Bag-A-Thon&#174;</a> drawing thousands to public access areas, to
local neighborhood cleanups where community pride runs the
deepest. School presentations, community education forums, and
the start of a mobile household hazardous waste collection
program also topped the affiliate&#146;s list of actions.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;I&#146;m very excited about
Keep Columbus Beautiful and all that it has to offer to our
residents and local businesses,&#148;</strong></em> said Peggy
Fisher, a member of the Columbus City Council and chairman of its
Solid Waste Committee.</p>
<p align="left">Fisher said that the affiliate is poised to
provide an even greater return next year.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;We&#146;re all expecting great
things out of Keep Columbus Beautiful in 1997 to better educate
the people about recycling, litter prevention, and beautification
awareness in Columbus. This award is a catalyst to reach those
goals.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Keep Columbus Beautiful&#146;s year-round
litter-prevention campaign revolves around a 30-day GLAD
Bag-A-Thon&#174; and &#147;Litter Round-Up.&#148; The end of the
Bag-A-Thon&#174; signals the start of other efforts cleaning up
community areas and energizing citizens to take greater
responsibility for their own waste handling.</p>
<p align="left">In April 1996, 2,400 Ohio State University
students took part in the affiliate&#146;s cleanup day in an area
near the campus. Thirty tons of bulk waste and 26 tons of litter
were collected.</p>

Recycled&#148;</a></h2>
<p align="left">Everyone loves to show off a new car. But
here&#146;s a way to really impress your family and friends if
you drive a late-model Ford car, truck, or minivan.</p>
<p align="left">Pop open the hood and tell them about the
post-consumer plastic soda bottles that were used to make the
brackets for the grille. Open the door and have them step on the
brake pedal made from crumb rubber. And instead of kicking the
tires, have them look under the fender at the splash shield
containing polypropylene from used battery casings.</p>
<p align="left">And that&#146;s just for starters. Ford Motor
Company and its Recycling Action Team continue to identify new
uses for recycled products in its vehicles.</p>
<p align="left">Since 1991, the team&#146;s charge has been to
develop ways to incorporate recycled materials in manufacturing
while ensuring that the product is comparable in quality and cost
to one made of raw material. And, by doing so, increase the
company&#146;s role in creating market demand for recyclables.</p>
<p align="left">Over a million Fords a year now roll off assembly
lines with parts containing recycled materials. Making those
parts requires no fewer than 50 million 2-liter pop bottles, 27
million pounds of other post-consumer plastics from bottle caps
to computer housings, and 5 million pounds of old battery
casings.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;It doesn&#146;t do a whole lot
of good if you collect recyclables and don&#146;t use them. As a
major corporation, we think we have an obligation to help
increase the demand for them,&#148;</strong></em> says Andy Acho,
Ford&#146;s Director of Environmental Outreach and Strategy.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;We&#146;ve made environmental
stewardship part of the everyday fabric at Ford&#151;there&#146;s
no reason why you can&#146;t be a good environmental citizen at
the same time you&#146;re a good corporate citizen.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Ford recently announced another recycling
breakthrough&#151;fan parts for Windstar minivans will be made
from post-consumer nylon carpeting, a move that will recycle the
equivalent of 1,400 homes&#146; worth of carpet annually.</p>
<p align="left">Recycling isn&#146;t limited to the cars and
trucks Ford produces. Its North America plants are saving the
company over $8 million annually through recycling and waste
reduction. At two casting plants, 115,000 tons of sand is being
re-used in paving and building materials&#151;enough to fill 60
hockey rinks waist deep.</p>

<p align="left">If there&#146;s a business in Dougherty County,
Georgia, that has yet to hear about, or be influenced by, the
Albany-Dougherty Clean Community Commission, we&#146;d like to
meet it.</p>
<p align="left">This Keep America Beautiful, Inc. affiliate
reaches businesses like nobody&#146;s business. And not only
reaches them, but shows them how to prevent litter and teaches
them about waste minimization.</p>
<p align="left">The payoff is a cleaner county that has less
waste to manage. Businesses have reduced litter around loading
docks by 96%; around dumpsters by 82%; and are largely
responsible for parking lots being 97% cleaner.</p>
<p align="left">One of the affiliate&#146;s major successes was
the commitment to recycling and composting made by the
county&#146;s largest private employer, Phoebe Putney Memorial
Regional Medical Center.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;Our president is very committed
to us being a leader, and we have looked to Julia (Affiliate
Executive Director Julia Bowles) to help us in terms of recycling
and reducing waste,&#148;</strong></em> said Gary Stradowski, the
hospital&#146;s Director of Project Management.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;By attending the Clean
Community Commission&#146;s meetings, we realized that it was
something we should be doing,&#148;</strong></em> Stradowski
said. </p>
<p align="left">The commission&#146;s aggressive outreach to
businesses in 1996 included two 1,000-piece mailings and
distributing 47,000 &#147;Clean Business&#148; tabloids.</p>
<p align="left">One hundred sixty-nine new businesses became
members of an office recycling project. Twenty-eight received
on-site training from the commission.</p>
<p align="left">Midland, Texas, also received a unique benefit
from its Keep America Beautiful affiliate in 1996. Keep Midland
Beautiful won a grant from the Texas Forest Service to recruit
and train 25 volunteer arborists, who will assist the Midland
Parks Department in protecting and maintaining the city&#146;s
trees.</p>
<p align="left">In connection with the training, the affiliate
planted 1,000 trees in public areas and developed a native garden
program for schools.</p>

<p align="left">Don&#146;t tell the students, teachers, and

don&#146;t come true. They know otherwise.</p>
<p align="left">They were the first to be chosen for a new
program developed by Keep America Beautiful, Inc.&#146;s
Indianapolis Clean City Committee to revitalize urban schools and
introduce children to environmental learning.</p>
<p align="left">The project, based on the affiliate&#146;s
successful neighborhood revitalization program, has restored
neighborhood pride in the schools and encouraged neighboring
residents and businesses to be more responsible for their own
corner of the city.</p>
<p align="left">Most remarkable of all, &#147;Project 180 - A
Piece of the PIE&#148; began with virtually no funding and has to
date garnered $58,400 in in-kind services and 8,000 volunteer
hours.</p>
<p align="left">At each school, &#147;wish lists&#148; were
created. The affiliate and its partners&#151;city, county and
state agencies, community groups, businesses, and
corporations&#151;set about to fulfill as many of the needs as
possible.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers at the schools also attended workshops
on the environment and incorporated the topics into their lesson
plans.</p>
<p align="left">During one-day workdays at each school,
volunteers turned out to landscape, refurbish playgrounds and
install new equipment, build benches and birdhouses, and plant
gardens and trees.</p>
<p align="left">The most recent workday was held at Saint
Gabriel&#146;s Elementary School. Michael Schill, a science
teacher, was the school&#146;s liaison with the Clean City
Committee. <em><strong>&#147;The project went beyond
everybody&#146;s expectations. The feedback that I&#146;ve gotten
so far is that what happened is pretty incredible.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left">You&#146;re a small Keep America Beautiful, Inc.
affiliate. Funding&#146;s limited. Does that stop you from
improving the local quality of life?</p>
<p align="left">It hasn&#146;t stopped the Roberta/Crawford Clean
&amp; Beautiful Commission of Georgia and Keep Port Aransas
Beautiful, Inc. of Texas, which conducted much-needed programs
for their communities in 1996 with a combined budget of just
$14,500.</p>
<p align="left">The Roberta-Crawford Clean &amp; Beautiful
Commission returned $16.97 in cost-avoidance and other benefits
for every $1 in municipal money received. The 9,000 citizens it
influences provided 15,861 hours of volunteer time.</p>
<p align="left">The commission has played a key role in managing
solid waste effectively by helping the county inform residents of
new waste disposal regulations and organizing white goods
recycling. It also operates the county&#146;s recycling program.</p>
<p align="left">Perched on a barrier island dependent on tourism,
Keep Port Aransas Beautiful keeps the community clean for the
tens of thousands of beachgoers and birdwatchers that visit.</p>
<p align="left">It encourages permanent residents to handle waste
responsibly; they&#146;ve responded by reducing litter along
streets by 76% and near dumpsters by 57%. </p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;I&#146;ve heard a lot of talk

for $1 Million in Waste Savings</a></h2>
<p align="left">Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc.&#146;s employees
are preserving and protecting America&#146;s environment.</p>
<p align="left">Throughout its facilities and those of its
subsidiaries, over 40 Environmental Quality Teams assess
Anheuser-Busch&#146;s operations and propose steps to reduce
waste, minimize other environmental impacts, and encourage the
company to purchase more recycled products.</p>
<p align="left">They&#146;ve done their work well. At its 12
breweries alone, the company estimates that recently-adopted
waste minimization efforts returned over $1 million in avoided
landfill costs and revenues from the sale of recyclable materials
in the past year.</p>
<p align="left">Company-wide, the amount of waste landfilled in
1995 was reduced 26%, or 45 million pounds.</p>
<p align="left">Notable among the new programs were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="left">A switch from wooden to plastic pallets
        at the company&#146;s can subsidiary, which ships new
        cans to breweries. Over 1 million pounds of wood waste
        was avoided. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Processes to reduce sludge and recover
        methane from brewery wastewater were launched at three
        more breweries. At the six breweries with the process,
        61,500 fewer tons of sludge was generated. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Expanded markets for the beechwood chips
        and filtering material used to make beer. Over 19 million
        pounds of chips were composted or used as mulch. The
        filtering material is being used as a cement additive. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reducing waste isn&#146;t only for the
company&#146;s breweries and manufacturing operations. Busch
Gardens Tampa Bay turned 2,300 tons of yard and animal stable
waste into compost for landscaping. At all Busch Entertainment
Theme Parks, recycling increased by 55%.</p>
<p align="left">The company also continues to make its bottles
and cans lighter and with less material. An estimated 21.5
million pounds of aluminum and 63.5 million pounds of glass have
been saved annually since 1994 through lightweighting.</p>

<p align="left">Workers are also on the lookout for litter at the
plant itself. Monthly inspections are made and the cleanest areas
recognized at meetings.</p>
<p align="left">Involvement in community education is also a
priority. BASF Freeport has participated in local teacher
training institutes and sponsors a week-long environmental camp
for students. In April 1996 during &#147;Responsible Care&#148;
week, over 800 students and teachers toured the plant, learning
about BASF&#146;s environmental initiatives.</p>
<p align="left">BASF Freeport&#146;s own recycling and
waste-minimization effort is a model Williams says has been
studied by other BASF plants and other chemical companies in
Brazoria County. Recently, BASF also announced a new goal of
reducing by half the amount of non-hazardous waste at the plant
within five years. </p>
<p align="left">Uses have even been found for old railroad ties
from the plant&#146;s rail line. Over 500 have been taken home by
employees for landscaping and other projects.</p>

Makes Dramatic Cuts in Waste</a></h2>
<p align="left">Being known as one of the 10 largest contributors
of waste at the regional landfill is enough to make any company
want to know where its trash comes from. </p>
<p align="left">No company has scrutinized its operations with an
eye to reducing waste more closely than J&amp;J Industries, Inc.,
a commercial carpet maker in Dalton, Georgia, which found itself
on such a list four years ago.</p>
<p align="left">Manufacturing waste has been reduced from 248
pounds for every 1,000 square yards of carpet to just 47 pounds.
Overall waste generated by the plant has been reduced by 81%.
And, in true entrepreneurial spirit, the company has found a
buyer for the lint it once paid $800 a month to dispose of at the
landfill.</p>
<p align="left">What&#146;s behind these dramatic reductions? The
company&#146;s commitment to waste reduction&#151;which included
allowing workers to tour the landfill on company time to learn
more about solid waste&#151;and the involvement of both hourly
and management employees in identifying waste-saving steps. </p>
<p align="left">Textile scraps, yarns, cardboard yarn tubes and
boxes, and wrapping material are baled and recycled. Office paper
is collected, and reusable containers are sent back to vendors.</p>
<p align="left">In conjunction with its recycling and waste
reduction program, J&amp;J Industries also committed to closing
the recycling loop by purchasing products made from recyclables.</p>
<p align="left">The company is also sharing its experiences
within the industry. A founding member of the Carpet and Rug
Institute&#146;s Carpet Recycling Team, J&amp;J Industries is
helping organize a national post-consumer carpet recycling
project.</p>

America Beautiful Reaching 8.9 Million Floridians</a></h2>
<p align="left">What do 8.9 of Florida&#146;s 13 million
residents have in common? They live in a community or county
that&#146;s either a certified or pre-certified Keep America
Beautiful, Inc. affiliate.</p>
<p align="left">Ensuring that these affiliates have the resources
and training to influence positive actions in Floridians from
Walnut Hill to Key West is the job of Keep Florida Beautiful,
Inc., one of 21 statewide KAB programs.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Florida Beautiful has doubled the number of
affiliates in the state since its founding in 1991, from 15 to
31. Another 11 affiliates are in the process of becoming
certified.</p>
<p align="left">Once certified, affiliates receive ongoing
training from Keep Florida Beautiful and opportunities to
participate in statewide cleanup and stewardship programs.</p>
<p align="left">Such programs have won praise from officials at
both the local and state level.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;As Chairman of the Florida
House of Representatives&#146; Natural Resources Committee,
I&#146;ve seen firsthand how Keep Florida Beautiful and the local
Keep America Beautiful affiliates work through public/private
partnerships to protect our environment,&#148;</strong></em> said
State Representative Everett Kelly.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;By reaching out to involve
diverse groups, including businesses, governments, civic and
environmental organizations, Keep Florida Beautiful and the many
volunteers involved in the program are making our communities
better places to live and work.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Keep Florida Beautiful and Florida State
University also operate a waste exchange clearinghouse, which
receives hundreds of calls monthly from businesses across the
southeast.</p>
<p align="left">A statewide waste exchange has also been created
by Keep Nebraska Beautiful to help businesses reuse materials
other companies discard. Over 1,500 businesses subscribe.</p>
<p align="left">The exchange was one of several
&#147;firsts&#148; for Keep Nebraska Beautiful. It helped
organize the first Build America Beautiful program in the state;
initiated the &#147;Grow Big Red&#148; campaign to beautify
communities; and was the only Nebraska recipient of an annual
Pollution Prevention Award from the Environmental Protection
Agency.</p>
<p align="left">Georgia Clean and Beautiful supports the largest
number of local Keep America Beautiful affiliates, 58, of any
state. It maintains their high level of community
benefits&#151;an average 55% litter reduction and a return of
$7.93 for every $1 of municipal money invested&#151;by offering
comprehensive training programs for executive directors and board
chairman.</p>
<p align="left">It also partners with Georgia-Pacific
Corporation, Georgia Power, The Home Depot, and WXIA-TV to hold a
statewide Christmas tree chipping project. The project, which
recovered 278,275 trees in 1996, also educated residents about a
new ban on yard waste from landfills.</p>

Spirit Thrives in Big Cities</a></h2>
<p align="left">Building a sense of community and a spirit of
cooperation among citizens, however large the city, is what
separates a Keep America Beautiful, Inc. affiliate from the rest.</p>
<p align="left">Nowhere is this more evident than in San Antonio
and Chicago. Neighbors are working together. Street by street,
block by block, each city is becoming cleaner and residents are
handling waste responsibly.</p>
<p align="left">In San Antonio, Keep San Antonio Beautiful,
Inc.&#146;s Neighborhoods Committee is the busiest of any
committee. In the past year, it developed quality of life
programs with 125 neighborhood associations&#151;citizens removed
graffiti, cleaned up illegal dumps, and beautified parks.</p>
<p align="left">The affiliate&#146;s ability to educate citizens
about litter and its prevention is applauded by David Carpenter,
a city zoning commissioner and president of one of the largest
neighborhood associations.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;We can clean up until the cows
come home, but unless we educate people, especially our children,
we haven&#146;t done our job. Keep San Antonio Beautiful is doing
that for us.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">Carpenter said the affiliate&#146;s programs are
especially welcome in some urban neighborhoods where streets were
impassable because of dumping and debris. <em><strong>&#147;They
are filling a need that has long been unmet.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">One of five affiliates serving as a pilot for
Keep America Beautiful&#146;s new graffiti-education program,
Keep San Antonio Beautiful also coordinated a citywide
graffiti-awareness campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;I know that the 128,000 people
in my district don&#146;t tolerate graffiti at all, and across
the city the level of graffiti tolerance has been reduced
substantially. I know it&#146;s because of what Keep San Antonio
Beautiful has done,&#148; </strong></em>said City Councilman Jeff
Webster.</p>
<p align="left">Webster sits on the city&#146;s graffiti
abatement task force. <em><strong>&#147;Keep San Antonio
Beautiful has made sure we don&#146;t reinvent the wheel because
they&#146;ve given us access to information about programs that
other cities have tried.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">For Keep Chicago Beautiful, a name and logo
change were in order to highlight its ongoing commitment to serve
Chicago&#146;s neighborhoods first.</p>
<p align="left">Through meetings with city officials and
citizens, it learned that a &#147;how-to&#148; handbook for local
neighborhood groups was needed to stimulate partnerships among
residents and businesses. By creating and distributing such a
guide, Keep Chicago Beautiful is stimulating scores of new
partnerships addressing neighborhood concerns.</p>
<p align="left">During the year, 80 neighborhood cleanups were
held, and the city&#146;s first <a href="glad.html">GLAD
Bag-A-Thon&#174;</a> cleanup and recycling event was staged.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Chicago Beautiful&#146;s emphasis on
neighborhoods was reflected in its educational programming. At 28
community centers with after-school programs, the affiliate and
the Museum of Science and Industry introduced hands-on
environmental education activities.</p>

<p align="left">To Wake County Keep America Beautiful of North
Carolina and Middletown Clean Community of Ohio, beautification
means trees&#151;and plenty of them.</p>
<p align="left">The KAB affiliates are educating their
communities about trees, distributing seedlings, and ensuring
that future generations will play and study in schoolyards shaded
by canopies of green.</p>
<p align="left">In Wake County, where the largest city recently
eliminated the care and replacement of street trees from its
budget, Wake County Keep America Beautiful has stepped forward
with its &#147;Capitol Trees&#148; program to fill a vital role
in educating students about trees and their benefits.</p>
<p align="left">The volunteer-led project has a goal of reaching
all 100 county public schools; it has already reached 28,000
students and teachers at 38 schools. In less than two years, it
has also attracted over $19,000 in benefits to the county. </p>
<p align="left">One volunteer has also created a computer model
that calculates the economic value of trees based on their
capacity to clean and cool the air, control erosion, and increase
property values. Other benefits being returned to the county
through the project include a speaker&#146;s bureau and a planned
tree seminar for local urban forestry advocates in a six-county
area.</p>
<p align="left">A &#147;Re-Leaf Middletown&#148; project is one
of six being used by Middletown Clean Community to enhance the
city. Dozens of trees have been planted along major roads and at
schools. A tree farm was established, and a permanent sculpture
with the names of all donors to the project was unveiled in the
municipal building.</p>

<p align="left">When the city administration in Gastonia, North
Carolina wants to reduce solid waste management costs, stimulate
more curbside recycling, or set a new committee off on the right
track, it turns to Gastonia Clean City, Inc.</p>
<p align="left">In the past year, this Keep America Beautiful,
Inc. affiliate has helped the city avoid over $49,000 in landfill
fees through a leaf composting program. Its public education
efforts increased by 28% the number of residents in a curbside
recycling collection.</p>
<p align="left">And it has held strategic planning sessions and
training in Keep America Beautiful&#146;s systematic,
results-oriented approach for the city&#146;s Uptown
Revitalization Committee.</p>
<p align="left">Invitations from Gastonia&#146;s government to
help address a local environmental or social issue come
frequently to Gastonia Clean City.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;They&#146;ve served us well in
training leaders for future service to the city,&#148;</strong></em>
said Gastonia Mayor Jick Garland, adding that chairmen of the
city&#146;s crime and civic center task forces also came from the
affiliate&#146;s ranks.</p>
<p align="left">He also noted that Clean City also provides
&#147;morale leadership.&#148; <em><strong>&#147;I&#146;ve always
felt that they were a watchdog for the community to see that we
were on the right track. They&#146;ve helped us to achieve beyond
our expectations.&#148;</strong></em></p>
<p align="left">In 1996, Clean City attracted 40,000 volunteers
and generated $1.1 million in donated goods and services.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Denton Beautiful solidified its role as the
provider of environmental programs and education to this Texas
city in 1996 by expanding its board to add a dozen new members
from community organizations.</p>
<p align="left">Already one of Denton&#146;s most visible
programs, the affiliate&#146;s expansion and increased planning
paid immediate dividends. The number of groups and businesses
adopting spots and maintaining them increased by 20%;
participation in its <a href="glad.html">GLAD Bag-A-Thon&#174;</a>
cleanup rose by 9%; and overall program participation was up by
10%.</p>
<p align="left">In partnership with Safety Kleen, it also
introduced a household hazardous waste collection event. It also
had an educational message printed on 2.6 million garbage bags
given to residents with city trash collection.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Denton Beautiful also increased its
effectiveness in improving neighborhoods through a partnership
with the city that educates residents about waste handling. It
has held over 50 meetings with neighborhood groups to help
coordinate cleanup events.</p>

Best Tool Prevents Litter, Reduces Waste </a></h2>
<p align="left"><a href="bab.html">Build America Beautiful</a>,
the voluntary waste reduction and litter prevention program from
Keep America Beautiful, Inc. and the National Association of Home
Builders, helps builders across America address these concerns.</p>
<p align="left">No builders know this better than those in Summit
County, Ohio, thanks to the Home Builders Association of Greater
Akron. For the third consecutive year, the association received a
Build America Beautiful award for involving builders in the
14-point program.</p>
<p align="left">Contractors who build homes for the
association&#146;s annual Parade of Homes show are required to
follow Build America Beautiful guidelines. During the 1996
Parade, nine builders diverted four tons of cardboard and a ton
of metal from the waste stream. Another 26 tons of mulch was
created from scrap lumber.</p>
<p align="left">The association helped educate subcontractors
about the importance of recovering recyclables and preventing
litter; coordinated publicity efforts; created an environmental
subcommittee; and found end-users for the mulch.</p>
<p align="left">To date, 30 builders have participated in the
Build America Beautiful Parade events. Many are now using the
program for all sites. </p>
<p align="left">One, Troike/Moore Building Corp., also received a
1996 Build America Beautiful award. In addition to recycling,
Troike/Moore designated one area for lunches and breaks and
equipped it with trash receptacles. Its subcontractors were
continually reminded of the program and how to handle waste.</p>
<p align="left">Troike/Moore also used building materials with
recycled content and added numerous energy-saving features to its
house.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;We started out with the program
and I&#146;ve come to see it&#146;s something good to do,&#148;</strong></em>
said John Troike. The company follows the guidelines at each new
home site.</p>
<p align="left">The association&#146;s success was a model for
the third Build America Beautiful award winner, Atlantic Homes
Development Corporation of Hampton, Virginia.</p>
<p align="left">Atlantic Homes, in partnership with
Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., introduced the program to 11
builders in a new development. Over 38 tons of scrap wood was
ground into mulch, and metal and corrugated were recycled.</p>
<p align="left">Each builder was also given separate containers
for non-recyclable scraps. A lunch area, complete with picnic
tables and litter boxes, was set aside.</p>
<p align="left">During an open house, 34,000 residents and
prospective home buyers toured the development and learned about
Build America Beautiful.</p>
<p align="left">Florida&#146;s Homestead Habitat for Humanity, a
subsidiary of Habitat for Humanity International, was also
recognized for its environmentally-responsible practices.</p>
<p align="left">The group is overseeing construction of a
187-home community in an area devastated by Hurricane Andrew. The
project is recovering materials for reuse or recycling, and
numerous local and national agencies have formed a partnership to
make the community as energy-efficient as possible.</p>

<p align="left">The words &#147;public lands&#148; may evoke
images of majestic mountains above evergreen forests. They also
describe areas in our own communities, whose protection also
depends on wise use by involved citizens.</p>
<p align="left">Outstanding projects that stimulate awareness of
public land stewardship are recognized by Keep America Beautiful,
Inc.&#146;s Take Care of America Award.</p>
<p align="left">In 1996, a neglected railroad depot, a
20,000-acre reservoir, and a river were the focus of
award-winning projects.</p>
<p align="left">The railroad depot was donated to the city of
Roberta, Georgia by the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which also
provided three acres of land. Under the direction of the
city&#146;s Keep America Beautiful affiliate, the
Roberta-Crawford Clean &amp; Beautiful Commission, the depot has
been converted to the county&#146;s only recycling center.</p>
<p align="left">The affiliate also oversaw the creation of a park
on the land. Scores of trees were planted, landscaping was
performed, and a walking trail built by volunteers using donated
materials. Today, the park and recycling center are used daily by
appreciative residents who know that their involvement made each
possible.</p>
<p align="left">The Barren River Lake Trashmaster&#146;s Classic
is an annual event in which hundreds of volunteers remove litter
from the shores of this public recreation area in Kentucky.
Thousands more residents in the four-county region around the
lake receive educational messages about the need for wise waste
handling.</p>
<p align="left">The event is organized by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Barren River Lake State Park, the Barren River Lake
Regional Water Authority, businesses, and citizen groups. Local
communities provide support through equipment and free use of
landfills.</p>
<p align="left">The Licking River Roundup in Newark, Ohio is held
annually by the River Advisory Committee of Keep America
Beautiful&#146;s affiliate, the Newark Litter Prevention and

federal agencies. When a KAB affiliate partners with an NAC
member's local chapter or agency, the whole community benefits.</p>
<p align="left">Residents of Hardin County, Ohio, were among
those benefitting from such a partnership in 1996. Their Keep
America Beautiful affiliate, Keep Hardin County Beautiful,
developed a number of projects with Ohio State University's
Extension program, a local agency of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.</p>
<p align="left">Topping the list was a household hazardous waste
collection that recovered 22,120 pounds of waste and 475 gallons
of oil. Four hundred vehicles passed through the collection
point&#151;nearly double the number in 1995.</p>
<p align="left">The affiliate and the extension program also held
a pesticide container recycling project for farmers. Farmers were
asked to save plastic containers, which were collected and
chipped for use in plastic lumber.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Hardin County Beautiful also partnered with
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to collect black walnut
seeds from residents with walnut trees on their property. The
seeds were sown in a state greenhouse to help meet a demand for
the seedlings.</p>
<p align="left">A Louisiana KAB affiliate, CenLa Pride, continued
a long-standing partnership with the Department of Agriculture's
Forest Service in 1996 by creating the city's first environmental
museum.</p>
<p align="left">Located in the Alexandria Mall, the free museum
features displays on forests, water quality, solid waste
management, and related topics. Over 2,000 residents visited the
museum in its first month. It has also been used for workshops
and teacher training forums.</p>
<p align="left">CenLa Pride also teamed with city Boy Scout
troops to conduct wildlife habitat programs, help educate city
residents about recycling, and make the Alexandria's annual Mardi
Gras parade a &quot;litter-free&quot; event.</p>
<p align="left">In Albuquerque, Keep Albuquerque Beautiful has
found that one of the best ways to deter graffiti is through
mural art. Together with local neighborhood associations which
belong to the National Association of Neighborhoods, the
affiliate has coordinated murals throughout the city.</p>
<p align="left">In the summer of 1996, four mural projects in
neighborhoods attracted over $40,000 in donated goods and
services from local businesses and provided work for scores of
city teens.</p>

Keep Austin Beautiful know that the secret to success is finding
the right people, giving them a task, and holding them
accountable.</p>
<p align="left">Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful has become the
region&#146;s foremost source of environmental information and
programming by tapping the energy of over 275 volunteers who
serve on its board and committees.</p>
<p align="left">With citizens, businesses, educators, and
government represented, the affiliate&#146;s board and committees
have their finger on the pulse of the region&#146;s environment
and create innovative programs.</p>
<p align="left">In 1996, Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful took
advantage of its new location at Milwaukee&#146;s multi-material
recovery facility by focusing on education. The affiliate
facilitates the center&#146;s educational programs, and its tours
are so popular that a waiting list has over 50 schools on it.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>&#147;The field trip was a great fit

<p align="left">Keep Austin Beautiful&#146;s 40-member board of
directors and 10 advisors donated over 7,000 hours of service in
1996, an investment that provided exponential returns to the
city.</p>
<p align="left">Over 400 cleanup events involved 30,740
volunteers and saved Austin $880,000 in cost-avoidance for litter
removal.</p>
<p align="left">At teacher-training forums, 300 educators were
trained in a variety of environmental curricula, in turn
influencing positive actions in over 8,000 students. To hold the
forums, Keep Austin Beautiful leveraged $40,000 in corporate

<p align="left">There&#146;s good news in Newport News, Virginia.
The amount of waste being landfilled has dropped by one-third and
litter has been reduced by half in parking lots and public
rights-of-way. </p>
<p align="left">Behind these accomplishments is the city&#146;s
Keep America Beautiful, Inc. affiliate, the Newport News
Recycling and Clean Community Commission.</p>
<p align="left">Through the commission&#146;s lead in educating
citizens about waste reduction and participation in recycling,
each household has reduced its waste by 1.7 pounds per day.</p>
<p align="left">And through an innovative business-to-business
waste reduction program, companies with successful waste
reduction and recycling programs are being matched with those
looking to began or expand their own programs.</p>
<p align="left">The 160 community groups and businesses in its
Adopt-a-Spot program are at the heart of the commission&#146;s
success in preventing litter. Each keeps a specific area clean,
and during a recent two-month period logged over 3,000 total
hours of volunteer time. Over 120 miles of local road have been
adopted.</p>
<p align="left">The commission also holds a spring <a
href="glad.html">GLAD Bag-A-Thon&#174;</a> cleanup and a fall
citywide cleanup.</p>
<p align="left">A new venue for educating residents about litter
prevention, the &#147;litter-free&#148; event, has also been
introduced. Twelve such events in 1996 reached over 36,000
citizens and helped them recognize that proper waste handling
should be practiced everywhere.</p>

<h3>The Charge to Recycle Nickel-Cadmium Batteries</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn.&#151;Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) rechargeable
batteries, used in thousands of consumer products on the market
such as laptop computers, cordless power tools and cellular
phones, are now the focus of a nationwide campaign that aims to
keep Ni-Cds out of the waste stream through a systematic process
of collection and recycling. Keep America Beautiful, Inc., (KAB),
the nation's premier educational organization dedicated to
improving waste handling practices at the community level, has
announced its endorsement of the program, called <a
href="nicad.html">&quot;Charge Up to Recycle!&quot;</a> which is
being launched and administered by the Rechargeable Battery
Recycling Corporation (RBRC). RBRC, a group of more than 200
rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery manufacturers, is now
offering retailers, government agencies, and consumers a variety
of safe, convenient, and cost-effective opportunities to recycle
used nickel-cadmium batteries. The potential is significant. 10
percent of the approximately four <em>billion</em> dry-cell
batteries sold in the U.S. each year are Ni-Cd rechargeable
batteries.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud to be a leading voice promoting the
benefits of recycling nickel-cadmium batteries,&quot; says Roger
Powers, president of Keep America Beautiful, Inc. &quot;It's a
program that is easy for consumers to take part in. We'll do our
part by spreading the word about Ni-Cd recycling through our 450
community affiliates.&quot; </p>
<p>Under the program, consumers will be able to bring their used
Ni-Cd batteries either to participating retail outlets that sell
rechargeable batteries, or to community collection centers.
Collected batteries are sent to the International Metals
Reclamation Company (Inmetco) in Pennsylvania where a thermal
process is used to reclaim the cadmium, nickel and iron content
of the batteries. The recycled cadmium is used to make new
batteries and the nickel and iron are used to make stainless
steel. RBRC pays for both the shipping and recycling costs.</p>
<p>When purchasing Ni-Cd batteries or battery-powered products,
consumers should look for the RBRC Seal, which indicates that
company's participation in the &quot;Charge Up to Recycle!&quot;
program. That's because the recycling program is funded by the
licensing of the RBRC Seal. The Seal, when displayed on Ni-Cd
rechargeable batteries also indicates that the batteries are
covered under the RBRC recycling program.</p>
<p>&quot;Charge up to Recycle!&quot; is also helping businesses
and public agencies set up recycling programs, and now offers
Ni-Cd recycling opportunities to military and federal
installations.</p>
<p align="center"># # #</p>

Beautiful at 203/323-8987, or <a href="mailto:kabcomms@aol.com">e-mail</a>

<h3>FORD LAUDED FOR EXCELLENCE BY KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL, INC.</h3>
<h4>National non-profit organization cites Ford's commitment to
environmental stewardship through expanded and continuing use of
recycled-content materials in manufacturing</h4>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., December 4, 1996&#151;Keep America Beautiful,
Inc. (KAB) today announced that the <a
href="http://www.ford.com/corporate-info/environment/">Ford Motor
Company</a> is the recipient of its 1996 Award of Excellence in
recognition of the company's leadership on environmental issues
facing American communities. The award will be presented at the
KAB National Awards Dinner being held on December 12 in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The 1996 Award of Excellence is focused on Ford's expanded and
continuing utilization of recycled materials in the manufacture
of new automobiles. &quot;The importance of Ford's effort goes
far beyond the positive environmental impact of diverting tons of
material from the waste stream, said Roger W. Powers, President
of Keep America Beautiful, Inc. &quot;Indeed. by making such a
commitment to the use of recycled material in producing its high
quality, high visibility products, Ford is demonstrating to
millions of consumers that we can achieve the essential
priorities of resource conservation and progressive quality of
living at the same time. Each new Ford on the road illustrates
the potential value and quality performance of all products that
use recycled materials.&quot; </p>
<p>The award is also given in recognition of Ford's market-based
approach to the increased use of recycled-content materials. By
working methodically within the real market for recycled
materials, Powers said, &quot;Ford is contributing to the
stability of, and consumer confidence in, these maturing markets.
This has tremendous implications for the future of recycling in
general.&quot;</p>
<p>For over forty years, Keep America Beautiful, Inc. and its 500
local community affiliates have been providing positive
recognition to American citizens, organizations and companies
whose dedication and initiative have inspired tangible
improvements in the quality of life of American communities. Last
year, hundreds of entries and nominations were made for Keep
America Beautiful awards in several categories including
recognition for exceptional community pride and progress,
inspirational community volunteerism by individuals and groups,
effective environmental education, and successful public-private
partnerships that have made a real impact on the public's
awareness of proper waste handling practices.</p>
<p>However, not all instances of exceptional environmental
initiative benefiting our communities fall into these categories.
Some are examples of environmental endeavor that are indeed
precedent-setting efforts with the potential to have a major role
in positively influencing the attitudes and actions of millions
of Americans where they live, work and play. In 1989, Keep
America Beautiful instituted the Award of Excellence to recognize
these precedent-setting initiatives. Given three times since
1989, the Award of Excellence aims to bring widespread
recognition to efforts that not only demonstrate proactive
environmental stewardship in and of themselves, but indeed have
the potential to promote broader and even more critical progress
for the nation as a whole because of the positive influence they
can have on the behavior and attitudes of millions of Americans.</p>

<h3>Trim Your Holiday &quot;Waste&quot; Line<br>
Holiday waste-prevention tips from Keep America Beautiful, Inc.</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., November 1, 1996--'Tis indeed the season to
get wrapped up in parties, gift giving, and festive decorations.
To keep pace with it all, we need energy. So what's wrong if we
have a few extra helpings of cheese, pepperoni, and
jalepe&ntilde;o strategically placed on a stonewheat cracker?
We've got the hustle and bustle of holiday shopping to burn it
off, not to mention a whole new year of resolutions ahead of us.
Until it's time to squeeze into New Year's attire, we don't think
much about our waist line during the holidays--nor our waste line
for that matter. Of course, it's will-power to turn down a slice
of pumpkin pie, and not to eat everything on the plate, but where
does all the uneaten food go? </p>
<p>&quot;Americans throw away 28 billion pounds of food waste per
year,&quot; according to Colleen Barton, manager of solid waste
programming for Keep America Beautiful, Inc. &quot;Things can add
up quickly during the holidays,&quot; Barton said, &quot;If every
guest at grandmother's house left a tablespoon of cranberry sauce
on their Thanksgiving plates, that alone adds up to 14 million
pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>On November 21, we are reminded to be aware of ways to reduce
waste by recognizing <a href="uls.html">Use Less Stuff Day</a>
(ULS Day), a national awareness day sponsored by the ULS Report
and other groups such as Keep America Beautiful, Inc. and its 460
community affiliates.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, Keep America Beautiful is celebrating ULS Day
by decking the halls with tips on how to cut down on food
waste,&quot; Barton said, &quot;By following these tips, you can
have cheerful and fulfilling holidays without creating excessive
food waste.&quot; And besides being a nice gift for the
environment, reducing your &quot;waste&quot; line just may make
getting into that New Year's outfit a little easier.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>Tips to Reduce Food Waste This Holiday Season From Keep
America Beautiful, Inc.<br>
</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Determine how many adults vs. children are among your
        guests and be realistic about how much food you expect
        they will eat, and plan accordingly.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Don't overdo the appetizers or dessert.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Send guests home with leftovers or be creative and make
        new meals such as turkey Tettrazine and freeze it--see
        our special recipe!<br>
    </li>
    <li>Store the extra food in reusable containers so it keeps
        well.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Create a compost pile in your backyard for fruit and
        vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and egg shells. DO NOT
        compost fats and meat scraps since they attract vermin.<br>
    </li>
    <li>For office functions, order one less party item and
        donate the funds to a local food shelter.<br>
    </li>
    <li>When dining out, order only what you know you can finish,
        consider half-orders, and don't shy away from taking home
        what's left!</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>KAB's Turkey Tettrazine for Holiday Leftovers</h3>
<p><strong>(4 to 6 servings)</strong></p>
<p><em>Contributed by KAB's Susanne Woods, Senior Vice President<br>
</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em><em> </em></p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>3 tbs. butter<br>
    1 can (3-4 oz.) mushrooms--save the liquid, you'll be using
    it<br>
    1 cup chicken broth<br>
    3 tbs. flour<br>
    3/4 cup half &amp; half or milk<br>
    2 tbs. sherry<br>
    3 oz. Gruyere (or if you can't get Gruyere, Swiss cheese)
    (1/2 cup)<br>
    2 cups diced turkey (use leftover bones and meat for turkey
    soup!)<br>
    salt &amp; pepper<br>
    8 oz. spaghetti<br>
    1/4 cup Parmesan cheese<br>
    2 tbs. almonds<br>
    </em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Before cooking, make sure to have different receptacles
    handy for recyclables as well as nonrecyclable garbage. If
    your meal includes vegetables, consider composting husks,
    skins, peels and other vegetable waste. Cook spaghetti and
    set aside (or use leftover spaghetti). Add enough broth to
    the mushroom liquid remaining in the mushroom can to create a
    total of 1&#188; cups and set aside. Melt butter in skillet
    and saut&eacute; the mushrooms. Blend the flour into the
    mushrooms and gradually add the broth/liquid mixture and the
    half &amp; half. Cook on low/medium heat while stirring until
    thickened. Add the sherry and cheese (either Gruyere or
    Swiss), and cook on low/medium heat until melted. Add turkey.
    Combine ingredients in a baking dish, add spaghetti and bake
    30 minutes at 375 degrees. Sprinkle with Parmesan and
    almonds. Enjoy! <br>

<h3>New Mexico's Governor Johnson Stimulates Statewide Commitment
to Clean Communities with 545 Mile Bike Trek</h3>
<h4>&quot;Clean Team&quot; Trek For Trash Event Organized By Keep
America Beautiful, Inc.'s New Mexico State Affiliate</h4>
<p>STAMFORD, CT, September 6, 1996&#151;New Mexico Governor Gary
Johnson and a &quot;Clean Team&quot; including hundreds of
cyclists and thousands of volunteers on foot will bike 545 miles
across the state over a five day period to both raise awareness
of community litter prevention efforts and to spark community
clean-up events statewide. The trek, organized by New Mexico
Clean &amp; Beautiful, Keep America Beautiful, Inc.'s New Mexico
state affiliate, will begin on September 13 near the Colorado
border in Raton, NM, and will conclude on September 17 near the
Texas/Mexico border.</p>
<p>A similar event in which the Governor took part last year
resulted in the collection of 3 million pounds of litter from New
Mexico roadsides and towns during the 5-day period, and more
importantly, also contributed significantly to ongoing efforts by
New Mexico Clean &amp; Beautiful to raise awareness of litter
prevention and the need for direct citizen involvement in their
communities on the environment. Over 70 communities have
committed to cleaning up trash along the Governor's bike trek
route this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Governor Johnson's personal passion for the communities
of New Mexico and his demonstrated commitment to the environment
are shining examples that point to a new breed of volunteer that
is coming to life all across America today,&quot; said Roger W.
Powers, President of Keep America Beautiful, Inc. based in
Stamford, CT. &quot;His effort is illustrative of the fact that
thousands of Americans are now coming together voluntarily to
work towards building the quality of life in their communities.
His actions speak louder than words saying that every day should
indeed be Earth Day for all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful's state affiliate, New Mexico Clean
&amp; Beautiful, responded to the Governor's dedication to
community improvement and environmental attentiveness by helping
to organize last year's trek. Joseph Lobato, Director of New
Mexico Clean &amp; Beautiful, says that this year's event is
expected to be an even bigger success. &quot;The team will cycle
an average of 110 miles a day, stopping along the way to attend
community rallies and pick up trash,&quot; he said. &quot;This
five day journey across the Land of Enchantment will take the
Governor and cyclists through six State Parks and more than
twenty communities.&quot; Lobato added that the President of the
Navajo Nation, Albert Hale, will make a several hundred mile trek
of his own on horseback to meet the Governor and other cyclists
in Socorro, NM to express his solidarity with the effort. </p>
<p>Cyclists of all ages and abilities are being invited to join
the Trek, riding for just a few blocks or the entire route, and
helping the Governor to pick up trash along the way. New Mexico
State Parks is providing pit stops for participants every 25
miles where water, snacks and restrooms will be made available. </p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. is a national, nonprofit, public
education organization dedicated since 1953 to improving the
natural beauty and environment of America and improving waste
handling practices at the community level. Through its 500 local
affiliates in 40 states as well as in Canada and the Bahamas, KAB
builds partnerships between citizens, volunteer organizations,
government agencies, and the private sector to improve the
quality of life in American communities through education and
direct volunteer participation. In 1995, over 2.6 million
Americans took part directly in litter prevention education
initiatives, community improvement projects, beautification
efforts or recyclables collection events organized by KAB
affiliates. </p>

<h3>Ruckelshaus, Progress-Oriented Environmentalist for American
Communities, To Be Honored by Keep America Beautiful</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., September 5, 1996&#151;A true American
environmentalist who has risen above controversy on the issues to
create a legacy of continuous environmental progress will be
honored with the 1996 Vision for America Award by Keep America
Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) on Wednesday, September 25 in New York
City. </p>
<p>William D. Ruckelshaus, the first Administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (and the only person to
serve as Administrator two different times), and currently the
Chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (BFI) will receive
the award for his continuing personal leadership on the
environment and his commitment to developing lasting solutions to
environmental challenges. The award will be presented before an
audience of 600 corporate and public sector leaders at KAB's
annual dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria. Mr. Ruckelshaus has been an
active, longtime supporter of KAB's ongoing environmental efforts
in communities across the nation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen first-hand Bill Ruckelshaus' commitment to
the environment and to the quality of life in American
communities and we are pleased to honor him with this
award,&quot; said KAB President Roger W. Powers. &quot;His
leadership, courage and innovation has significantly shaped the
nation's environmental agenda and continues to do so. Rather than
pointing fingers, Bill has worked tirelessly throughout his
career to bring citizens, the public sector and corporations
together building mutual understanding on environmental issues
and making real, measurable improvements on these issues in ways
that benefit our communities.&quot; Mr. Ruckelshaus is the 11th
recipient of the Vision for America Award. </p>
<p>For well over two decades, Bill Ruckelshaus has provided
astute national leadership on environmental policy-making and for
that has gained bipartisan recognition as one of America's
foremost authorities on environmental issues. He remains active
taking on complex environmental challenges. In one prominent case
that is still playing out, New York City has been the primary
beneficiary&#151;both economically and environmentally. In 1993,
under Mr. Ruckelshaus' leadership, BFI became the first
publicly-held company to offer market-driven commercial waste
collection and recycling services in the city, directly
challenging established garbage &quot;syndicates&quot; that had
dominated the business (and had been stalling growth in
beneficial activities like recycling). This bold move is now
revolutionizing the practice of garbage and recyclables
collection in New York, opening the door for a new era of
market-driven growth in the development of recycling, fair
competition and lower prices for customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruckelshaus was named by President Nixon in 1970 to be the
first Administrator of the newly-created EPA. He was appointed
EPA Administrator again by President Reagan in 1983. An avid
proponent of balanced and reasoned thinking on environmental
issues, he is responsible for the genesis of many different
aspects of current EPA programming, ranging from policy-making to
law enforcement. During his second term as Administrator, he
launched a national educational effort to improve public
understanding of environmental risk, a key aspect of
citizen-driven, community-based environmental decision-making. </p>
<p>Among many other accomplishments in public life, Mr.
Ruckelshaus served under President Clinton on the President's
Council for Sustainable Development. He also served as U.S.
Representative to the United Nations World Commission on
Environment and Development. He currently chairs the Enterprise
for the Environment Initiative, a prominent group of public and
private sector leaders reviewing current environmental laws and
regulations and making recommendations to improve their
effectiveness in the future. </p>
<p>During Mr. Ruckelshaus' tenure as Chairman of BFI, the company
has made significant strides to improve the foundations for
recycling and effective solid waste management in American
communities. By making recycling and resource recovery key
elements in his company's core business, Ruckelshaus has
positioned BFI as currently the largest collector and processor
of recyclable material in the world. BFI has partnered with KAB
frequently over the years on critical educational initiatives and
programs that help individuals prevent litter, reduce waste,
recycle more and work to improve the quality of life in their
communities. Mr. Ruckelshaus himself has generously devoted
significant time and effort to KAB as a member of the
organization's Board of Directors. </p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. is a national, nonprofit, public
education organization dedicated since 1953 to improving the
natural beauty and environment of America and improving waste
handling practices at the community level. Through its 500 local
affiliates in 40 states as well as in Canada and the Bahamas, KAB

<h3>Austin Receives Keep America Beautiful Month Award for
Environmental Improvement</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., July 29, 1996&#151;Keep America Beautiful,
Inc., (KAB) a national nonprofit public education organization,
announced today that <a href="http://www.txinfinet.com/KAB/">Keep
Austin Beautiful</a> has been selected as a first place winner of
the Keep America Beautiful Month Awards. The award is given
annually to a KAB affiliate for its outstanding efforts during
the month of April to raise awareness of litter prevention and
beautification efforts in their community. The award will be
presented to Austin at KAB's 43rd Annual Meeting in Washington,
DC on December 11.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very proud of the work that Austin has done in
improving the environment and educating the community about
litter prevention,&quot; said Roger W. Powers, President of KAB.
&quot;Austin's success shows that its community is dedicated to
public education and is willing to take responsibility for their
environment.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful Month is held annually every April. KAB
affiliates and Americans across the nation join together in
cleaning up and restoring parks, neighborhoods, and beaches. Many
KAB affiliate communities conduct education workshops, seminars,
presentations and special events.</p>
<p>In 1996 KAB celebrated the 25th anniversary of Keep America
Beautiful Month. The event was created as &quot;Scouting Keep
America Beautiful Day&quot; in 1971 by David Reynolds of Reynolds
Metal Company. KAB and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)
co-sponsored a massive national cleanup and recycling event. Girl
Scouts of the USA joined Keep America Beautiful and BSA in 1972
and by 1973 the observance became a national institution. Keep
America Beautiful Day later became Keep America Beautiful Week
and today it is observed as a month-long event.</p>
<p>Highlights of Austin's Keep America Beautiful Month activities
were the Clean Sweep cleanup that involved more than 3,700
volunteers who collected more than one-half million pounds of
litter; The Great Texas Trash-Off ; and, presentations at area
schools that featured T.R. ASH, Mobius, and Baron Waste. Mascots
were also featured at events at the Austin Nature Center and
Earth Day concert. The affiliate's ongoing activities with the
Downtown Austin Alliance helped to clean sidewalks and areas
around the downtown district.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep Austin Beautiful is a wonderful organization made
up of dedicated people,&quot; said Dennis Hobbs, President of the
organization. &quot;The organization works with both the public
and private sector to reduce litter and promote recycling
campaigns and education programs that benefit the entire
community. When it comes to keeping the city clean, Keep Austin
Beautiful makes things happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep Austin Beautiful is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
promoting a clean community through non-controversial,
nonpolitical inclusive win-win litter abatement, recycling,
beautification, and educational awareness activities. </p>
<p>In addition to Keep America Beautiful Month Awards, KAB has a
National Awards program that includes awards that are given
annually to individuals, businesses and organizations in

<h3>Milwaukee Receives Keep America Beautiful Month Award for
Environmental Improvement</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., July 29, 1996&#151;Keep America Beautiful,
Inc., (KAB) a national nonprofit public education organization,
announced today that Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful, Inc.
(KGMB) has been selected as a first place winner of the Keep
America Beautiful Month Awards. The award is given annually to a
KAB affiliate for its outstanding efforts during the month of
April to raise awareness of litter prevention and beautification
efforts in their community. The award will be presented to
Milwaukee at KAB's 43rd Annual Meeting in Washington, DC on
December 11.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very proud of the work that Milwaukee has done in
improving the environment and educating the community about
litter prevention,&quot; said Roger W. Powers, President of KAB.
&quot;Milwaukee's success shows that its community is dedicated
to public education and is willing to take responsibility for
their environment.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful Month is held annually every April. KAB
affiliates and Americans across the nation join together in
cleaning up and restoring parks, neighborhoods, and beaches. Many
KAB affiliate communities conduct education workshops, seminars,
presentations and special events. </p>
<p>In 1996 KAB celebrated the 25th anniversary of Keep America
Beautiful Month. The event was created as &quot;Scouting Keep
America Beautiful Day&quot; in 1971 by David Reynolds of Reynolds
Metal Company. KAB and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)
co-sponsored a massive national cleanup and recycling event. Girl
Scouts of the USA joined Keep America Beautiful and BSA in 1972
and by 1973 the observance became a national institution. Keep
America Beautiful Day later became Keep America Beautiful Week
and today it is observed as a month-long event.</p>
<p>Highlights of KGMB Keep America Beautiful Month activities
were the GLAD Bag-A-Thon cleanup that involved more than 500
groups including block clubs, scout troops, schools, businesses
churches, youth groups and individuals who collected over 2,000
tons of litter; a waste reduction and education campaign in
partnership with KGMB, local government; businesses, schools, and
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to reduce the
amount of waste generated in southeast Wisconsin; and,
&quot;Let's Not Waste the 90's Tours, Workshops and Field
Trips.&quot; More than 1,000 children and adults visited
Milwaukee's Environmental Education Resource and Tour Center. The
center, home to KGMB, has over 450 resources on litter recycling
and composting.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of all the citizens of Milwaukee County, I
congratulate KGMB for the prestigious award it has received from
Keep America Beautiful,&quot; said F. Thomas Ament, Milwaukee
County Executive. &quot;KGMB has accomplished its goals of litter
reduction, recycling campaigns, and education programs through
strong partnerships with the private and public sectors. Our
community is the benefactor of KGMB's principles of reduce,
reuse, recycle and, compost and the award underscores its success
in keeping greater Milwaukee beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful, Inc. has been an affiliate
of Keep America Beautiful since 1985. KGMB promotes responsible
solid waste management and environmental programs through
outreach to business, industry, government, educators, community
groups, and residents of Milwaukee. In addition to Keep America
Beautiful Month Awards, KAB has a National Awards program that
includes awards that are given annually to individuals,
businesses and organizations in categories in state and local
government. KGMB has been an a five-time award winner. </p>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. is dedicated to preserving the
natural beauty and environment of America and improving waste
handling practices at the community level. Through its 500
affiliates in 40 states, Canada, and the Bahamas, it is building
partnerships with volunteer organizations, government agencies,

<h3>Complex Solid Waste Management Issues Made Simple by Keep
America Beautiful, Inc.</h3>
<p>STAMFORD, Conn., July 19, 1996&#151;A concise summary of
municipal solid waste management options is now available through
the non-profit educational organization, Keep America Beautiful,
Inc. (KAB). Titled, <em>&quot;</em><a href="overview.html"><em>Overview
of Municipal Solid Waste Management</em></a><em>,&quot;</em> the
14-page document provides definitions, statistics, and
explanations on waste management options, including source
reduction, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and sanitary
landfilling. </p>
<p>The <em>Overview</em> provides a broad perspective on solid
waste management in the United States by simplifying voluminous
and complex data gathered from KAB's Solid Waste Committee, trade
associations, solid waste publications, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
<p>&quot;There is no single solution to managing garbage,&quot;
says Colleen Barton, manager of solid waste programming. &quot;We
hope this document will be a valuable resource for teachers,
government officials, industry, and the general public as they
continue to explore the options of an integrated waste management
approach.&quot; An integrated waste management approach enables
communities to tailor a combination of waste management options
to meet their specific waste management needs.</p>
<p>Copies of the <em>&quot;Overview of Municipal Solid Waste
Management&quot;</em> may be obtained by contacting Keep America
Beautiful, Inc. at 203/323-8987, or through our <a
href="stuff.html#Overview">catalog</a>.</p>

EGS is an independant, bi-monthly analysis of the Western Canadian equity markets and small-cap, speculative mining and technology or industial companies with above average upside potential.  It is published for the expressed use of our paid subscribers who should be experienced, sophisticated investors, brokers,etc. and accustumed to high risk investments.  Before proceeding further you should read our full Disclaimer below as we operate under the assumption that you have.  
<P>
<font size=+2>STRATEGY & RECENT PERFORMANCE</font size>
<P>
<P>
At EGS, we are dedicated to finding the next success stories, but before you read about them elsewhere in the financial press, brokerage reports, and other major newsletters.  Once we find them, we get to know the stock`s trading pattern, and then we buy low and sell high , and pass this information onto our readers.
<P>
<P>
We utilize elements of market timing and stock selection based on fundamental and technical analysis, contrarian investment strategies, technology, and our proximity to the companies we follow to find the highest returns possible - with a rough target of 100% within one to twelve months.  Previous success is no guarantee of future performance, but our carefull disciplined approach has paid off so far.  Of our previous 13 picks (in over as many months) 8 of these have exceeded  this target, 3 of which have traded in excess of 500%, and the average subsequent high recently was 241%.  With high returns comes risk however, and 6 of our picks are in negative territory, with one stock down 49%, and the rest only off 20% or less. On a simple buy and hold basis, our EGS portfolio has ranged from 64% to 117% in recent months.  Actual performance would depend on which stocks were purchaced, selling prices, etc.  Issues usually contain up to date performance records and corporate updates on  companies previously featured.

<H1>KAISER EXPRESS<br> &<br> Sports-Fishing vs Bottom-Fishing</H1>
<P>
Commentary by John Kaiser <BR>
<P>
<font size=+2>Publications & Services Available</font size>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<font size=+1><b>Canspec Research</b></font size>  offers a fax service called <b>Premium Kaiser Express.</b>  It costs US $300 per year, which guarantees subscribers at least 15 faxes. Kaiser Expresses are issued only when a trading opportunity has been identified. The time between expresses can be days or more than a month. In contrast to the <b>Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report</b>, which encourages a disciplined and slow-paced investment strategy (bottom-fishing), the Kaiser Express presents opportunities for immediate action (reel-'em-in sports-fishing). Whereas the newsletter highlights speculative stocks at a very early stage before they enter the limelight, and offers followup commentary to guide the selling strategy of bottom-fish owners, the Kaiser Express is devoted to the identification and analysis of changing situations. Expresses come in two basic forms. The first type highlights a stock where the market has not yet recognized the implications of a new development. The second type of Kaiser Express provides analysis and strategies for more general topics such as area plays (Voisey Bay) and market trends. Such expresses do not make specific recommendations. Instead, they explain the situation, provide information about relevant stocks, and suggest strategies on how the emerging trend can be exploited. It remains up to the subscriber to decide what stocks to buy or sell. Because Kaiser Express is designed as an early warning system for volatile situations that do not allow for live commentary and handholding, it is suitable only for individuals with a sophisticated understanding of speculative markets and the willingness to track developments affecting these "sports-fish". The Kaiser Express is intended exclusively for Premium Kaiser Express subscribers until two trading sessions have passed after the release date.
<P>
<b>Kaiser Express</b> is then available for free viewing at a number of authorized Internet sites. These sites are: http://www.baystreet.com (Market News), http://www.info-mine.com/investment/ (Robertson Info-Mine), and http://www.markets-west.com/info-data/index1.html (Markets-West). Newsletter subscribers who wish to try out the Premium Kaiser Express are entitled to a one time US $50 trial that runs for two months or until at least four expresses have been sent.

Curious about what stocks will be featured in the 1997 Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Guide? Wouldn't it be nice to spot and accumulate them even before Kaiser knows about them? Hard-core bottom-fishers are already cruising the charts of Bob Stranks' ChartSmart system, searching for those bottoming troughs. Now Stranks is adding private placement data to the system so that users can filter paper creation activity. He is also getting major indices into his system. If you are serious speculator, own a 386 or better PC with 100 MB of free disk space, and have an Internet account, getting setup with ChartSmart will be the smartest stock market thing you can do between now and the new year. Bob Stranks has made it very easy to get set up. You can get more details at his web site <b>http://www.chartsmart.com</b> where you can download the entire ChartSmart software and database for all VSE, ASE and TSE stocks to use for a free trial. Bob will give you a temporary password that allows you to get updates whenever you wish. If you like what you see, you pay a one time $25 registration fee to get permanently set up and then you pay US $29 ($35 CAD) per month to get all the daily trade data for all Canadian stocks. You can set up your portfolio to track its value. Or any custom list you build. And if you are simply hungry for ideas, ChartSmart's filter system will keep you busy all evening.

<font size=+2>The Vancouver Stock Exchange</font size>
<P>
Established in 1907 to act as a central marketplace for the resource-based economy emerging in Western Canada,  the Vancouver Stock Exchange has grown to become one of the leading venture capital markets in the world.  As most of the companies who sought financing through the VSE in the early 20th century were involved in the mining industry, the VSE became known as  "Canada's mining exchange".
<P>
Since it's inception, mining companies have raised billions of dollars for exploration and development.
<P>
Today, an increasing number of junior industrial and high-technology firms turning to the VSE for capital, but the VSE's major source of financing continues to be for mining companies based in Canada, the US and other parts of the world.  Of the companies listed on the exchange 52 % are natural resource - related.
<P>
Another significant and growing natural resource category on the VSE is the oil and gas company sector.  The interest in these types of companies traditionally fluctuates with the price of, and the demand for oil.  However, there have always been companies involved in exploration and development, production, pipeline operations and related services.
<P>
With a reputation as a leading venture capital market through financing mining exploration and development,   VSE listed companies can be found almost everywhere in the world where exploration is taking place:  B.C's Eskay Creek and Iskut regions, the Northwest Territories, Labrador's Voisey Bay, California, Colorado, Nevada, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico and now Indonesia, etc. 
<P>
The VSE is a self-regulatory organization, owned and operated by over 50 member brokerage firms.  Each member has a seat on the exchange, and a Board of Governors elected by the members set policies and guidelines for the exchange members and listed companies to follow.  As an exchange, 20 % of all Canadian trading volume is done on the VSE - a trading volume that ranks the VSE third among all North American exchanges.
<P>
The VSE has one main index known as the, "VSE Composite Index".  Three sub-indices are provided as  sub numerical market guages to the main composite index, the Commercial/Industrial index, the Resource index and the Venture index.  A recent addition to the VSE is the Asian Board/Index.  This index monitors the growing number of  Asian related companies listed.
<P>
As a venture capital exchange the VSE provides the opportunity for companies to grow from a start-up stage to a small, medium or possibly, large company.  There are few exchanges that can boast of a proven track record for financing venture type of companies.  Over the years, the VSE has proven itself.  With more then 90 years of experience developing expertise to service small and medium size resource oriented companies, a set of policies and procedures tailored to these companies unique financing needs, a service-driven corporate finance department, leading - edge trading facilities, an extensive market information services group and finally a fair system of regulations, the VSE  facilitate a marketplace where ideas can meet investors.
<P>
This ability has placed the Vancouver Stock Exchange as a world leader when it comes to raising venture capital funding for risk type ventures.

<DT>10/11/96<DD>The company, in concert with its working interest partners  on  the  Eight  Mile
Flat  field  in Uintah County, Utah, will enter into a waterflood program on its wells in order to increase production.    
<P>                                      
It appears that the reservoirs have good  sustainable  oil  producing  life  and inflow  into  the  well  bore  remains  the major issue. After several months of monitoring the wells  and  flow  rates  and  following  discussions  with  other operators  in  the  area recommendations have been made to commence a waterflood
program.    
<P>                                                                    
The 4-2 well consistently produces about 20 bopd with little or no water and  is capable of producing reasonable rates from the lower perforations since the well pressure remains high and undepleted. In addition, the well produces  sufficient gas  to  run the pumping units and heaters and when combined with other wells in the field the company would have excess gas to run the entire field.  Therefore, the  company  has agreed to expend the funds necessary to clean out the existing perforations, dissolve the asphaltenes and paraffins that  are  present  in  the well  bore  and perforate certain upper zones to correlate with the perforations
in the 4-3 well in the Lower Green River  formation.  The  net  result  of  this program should be to increase production to about 100 bopd.          
<P>           
The 4-3 well, which is also maintaining pressure, is currently shut-in and  will be   converted  to  a  water  injection  well.  Although  initial  results  were encouraging, the well now produces only about one  bopd  when  allowed  to  run.  Because  there  are  common  sand bodies between the wells, the wells provide an
ideal candidate for a waterflood project. A significant increase  in  production in  the  4-2 well should be achieved once water injection rates are sustained in the 4-3 well which will take about one to two months to realize.     
<P>           
The 4-2 well has been petrophysically evaluated to have 14m of conventional  pay from  seven  zones within the lower Green River formation. Five of the zones are correlatable to the initial and offsetting well and  are  amenable  to  pressure maintenance  via a waterflood program. The company estimates primary reserves of
this well to be 70,000 barrels based on a 5% recovery  efficiency  and  40  acre drainage.  An  additional  11m  of  unconventional  oil pay is seen in fractured siltstones and fractured argillaceous carbonates in four other  zones.  Although the  North  Bonanza  field  produces from such fractured siltstones, no reserves
have yet been attributed to these zones.          
<P>                              
Waterflood analogs from the adjacent Monument Butte and other Green River fields indicate that primary recovery can be increased by an additional 2.5 times which would increase the ultimate recoverable reserves of the Federal 4-2  to  175,000 barrels.                                   
<P>                                   
It is expected that work on this project will commence about October 14 1996 and will  require  approximately  three  weeks for completion at a total cost to the partners of about US$144,000. This will allow for conversion of the 4-3  into  a water  injection  well,  recompletion  of  the  4-2  well  in the sands that are considered to be behind pipe, install a tri-plex water injection  pump  and  lay about  four  miles of poly piping from the Green River to bring water to the 4-3 well.                                                                           

<DT>10/10/96<DD>Further to the VSE notice dated May 29 1996, the  transfer  within  escrow  from
Brian  Doutaz as to 650,000 shares and William F. Verchere as to 100,000 shares, to B.G. Capital International Ltd (George H. Plewes)  will  not  be  proceeding.  Therefore, the consent for a pro rata release of 375,000 shares will go to Brian Doutaz as to 325,000 shares and William F. Verchere as to 50,000 shares.

<DT>10/04/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 375,000 shares from escrow. There are
375,000 shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>07/30/96<DD>On July 3 1996, directors and employees have been  granted  options  on  100,000
shares at $1.60 expiring July 3 1998.

Brian C. Doutaz (650,000 shares) & from William F. Verchere to B.G. Capital International 
Limited, a private company owned by George H. Plewes, subject to regulatory approval

<DT>04/16/96<DD>Closing of special warrant private placement announced on February 16 and 23, 
1996 - all funds received. The Company proposes to file an Exchange Offering Prospectus to 
qualify the exercise of the special warrants. If the Exchange Offering Prospectus is not effective by 
September 13, 1996, each special warrant will entitle the holder to 1.1 common shares and 0.55 
share purchase warrants.

<DT>03/27/96<DD>Further to announcement of June 07, 1995, the Company has disposed of its  working interest of five sections of land in the Peace River of northeastern B.C. for $152,000  (original purchase price) to the Calgary based company from which it acquired the property in 1995  as result of one of the parties refusing to extinguish rights of first refusal and the Company being unable to secure full and clear title. The Company has now repaid the $100,000 bridge loan from  Canaccord Capital Corporation used to finance the acquisition.

<DT>02/23/96<DD>Private placement changed to Special Warrant placement.

<DT>12/01/95<DD>Options on 150,000 shares @ $0.85 granted to George H. Plewes for 2 years.

<DT>09/21/96<DD>Production summaries on Federal 4-2 and 4-3. Future plans for wells.
<P>
<B>FEDERAL 4-2 WELL:</B> Two of the seven hydrocarbon zones were perforated and fractured on 
June 29, 1995. The well was put on production on July 25, and during a one week production test 
averaged 50 barrels per day (bpd), ranging between 10 and 87 bpd of oil with no decline in 
pressure. Production figures for the month of August averaged 16 bpd (ranging from 15 to 30 bpd) 
without any indication of reservoir depletion. Rocky Mountain Operating Company (RMOC), the 
operator of the field, has analyzed the discontinuous entry of fluid into the borehole and has 
attributed the inconsistent flow to paraffin plugs. RMOC has recommended a hot condensate/xylene 
mixture be pumped into the borehole in order to dissolve the paraffin plugs and return the well to 
its initial production figures. The Company plans to follow the recommendation. In addition, over 
the next number of months, the Company will perforate and fracture the additional five zones. 
<P>         
<B>FEDERAL 4-3:</B>The second offset well was completed on June 14, 1995, and has been evaluated 
to have 10.1 metres (33 feet) of pay from four zones, two of which are unconventional zones (i.e. 
organic rich carbonates and siltstones) correlating to those seen in the 4-2 well. Good oil shows 
were seen across these zones which were first completed. Similar siltstone-type reservoirs are also 
productive in the North Bonanza Field and have assigned primary recoverable reserves of 50,000 
barrels of oil per well from a 2.4 m (8 foot) zone. Given that these unconventional zones are 
capable of economic production, RMOC has included them in the primary reserve estimate of the 
well. Therefore, primary reserves for this well are 46,000 stock barrels of oil (35,000 bbl are 
attributable to these unconventional pay zones) based on a 5% recovery efficiency and 40 acre 
drainage. Ultimate recoverable reserves after waterflood are estimated at 115,000 bbl of oil based 
on waterflood analogues from the Monument Butte Field. The well was perforated and fractured on 
July 22, 1995, and put on production August 21. Available initial production figures for the well 
are 54 bpd (from 10 to 90 bpd) with no decline in reservoir pressure. This well will also undergo a 
hot condensate/xylene treatment to alleviate paraffin plugging and to help maximize deliverability. 
<P>     
<B>FUTURE PLANS - EIGHT MILE FLAT:</B> It is the intention of Adda to maximize the 
deliverability of the oil and to minimize the operating costs of the wells by electrically heating the 
production tubing, thus eliminating the paraffin problem. At present there are no power lines in the 
immediate area; however, Utah Power has begun the process to install transmission lines to 
Pleasant Valley and the Monument Butte oilfields. GHP/JH Limited Partnership has been contacted 
by Utah Power for permission to cross the Eight Mile Flat Field and to determine the disposition of 
GHP/JH to the use of power when it is made available. The Company intends to commence 
negotiations with GHP/JH on additional acreage at the Eight Mile Flat Field whereby Adda would 
be in a better position to maximize the return on its investment at Eight Mile Flat. This would be 
achieved through a five point technical plan which would increase production and reduce operating 
costs: <BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Use seismic to identify fractured "sweet spots" and thick channel deposits;
<LI>Exploit the reservoirs using appropriate logging tools to identify fracture patterns and sandbody 
orientation - horizontal drilling will be used where practical and economically feasible;
<LI>Electrically heated tubing used to maintain high deliverability and reduce operating costs;
<LI>Employ pad drilling to reduce drilling and facility costs;
<LI>Pressure maintenance through waterflood to sustain deliverability & provide additional reserves.
</OL>
<P>

<DT>08/04/95<DD>Production commences on Federal 4-2 based on lower of 7 zones producing  80 
BOPD. 4-3 nears completion of surface equipment.

<DT>07/20/95<DD>Options on 75,000 shares at $1.50 granted to Gerry Williams for two years.

<DT>06/28/95<DD>Results of AGM. Name change approved to Adda Resources Ltd.

<DT>06/19/95<DD>Drilling completed on Federal 4-3. Initial evaluation of 4-2 shows 14 metres of 
conventional pay from 7 zones. Primary reserves 70,000 barrels. Waterflood possible. Additional 11 
metres of pay in 4 zones.

<DT>06/10/95<DD>Drilling commences on Federal 4-3 well, Eight Mile Flats, Utah.

<DT>06/07/95<DD>The Company entered into agreement with a Calgary, Alberta, based oil and 
natural gas company, to acquire 50% of the Calgary company's working interest in five sections 
(1280 hectares) of land in the Peace River Block of northeastern B.C. and the associated tangibles 
and miscellaneous interests (the Company's interests will vary between 20.3% and 35.0% and will 
average 31.3%) for a total consideration of $152,000. The exact location of the properties will be 
disclosed on a confidential basis to the regulatory authorities pending verification of clear title and 
certain other operational matters being completed between the parties. The net 15.66% WI on the 
lands include interests in 3 shut-in gas wells, one shut-in oil well and one abandoned gas well all of 
which have oil and gas potential from multi-zone Cretaceous and Triassic objectives. The property 
has been evaluated to have a net 13.15 MSTB of proven oil; 11.55 MSTB of net proven condensate 
with a net associated 0.16 BCF of proven sales gas and 5 BCFE of net probable sales gas 
attributable to the Company's interests. All the wells currently have production infrastructure and 
the plan will be to workover and complete the existing wells later this summer. Canaccord Capital 
Corporation has loaned the Company $100,000 as bridge financing in order to complete the Peace 
River acquisition. The funds have been guaranteed personally by the President of the Company and 
are to be repaid through proceeds of the Company's Statement of Material Facts financing through 
the Vancouver Stock Exchange which has an effective date of May 31, 1995.

<DT>05/24/96<DD>Drilling on the Federal 4-2 offset well located in the Eight Mile Flat Field of 
Uintah County, Utah, was completed on May 24, 1995. Logging was also completed and the bore 
was cased in preparation for production testing which will commence in about seven days.

<DT>03/27/95<DD>Appointment of Carlos Salas as director and Vice President, Exploration and 
Development. 115,000 options at $2.10 granted to Salas (100,000) and Provenzano (15,000) for 2 
years.

<P>
Adda Resources Ltd. is a Canadian based publicly traded junior oil and gas exploration and 
development company (listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange) which is seeking to become a viable 
operational oil and gas producer with domestic, international, and offshore interests in the oil patch.
<P>
In 1994, Adda agreed to farm-in on 80 acres of land owned by GHP/JH Limited Partnership (with an 
option on an additional 80 acres) to earn a 75% interest in two oil wells to be drilled in the "Eight Mile 
Flat Field" of Uintah County, Utah located about 185 km east of Salt Lake City, which lies adjacent to 
the Monument Basin Field, one of the most prolific producers of petroleum products in the United 
States. Adda earned its interests in this property by drilling and completing at a cost of US $700,000, 
two offset wells. The Company is entitled to 75% of revenues until payback of the US $700,000 and 
thereafter its interest will drop back to 50% subject to royalties and encumbrances.
<P>
The Federal 4-2 and 4-3 wells were drilled and completed in 1995. Because of the high paraffin content 
of the oil, results to date have been disappointing. Production costs have equaled revenue from the two 
wells. Various remediation processes including hot oil treatments have been attempted with only 
partial success. The operator will  complete an enzyme treatment process on the Federal 4-2 to 
determine the effectiveness of this method on increasing production. Until electrical service into the 
area is completed by Utah Power, the prognosis for a profitable operation is questionable. With power, 
heating of the well bore would likely produce revenues in excess of initial production estimates.
<P>
In November, 1995, the Company raised $800,000 through a Statement of Material Facts financing of 
1,000,000 Units consisting of one share and one warrant at a price of $0.80 per Unit, to raise working 
capital for the coming year and to drill and complete a third well in the Eight Mile Flat (scheduled for 
mid summer, 1996). In May, 1996, 500,000 warrants and 200,000 brokers' warrants were exercised and 
converted to shares providing the Company with an additional $560,000 in working capital.
<P>
Recently, the Company completed a special warrant private placement through the facilities of 
Canaccord Capital Corp. whereby $1,150,000 was raised. The Company proposes to qualify the special 
warrants (comprised of One Unit which will in turn provide one share and  warrant) with an 
Exchange Offering Prospectus to be filed in British Columbia late this summer.
<P>
As part of the corporate strategy to become a credible player in the petroleum industry, the Company is 
working with a number of sources to add strength to its Board of Directors and Management 
Committee through the retention of other individuals with experience and strength in the oil and gas 
business as new Board members, employees and advisors to the Company. The Company is also 
actively seeking and evaluating prospects in various areas of the world that would be likely candidates 
for the Company's involvement on an ownership or joint venture basis.
<P>
Adda Resources is currently in a good financial position with about $2,500,000 in its treasury. It is the 
intention of the Company over the next few years to become a viable, profitable and credible oil and 
gas entity with interests in various areas of the world.

<P>
<B>Eight Mile Flat - Utah:</B>
<P>
Adda Petroleum (Utah) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Adda Resources Ltd. by Agreement 
dated June 23, 1994, with GHP/JH Limited Partnership of Englewood, Colorado, agreed to 
farm-in on 80 acres of land owned by GHP/JH with an option on an additional 80 acres, to earn 
a 75% interest in two oil wells to be drilled in the "Eight Mile Flat Field" of Uintah County, 
Utah. This Field is located in northeastern Utah, about 185 km east of Salt Lake City and lies 
adjacent to the Monument Basin Field, one of the most prolific producers of petroleum products 
in the United States. Several large producing fields exist within the Uintah Basin including the 
giant Altamont-Bluebell field with ultimate recoverable reserves in the order of 250 million 
barrels.
<P>
Adda earned its interests in this property by drilling and completing at a cost of US $700,000, 
two offset wells. Under the terms of the acquisition, Adda is entitled to 75% of revenues until 
payback of the US $700,000 and thereafter its interest will drop back to 50% subject to royalties 
and encumbrances.
<P>
The oil is trapped primarily by stratigraphic elements within the thick interbedded sequence of 
carbonates, shales and sandstones of the Green River Formation. Although these reservoirs 
generally have low porosities and low permeabilities, initial production rates vary from 100 to 
5,000 barrels per day. Studies have shown that fractures are key to the economic viability of 
these wells. Typical Green River oil fields are developed on a 40 acre spacing with a total of 16 
wells drilled per section. Almost all the fields are on primary production with only a few units 
attempting secondary recovery methods. The Monument Butte "D" unit has implemented a 
waterflood which has doubled the recoverable reserves.
<P>
The Federal 4-2 and 4-3 wells were drilled and completed in May through August of 1995. As a 
result of the waxy nature of the oil, results to date have been disappointing. Production costs 
have equaled revenue from the two wells. Various remediation processes including hot oil 
treatments have been attempted with only partial success. It is the intention of the operator to 
complete an enzyme treatment process on the Federal 4-2 to determine the effectiveness of this 
method on increasing production. Results will be announced in due course. Until electrical 
service into the area is completed by Utah Power, the prognosis for a profitable operation is 
questionable. With power, heating of the well bore would likely produce revenues in excess of 
initial production estimates.
<P>
<P>
<B>Rob Mineral Claims - Yukon Territory</B>
<P>
The Company holds 58 contiguous mineral claims located in the Wheaton River area of the 
Yukon Territory known as the Rob Claims. The property is in good standing until 1998. 
Management has reviewed the recommendations of the Company's geologists and has 
determined that the best course of action for the coming season would be to do maintain close 
contacts with associates in the area as exploration work on ground immediately adjacent to the 
Rob Claims is carried out.

<DT>10/24/96<DD>A progress report is provided on the stage one exploration program currently  in progress  on  the  Liphichi property in the Altiplano region of Western Bolivia.  The company has the right to earn up to a 70% working interest in  the  Liphichi property.             
<P>                                                          
Past mining activities on the Liphichi property can be followed over a length of more  than  three  kilometres along the strike of the mineralization zone and in several levels of extensive adits spread over a vertical distance of  more  than 150  metres. These mining activities historically followed high grade zones. The stage one underground sampling program recently completed by the company focused on  the  adits  near  the  Liphichi  River  Valley.  The  assay  results for the underground channel samples from  cross-cuts  of  three  vertically  overlapping adits can be obtained by phoning the company.
 <P>
A diamond drill program is presently under way on the  property  to  define  the mineralization  zone.  Two  diamond drills are presently working on the property with the first (110 metres) hole having been completed near the  Liphichi  River Valley.  The drill core from the first hole is well mineralized to art 80 metres depth displaying abundant quartz vein-network  and  sulphide,  and  with  lesser quartz  veining  and sulphide mineralization to the end of the hole. Split cores from the hole have  been  submitted  for  assay  and  results  are  expected  in approximately two weeks. It is expected that detailed sampling from other levels of adits and along the strike, as well as drilling in progress will  extend  the mineralized  zone  along the strike and to depth which will enable a preliminary reserve evaluation to be calculated.

<DT>10/17/96<DD>Redex Gold has agreed in principle to enter into a joint venture agreement  with
Anthian  Resources  with  respect to the Llallagua 1 and 2 properties comprising 175 sq km in eastern Bolivia which are 100%-owned by the company. 
<P>
Anthian will be the operator of an exploration and development  program  on  the property  and  Redex  Gold's  vice-president  of  mining  operations, Mr Charles "Scotty" Bruce, will remain involved in a consulting capacity. 
<P>
Redex Gold has arranged a brokered private placement of  one  million  units  at $0.32.   Proceeds from the
offering will be added  to  working  capital  and  expenditure  into  continuing exploration work on the company's 100%-owned properties.

<DT>10/04/96<DD>The Company reports that Mr Ljubo (Louie) Mikulic and Mr Mitchelle M. Brajdic have been appointed to  the board  of  directors of the company. Mr Mikulic is an experienced financier with
over ten years of experience in the mining industry, the past  president  and  a current director of Banff Resources. 
<P>                                           
Mr Brajdic, B.Comm., MBA, holds degrees from universities in  Australia,  France and  the  USA,  currently  involved  in  the banking industry as chief executive director of Glumina Banka D.D., Zagreb, one of Croatia's top ten banks  and  one of  the  three  largest  private  banks  in the country specializing in merchant
banking, trade finance and international operations. Mr Brajdic  was  previously chief manager of Croatia Banka D.D., Zagreb, Croatia's largest private bank.     The appointments follow the resignation of Mr Marvin Mitchell from the board  of directors.

<DT>09/18/96<DD>Ms Sandra Sikic reports Mr Anthony Garson has been appointed to the board of directors.  Mr  Garson  has acted  in  various capacities as a senior mining analyst and financial executive
for over 20 years in the mining, brokerage, and banking industries in Canada and the UK.

<DT>09/12/96<DD>Ms Sandra Sikic reports Mr Bruce Purcell has resigned from the board of directors,  effective  September 12 1996.

<DT>09/11/96<DD>On August 9 1996, directors and employees have been granted options  on  100,000
shares at $2.01 expiring August 8 1998.                                         

<DT>08/29/96<DD>All title matters have now been completed and a formal option agreement has been executed  and  recorded  under Bolivian Law in order to provide Anthian's wholly owned Bolivian subsidiary with the right to earn up to a 70% undivided  interest in  the  Liphichi  gold property, which includes the Progresiva gold mine in the vicinity of La Paz.    
<P>                                                         
Anthian will immediately commence a two phase program consisting  of  geological studies  and  sampling  in  preparation  for a minimum 1,000 metre diamond drill program recommended on the claims by the company's consultant Peter Christopher, P.Eng.  The estimated cost of the two phase program is approximately US$900,000.
<P>
According to Mr Christopher, a mineralized zone up to 60 metres  wide  has  been traced  by  following  surface  workings over a 2km area. The zone is crossed by four main levels  and  numerous  sub-levels  and  shallower  workings.  Previous surface chip samples, across a steeply dipping network vein zone, averaged 5.280 g/t Au over a 52.9 metre zone width.   
<P>                                         
Underground chip sampling with approximately two metre intervals at level  three averaged 3.410 g/t Au and 22.34 g/t Ag over a 49.0 metre exposed zone width.   The present program will review  underground  workings  which  will  be  channel sampled  over  narrower  widths  to  improve quality of results. Samples will be
analyzed by Bondar Clegg in Bolivia  with  check  analyses  being  conducted  in Vancouver.

<dt>08/08/96<dd>On June 1 1996, Mr Hauke Andresen  was  appointed  as  vice-president,  European
Finance.

<DT>08/01/96<DD>The company has completed the acquisition of a 30%  undivided  interest  in  the Lilas  gold  property,  Costa  Rica.  Please call the Company  for complete drill results.

<DT>07/24/96<DD>The company has received results of the initial  200  reverse  circulation  dril holes from the Lilas project in the central gold belt of Costa Rica. The project is a joint venture between Barrick Gold Corp and  Anthian  (30%).  Barrick,  the operator,  has  reported  on  the first 20 of 40 holes (totalling 5,966.3m).  Equipment has been imported to Costa Rica by the joint venture to extend holes 19, 20, 29  and
31.  Project  consultants have recognized a zoned, auriferous, hot spring system which may cover as much as 80 sq km including a silica cap of at least 6 sq  km.  Only  part of the silica cap has been drill-tested. Significant results from the first 20 holes (96R-17 to 96R-34) of the 1996 program can be obtained from the 
company.

<DT>07/22/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation  pertaining  to  an  agreement  of purchase  and  sale  dated  March  5  1996,  as amended June 28 1996 whereby the company can acquire from Orion Resources Inc a 30% interest of  an  option  from Tierra  Colorado S.A. to acquire five mineral concessions (8,500 hectares) known as the Lilas gold property in the Guanacaste Province of northwest  
Costa  Rica. Consideration  is  based on a valuation report by Orcan Consultants of Vancouver dated 
February 28 1996, that consists of a total payment  of  $100,000  and  the issuance (subject to a one year hold period) of 616,100 shares of the company at $1.00. The agreement is subject to a 2.5% net smelter  return  royalty  held  by Tierra.      
<P>                                                                   
The remaining 70% interest in the Tierra option is owned by Barrick  Gold  Corp.  Upon  Barrick  exercising its option and the company deciding not to participate in  further  exploration,  the  company  will  be  deemed  to  convert  its  30% participating interest to a 15% net profits interest (NPI)

<DT>07/19/96<DD>Further to the company news release of  April 24  1996,  the  company is pleased to annouce it has  completed  its private  placement  for  $1,400,000  with  the  sale  of  one million units. The
securities issued are subject to a hold period in BC expiring on June 14 1997.

<DT>06/21/96<DD>On April 19 1996, directors and employees have been granted options  on  330,340
shares at $1.77 expiring April 18 1998.
 
<DT>06/11/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an agreement with Northeast Resources Corp (NRC)
dated  April  22  1996 whereby the company has been granted an option to acquire all of NRC's interest in Liphichi gold property, Larecaja  Province,  Department of La Paz, Bolivia.   
<P>
For details on the payment arrangements for the option given to Anthian Resources please call the company.
<P>
Pursuant to an underlying agreement, the company may earn up to 70% interest  in
the  property  by  paying US$2,600,000 and incurring US$2,400,000 in exploration
expenditures. 

<DT>04/23/96<DD>The Company reported that it has concluded negotiations and signed a letter of 
intent to acquire an assignment of a right to earn 70% interest in and to the Lipichi Gold Property, which includes the Progresiva Gold Mine located in the La Paz Province of Bolivia.  
<P>
Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, the Company is required to pay CDN$45,000, 1,300,000 shares of Anthian in installments and 800,000 two-year, non-transferable share purchase warrants exercisable in whole or in part at a price of $2.00 per share in the first year and $2.25 in the second year to Northeast Resources Corp. of Road Town, Tortola, Bolivia.  In addition, the Company is required to pay US$2,600,000 and incur US$2,400,000 in exploration expenditures in installments in order to earn a 70% interest in and to the property.  The Lipichi Gold Property is located in the La Paz Province of Bolivia and has been equipped
with power lines and a 100 ton per day flotation mill which is 90% complete.  The property is situated
about 110 km. NW of La Paz, Bolivia and is accessible by road.
<P>
Prior to acquiring an interest in the property, Anthian retained the services of Dr. Peter A.Christopher,
P. Eng, to conduct an examination of the property and to check results from 78 previous chip samples
which averaged 4.73 g/t Au (0.138 oz/t) over a 50 meter zone width.  Dr Christopher obtained 78 chip
samples which have assays (by Bondar Clegg in Bolivia or Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver)
ranging from 0.02 g/t to 101.83 g/t Au (2.978 oz/t Au) and have an average grade of 5.53 g/t Au (0.161
oz/t Au).  High grade intervals obtained during surface check sampling included 1 meter grading 2.970
oz/t Au (checks sample interval reported at 44.8 g/t) and 2.5 meter which averaged 0.924 oz/t Au (checks
reported results of 2.5 meters at 43.96 g/t Au).  The terms of the letter of intent were concluded following
Anthian's receipt of recommendations from its consulting engineers.
<P>
The Progresiva Mine has been mined on three main levels with numerous additional short adits driven on
zones of high grade.  The workings are spread over a vertical distance of over 150 meters and a sampled
width of over 50 meters.  Workings are situated on both sides of the Lipichi River Valley and have been
followed for about 3 kilometers.  Although mining activities on the property have been extensive,
accurate information is not available with respect to the value of ores mined from the property.
In conjuction with the acquisition, Anthian has agreed to make a placement of 1,000,000 units at a price
of $1.40 per unit.  Each unit consists of 1 share and 1 two-year non-transferable share purchase warrant
exercisable in whole or in part at a price of $1.65 in the first year and $1.90 in the second year.
The Company plans to conduct a drilling program and further underground sampling with the private
placement proceeds to determine if the project should retain the high grade, selective mining approach
or expand the mill capacity to bulk mine the entire zone.  The terms of acquisition and private placement
are subject to the prior approval of the Vancouver Stock Exchange.

<DT>04/19/96<DD>The Company announced that Mr. Jenn-Fa Chen has been appointed Vice-President of the Company. Mr. Chen is introducing the Company to a number of mineral opportunities owned by Asians.
The Company has agreed to grant incentive stock options on 330,340 shares of the Company exercisable
in whole or in part at a price of $1.77 on or before the expiration of two years from the date of grant.  The
grant of stock options is subject to the prior approval of the Vancouver Stock Exchange.

<DT>04/18/96<DD>The Company announced that a minimum 5,000 metre reverse circulation drill program has commenced on the Lilas Project in Costa Rica.  Anthian Resources has a 30% interest in the Project while Barrick Gold has a 70% interest.  The program followed a 1995 diamond drill program conducted by Barrick Gold Corporation which yielded encouraging gold values.  The 1995 drill program confirmed a large
mineralized system which is targeted by the 1996 drill program.

<DT>03/29/96<DD>The Company announced the completion of its private placement of 1,000,000 units at a price of $0.82 per unit.  The securities issued pursuant to the private placement are subject to a hold period expiring on March 14, 1997.

<DT>03/19/96<DD>The Company announced the resignation of Mr. Donald Currie as director of the Company.  Effective March 12, 1996, Mr.. Bruce Purcell has been appointed as a new director of the company.

<DT>03/05/96<DD>The Company reported that it has agreed to purchase an assignment of a 30% right, 
title and interest in and to 5 mineral concessions covering an area of 8,500 hectares of mineral lands located 
in the Province of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica from Orion Resources Inc., a private British Columbian Corporation.  The consideration due and payable for the mineral property interest is CDN$716,140 which amount is due and payable in cash of $100,000 and 489,000 common shares of Anthian to be issued at a deemed price of $1.26 per share.  In addition, Anthian has agreed to issue and allot to Orion, an additional 489,000 share purchase warrants exercisable in the first year at a price of $1.26 per share and in the second year at a price of $1.51.
<P>
The claims were originally acquired by Orion on April 15, 1994.  On April 22, 1995, Barrick Gold
Corporation received a right to earn a 70% interest in and to the claims by spending US$500,000 on the
claims.  To date, Barrick Gold has spent the sum of $536,835 on exploration and evaluation expenditures
on the claims and advised Orion that the results were sufficiently encouraging to continue the program in
1996 with an anticipated budget of US$500,000.  By virtue of the agreement entered into with Orion,
Anthian will be required to contribute 30% of the exploration budget.  The value placed on the interest
purchase was established in the evaluation report dated February 28, 1996 on the claims prepared by 
David R. Budinski, P. Geo. and Peter A. Christopher, Ph.D., P. Eng.

<DT>01/29/96<DD>The Company announced that it agreed to a $820,000 private placement of its securities which will consist of the sale of 1,000,000 units at $0.82 per unit.  Each unit consists of one common share and one two-year non-transferable share purchase warrant with each such share purchase warrant entitling the
holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company for $0.82 during the first year of the
warrant and for $0.94 during the second year of the warrant.  The proceeds from the private placement will be used for general working capital and to establish a reserve for the acquisition and exploration of resources properties.  In this regard, the Company currently has 4 separate properties under review.  Management believes it will be able to negotiate more favorable acquisitions terms if Anthian is in a strong cash position.

<DT>11/01/96<DD>Pursuant to a loan agreement dated  September  16  1996,  the  company  borrowed
$750,000  at  12%  interest  per  year  from  W.A.T. Capital Corp. As additional
consideration for this loan, the company agreed to a 20% bonus payable in cash.

<DT>10/11/96<DD>At the company's annual general meeting held October 10, 1996,  in  addition  to

<P>
<dt>09/16/96<dd>Mel Reeves, President & Director of Apex Resorts Corp., announces that the Company has 0arranged a loan of $750,000 secured by Promissory Note.   Proceeds are to be used for retirements of short term loans, trade payables, general working capital and funding of the litigation against the Province of British Columbia. In consideration of the above, the Company has granted the lender a maximum cash bonus allowable under Vancouver Stock Exchange Rules.

<DT>09/13/96<DD>At the company's upcoming AGM,  in  addition  to  routine  business,  management
proposes  to  seek shareholder approval to approve and authorize the issuance of shares by the company, from time to time in one or more transactions,  over  20% of  its  issued capital; to pass a special resolution to alter the memorandum of the company by consolidating the company's share capital, using a ratio of up to
ten  old  for  one  new;  to  consider  and, if deemed advisable, pass a special resolution to change  the  name  of  the  company  from  Apex  Resorts  Corp  to Consolidated Apex Resorts Corp.        
<P>                                         
Depending upon the consolidation ratio used, the  company  may  be  required  to obtain a written opinion prepared by a member of the exchange to the effect that the  proposed  consolidation  is  a  necessary  and  advisable   part   of   the reorganization of the company's affairs.
<P>
The provincial government and Apex Mountain Resort, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apex  Resorts  Corp,  have  agreed  and  have  received  court  approval  of the appointment of Arthur Anderson as  receiver-manager  of  Apex  Mountain  Resorts relating  to the assets comprising Apex Mountain Resort but excluding any rights
with respect to the company's lawsuit against the province arising  from  native roadblocks and related matters. 
<P>                                               
The appointment of a receiver-manager to operate the ski hill, offers  the  best opportunity  for an economically viable ski operation that will provide jobs and other economic benefits to the people of the South Okanagan region.      
<P>       
The appointment of a receiver-manager  will  ensure  that  Apex  Ski  hill  will operate this season, and provide the stability needed for the ski resort. In the face of road access problems, the province has joined the company's view of  the value and importance of the ski resort to the economy of the Penticton community
and the South Okanagan region.   
<P>                                               
The order appointing the receiver-manager expressly allows the Apex companies to carry  on  with  the  lawsuit  against  the  province for damages resulting from blockades and related activities over the years.         
<P>                       
The company consented to the appointment of the receiver-manager due to  amongst other  things,  the  continued threats of native landblocks on the Apex Mountain Resort access roads. Such action has caused millions of dollars in losses to the company  over each of the last few years. The province has agreed to finance the costs of operating Apex Mountain Resort through the receiver-manager.  The company retains the right to bid on the Apex Mountain  Resort  asset  should the province be successful in resolving the Green Mountain Road dispute.      
<P>  
Apex Resort Corp, as a result of this settlement, will  be  freed  up  from  the guarantee  and  is  allowed  to  reorganize  and  pursue  its  claim against the province. If the lawsuit against the province is successful, the  province  will be  able  to set off any money owing under the debt before being required to pay
any funds over to Apex Resort Corp.

<DT>09/06/96<DD>The provincial government, Apex  Resort  Corp  and  Apex  Mountain  Resort  have
jointly  agreed  to  adjourn their court hearing scheduled for September 6 until September 12.     
<P>                                                              
The adjournment is to enable parties  to  finalize  an  agreement  appointing  a receiver/manager for the Apex Ski Resort which is owned by Apex Mountain Resort. This agreement will provide stability to local  business  and  ensure  that  the South  Okanagan region can rely on the operation of the resort during the coming
ski season.

<DT>08/22/96<DD>The company has withdrawn  its  brokered  private  placement  and  will  not  be
proceeding with its application.

<DT>08/20/96<DD>The company has made a mutual agreement with Holiday Inns Worldwide to terminate
the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort franchise with respect to the hotel, immediately without any cost to the company. This agreement has  been  brought  about  as  a result  of  the  failure  of  the  province  of  British Columbia to approve the company's  restructuring  and  settlement  proposal  thereby   restricting   the company's  ability  to  raise  capital.  Two  of  the  franchise's requirements, construction of a new food and beverage facility and a swimming pool both  being part  of  or  attached  to  the hotel, are now not possible within required time
frames.
<P>
This change reflects the view that Apex Mountain Resort  is  a  regional  resort serving  the  South Okanagan and will save the company an estimated $78,623 over the next twelve months.       
<P>                                                 
InnVentures,  one  of  Canada's  leading  hotel  resort  management   companies, continues  to operate the hotel in the normal course on a reduced staffing level until September 3 1996 when the resort will  close  until  the  opening  of  ski season on November 28 1996 as previously planned.
<P>
<DT>08/1/96<DD>The company has received a notice of intention to enforce security from Greyback
Construction  with  respect  to  first mortgages on 15 strata lots owned by Apex Mountain Resort in the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort. The amount due on the  first mortgage  is  $430,543  as of August 8 1996 together with a per diem interest of $115. The 15 strata lots are currently listed for sale at $1,613,600.  
<P>         
The company has given notice to Jordan Ventures and the VSE that  all  documents with  respect to a brokered private placement in an amount of $625,000 announced by the company on May 3 1996 have been returned to the respective  parties  and  the brokered private placement has been cancelled.   
<P>                              
Both of the foregoing actions were caused by the failure of the province  of  BC to  accept  the company's settlement agreement which involved: full repayment of the debt together with interest owed to the Bank of Montreal and assigned to the province;  and  a  release  of  the  company's  $125,000,000 lawsuit against the
province.  
<P>                                                                     
A total of 2,800 applications for season's passes  have  been  received,  a  60% increase over last year's total (1,750).  The company has reduced its employees to a nominal level to protect its  assets, operate  the  hotel  to  September  3  1996 and fulfill Kids Camp obligations to September 3 1996. The company plans to re-open Apex Mountain Resort on  November 28 1996 for the coming ski season.   
<P>                                          
Mr Reeves also reports, <BR>      
<P>                                                   
The company would like to respond to Mr Dan Miller's, Deputy Premier,  statement yesterday  to  the  media  in Penticton, that the company was not prepared to go forward with the Supreme Court hearing on August 15 and 16 1996 and requested  a delay.
<P>                                                                          
These statements are absolutely not true.  The  company  has  always  wanted  to proceed  with  the  Supreme  Court  hearing  as  soon as possible and it was the Attorney General's department who was not prepared for the August 15 and 16 1996 date.  The  Attorney  General's department requested a delay of the hearing date
and when the company refused to agree and pressed on for the hearing  on  August 15  and 16, the Attorney General's department threatened to invoke a cause in an earlier agreement requiring both parties consent to court dates.  Reluctantly at the request of the Attorney General's department the company  was
forced  to  agree  to  a  postponement. The company continues to press on for as early a court date as possible. 
<P>                                                
The company has received the approval of Arthur Andersen and the province of  BC to the release of the Arthur Andersen report on the Apex Group of Companies.   For complete highlights of the Arthur Anderson report please call the company. 
<P>
Apex Mountain Resort has  committed  to  its  shareholders,  employees  and  the community  if it is successful in defeating the province of BC's application for appointment of a receiver-manager to operate Apex Resort for the 1996/97  winter ski season.  
<P>                                                                   
Apex Mountain Resort has guaranteed the Apex Resort  operation.  Mr  Dan  Miler, deputy  premier,  his staff and Arthur Anderson have been repeatedly refused (as late as yesterday in Penticton) to guarantee the operation of Apex  Resort  this winter ski season.    
<P>                                                         
The company knows of no other party prepared to guarantee the operation of  Apex Resort  for  this  winter  season.  The  resort  supports  its employees and the community in their continuing effort obtain the province of BC's  commitment  to operate Apex Resort this winter ski season. 
<P>
The company continues to request release of the reasons and cabinet  minutes  to determine  the  province's  rationale  for  turning down the proposed settlement agreement which would have allowed Apex  to  continue  operation  with  a  sound business plan and release the province from the company's $125,000,000 lawsuit.
<P>
<dt>08/12/96<dd>The company was scheduled to appear in court with The Provincial  Government  on
August 15/16 to hear their case as previously reported. The company has now been asked for an adjournment to early September as  the  Provincial  Government  are unable to proceed with the earlier scheduled court date.   The company continues to press on for the early resolution  and  court  date  to avoid  the  uncertainties  this  action  has  caused  the company, shareholders, employees, and citizens of the South Okanagan.                                  

<DT>08/07/96<DD>The BC government has made good on its threat to call in  its  $8.5  million  of
loans  made  to  Apex  Mountain Resort and Apex Resorts Corp. The NDP government initiated a legal default claim in a statement of claim filed Friday in  the  BC Supreme  Court.  The  suit  seeks  an order for the appointment of a receiver or receiver-manager for the ski resort property. In the  $8.6  million  foreclosure
proceeding,  the government also seeks an order allowing it to show the property to any potential buyers from 9 am to 7 pm, Monday to Friday. The suit  covers  a $500,000  loan  made  by  the  Bank  of  Montreal  in 1989 and guaranteed by the provincial government in 1994, and  a  series  of  demand  loans  and  mortgages
totalling  $8  million, made in 1994 and 1995. The government declared the loans due last December, and ended unsuccessful repayment negotiations last month.

<DT>08/07/96<DD>The company was served with a writ of summons and  statement  of  claim  by  the
Ministry of Attorney General. The writ of summons names a number of defendants.  The  statement  of  claim  alleges  that,  because  the  Crown  guaranteed   the indebtedness  of  Apex  Mountain  Resorts  to the Bank of Montreal, the Crown is legally entitled to exercise all remedies which the bank  might  otherwise  have
had  in  collecting  this  indebtedness,  had  the bank not acted on the Crown's guarantee. In short, it is argued that the indebtedness of Apex Mountain  Resort has  been  assigned  by  the  bank  to the Crown. The indebtedness is alleged to amount to approximately $8,616,225 (the unpaid principal of all indebtedness  of
Apex Mountain Resorts) and accrued interest.                                    

<DT>08/06/96<DD>As a result of the continued failure of the premier and the government to honour
their  commitments  starting  with the guarantee of free unimpeded access to the resort, the company must announce these survival measures.   
<P>
<OL>                   
<LI>1. Continued operation of the Sunspree Holiday Inn Hotel until September 3  1996
with  a  minimum  number  of  employees  and  closure until November 28 1996. 
<LI>2.Effective immediately the company president, Mr Fraser Martin, will oversee  the
operations  of the resort. Also due to the request of the board of directors, Mr
Gary Gierlich will be taking a leave of absence until August 19 1996.           
<LI>3. The closure of Apex Mountain Resort effective immediately and  the  reduction
in  employees  from  70  to  12  in order to protect the assets and continue the
company's season's pass drive until the ski season  re-opening  on  November  28
1996.

appointment  of a receiver-manager on August 15 and 16 1996 in the Supreme Court
of BC in Vancouver, BC.

<P>

<DT>07/29/96<DD>Directors and management of the company are shocked and dismayed by  the  recent
irresponsible  and  malicious  response  from  the  provincial government to the resort's continuing financial dilemma. The company's financial woes are a direct result  of  illegal  Indian  roadblocks in November and December of 1994 and the continuing threats of further roadblocks as recent as two weeks ago.  For the complete news release of July 29, 1996 - please review the Special Report under <a href="../stockTALK/spr730.html">July 30th</A> re: <B>Apex Resorts and What Could Happen Next ?</B>

<DT>07/26/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing a loan agreement dated June 4 1996  between  the
company  and  Mitchell M. Paul whereby Mr. Paul has loaned the company $150,000. 

<DT>07/22/96<DD>The company was informed July 19 that the proposed settlement agreement, which  would  have  released  the company's $125,000,000 lawsuit against the province of BC was rejected by the provincial  cabinet  after  being passed on by the treasury board.
<P>                                                
The decision of the provincial cabinet appears to be  politically  motivated  as the  agreement  was supported by senior government officials, recommended by the government's consultant Arthur Anderson and signed  by  
Mr  Dan  Miller,  Deputy Premier to go forward to the treasury board.
<P>                                    
Although the company is disappointed, it will be proceeding with its lawsuit.   Mr Reeves also reports, the
Company received demand for payment of the  total  amount  of  Apex  Resorts Corporation and Apex Mountain Resort's indebtedness to the Bank of Montreal from the province of BC.                                                             
<P>
The province has notified the company of its intention to file  their  writ  and statement  of  claim on August 2 1996, along with their notice of motion for the court appointment of a receiver-manager with  the  motion  returnable  August  8, 1996.
<P>                                                                           
The company has instructed its legal  council  to  vigorously  defend  all  such aforementioned  action  by  the  province  and  to  proceed  with  the company's $125,000,000 claim against the province.

<DT>05/13/96<DD>The leaders of the three major political parties in BC, the Liberal  Party,  the
New  Democratic  Party, and the Reform Party, all have made statements that road blocks are not acceptable 
in BC. This supports the position of the  province  of BC  which  has  obtained  an injunction from the Supreme Court of BC restricting blockades and ensuring access on the Green Mountain road which leads to the Apex resort from Penticton, BC.  
<P>                                                    
Such a guarantee from the province of BC clears the way for Apex Resorts to open its  summer  season  on  June  21  and proceed to the next ski season with great anticipation of a record year ahead.
<P>                                            
The company is also pleased to announce commencement of  a  capital  expenditure program  during  the  summer  of  1996  to further enhance Apex Resorts. Further capital expenditures, including enhanced 
snow-making capability to  the  top  of the  mountain, are dependent on approval of the government of the province of BC of the company's draft financial reorganization plan.

<DT>05/02/96<DD>The company has executed a draft  non-legally  binding  agreement  to effect  a
reorganization  on  normal  commercial  terms  of  the  Bank of Montreal loan as assigned to the Province 
of British Columbia and  a  release  of  the  company's lawsuit against the Province of British Columbia.                               

The draft restructuring requires the decision of government. Due to  the  timing of  the  provincial  election 
the parties have agreed to a 90 day extension from today.                                                                          

The company believes the proposed settlement agreement is in the best  interests of  all the parties involved. The government decision if favorable will allow us to undertake the following prior to next winter 
season: a summer opening of  our resort  to  service  the  south Okanagan convention and tourism trade, implement capital expenditures  totaling  $650,000  including  snow  making  equipment  to protect  our  resort  from nature's inevitable bad snow years; both resulting in substantial employment and enhancement 
of our resort.

Following on this joint venture for the retail and ski rental operations and the earlier  appointment  
of InnVentures Hospitality as managers of the Apex Holiday Inn  Sunspree  Resort  effective  
March  1  1996,  the  company   is   currently entertaining  joint  venture  proposals  for its food

<DT>02/28/96<DD>The company reports that the provincial government has entered into 
negotiations with  the  company  with respect  to  the  debt of approximately $8,250,000 owing 
to the Bank of Montreal and assigned to the province.  Resolution of the lawsuit commenced by 
the company against  the  province;  and  settlement  of the company's outstanding claim for
direct losses resulting from roadblocks is continuing.  Further details of  these  negotiations
are expected within the next month.                                             
<P>
Effective March 1 1996, Inn Ventures Hospitality will assume management  of  the
Apex  Holiday  Inn  Sunspree Resort. Negotiations are under way to joint venture
the retail, ski rental and ski school operations and are  expected  to  generate
$300,000  to the company. As part of the restructure, the company has decided to
relocate the Penticton office and re-evaluate operations both to meet new  joint
venture  philosophy  which will substantially reduce operational costs. Recently
the company retained Penticton's largest real  estate  broker,  Realty  World  -
Locations  West,  to  aggressively  market the 17 remaining condominiums and two
single family lots to realize in excess  of  $1,500,000.  The  company  is  also
entertaining  joint venture proposals with respect to the further development of
the resort's real estate assets which include substantial land holdings.        
<P>                                   
<B>The company  negotiations  with  the  province  of  BC  are  anticipated  to  be
completely resolved by the end of April 1996.</B>

<DT>02/20/96<DD>On December 22 1994, directors and employees  were  granted  
options  on  65,000 shares at $0.15 (renegotiated price) expiring December 22 1996.

<DT>02/07/96<DD>On January 24 1996 directors and  employees  were  granted  options  
on  952,383 shares at $0.15, expiring January 30 1998.

<DT>01/25/96<DD>Company officials report that Apex Mountain Resort near  
Penticton  is  beginning  to  reap the  benefits  of modifications  introduced  in 
spring 1995. When compared to the same period last year, December reports show, 
even though skier visits were down 16% because  the resort  opened  later  than  
last year, revenues are up 11% compared to December 1994. Expenses are down 
by 20% over this time period.         
<P>
Net income for December is up  nearly  100%  over  December  figures  from  last
season.  This  increase  is due to a substantial number of repeat customers from
last winter and a more realistic pricing structure for the resort product.      
Also adding to the bottom line performance of Apex Mountain Resort is  the  fact
that, from day one of the 1995/96 ski season, it has experienced the best skiing
conditions in its 35 year history and continues to offer some of the best skiing
conditions, not only in BC but the entire Pacific Northwest.                    

<DT>01/24/96<DD>As of January 3,1996 directors and employees were granted options on 
722,700 shares at $ 0.15, expiring January 3, 1998.

<DT>01/23/96<DD>The company is pleased to report that ski volumes continue strong despite
last  year's threats  of  aggressive  road closure.  Recently, the Supreme Court of BC upheld 
the  Province  of  BC  injunction  with respect  to  preventing  interference  with  the  access  
roads  to  the resort. Tremendous ski conditions and unimpeded access point towards a strong 
season for the company.  While the company maintains its legal rights in its action against the  
Province of  BC with respect to prior year road closures, management has entered into 
negotiations with developers for the development of additional housing stock  to further 
enhance the resort.  Management is actively pursuing the sale  of  the  unsold  condominiums  
in  the Holiday  Inn  Sunspree  Resort and expects to generate funds for working capital and 
debt reduction.  The company is looking for a strong finish to the ski  season  and  preparations 
are underway for its summer program.                                            

<DT>01/18/96<DD> The VSE has accepted for filing the issuance  of  961,255  shares  
at  $0.15  to settle outstanding debt.

<DT>11/24/95<DD>The <B><EM>Vancouver Sun</EM></B> carried a Canadian Press dispatch in
its November 24, 1995 edition, that reported that the Penticton Indian
Band is threatening to disrupt traffic flow to Apex Apline's ski resort
again. It was reported that the band may put road checks on Green
Mountain Road as early as next week, without waiting for the conclusion
of a court case due to begin on November 27, 1995.  Band representative,
Mr. Stewart Phillip originally said that the band would leave the road
to the Apex ski resort alone until after the court case.  After meetings
this week among members of the Penticton and Upper and Lower Similkameen
Bands, Mr. Phillip said that natives might take direct action soon.  He
said that the natives may begin checks or roadblocks if they feel the
case is going against them.  Band members blocked the road last November
over concerns about the environmental impact of a $20 million expansion
at Apex.

<DT>11/23/95<DD>The Company reported that due to the warm weather, the
opening of the Apex Resort for the 1995/1996 ski season has been
postponed.  Apex Resort will open the weekend of December 2, 1995.

<DT>11/21/95<DD>Mr. Fraser Martin has tendered his resignation as
President and Director.  Ms Valerie McInnes is to be appointed on an
interim basis in his stead to fill the vacancy caused by the
resignation. Mr. Fraser Martin will remain as an officer and employee of
the company's operating subsidiaries. The <B><EM>Vancouver Sun</EM></B> reported in its
November 21, 1995 edition that Fraser Martin has been asked by the
Vancouver Stock Exchange to resign as President of Apex Resorts and to
leave the boards of Empyrean Diagnostics and three other VSE-listed
companies for disclosure violations.  Mr. Martin's Apex exit could prove
embarrassing to the BC government which has provided $8 million in loan
guarantees for Apex's ski resort development near Pencticton.

<DT>11/14/95<DD>The Vancouver Sun reported in its November 14, 1995
edition that the native dispute over the road to the Apex ski resort
failed to deter skiers on the opening weekend.  Reporter Stewart Bell
said about 1,500 skiers hit the slopes at Apex Mountain near Penticton
this past weekend, despite the simmering road dispute.  The Penticton
Indian Band, however, warned that it may not continue to allow traffice
pass unimpeded.  Councillor Stewart Phillip says his band and two
neighbouring bands are meeting in the community hall on the reserve
Thursday, November 16, 1995 to decide what to do next.  He said there
may be more currency coming out of the meeting.  When asked if this
might mean an escalation of the native protest, he said there could be.
Apex general manager, Brian Rhodes said that the skiers were allowed to
pass freely, but protestors dressed in US Army fatigues stood watch at
the band's so-called checkpoint.

<DT>11/10/95<DD>The Company reported that it had entered into a loan
agreement with a lender for interim bridge financing in the amount of
$100,000 with interest at 9% per annum plus a bonus of the maximum
number of shares permitted to be granted to the lender under the
policies of the Vancouver Stock Exchange. Directors and employees have
been granted options on 676,571 shares at $0.19 expiring November 2,
1997.
<P>
The Vancouver Sun reported in its November 10, 1995 edition that the
continuing dispute over who owns the road into Penticton's Apex ski
resort took another turn on November 9, 1995 as Apex Resorts launched a
suit against the provincial government.  Apex claimed the government
failed to safeguard public access to the area.  Earlier this week,
members of the Penticton Indian Band donned US Army surplus fatigues and
kerchiefs as they waited in roadside bunkers and threatened to use force
in defence of the road to which the band claims ownership.  Last year,
the band mounted a five-week blockade that Apex claims resulted in
direct and indirect losses of $4.5 million.  President Fraser Martin
says Apex's suit, claiming unspecified damages, is based on lost
revenues and on its lost potential to do business on land the resort
bought from the government 35 years ago.  He said that investor
confidence had now completely disappeared.
<P>
The Province  reported in its November 10, 1995 edition that Apex
Resorts is suing the BC government for more than $14 million for
business losses due to native blockades on Green Mountain Road near
Penticton.  Reporter Ian Austin said that President Fraser Martin
claimed Apex has invested $14 million in the resort, but a five-week
blockade last November crippled business. He said the suit, filed on
November 9, 1995 before a press conference, will be for considerably
more than $14 million.  He said that it will include lost business
opportunities and loss of sales, and loss of sales on the stock market.
Mr. Martin said that Apex's lawyers claim it has a very good case, but
he hopes to settle the affair out of court.  He said the last straw came
last week, when the government failed to give $2 million in loan
guarantees, after giving $8 million in guarantees last season.  NDP MLA
Jim Beattie said the government has been trying to settle the dispute.

<DT>11/09/95<DD>Mr. Fraser Martin reported that on November 9, 1995, the
Company has recommended action against the government of BC in the Supreme
Court of BC for: Damages for breach of contract and loss in value of Apex's
properties as a result of the failure of the government to maintain and keep
open, safe access to Apex Mountain; Damages for negligent misrepresentation
wherein the government misrepresented it would maintain access to Apex
Mountain and as a result of that representation the Company has invested in
excess of $14 million and is seeking repayment of those funds; A declaration
that the government is estopped from claiming indemnity from Apex for any
obiligations under the monies advanced by the government through the Bank of
Montreal. The current situation has left the Company with no choice but to
seek redress from the courts.  The Company has effectively been denied safe
and continued access to its property.  Its assets and their value have been
materially affected as a result of the government's inability to deal with
the situation.  The safety of its guests and employees have been put at risk
and the current debt structure leaves the Company little, if any, ability to
operate.  The Company has spent substantial sums of money attempting to
resolve this issue but the positions taken by the various parties and the
resources available to them has put the Company at a severe disadvantage. 
The Company is ready, willing and able to negotiate a resolution to this
situation but the reponsible parties must take into account the damages
suffered by the Company to date and the future viability of the resort.

<DT>11/08/95<DD>The Company reported that Apex Moutain Resort will open for
limited skiing on November 11, 1995 and remain open through November 13,
1995.  This is the earliest ski season opening in the resort's 35 year
history and has been made possible by the considerable snowfalls of the past
few days.  The hotel will not open until November 23, 1995.

<DT>11/07/95<DD>The Company has completed its non-brokered private
placement of 230,533 units at $0.235 per unit with each unit consisting
of one share and one warrant entitling the holder to purchase an
additional share at $0.235 for one year.

<DT>11/06/95<DD>The <B><EM>Province</EM></B> in its Sunday November 5, 1995 edition,
reported that Apex Resort owners vow they will open the ski area later
this month despite the threat of Indian blockades and the refusal of
government financial backing.  Journalist Ian Austin reported that Apex
president, Fraser Martin said that Apex has close to 2,000 season ticket
holders and will be able to open the resort.  He made the comment after
learning that the BC government turned down his request for $2 million
in loan guarantees.  Mr. Martin said that the officials had a year to
resolve the road blockade problem and they have done nothing.  He said
that the NDP government seemed incapable of resolving this situation, or
any other situation.  NDP MLA Jim Beattie said that Apex is a private
concern and it must find private capital.

<DT>11/06/95<DD>The Company reported that the BC provincial government
did not approve the Company's request for an additional $2 million in
financing assistance.  The request had been made in early September and
at that time government officials committed to respond no later than
October 31, 1995.  The government did not respond until November 3, 1995
that it has decided not to continue its support for the Company. Only
after getting written assurance from Premier Mike Harcourt in September
1993 that his government would not allow this type of blockading to
happen did the Company make the decision to proceed with its $20 million
expansion program.  The provincial government also saw fit to provide
the land base necessary for this development, has issued all required
permits for this development and has reaped the benefits of its tax base
since 1960.  It would only be natural to assume that the government
should also uphold the laws that are already in place which guarantee
the freedom of travel in this province.  For that reason, the Company is
entitled to compensation from the provincial government and if necessary
will seek a settlement in the courts.  The loan guarantees were
originally requested from the provincial government to partially replace
substantial financing mechanisms already secured and set to close just
prior to disruption of business created by the blockading of the resort
access roads for five weeks in November and December 1994.  Because of
the government's inability to resolve the road access issue the Company
has been unable to attract interest in real estate development and sales
of condominimum units in its Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort Hotel came to
an abrupt halt.  The Company's shares remain at an all time low when in
fact they should be trading at a much higher level of confidence
considering the scope of development at the resort and the record number
of visitors who showed their confidence in the past year.  The directors
wish to stress that although this unfortunate situation has been imposed
on the Company by the inability of the government to deal with this
illegal situation and continued road closure threats, they will continue
to strive to ensure that the resort will open as scheduled on November
23, 1995.

<DT>11/03/95<DD>The <B><EM>Vancouver Sun</EM></B> carried a Canadian Press dispatch in
its Friday November 3, 1995 edition that reported that the BC government
will intervene if access to the Apex ski resort becomes a public safety
issue.  Both the Penticton Indian Band and the government will go to
court to have the issue dealt with either through a summary trial or an
interim injunction.  Parts of the Green Mountain access road run through
reserve land where Indians dressed in fatigues have dug foxholes and
bunkers.  The Indians blocked access to the ski area early last winter
in a bid for another environmental review of the resort's $20 million
expansion.  The natives claim the expansion will affect land they claim
as their own.

<DT>10/30/95<DD><B><EM>The Province</EM></B> reported in its Sunday October 29 edition that
Penticton natives have built two bunkers above a disputed road in
anticipation of a showdown with the provincial government. Reporter Roberta
Staley says Apex ski resort president Fraser Martin fears the bunkers
indicate the band is preparing for battle.  He says it is going to be
another Gustafsen Lake, the month-long armed standoff in the Cariboo and
says it is very intimidating and quite frightening.  Mr. Martin say it is
psychological warfare and several of his 250-member staff quit last year due
to stress over the dispute.  The resort, which boasts 56 runs and is set to
open November 23, is undergoing a $20 million expansion on land that natives
claim is theirs.  Joan Phillip of the band says the bunkers were built in
case new checkpoints are needed.

applied towards the Company's general working capital.

<DT>10/23/95<DD><B><EM>The Province</EM></B> carried a Canadian Press dispatch in its Sunday
October 22 edition that members of the Penticton Indian band have beefed up
their roadside presence on the disputed Green Mountain Road. CP reported
that about 25 band members were on the site of last year's checkpoint on the
road leading to Apex ski resort on Friday.  Natives blocked the road for
several weeks last fall, preventing construction crews from working on a $20
million resort expansion. Band spokesman Stewart Phillip says the current
work gathering is in preparation, if necessary, to re-establish checkpoints. 
No attempts were made to stop traffic going through.  The provincial
government says it will apply for an immediate injunction if the road is
blocked.  Victoria has filed a writ claiming public access rights and
ownership of the road and others in the region.

<DT>10/20/95<DD><B><EM>CBC Radio</EM></B> reported in an early morning Vancouver broadcast
that the Penticton Indian Band will take its time to respond to a court
action by the provincial government seeking to block renewed native
blockades of roads leading to the Apex ski resort.  Spokesman Stewart
Phillip says the band will take until next week to consider its options.  He
says for now, members will continue with the band's preliminary preparations
for renewed action.  Mr. Phillip says the band will not be on the road per
se, stopping traffic, until it decides what to do.  <B><EM>CBC</EM></B> reports the
government says it will seek an interim injunction if any roadblocks are
erected.

<DT>10/19/95<DD><B><EM>The Vancouver Sun</EM></B> carried a Canadian Press dispatch in its
Thursday October 19 edition that reported that the B.C. government is
seeking a court injunction to prevent interference with public access and
maintenance work on roads through the Penticton Indian reserve leading to
the Apex ski resort.  CP says the province maintains the roads are public,
but the Penticton band claims they are private.  Native Indians blocked the
main road last fall to protest against an expansion project at Apex, saying
they had not been sufficiently consulted on the plan's environmental impact. 
A year of negotiations has failed to reach a compromise.  This fall, the
Penticton band told the government that native Indians will take over road
maintenance and snow clearing work on the roads.

<DT>10/18/95<DD>The Company reported that the Province of B.C. deemed that
the section of the road which passes through the Penticton Indian Band
Reserve is a public access road.  This section of the road, which has been
in dispute between the province of B.C. and the Penticton Indian Band is
part of one of the public access roads leading to the Company's resort
property, Apex Resort.  The province's position is that the road is a public
access road, under the jurisdiction of the province, over which the
travelling public has a right to expect unimpeded and safe access.  Further,
the province's jurisdiction includes the right and duty to maintain the road
to ensure safe access for the travelling public.  Due to the lack of
progress in resolving the dispute with the Penticton Indian band, the
provincal cabinet will be meeting on October 25, 1995 to review the
Company's request for $2 million, which will be advanced other than by way
of debt financing.  Two deputy ministers and senior finance directors of the
government have made a commitment to the directors of the Company that the
government will, by January 1996, deal with the issue of compensation and
existing debt conversion in the form of preferred equity shares or some
other mutually agreed upon security.  The Company plans to open its resort
property, weather permitting, for skiing in late November.

provincial government offer of $1.3 million for control of the road to Apex
Ski Resort. Band negotiator, Rory Morahan said that the roads are not for
sale.  The Penticton and Upper and Lower Silmilkameen bands blocked
construction vehicles to the resort last year because they said a planned
$20 million development threatens the environment.  The natives lifted the
blockade when the government agreed to negotiate.  The BC government wants
jurisdiction over the road so provincial laws can be applied.

<DT>08/21/95<DD><B><EM>The Saturday Okanagan</EM></B> reported in its August
19, 1995 edition that Apex Resort is on the verge of clearing its biggest
environmental hurdle in the dispute with South Okanagan Indian bands.  The
looming water license approval already has the Penticton, Upper and Lower
Similkameen Bands crying foul and threatening legal action.  Apex Resorts
expects to get a license to remove water from Nickle Plate Lake soon.  The
resort needs the water to boost its snowmaking operations during the ski
season.

discount attached thereto, exerciseable for a period of two years.

<DT>07/31/95<DD>The Company announced certain changes to its Vacation Bonus
program.  Effective August 1, 1995, to qualify for the Vacation Bonus
program, a shareholder must own a minimum of 20,000 shares of the Company;
hold the shares a minimum of consecutive six months; and the shares must be
registered in the shareholders name and their names must appear on the
Company's shareholders list as prepared by its transfer agent.  All
shareholders qualifying for the Vacation Bonus may apply for a season ski
pass or one 3 day/3 night mid-week ski vacation, at no charge.  For those
shareholders who hold less than the required 20,000 shares, they may apply
for the Vacation Bonus on a pro-rata basis.  The increase in the minimum
number of shares for the Vacation Bonus, which was implemented a year ago,
was a result of the decrease in share cost from $2.00 a year ago to below
$0.40 today.  The decrease in share value and lack of activity in its shares
are a result of the ongoing activity by the Pentiction Indian Band, Lower
Similkameen Band and Upper Similkameen Band.

<DT>07/19/95<DD>The Company announced that it has entered into a brokered
private placement with Canaccord Capital Corporation for the placement of

agreement with a lender for interim bridge financing in the amount of
$200,000 with interest thereon at a rate of 10% per annum plus a bonus of
the maximum number of shares permitted to be granted to the Lender under the
policies of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, subject to regulatory approval. 
The Company also announced that, subject to regulatory approval, it has
granted Incentive Stock Options to directors and employees of the Company in
the aggregate amount of 593,567 common shares at a price of $0.24 per share,
being the average 10 day closing price of the company's shares on the
Vancouver Stock Exchange, less the applicable commercial industrial Company
discount thereto, exercisable for a period of two years.  The Company also
amended incentive stock option to previously granted employees and directors
in the aggregate amount of 115,000 shares from an exercise price of $0.65
per share to $0.24 per share.

<DT>05/25/95<DD>Apex Resorts Corporation's management and directors were
pleased to announce that negotiations have been finalized and the provincial
government has increased its loan guarantees to the Company by an additional
$3 million.  This was announced on May 5, 1995 by Small Business, Tourism
and Culture Minister, Bill Barlee and brings the total of the loans
guaranteed by the provincial government of $8 million.  These loan
guarantees have helped to partially replace funding that were already in
place and set to close just prior to disruption of business created by the
blockading of all access roads leading to the resort for 5 weeks in November
and December 1994.  Despite the earlier problems created by the untimely
road closures, the resort experienced the best ski season in its history and
was able to surpass the previous years ski visits of 70,000 by more than
47,000, for a total of 117,000 ski visits, an increase of 67%. Selective
logging of the ski runs has been completed and a portion of the timber taken
will be used to construct the previously announced horse-barn and corrals. 
Work has also started on a majore upgrade to the resort's electrical system
and the installation of the previously announced snow making system which
will make possible snow making to the top of the mountain.  With this
addition to their snow making system, the resort will be able to open at
least two weeks earlier.

<DT>05/18/95<DD>The Company announced that the closing of the brokered
private of special warrants has been delayed in order to facilitate the time
required for the preparation and filing of the consents and other agreements
to reflect the additional $3 million loan to be guaranteed by the Province
of British Columbia.  In order to obtain this additional loan, the Company
agreed to reduce the number of special warrants from 1,568 to 568 special
warrants for an aggregate face value of $568,000 to which the additional $3
million will be subordinated.  The 1,000 special warrants which were
eliminated from the said private placement were to be subscribed through a
conversion of a portion of an existing demand convertible debenture granted
by the Company on May 9, 1994.  This demand convertible debenture will now
remain in its original form and remaining principal amount.

$250,000 with interest at a rate of 11% per annum plus a bonus of the
maximum number of shares permitted to be granted to the lender.  The Company
also announced that it had completed a brokered private placement in the
amount of 2,175,000 units at a price of $0.225 per unit, each unit
consisting of one common share and one share purchase warrant entitling the
holder thereof to purchase an additional common share at $0.25 for a period
of one year.  The Company also proposed to complete a non-brokered private
placement of 1,000,000 units and a brokered private placement of 1,500,000
units, each at $0.20 per unit, each unit consisting of one common share and
one share purchase warrant which entitles the holder to purchase one
additional common share at $0.20 per share for a period of one year.  The
Company also entered into a brokered private placement with Canaccord
Capital Corporation for the placement of 585,000 units at a price of $0.225
per unit and a non-brokered private placement in the amount of 2,225,000
units at the price of $0.225 per unit. On June 5, 1995, the Company
announced that it had entered into loan agreement with a lender for interim
bridge financing in the amount of $200,000 with interest thereon at a rate
of 10% per annum plus a bonus of the maximum number of shares permitted to
be granted to the Lender.  The proceeds of the private placements and the
bridge loans will be used for general working capital purposes.
<P>
The Company also granted various Incentive Stock Options to directors and
employees of the Company at prices, being the average 10 day closing price
of the Company's shares on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, less the applicable
commercial industrial Company discount attached thereof.
<P>
On May 25, 1995, the management and directors of the Company announced that
negotiations with the BC Government were finalized with Apex Resorts
receiving a total of the loans guaranteed to $8 million, an additional $3
million.  These loan guarantees have helped to partially replace fundings
that were already in place and set to close just prior to disruption of
business created by the blockading of all access roads leading to the resort
for five weeks in November and December 1994.  Despite the disruption, the
resort experienced the best ski season in its history.
<P>
Work has also started on a major upgrade to the resorts electrical system
and the installation of the snow making system.  Selective logging of the
ski runs have been completed and a portion of the timber taken will be used
to construct the previously announced horse barn and corrals.

<P>
Apex Resorts Corporation was incorporated in 1984 as Trumark Resources Corp.
and after 2 other name changes became Apex Resorts Corporation in 1993 with
the acquisition of Apex Resort which has a 34 year operating history.
<P>
Apex Resorts Corporation is in the business of developing four season,
recreational, resort playgrounds to free the mind and rekindle the spirit. 
The Company already has a complete and detailed Master Plan in place for
their first acquisition, Apex Mountain Resort.  Apex Resort is a mountain
resort offering skiing and other recreational leisure activities in the
Okanagan Valley, located 20 miles west of Penticton, British Columbia, 240
miles northeast of Vancouver and 40 miles north of the Canada/USA border. 
Apex Mountain Resort is the Corporation's first acquisition.  As the first
phase of the expansion is now complete, intentions are to use this project
as a model for future resort acquisitions.  Management believes that it is
possible to assemble a group of resorts by acquiring similar undervalued
four season resorts which require capitalization in order to yield
significant long-term appreciation potential..
<P>
Apex Resort has an expanding village with a complement of ancillary
facilities, including restaurants, lounges, ski school, retail and rental
ski shop, day lodge, grocery/liquor store and child ski centre.  The
mountain offers 550 acres of skiable terrain and a maximum lift capacity of
4800 skiers per day.  There are four lifts (including the new high speed
quad) and 56 ski trails.  In addition, there are 12 kilometres of
cross-country trails and a 1 kilometre night-lit cross country loop.  Apex
also contains 6 condominium complexes, including a 90 room (47 strata condo
units) Holiday Inn Sun Spree Resort, bringing a total of 240 townhouses and
condominium units within walking/skiing distance of lifts and facilities. 
In addition, there are 165 single family homes and 125 lots slated for
development.  The Company estimates its real estate development values at
between $30 - 50 million when compared to other resorts in the region.
<P>
Due to market conditions, proximity and development rights, Apex Mountain
Resort offers an exciting opportunity.  Similar to the larger
Whistler/Blackcombe resort, Apex is now showing signs of the potential to be
realised in a destination four season mountain resort.  An aggressive team
of management professionals has been assembled to achieve dynamic changes at
Apex Mountain Resort. Specific 1994/95 objectives include 40% increase in
season passholder base; 70% increase in overall skier visits; 100% increase
in destination skier visits; sell-out of Holiday Inn strata hotel
development; $30,000,000 market capitalization; dual stock market listing;
establish four season product; construct summer facilities including a guest
ranch and a positive cash flow
<P>
With the winter product development well underway and an additional $9
million expansion planned, Apex is now focussing on facility utilization
during the remaining three seasons of the year.  A western guest ranch
featuring horseback riding, lessons, tennis, mountain bike riding and hiking
will be built to attract year round visitors.  Spring, summer and fall
represent exciting business opportunities and strong, four season activity
at Apex will stimulate real estate sales and visits, increase property
values and maintain a vibrant economy in a spectacular mountain setting.
<P>

<DL>
<DT>10/09/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation  pertaining  to  a  joint  venture
agreement  dated  May  8 1996 whereby Athlone Resources Ltd has granted to Vital Pacific Resources Ltd the right to earn up to an additional 16% interest in  the Soup  mining  claims  in  BC  by  incurring  up  to  $2,000,000  in  exploration expenditures over the next four years. The company currently owns a 26% interest
in the claims while Vital has a 74% interest.                                   

<dt>09/16/96<dd> Mr. Paul Reynolds reports that core results of drill hole 96-2 on the Soup property have been received.  The drill hole was located on the southeast side of the Saddle Gully zone  approximately 170  metres  east  northeast of hole 96-1. The hole was drilled to the northwest and it intersected two mineralized sections. The first  section  from  13.20  to 18.35  metres  is  an  altered  mafic dyke with pyrite veinlets and malachite on
fractures. The second section from 74.31 to 75.90 metres is made up of  tuff  of dark  green  to  black  colouration  with multiple quartz stringers and abundant pyrite, chlorite and magnetite.     
                                           
Drill hole 96-3 did not reach target depth as the drill rods jammed at 50 metres due  to  broken  ground  conditions.  Drill  holes 96-4 and 96-5 were drilled to intersect  a  geochemical  and  geophysical  anomaly  approximately  700  metres southeast  of  the  Saddle  Gully  zone.  Neither  96-4 nor 96-5 intersected any significant mineralization. Drill holes 96-6 and 96-7 did not reach target depth as the drill rods jammed.   Drill hole 96-8 has been drilled vertically from the 96-1 setup. Drill hole 96-9 is  being  drilled  to  test the structure below the 96-1 hole. Assays for these holes will be released when they are available.

<DT>09/10/96<DD>Athlone Resources received Soup property drill results.  Please call the company for 
a copy of the drill results.  The company has provided the following comments on the initial results. 
<P>
This initial drill hole was drilled from a setup on the northwest  side  of  the Saddle Gully zone and it encountered good gold mineralization. The first section from 39.36 to 45.88 metres is a mafic dyke containing altered rocks with pyrite, quartz,  ankerite  and  magnetite  stringers, with chalcopyrite and malachite on
fractures. The second section 51.10 to 59.60 metres runs into the  saddle  gully zone  at 90 degrees and this stratiform zone is made up of massive magnetite and iron carbonate. The third section from 59.60 to 71.63 metres is the Saddle Gully zone  and  it  is  made up of highly altered rocks containing quartz, carbonate,
chlorite and magnetite. The hole was  stopped  at  79.25  metres  in  an  augite porphyry.
<P>
The joint venture is currently drilling the  seventh  hole  of  this  phase  one program.  
<P>                                                                      
Athlone has a 26% interest in the Soup property. Vital Pacific Resources Ltd has an  option  to  increase  its  74%  interest  to  90%  by spending $2,000,000 on exploration and development. Athlone will  retain  a  10%  interest  carried  to
feasibility.

<DT>09/09/96<DD>The company has entered into an agreement with Yorkton Securities to act as  its
exclusive  agent  with  respect  to  the  private placement of up to 2.5 million special warrants at $0.30 for $750,000.
<P>                              
Proceeds will be used to begin drilling on the El Norteno  gold-copper  property
in Western Bolivia.

<DT>08/28/96<DD>The company's joint venture partner, Vital Pacific Resources, reported  drilling
has  commenced on the Soup Property 75km southeast of Royal Oak's Kemess deposit north of Smithers, BC. 
<P>
Initial drilling will further test the Saddle Gully  zone with  two  holes.  Drilling will then test a gold-copper zone currently known to extend one kilometre northwest from the  Saddle  Gully  zone.  Geochemistry  and
magnetics  carried out this summer on an anomaly 1.5 kilometres to the southeast of the Saddle Gully zone have shown assay values up to  0.347  oz/ton  Au. 
<P>
This potentially  extends  the  strike  length  to approximately 2.5 kilometres. This possible southeast extension will  also  be  drilled  to  test  the  geochemical anomaly.  The  phase  one  drilling program consists of nine widely spaced holes totaling 1,220 metres and it is  designed  to  test  both  the  regions  to  the
northwest  and  southeast  of  the Saddle Gully zone. The program is expected to provide a critical initial test of C.J.  Sullivan's  suggestion  that  the  Soup property could contain 25 to 50 million tons with 5 to 10 million oz gold.    
<P>
For complete drill result from past drilling activities on the Saddle Gully Zone,  (1989 & 1995 drilling results)  
please call the company.     
<P>                                                                           
The joint venture has staked an additional 20 claim units (the  Soup  15  claim) immediately  to  the  west  adjoining  the  Soup 1 to 10 claims, which amount to approximately 4.25 square kilometres of additional mining claims.  Athlone presently has a 26% interest in the Soup property joint venture.

<DT>08/22/96<DD>The recently completed induced polarization survey has delineated  targets  with
potential  for  mineralization.  The  IP  survey  was  undertaken  by  Geofisica Gradiente S.A., a prominent Bolivian consulting firm. The work consisted of nine one kilometre long lines spaced 100 metres apart.    
<P>                           
The survey report identifies the presence of abundant  sulphides  and  concludes that  the amplitude and extent of the anomalies indicate excellent potential for porphyry-type mineralization. The consultants recommend drilling  four  specific targets.  
<P>                                                                      
The  main  anomalous  target  is  believed  to  represent  a  zone  of  sulphide mineralization  covered by a silica cap, and is located approximately 400 metres west of the previously defined rock geochemical gold-copper anomaly.    The  company  intends  to  start  drilling  as  soon  as  possible.   Additional geochemical work is also probable.    
<P>                                          
El Norteno is 100% owned by  the  company.  The  property  is  adjacent  to  the Peruvian border, 140 kilometres southwest of La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. The property can easily be reached in four hours by road, from La Paz, and is within 200 kilometres of the northern Chilean port of Arica.

<DT>08/15/96<DD>The VSE has consented to a number of escrow share position transfers.  The transfers of these share position indicates a change in management powers and a new direction for the company.  Please contact Mr. Paul Reynolds for details on the escrow transfers at (604) 683 - 8909.                

<DT>08/01/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation pertaining to an option  agreement
dated June 13 1996 between Athlone and Mr John M. Graham, the optioner. Pursuant to the agreement, Athlone will acquire an option to purchase 100% of the Daw 101 to  127  mining claims in Elko County, Nevada. 
The claims are in  the  north  end  of  the  Carlin  belt,  approximately  320km northeast  of  Reno, 4.8km west of the Rossi barite mine, 4.8km northwest of the Dee gold mine and 5.6km southeast of the Ivanhoe gold mine. The 27 claims  cover an area of approximately 3km north-south by 650m east-west.   Regional mapping shows the area  to  be  underlain  by  Tertiary  volcanics  and associated  sediments.  These  rocks overlie the Paleozoic upper and lower plate sediments which host the gold mineralization in the Dee, Bootstrap, Bluestar and Carlin  mines.  Work  by  previous  operators  on  the Daw claims has identified coincident,  northerly   trending,   magnetic-induced   polarization-resistivity anomalies. There are three or four east-west trending geophysical features which may represent cross-faulting. It is postulated that these geophysical  anomalies
represent  deep  seated  structures that may host gold mineralization similar to that found in American Barrick's Meikle mine.  The  Meikle  mine  contains  high grade  structurally  controlled gold mineralization (the discovery hole returned 165m grading 14 g/t Au). Reserves at the Meikle mine as of December 31 1994  are stated  at  7.6  million  tonnes  grading 23.42 g/t Au (8.4 million tons grading 0.683 ounces per ton).      
<P>                                                    
Athlone plans a first phase  program  of  prospecting,  geological  mapping  and geochemical  sampling  in  order  to  further  evaluate  this  property. Work is scheduled to begin in mid-August.

<DT>07/26/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation pertaining to an option  agreement
dated  June  13  1996  between  Athlone  Resources  Ltd  and  John M Graham (the optionor). Athlone Resources Ltd will acquire an option to purchase 100% of  the DAW 101 through DAW 127 mining claims in Elko County. 

<DT>07/24/96<DD>Exploration work is under way on the El Norteno concession in  western  Bolivia.
Exploration  work  consisting  of  approximately  ten line kilometres of induced polarization survey began late last week with the objective of further  defining and extending the known gold-copper anomalous zone.                             
The geochemical signature of the  mineralized  rocks  and  soils  indicates  the possibility  of  a gold-copper porphyry. Previous exploration programs defined a 700m by 200m gold-copper anomalous zone within altered dacite,  rhyolitic  tuffs and  andesite  porphyry. The zone is high in copper and gold for rock chip, soil
and stream sediment samples. Within this  zone,  rock  chip  samples  from  area measuring   approximately  225m  north-south  by  150m  east-west,  consistently returned gold values greater than 0.1 g/t. The maximum value  returned  was  2.2 g/t. The extension to this area, which is open to the south, west and east, will
be tested by the IP program.     
<P>                                               
Results of the IP survey are expected in three weeks.  The  company  anticipates that  diamond  drilling  will  commence  shortly after analysis of the IP survey results. The 2,000 hectare El Norteno concession is 100% owned by Athlone and is in a region of recently recognized porphyry gold deposits.

<DT>07/17/96<DD>Exploration work is under way  on  the  Soup  property.  Exploration  work  will
consist  of mapping and sampling followed by a minimum of 1,220m (4,000 feet) of diamond core drilling. The  drilling  program  will  test  airborne  and  ground magnetic  anomalies  over  a  1,600m discontinuous strike length. These magnetic anomalies are thought to represent gold bearing magnetite skarn zones similar to those  encountered  in  previous  drilling,  the  results of which are tabulated below:  The company currently owns 26% of the Soup property. 

<DT>06/13/96<DD>Athlone has acquired the Daw claim group located within the Carlin Belt in  Elko
County, Nevada. The claims are approximately 320km northeast of Reno, 4.8km west of the Rossi barite 
mine, 4.8km  northwest  of  the  Dee  gold  mine  and  5.6km southeast  of  the  Ivanhoe gold mine. The 21 claims cover an area approximately 3km north-south by 650 metres east-west.     
<P>                                   
The  property  is  100%  owned  by  Athlone subject to a 10% net profit increase in favour of the vendor. 
This net profit interest may be  purchased  by the company for $500,000.    
<P>                                                   
Work by previous operators has identified anomalies. These geophysical anomalies represent  deep  seated  structures that may host gold mineralization similar to that found in American Barrick's  Meikle  mine.  Athlone  plans  a  first  phase program  of prospecting, geological mapping and geochemical sampling in order to further evaluate this property.

<DT>06/04/96<DD>On April 9 1996, directors and employees have been granted  options  on  850,000
shares at $0.25 expiring April 9 1998.

<DT>05/30/96<DD>The company has received the results from  a  recent  lithogeochemical  sampling
program  on its 100% owned El Norteno concession in western Bolivia. 139 samples were collected 
rock outcroppings over an area 400 metres north-south by 250 metres east-west. The samples were collected 
at random in order to determine the potential of a large area of andesite porphyry. 67 samples,  over  an  area  225 metres  north-south  by  150 metres east-west, consistently returned gold values greater than 0.1 g/t. The maximum value returned was 2.2 g/t. This area is  open to  the south, west and east. This geochemical anomaly occurs in an area that is almost completely leached of sulphides. This leaching results  in  reduced  gold
(copper)  grades  at  surface. It is postulated that this anomaly is the surface expression of an underlying gold (copper) porphyry system.

<DT>01/22/96<DD>The company reports that Hemlo Gold Mines has terminated its option 
agreement  on  the  Soup  claims  in northern BC. Hemlo attempted five holes to test for gold 
mineralization.  Due  to  technical problems encountered while drilling, only one hole 
(DDH 95-4) penetrated part of one target area.  Results can be received from the company.  
The drilling has tested a relatively small magnetic feature measuring 120 metres by   100  metres  
in  plan.  Much  larger  magnetic  anomalies  with  associated gold-copper geochemistry exist 
along strike to the northwest  and  southeast  as well  as  in  parallel  zones  to  the  east and 
west. These anomalies represent additional drill targets.  Athlone and Vital are currently 
talking to other interested parties.            

<DT>10/16/95<DD>The Company reported that Hemlo Gold Mines has completed the
1995 drilling program on the Soup claims in the Johanson Lake area of
British Columbia.  The Soup claims are owned 25% by Athlone and 75% by Vital
Pacific Resources Ltd.  Hemlo Gold Mines may earn a 51% interest in the Soup
claims by spending $1.5 million in exploration and paying to Athlone and
Vital $150,000.  Currently, Hemlo is completing the second year of this
project.  Hemlo attempted four holes to test for gold mineralization.
Unfortunately, due to technical problems encountered while drilling, none of
the holes reached target depth.  The first two holes, DDH 95-1 and DDH 95-2
were to be drilled on coincident airborne potassium radiometric and ground
magnetic anomalies in an area of quartz-magnetite stockwork which had
returned surface values of 8,500 and 11,000 ppb gold updip from previously
drilled holes DDH 89-1 and DDH 89-2.  The first two holes were lost at 62.8
metres and 69.5 metres respectively.  The third hole DDH 95-3 was to test an
area with coincident talus fine (greater than 300 ppb gold), ground magnetic
and airborne radiometric anomalies, approximately 350 metres northwest of
the first two holes.  This hole was abandoned at a depth of 18.3 metres. 
The fourth hole DDH 95-4 was collared approximately 70 metres lower in
elevation than the first two holes but had the same target.  The fourth hole
did not reach target depth but it did encounter two gold mineralized
sections within magnetite silica stockworks.  Assay results are available
from the company.

<DT>09/19/95<DD>Manson Creek and Athlone Resources, in a 50/50 joint
venture, have completed the purchase of 234 claims (14,455 acres) in the
Harp Lake Pluton area from Fleck Resources.  The Manson/Athlone joint
venture now controls 534 claims (32,988) in the Voisey Bay play, including a
100 claim block at Pistolot Bay.  Northern Abitibi Mining is financing
exploration of these clains on an earn-in basis.  One of these claim blocks
(Shapio Lake) lies adjacent to the Nain-Churchill break which has
significant copper-nickel showings reported from previous explorations. 
Northern Abitibi has completed airborne geophysics on the Shapio Lake block. 
The airborne geophysical results show eight anomalies on the property. 
Ground samples have been taken.  Results are expected soon.

<DT>08/24/95<DD>The VSE has accepted an agreement dated July 20, 1995
whereby Athlone Resources and Manson Creek Resources can acquire from Fleck
Resources a 100% interest in two claim groups, totaling 234 claims in the
Harp Lake and Shapio Lake areas of Labrador.  Athlone Resources to acquire

<DT>04/10/96<DD>Banff Resources Ltd., and LaSource Compagnie Miniere SAS, the vendor to Banff  
of  55% of  the  issued shares of Kasese Cobalt Company, has concluded negotiations with
InterUnion Financial and Credifinance Securities for which 4,000,000 units to be created  by LaSource, InterUnion and Banff will be offered for sale to investors outside of Canada and the US at $7.50

<P>                                                                    
Each unit to be created by the parties to the transaction will consist of two  underlying  shares  
which  will  be  acquired  by InterUnion  on the exercise of  8,000,000 regular warrants 
of the company and one special warrant of Banff exercisable into one common

the  exercise  of the regular warrants and $10,000,000 will be received from the
sale of the special warrants. 
<P>                                                  
As part of the offering, Banff has  agreed  to  file  a  preliminary  prospectus qualifying the 
distribution of the special warrants in BC.

special  warrants  is payable to Credifinance on closing. In addition, the agent
will receive compensation in the form of new warrants equal to 10% of the number
of special warrants sold. Each compensation warrant will be exercisable into one
share at $2.50 in the first year and $2.88 in the second year.                  
<P>
The company has also agreed to a second private placement which consists  of  an
additional 400,000 units at $2.50 to a Canadian subscriber to provide Banff with
a further $1,000,000. Each unit will consist of  one  share  and  one  two  year
warrant  exercisable  on  a  one for one basis at $2.50 in the first year and at
$2.88 in the second year.
<P>
The terms of the private placements are subject to prior approval of the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  
In addition, the closing of the  Credifinance  financing  is  conditional  upon  the  company
concluding  its  purchase  of  55% of the issued shares of Kasese Cobalt Company
which purchase was announced in Stockwatch September 21,  1995  and  approved  by
Banff's shareholders in January 1996.

<DT>02/23/96<DD>On January 23, 1996 directors and  employees  were  granted  options  on  350,000
shares at $2.23, expiring January 22, 2001.

<DT>01/23/96<DD>The company has obtained shareholder approval  for  its  acquisition  
of  a  55% interest  in  Kasese Cobalt Company, a Ugandan company owned by 
LaSource Miniere SAS and its associates of Paris.  For complete details on the
shareholders meeting, please call the company at the above investor relations phone
numbers.  Some specific points of the meeting are shown below.
<P>
As consideration for the transaction the company  will  issue  to  the  LaSource
Group  21,700,000 shares and 12,150,000 warrants exercisable in whole or in part
on a one for one basis at $1.55 in the first year and $1.77 in the second  year.
<P>
Completion of a due diligence review  by  each  of  the  company  and  LaSource;
settlement of final documentation evidencing the agreement between La Source and
the company; completion of the  renegotiation  of  the  option  agreement  dated
August  2,  1994 between the company and Kilembe Mines in relation to the Kilembe
mine on terms  satisfactory  to  the  company  and  La Source;  stock  exchange
approvals.
<P>                                                                      
The completion  of  this  transaction  will  result  in  a  unique  and  natural
combination  of  the  company's  participation  and ownership in two significant
mining projects, the Kasese cobalt project and the Kilembe cobalt/copper mine.  
A bankable feasibility study for the Kasese  cobalt  project  was  completed  by
LaSource  in  August  1995 for the production of 1,000 tonnes per year of cobalt
for 10 to 11 years from the treatment of a stockpile of over 920,000  tonnes  of
pyrite  concentrate  grading  1.38%  cobalt.  The stockpile resulted from mining
operations undertaken at the Kilembe mine between  1956  and  1978 largely  by
Falconbridge.
<P>                                                                   
The company has an option to acquire 65% of the Kilembe mine from KML.  LaSource
and  the company have jointly developed the work program for the completion of a
prefeasibility study by April next year and a sampling and drilling  program  to
prove up the reserves of the mine. The preparation of a prefeasibility study for
the rehabilitation of the Kilembe mine in western Uganda will  be  completed  by
April 2, 1996. 
<P>                                                                  
The LaSource Group is a joint venture between  the  Australian  listed  Normandy
Mining  group  of  companies  and  the  French government-owned bureau Recherche
Geologique Et Miniere. The LaSource Group owns 55% of the shares of  KCCL  which
owns the Kasese cobalt project. The remaining 45% of KCCL is owned by KML, which
is wholly owned by the Uganda  government.  KML  is  also  the  company's  joint
venture partner in the Kilembe cobalt/copper mine.                              
<P>
For complete financing arrangements for the Kilembe cobalt/copper mine, please call the 
company.  <B> A Special Report will shortly be released on Banff Resources.</B>

<DT>11/01/95<DD>Since the annoucement of the Company's letter of Intent
with LaSource Compagnie Minerie SAS of Paris, France in September, the
Company has received independent confirmation of the value placed on the
shares of Kasese and the underlying assets being purchased by the
Company from Ross Glanville & Associates Ltd. in a report to the Company
dated September 1995. At the closing of the purchase and sale, the Board
and Directors will be reconstituted and LaSource is proposing that John
Richards and Greg Martyr both of Paris, France be appointed to the Board
of Directors at the closing.  In addition, Louis Mikulic, the Company's
President will remain on the Board. Since the announcement, the Company
has received approval to the closing of a private placement of 110,000
units of the Company at $1.53 per unit to net the Company $168,300.  In
addition, funds have been placed in trust to close the private placement
of 1,800,000 units of the Company at a price of $1.32 per unit which
placement will net the Company an additional $2,376,000.
<P>
The Company has made application to the Vancouver Stock Exchange that
its shares be allowed to resume trading pending completion of all legal
documentation required to close the transaction.  The terms of
acquisition are subject to shareholder approval and the transaction

<DT>10/02/95<DD>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has approved a pro rata release
of 40% from escrow in the amount of 201,666 shares.  There are 302,500
shares remaining in escrow.  Trading in the shares of the company will
remain halted pending review of a major transaction.

<DT>09/27/95<DD>The Company has completed negotiations and executed a letter
of intent with LaSource Compagnie Miniere SAS and its associates of Paris,
France whereby the Company has agreed to purchase in a major mining
transaction, all of the outstanding shares of Kasese Cobalt Company, owned
by LaSource Group. LaSource is a member of the Australian listed Normandy
Mining Group.  As consideration, Banff will issue to the LaSource Group
21,700,000 common shares at $1.54 and 12,150,000 warrants exercisable on a
one for one basis at $1.54 in the first year and $1.77 in the second.  The
warrants were attached to ensure the continued involvement of the LaSource
Group in the development of the KCCL assets and the existing assets of
Banff, to obtain their best efforts in financing the combined assets; and as
compensation for additional value not recognized for the KCCL shares in
issuing the common share portion of the consideration.  The principal
conditions of the transaction include:

<UL>
<LI>due diligence review by each of the respective parties to the agreement;

<LI>final documentation evidencing the agreement between the two parties;

<LI>a satisfactory review of the obligations of Banff pursuant to the option
contract dated August 1994 between Banff and Kilembe Mines Limited in
relation to the Kilembe Mine

<LI>the consent of KML to the purchase of the KCCL shares by Banff and

<LI>all necessary regulatory approvals.
</UL>
The LaSource Group owns 55% of the shares of KCCL which owns the Kasese
cobalt project.  The remaining 45% of KCCL is owned by KML which is wholly
owned by the Ugandan Government.  KML is also Banff's joint venture partner
in the Kilembe copper/cobalt mine.
<P>
KCCL owns stockpiled pyrite concentrates in Kasese, Uganda containing over
900,000 tonnes of pyrite assaying on average 1.38% cobalt.  The cobalt
reserves had been stockpiled as a result of mining operations undertaken at
Kilembe mine from 1956 to 1978.  In addition to copper concentrate, the mine
also produced a cobaltiferous pyrite concentrate that was never marketed
but was stockpiled near the railway terminal at Kasase.  In arriving at the
consideration due and payable to KCCL shares, Banff's review of the KCCL
shares include the feasibility study on the Kasese cobalt project completed
by the Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres on behalf of KCCL dated
July 1995.  The acquisition by Banff represents a logical combination of two
of the most significant projects in Uganda.  Upon completion of the
transaction, Banff will have the controlling interest in a project with the
potential to generate annual gross revenues of over US$60 million at current
market prices.  Banff currently has an option to obtain a controlling
interest in the Kilembe mine which is only 15 km from the Kasese cobalt
project.  At the closure of the Kilembe mine, there were reserves of 7.2
million tonnes of ore with a cut off grade of 0.6% copper and an average
grade of 1.6% copper.  There is also substantial exploration upside
associated with the mine.  Any cobalt production from the mine would be
treated at Kasese and could result in a significant increase in revenues and
the life of the project.  It is anticipated that Banff will benefit from
numerous operational and management synergies resulting from the combination
of the projects, as well as from the expertise of a significance international
mining house.

<DT>09/25/95<DD>The Company announced that a private placement of 500,000
units at a price of $0.96 per unit has been completed.

<DT>09/19/95<DD>  *** Banff Resources Limited ("Banff" or "the Company") is
pleased to announce that it has completed negotiations and executed a Letter
of Intent with LaSource Compagnie Miniere SAS and its associates ("the
LaSource Group") of Paris, France pursuant to which the Company has agreed
to purchase in a major mining transaction, as defined by the Vancouver Stock
Exchange, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Kasese Cobalt Company
Limited ("KCCL") owned by the LaSource Group ("the KCCL Shares").  LaSource
is a member of the Australian listed Normandy Mining Group. -- The Kilembe
Mine Operation in Uganda.
<P>
As consideration for the transaction Banff will issue to the LaSource Group
21,700,000 common shares of its capital stock.  LaSource via Banff Resources
Limited, will own 55% of the shares of KCCL which owns the Kasese Cobalt
project.  The remaining 45% of KCCL is owned by KML which is wholly owned by
the Ugandan Government.  KML is also Banff Resources joint Venture partner
in the Kilembe Copper/Cobalt Mine ("the Kilembe Mine").
<P>
KCCL owns stockpiled pyrite concentrates in Kasese, Uganda containing over
900,000 tonnes of pyrite assaying on average of 1.38% cobalt.  The cobalt
reserves had been stockpiled as a result of mining operations undertaken at
the nearby Kilembe Mine during the period 1956 to 1978.  The Kilembe Mine
was operated by Falconbridge and later by KML and extracted over 16.3
million tonnes of copper ore at a grade of 1.95%.  Over the last couple of
years a complete feasibility study was done on behalf on Banff Resources. 
The study determined that with the current mine facilities and the available
reserves, processing and production of the ore should proceed.  The project
is designed to produce 1,000 tonnes (approximately 2.2 million lbs) of
cobalt cathode per year with production commencing early 1998. Operating
expenses are estimated at US $ 4/lb.
<P>
The acquisition by Banff represents a logical combination of two of the most
significant projects in Uganda. Upon completion of the transaction, Banff
will have the controlling interest in a project with the potential to
generate annual gross revenues of over $60 million at current market prices.

was shut down prematurely in 1976 during the Idi Amin era.  Banff Resources
acquired the interest by agreeing to execute an exploration and
rehabilitation program, a feasibility study, and complete certain
facilities.  The Company projects these activities will cost approximately
US$1,085,000 and require about 20 months to complete.  Once the
rehabilitation is completed, a new company will be incorporated to bring the
mineral asset into production.  Banff Resources will own 65% of that
company and will recoup its investment in the project from 75% of profits, 
the remaining 25% will be shared according to the percentage of shares
owned.  Kilembe Mines Ltd., a state-owned company will own the other 35% of
the production company and has the right to re-acquire a 14% interest from
Banff Resources, at fair market value, once Banff has recouped its original
investment.
<P>
The Kilembe Project is a low risk exploration and mine reconstruction
venture which could result in production within two and years of the actual
start of the required geological and engineering work.  The former producer
could operate at a rate of 3,000 tons of ore per day at the time it was
closed.  The net smelter value of the ore is about $75/ton.  Mining costs
come in at about $20/ton according to the feasibility study conducted by
Seltrust Engineering.  A preliminary review of the project by Company
experts and a major international engineering Company further suggest that
a substantially greater ore reserve may well be available for development.
<P>
The mine, mill and associated infrastructure are 90% in tact and can be
rebuilt to the original 3,000 ton per day capacity for approximately US$20
million.  The mine is already served by hydro-electric power, paved roads, a
town site and an operating railroad connecting to Mombasa on the Indian
Ocean.  The presence of the necessary infrastructure further reduces the
overall risk of the project and enhances potential returns.  A new operation
of this magnitude would require at least a US$85 million investment.  The
Company projects the mine could be in full production as early as the summer
of 1996.
<P>
At today's market prices and at a planned operating rate of 3,000 tons per
day, the Kilembe Mine is capable of yielding an operation profit in the
order of US$40,000,000 per year for at least ten years and probably longer. 
Also, as there will not be a tax consequence in Uganda for six years and
with a truly world class mining project and the stability of the Ugandan
government, the overall picture is extremely favorable.

<DT>10/23/96<DD>The  company  has  received  the  results  of  a  recently   completed   BeepMat
prospecting,  blasting  and  sampling  program at its Port Cartier property 50km west of Sept-Iles, Quebec. 
<P>
The survey was intended to provide definitive  ground positioning  for airborne geophysical conductors within a favourable anorthosite complex known to host anomalous copper-nickel-cobalt bearing pyroxene zones.    
The focus of the company's program was an area measuring  400  metres  by  1,800 metres  near  the  northeastern  portion of the company's claim holdings. Within this area conductors  and  conductor  groupings  had  been  identified  trending northeast  from  the  previously identified B-20 showing. Test pits were blasted
and sampled along conductors, with the most significant results from  five  test pits   containing   semi-massive   to  massive  sulphides  associated  with  the westernmost conductor grouping. Here, sulphide mineralization continues  beneath overburden  outside  the  immediate  test  pit  areas (1-2 metres), making width estimates difficult without additional trenching or drilling.    
<P>               
Reconnaissance sampling at the company's Lac Mora property, 120km north  of  the Port  Cartier  property and near the eastern shore of Lake Manicouagan, returned results of up to 1.10% copper, 1.22% nickel and 0.15% cobalt from  grab  samples of  sulphide  horizons.  The  Lac Mora property is on the northwest flank of the staking rush  sparked  by  the  recent  Quebec  government  copper-nickel-cobalt discovery near Lac Manitou on Quebec's north shore.  
<P>                           
The Port Cartier property consists of 246  claims  and  the  Lac  Mora  property comprises  18  claims.  The  company  will be seeking joint venture partners for these 100% owned properties.

<DT>10/09/96<DD>The company has issued  150,000  shares  to  NDT  Ventures  in  respect  of  the
company's  option to acquire a 50% interest in the 1546 claims in the Voisey Bay area of Labrador pursuant to an agreement dated May 1  1995.  Consequently,  the company has now acquired its 50% interest.

<DT>09/13/96<DD>The company has completed its 90  day  due  diligence  evaluation  of  the  Mina
Paredones  property  near  Cajamarca,  Peru.  During  the  evaluation, over four kilometres of intensely argillic altered stratigraphy was samples with over  600 rock  chip  samples.  The  alteration  system  is  host  to  a series of narrow, structurally-controlled sulphide and stockwork vein systems  which  occasionally
returned  geochemically anomalous gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper values. No large scale epithermal vein systems  or  Manto  type  horizons  were  identified during  this  extensive evaluation. Birchwood has chosen not to proceed with the Mina  Paredones  option  and  will  continue  to  evaluate   other   exploration
opportunities  to  complement  the  company's present holdings in the Voisey Bay area and Port Cartier, Quebec where work is continuing.

<DT>09/10/96<DD>NDT Ventures and Birchwood Ventures have granted to Donner Resources  an  option
to earn an undivided 50% interest (as to 25% each) in mineral licenses 1084M and 1457M, which comprise 232 mineral claims in South Voisey's Bay  at  Sarah  Lake, Labrador (NDT project Nos. 78 and 81). 
In order to earn its 50% interest, Donner must incur minimum expenditures of $58,000 in the first year  
($250  per  claim)

<DT>08/28/96<DD>On August 1 1995, directors and employees have been granted options  on  735,890
shares at $0.61 expiring August 1 2000.

<DT>08/28/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation in  support  of  the  issuance  of
150,000 shares to NDT Ventures Ltd in respect of the company's option to acquire a 50% interest in 1546 claims in the Voisey Bay area of Labrador pursuant to  an agreement  dated May 1 1995. The shares represent completion of the three phases of work programs and upon issuance of these shares Birchwood Ventures  Ltd  will have a 50% interest in the property.

<DT>08/27/96<DD>On July 25 1996, directors and employees have been  granted  options  on  33,000
shares at $0.59 expiring July 25 2001.

<DT>08/16/96<DD>The company has released an update on the exploration progress at the  company's
properties in Peru, Quebec and Labrador.     
<P>                                   
At  the  3400  hectare  Mina  Paredones  property  near   Cajamarca,   Peru,   a property-wide  lithogeochemical  sampling  program  has  just been completed. In excess of 600 rock samples were  collected  from  extensive  epithermal  systems identified throughout the property. Due to exposures at varying erosional levels and the interpreted shallow dipping nature  of  the  altered/mineralized  zones, strike  extent  now  appears  to  be in excess of 4 kilometres for the stockwork veined, breccia and clay-silica alteration zones of this epithermal system.
<P>     
Assay results are expected over the next couple of weeks from the Mina Paredones sampling  program. The company will then be in a position to complete its 90-day due diligence evaluation of the  precious  and  base  metal  potential  of  this extensive alteration system by mid-September.     
<P> 
At the company's Port Cartier property near Sept Isles, Quebec, a field  program of ground geophysics, prospecting, geologic mapping, trenching and rock sampling has identified two zones of  anomalous  copper-nickel  mineralization.  Although these  zones  display considerable strike extent, their discontinuous nature and generally low copper-nickel grades do not warrant  further  evaluation  at  this time.        
<P>                                                                   
The 1996 field exploration programs at the company's Voisey  Bay  properties  in Labrador  have  now  begun.  Field  activities  here are being undertaken by NDT Ventures as a component of their regional evaluation programs.

<DT>07/31/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 375,000 shares from escrow. There are
375,000 shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>06/28/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation  pertaining  to  the  issuance  of 16,667  shares in consideration for an option payment required for the company's Coro property and the B20 property.

<DT>06/25/96<DD>The  company  has  received  an  exploration  update   on   its   Port   Cartier
copper-nickel-cobalt  exploration  property in Quebec. Field crews, mobilized to the property four weeks ago,  have  been  following  up  on  the  numerous  high priority  anomalies  indicated  by  the  airborne and ground geophysical surveys carried out over the winter. 
<P>                                                  
Work is  focussing  on  locating  and  tracing-out  the  surface  expression  of favourable  conductors,  and  prospecting crews have been successful in locating gossanous horizons directly coincident with many of the conductors. These  zones are  being  exposed  by hand trenching, and where required, are being blasted in
order to obtain unweathered samples  of  the  sulphide  mineralization. Previous surface  grab  sampling  from  the  Coro showing  in  the  central  part of the property returned peak values up to 1.60% copper,
 0.58% nickel and 0.20% cobalt. At the B20 showing, 3.7km east  of  Coro, maximum values to 1.93% copper, 1.27% nickel and 0.21% cobalt were returned.    
<P>
The  current  program  will  give  a  better  understanding  of  the  geological environment,  and  extent  of mineralization on the property prior to planning a drill program. Depending on the results of the current phase of  field  work,  a program  of  mechanized  bulldozer/backhoe trenching along with further blasting
and trenching, may be indicated in  order  to  obtain  better  exposure  of  the mineralized zones prior to choosing targets for drilling.

<DT>06/17/96<DD>The company has entered into an  agreement  for  the  acquisition  of  the  Mina
Paredones   property  50  kilometres  west-southwest  of  Cajamarca,  Peru.  The Cajamarca region is host 
to Newmont's Yanacocha mine which contains 7.5  million ounces  of  gold  in  eight  deposits;  and  to  American Barrick's Cerro Corona property which contains 3 million ounces of gold in a deposit grading 
0.03  oz/t gold and 0.6% copper.      
<P>                                                     
The Mina Paredones property has been mined for silver and base metals in several phases dating back to the pre-colonial period. An extensive epithermal system on the property hosts sub-parallel precious and base metal bearing veins  developed marginal  to  and within two extensive zones of clay-silica alteration. 
Previous sampling of these alteration zones returned values between 1.0 and 2.0 g/t gold.  On a recent property exam by the company, sampling of vuggy quartz vein material in the alteration zones returned 1.2 g/t gold. The two alteration zones are each up  to 100 metres in width and have been traced for several hundred meters along
strike. Significant gold production in this region  of  Peru  has  come  from  a similar  environment of large scale epithermal vein systems and associated broad alteration zones hosting large Manto type orebodies formed by  the  movement  of mineralizing   fluids   along   porous   horizons  during  the  same  epithermal
mineralizing event which formed the veins.   
<P>                                   
The company has an option to acquire a 40-year renewable concession  on  a  100% interest  in  five  mining  concessions  totalling  3,400  hectares.  
 <P>                                                                               
The property is also subject to a 12% net profits  interest  in  favour  of  the vendors. The three month due diligence period will allow the company to evaluate the gold and silver potential of the alteration areas and 
the associated veins. A program of extensive rock and soil geochemical sampling is planned  to  begin  in  early July 1996. For complete details on the acquisition of the property please call the company in Vancouver.

<DT>05/14/96<DD>The  company  is  a  joint  venture partner with NDT Ventures on 17 mineral properties comprised of 1,546 claims covering an area of 96,625 acres in Labrador.  A recent announcement by Cartaway Resources regarding a new discovery on the Cirque Property in the Staghorn Lake area of northern Labrador has caused excitement  and  anticipation  of  another major copper-nickel discovery in this area. The Cartaway property is on the west side of the company's project  9  and is 6.5 kilometres east of project 13.  
<P>                                         
The company will mobilize crews to the Staghorn Lake area later this  spring  to initiate  an  exploration  program. 

<DT>05/14/96<DD>Geophysical surveys in 1995 on the Main Showing on  Birchwood/NDT's  Project  13
defined a 1.3km long southeast trending HLEM/UTEM conductor. Surface sampling of gossanous sulphides along the trend of the conductor returned assays up to 0.68% Ni, 4.00% Cu, and 0.17% Co. 
<P>
A initial drill program in late 1995 confirmed that the Main  Showing  geophysical  anomaly  is  associated  with  a  laterally  and vertically  continuous layer of copper-nickel-cobalt bearing cumulate sulphides.
Drill holes intersected massive, semi-massive, and disseminated  sulphides  with obvious cumulate textures occurring in a layer up to 11.85m wide. Mineralization had been traced by drilling for 100m along strike and 105m down dip from surface showings  before  the  drill  program was shut down due to severe winter weather
conditions. The sulphide mineralization is  hosted  by  a  layered  sequence  of favourable troctolite,
anorthosite, norite, and leuconorite rocks.              
<P>
On Birchwood/NDT's  Project  9,  which  is  contiguous  with  Cartaway's  Cirque property,  airborne  geophysics  have defined numerous airborne EM anomalies. In the southern half of Project 9 a grab sample returned values of 0.67% ppm copper and 0.73 ppm nickel.                                                            

Management believes that mineralization in the Staghorn Lake area  occurs  in  a geological environment which may be analogous to that of the rocks overlying the main Voisey's Bay deposit located 70km to the  south.  Information  released  to date suggests that drill holes down to the Eastern Deeps deposit at Voisey's Bay encounter an overlying sequence of  layered  troctolite/anorthosite/norite  with isolated  pods  of  Cu-Ni-Co bearing sulphide mineralization which have migrated upwards during emplacement of the main sulfide
deposit at depth.                
<P>
Birchwood/NDT will be mobilizing crews to the  Staghorn  Lake  area  later  this spring  to  initiate  an  extensive  exploration  program incorporating this new model. The 1996 program will include  prospecting,  geological  mapping,  ground geophysics  and  diamond  drilling, including deep drilling, to further evaluate
targets in this very prospective area.

<DT>03/07/96<DD>On February 7 1996 directors and  employees  were  granted  options  on  
185,000 shares at $0.68, expiring February 7 2001.

<DT>01/08/96<DD>The company has received exploration reports on its Voisey Bay (Labrador) and 
Port Cartier (Quebec) mineral properties.
<P>
At Voisey Bay, only a limited portion of the proposed drilling program for projects 13, 9, and 21 were completed due to difficult winter conditions.  Only a 100 - metre section of the 1.3 km long main zone conductor was tested in seven drll holes totalling 953m on project 13.  Please contact the company for the results obtained.  Drilling will continue when conditions permit on the main showing, and also on the
north and south showings on project 13 and the priority targets on projects 21 and 9.  The company has 
an option from NDT Ventures to earn a 50% undivided interest in the Voisey Bay area mineral properties 
and is the operator of these properties.
<P>
The company has received final results of the airborne geophysical survey over the company's
Port Cartier property in southeastern Quebec.  The results indicate nine priorty areas with 
significant geophysical anomalies on the property which warrant follow-up work.  Several
surface sampling were taken and the essays have been returned to the company.  A second
major airborne anomaly grouping is a 3.6 km long north-east trending zone of conductors, 1.5 km to the  
east of the above.
<P>
Linecutting crews have been mobilized to the property this week to begin cutting 110 km of gridlines to 
cover the target areas.  Ground geophysical surveys are expected to commence by early February to better define targets for diamond drilling.

<DT>11/07/95<DD>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has accepted for filing
documentation pertaining to three minor property acquisition agreements
whereby Birchwood Ventures can acquire a 100% interest in three separate
properties in the Port Cartier area of Quebec.  Pursuant to an option
agreement dated July 20,1995, the Company can acquire from Philias Boudrias
20%, Claude Ouellet 40%, and Rober Ouellet 40%, a 100% interest in the Coro
property (15 mineral claims) for which the Company must pay to the Coro
optionors, as to above noted proportions, $185,000 on or before June 23,
2000.  The property is subject to nrs royalties totalling 3.5%; 2.5% payable
to the Coro optionors and 1.0% payable to Donald McKinnon. Pursuant to an
option agreement dated July 20, 1995, the Company can acquire from
Exploration Esbec a 100% interest in the B-20 property (25 mineral claims)
for which the Company must pay to Esbec an aggregate of $84,000 on or before
August 31, 2001.  The property is subject to nsr royalties totalling 3.0%;
2.0% payable to Esbec and 1.0% payable to McKinnon.  Pursuant to an option
agreement dated August 31, 1995, the Company can acquire from Philias
Boudrias and Mark Guindon a 100% interest in the Vachon property (four
mineral claims) for which the Company must pay to the Vachon optionors, as
to 50% each, an aggregate of $54,000 on or before August 31, 2001. The
property is subject to a 2.5% nsr royalty, payable to the Vachon optionors.
<P>
The Coro and B-20 agreements between the Company and vendors, were preceded
by agreements between McKinnon and the vendors, whereby McKinnon had the
opton to acquire each of the properties. Pursuant to a July 20, 1995
agreement between McKinnon and the Company, McKinnon assigned his rights in
these properties to the Company for which the Company will issue 100,000
shares to McKinnon.

<DT>10/27/95<DD>The Company has decided not to proceed with the acquisition
of any properties in Norway (including the Rombaken property) at this time. 
Regarding the company's Port Cartier property in Quebec, the Company wishes
to clarify the acquisition terms.  The Company has entered into three
agreements to acquire a 100% interest in three separate blocks of claims (39
claims in all).  In order to acquire the claims, the Company must pay the
vendors $323,000, of which $39,000 has been paid and the balance is due in
three stages, the last payment being due on August 31, 2001.  In addition,
the Company must issue 100,000 shares to Mr. Donald McKinnon, in
consideration for his assignment to the Company of his prior right to
acquire the claims.  The Company has also staked 202 claims in the vicinity
of the original claims.  The company's interest in the property is subject
to total net smelter return royalties of between 3% and 31/2%.

<DT>08/25/95<DD>Directors and employees of the Company have been granted
options on 825,890 shares at $1.00 expiring August 1, 2000.

<DT>09/27/95<DD>A new high priority drill target area in the Staghorn Lake
region, 90 km north of Voisey Bay, Labrador has been identified.  Birchwood
along with Aranlee Resources, Essex Resources, Layfield Resources and Lumina
Investment has 50% interest in claims in this area.  Birchwood is conducting
its own exploration while NDT Ventures is responsible for the exploration
program on the joint venture claims.  Detailed gridding has been conducted
on four newly discovered mineralized gossan zones.  A zone 8 km long has
been identified, containing highly anomalous nickel-copper-cobalt values in
norites and leuco norites.  Mineralization appears to be in multiple,
stratiform sub-horizontal zones of disseminated to massive sulphides
composed of pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, minor bornite and native
copper.  Airborne geophysics has indicated numerous EM conductors throughout
the property and a detailed ground geophysical survey has commenced.  Fresh
sulphide showings assayed up to 1.86% nickel, 0.95% copper and 0.165%
cobalt.  Grab samples of massive sulphides assayed up to 0.69% nickel and
4.00% copper.

<DT>09/22/95<DD>Birchwood Ventures has made progress in its exploration of
its Voisey Bay properties in Labrador.  Birchwood has an option with NDT
Ventures Ltd. to earn a 50% undivided interest in 17 mineral properties
comprised of 1,546 claims covering an area of 96,625 acres.  Birchwood is
the operator of the properties.  To date, airborne geophysical surveys have
been completed over all but one of the 17 properties and the final data is
in various stages of completion.<BR>
Project 13: much of the work completed to date in the field has focused on
Birchwood's Project 13 located approximately 1.5 km southwest of Canadian
States Gas property where drilling is currently under way.  Four gossanous
showing areas have been identified on Project 13, three of which (Main,
North and South) coincide with airborne EM anomalies.  All four showings
have returned anomalous values of nickel, copper, and cobalt from initial
prospecting.  Birchwood is currently mobilizing a winterized camp to Project
13 to facilitate drill testing of the North, Main, Mid and South showing
areas.  Drilling is scheduled to begin in the latter part of October.<BR>
Project 9:  the airborne survey indicated the presence of 46 airborne EM
anomalies on Project 9, located approximately 12 km northwest of Project 13. 
Preliminary examination of the total field magnetic data indicated the
presence of a single, wide magnetic feature traversing the entire length of
the property in a north-south direction.  In the northern half of the
property, airborne EM anomalies form two prominent linear trends, one of
which is parallel to a north trending and slightly arcuate massive magnetite
layer/dyke within the layered anorthosite complex that underlies the
majority of the property.  A large gossan has also been identified in the
southwestern corner of the northern half of the property.  This gossan
appears to coincide with two airborne EM anomalies and remains to be
evaluated by sampling and ground geophysics.  In the southern portion of the
property, a sample from a gossanous anorthosite returned 0.73% Nickel, 0.66%
Copper and 0.11% Cobalt.  Further sampling and ground geophysical coverage
of Project 9 is anticipated to begin next week.<BR>
Project 21:  results from the airborne geophysical survey from Project 21,
located approximately 35 km southwest of Project 13, detected several very
strong north-northwest striking conductors which occur as discrete trends in
the southern portion of the property.  However, the trends become wider and
gradually merge as one large conductive zone in the north half of the
property.  This large conductive zone conincides with the contact between
felsic gneiss in the southern portion of the property and a large norite
body in the northern half of the property.  A grid will be established over
this area to facilitate a ground geophysical survey.<BR>
Project 51:  airborne geophysical results are still pending for this project
which is located approximately 35 km northwest of Diamond Field's Voisey Bay
deposit.  Ground crews have completed the initial prospecting on the
property.  The maximum value returned from a grab sample of gossanous dyke
assayed 0.09% Nickel and 0.31% Copper.<BR>
Project 66:  airborne geophysical surveys identified four north-south
oriented conductive trends on Project 66, located approximately 4 km south of
Cabot Lake.  One of the conductive trends directly correlates with a strong
magnetic trend suggesting a possible association with massive sulphides. 
Followup prospecting by NDT Ventures Ltd. has identified a massive to
disseminated sulphide gossan measuring one to five metres wide, and 400
meres long along strike.  The zone has been trenched and sampled, with the
highest results returned to date of 79 ppm Nickel, 518 ppm Copper, 438 ppm
Cobalt, 270 ppm Zinc.<BR>
Airborne geophysical results have also been received for project 84, but are
still pending for Projects 51, 64, 71, 88, 93, 96, and 99 which are located
predominantly south of the Voisey Bay area.  Prospecting of these properties
is currently under way by NDT Ventures' crews.<BR>
In Rombaken, Norway, Birchwood has completed two drill holes, totalling 288
metres, on the copper-lead-zinc property located in central Norway.  After
receiving an expected grant from the Norwegian government, Birchwood
expenditures for this program are expected to total approximately $52,000.  No
further work is planned on the Rombaken property at this time.<BR>
At Birchwood's Port Cartier properties in southeastern Quebec, a helicopter
borne geophysical survey is currently under way.  Initial results from newly
discovered gossanous outcrops returned values up to 1.9% Copper, 0.7% Nickel
and 0.2% Cobalt.  Here, all known showings are easily accessed by an
existing network of logging roads.  Ground followup, including diamond
drilling of defined targets, will be carried out over the fall and winter.

<DT>08/15/95<DD>Birchwood Ventures announced that it has received an
exploration progress report from NDT Ventures Ltd. for the month of July on
its mineral properties in the Voisey Bay region.  To date, three of the
claim blocks have been flown by airborne geophysics and seven have been
prospected on a reconnaissance basis.  Two of Birchwood's geologists on site
will continue to delineate the newly discovered mineralized zones by
geological mapping and prospecting and ground geophysical surveying in
preparation for diamond drilling.  The Company also announced that the
initial four-hole drilling program on its Rombaken property, located in
Norway will begin this week.  Reconnaissance prospecting and geophysics has
also begun in Birchwood's 123 square kilometre, Port Cartier, Quebec mineral
property. An airborne geophysical survey, planned for the property, is
expected to begin flying in mid to late September.

<DT>07/26/95<DD>Birchwood Ventures Ltd. announced that it has been granted
options to acquire a 100% interest in copper-nickel-cobalt properties in
Norway.  At Karasjok in northeastern Norway near the Finnish border,
Birchwood's property holdings comprised of 717 claims covering 207 square
kilometres.  These claims cover areas where stream sediment and till
geochemistry in the area show strong, regional-scale, co- incident
copper-nickel-cobalt anomalies.

<DT>07/24/95<DD>Nell M. Dragovan has purchased 335,000 shares and warrants
to purchase an additional 335,000 shares by way of a private placement. 
Prior to the acquisition, she owned 563,000 shares.  She now owns 898,000
shares (equal to 12% approximately of the issued share capital) together
with the warrants.

<DT>07/07/95<DD>The Company also announced that it has entered into an
option to acquire 100% interest in 190 mining claims, covering 123 squares
kilometres, over a new copper-nickel-cobalt discovery located witin 10
kilometres southwest of Port Cartier, Quebec.  The discovery area is
situated within the upper units of a 1.38 billion year old layered
Anorthosite/Troctolite intrusion.  Grab samples grading up to 0.5 to 1.9%
copper, 0.4 to 0.7% nickel and 0.05 to 0.2% cobalt were taken from a 4 to 5
metre wide gossan zone which appears to conform with the layering in the
banded anorthosites and pyroxenites which host regional sulfide
mineralization.  The Company is arranging for an airborne geophysical survey
to be flown over the claims.  Preliminary geological mapping and more
detailed sampling of the showings is scheduled to begin next week.

<DT>06/30/95<DD>The company's brokered private placement with Yorkton
Securities of 200,000 units at $ 0.68 closed June 28, 1995, raising gross
proceeds of $1,360,000 for the Company.  The units are comprised of one
share and one warrant entitling the purchaser of a additional share at $
0.82 for one year.  .

<DT>06/20/95<DD>The Company reports that the airborne survey over its 17
Voisey Bay properties is currently under way. One of the properties is
located contiguous to the south and east of the Layfield Resources
Inc./United Compass Resources Ltd. Property on which results of a
preliminary survey show a number of extremely encouraging conductors within
a zone 2.4 km long and 1.0 km wide.

<DT>06/01/95<DD>Birchwood Ventures announced that it has been granted by
Hendricks Minerals Canada Ltd. an option to acquire an undivided 65%
interest in the Rombaken Property, located in north-central Norway.  The
Property is subject to a 3% net smelter return.  Birchwood agreed to
complete a program of drilling on the Property at a cost of not less than
$100,000 prior to September 15, 1995.  To exercise the option, Birchwood
agreed to pay Hendriks Minerals $300,000 over five years, issue 200,000
shares to Hendricks and incur not less than $2,000,000 in expenditures on
the Property over a five year period.

<DT>05/18/95<DD>The Company announced that it has been notified by NDT
Ventures Ltd. that airborne geophysical flying by Dighem Ltd. Is scheduled
to start on the NDT's claim blocks in the Voisey Bay area at month's end
with completion expected before the end of July.

<P>
<B>Voisey Bay Properties</B>
<P>
Birchwood Ventures has a 50% working interest in 1,546 claims in 17 blocks
covering 96,625 acres in the Voisey Bay and Harp Lake regions of Labrador,
Newfoundland in its joint venture with NDT Ventures Ltd.  Birchwood is the
operator both during the option and thereafter.  The properties cover
geological rock units similar to that of the Diamond Fields discovery with a
combination of proximity to geochemical and geophysical anomalies.  To date,
three of the claim blocks have been flown by airborne geophysics and seven
have been prospected on a reconnaissance basis, of which four (Project 9,
13, 21 and 66) were the focus of NDT's August 14th press release.  In the
release, NDT announced that an gossan discovered on the northwest side of
Project 13 contains two separate zones of near massive sulphide
mineralization.  Two preliminary grab samples from these zones returned
assay values of 0.68% nickel, 1.13% copper and 0.17% cobalt and 0.35%
nickel, 4.00% copper and 0.09% cobalt respectively.  NDT's press release
also outlines newly discovered gossans on three of their project blocks
contiguous to the west boundary of Birchwood's project 13 block.
<P>
Two of Birchwood's claim blocks (13 and 9) are located proximal and
structurally on trend to the copper-nickel-cobalt discovery recently
announced by Canadian State Gas.  According to Canadian States Gas' July
20th press release, two mineralized zones located approximately 700 metres
apart have returned values "of up to 1.8% nickel, 0.3% copper and 0.17%
cobalt".  The zones, which are up to 1400 metres in extent, are controlled
by northeast-southwest striking structures that pass through their property.
<P>
<B>Rombaken and Karasjok Properties, Norway</B>
<P>
Hendricks Minerals Canada Ltd. granted an option to Birchwood Ventures to
acquire an undivided 65% interest in the Rombaken Property, Norway.  The
properties were staked by Don McKinnon, the staker of the Hemlo gold
discovery in Ontario.  The claim block is 1100 hectares and covers numerous
electromagnetic anomalies.  The 1995 exploration program will evaluate the
block of claims, located 30 kilometres east of Narvik on the coast of
Norway, for a sediment hosted base metal mineralization similar to that
found at the Sullivan or Red Dog deposits in North America.  Exploration in
1994 defined a Zinc-Lead-Silver massive sulphide gossan zone which coincided
with a large geochemical anomaly.
<P>
Birchwood Ventures was also granted options to acquire a 100% interest in
copper-nickel-cobalt properties in Karasjok in northeastern Norway near the
Finnish border.  These properties comprised of 717 claims, totalling 207
square kilometres.  The Karasjok properties occur within the Fennoscandian
Shield, an area of Archean and Proterozoic rocks similar to the geologic
setting which hosts the Voisey Bay deposit in Labrador.  Although the
<P>
Norwegian Geological Survey has produced an extensive database for this area
including geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and helicopter-borne
geophysics, follow-up exploration in the Karasjok belt has been limited. 
The properties cover areas with strong magnetic and anomalies and
co-incident strong, short strike-length EM conductors.  Stream sediment and
till geochemistry in the area show strong, regional-scale, co-incident
copper-nickel-cobalt anomalies.  Initial work will include field screening
and priority rating of the claims in preparation for subsequent diamond
drill testing.
<P>
<B>Port Cartier, Quebec Property</B>
<P>
Birchwood Ventures also has entered an option to acquire 100% interest,
subject to 3% Net Smelter Return, in 190 mining claims (123 square
kilometres) located 10 kilometres southwest of Port Cartier, Quebec.  New
discoveries of copper, nickel and cobalt mineralization have recently been
made by local prospectors in three areas near the claims.  Quebec government
geologists believe that that they represent magmatic sulfide concentrations
and limited geophysical surveying indicates that the sulphides have
coincident magnetic high and VLF responses.  Assay results from samples
collected to date range up to 1.27% nickel, 1.9% copper, 0.2% cobalt and 310
ppb platinum and 112 ppb palladium.  Birchwood has encountered heavy
competitive staking by major mining companies to the east and west of its
Quebec properties.  An airborne geophysical survey, planned for the property
is expected to begin flying in mid to late September.

<DT>10/25/96<DD>The VSE has consented to the following transfers within escrow: 5,000 shares each to Hari Varshney and Raj I.  Chowdhry  and  15,000  shares  to Canaccord  ITF  Praveen  Varshney  RRSP  account,  from Praeen Varsheney; 30,000shares to Canaccord ITF Hari Varshney  RRSP  account  from  Hari  Varshney;  and 30,000 shares to Canaccord ITF Raj Chowdhry RRSP account from Raj I. Chowdhry.

<DT>10/15/96<DD>Further to the company news release of  August 22 1996,  the  structure  of  the
$2.34  million  financing  has been amended. The financing will now proceed as a private placement of 1.5 million special warrants at $1.56.                     
<P>
The company will use its best efforts to file and finalize a  prospectus  in  BC within  120  days  to  qualify the exercise of the special warrants. The special warrant proceeds have now been received by the company and will not be  escrowed pending completion of the prospectus filing.

<DT>09/19/96<DD>The Company reports processing of the remaining 79 tonnes, of the total 104 tonne mini-bulk  sample, by  Canamera  Geological  Ltd's  dense  media  separation  plant  (DMS) has been completed and is considered to be a success. Diamonds  were  recovered  from  42 bulk  sample drill holes, which were spaced in such a way to uniformly cover the entire surface area of the pipe. As a result, planning for a  feasibility  study of  the  5034  pipe has begun. It is anticipated that this will include a 10,000
tonne underground bulk sample to provide a large enough quantity of diamonds for evaluation  purposes.  It  is expected that underground operations will start in the spring of 1997. An aggressive exploration program will continue for the next several months.
<P>
The processing of the remaining 79 tonnes of kimberlite was accelerated  by  not doing  a  final crush of the ore. This meant that a large fraction of the 1 to 3 mm diamonds were not recovered from the kimberlite chips,  that  were  up  to  a centimeter in size. The main purpose of the mini-bulk sample was to determine if
it is warranted to proceed to the underground bulk sample and not to recover all the  diamonds.  The  key  aspects of the mini-bulk sample were to determine if a sufficient grade of  diamonds,  uniformly  spaced,  is  present,  including  the presence  of  larger stones and a representative number of quality stones. These
key conditions have all been met, making the bulk sample a success.    
<P>         
Diamonds with a weight of 257 carats were recovered from 104 tonnes of processed kimberlite,  for a recoverable grade of 2.48 carats per tonne. As expected, this is lower than the 3.09 carats per tonne for  the  first  25  tonnes,  which  did undergo a final crush. The grade of the diamonds greater than 2mm in the largest
dimension is 2.10 carats per tonne. There were three diamonds over  two  carats, eight diamonds equal to or greater than 1.5 carats, 43 diamonds over 0.50 carats and 556 diamonds over 0.10 carats. The largest diamond is 2.88 carats  and  four of the largest eight stones are of gem quality. A value for the diamonds will be
determined by  several  diamantaires  and  will  be  reported  as  soon  as  the information is available. 
<P>                                                      
An extensive exploration program, involving the expenditure of $4 million,  will continue for the next several months. 1,000 heavy indicator mineral till samples will have been collected by the end of September from five  different  areas  on the  AK  claim  group  and  335 samples from the CJ claim group to better define
drilling targets. It is anticipated that up to 15  land-based  targets  will  be drilled  on the AK and up to five on the CJ claims this fall. Lake-based targets will be drilled this winter.    
<P>                                                
Planning for the  underground  bulk  sample  has  started  with  the  filing  of applications for the initial permits and with the work on environmental issues.  The AK and CJ properties are held 50% by  Mountain  Province,  40%  by  Glenmore Highlands and 10% by Camphor Ventures.

<DT>08/21/96<DD>The company has secured commitments for the private  placement  of  1.5  million
units at $1.56 each, for total proceeds of $2,340,000. 
<P>
Proceeds of the private placement will  be  used  for  working  capital  and  to finance the company's commitments for the further exploration and development of its 10% interest in the AK/CJ diamond claims in the NWT. Up to one million units of  the  private placement will be designated as flow through units for Canadian income tax purposes.                                                            

<DT>06/24/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation pertaining to the agreement  dated
April 23 1996 whereby the company has given Aurora Gold Corp the right to earn a 49% interest in  mineral  claims  in  the  South  Mining  District  of  Canada's Northwest Territories by spending $1,000,000 on property expenditures over three years. Aurora shall further have the right to earn an additional 16% interest by expending  a further $750,000 on the property. 

<DT>06/19/96<DD>Mr Raj Chowdhry has been appointed  president  of  the  company  to  succeed  Mr
Praveen Varshney. Mr Varshney will continue as a director.

<DT>06/12/96<DD>Camphor Ventures has entered into a joint venture agreement with Aurora Gold  to
participate in the further exploration and development of certain mineral claims in the South mining district 
of Canada's  Northwest  Territories.  Aurora  is  a private  company  engaged  in  mineral  exploration and development in key North American mining regions.                                                        
<P>
The properties, as outlined in  the  agreement,  consist  of  59  claims  staked covering an area of approximately 58,000 hectares in the region of the Northwest Territories. Initial staking and ground work has been carried out by Camphor  on the  property. The Northwest  Territories  and  the  South  mining  district  are  currently highly prospective areas to foster new discoveries of gold, copper and diamonds.   For complete joint venture agreement details please call Camphor Ventures.    

<DT>06/05/96<DD>Mountain Province has received results of the first quarter  of  the  100  tonne
mini-bulk  sample  taken  of  the  5034  diamond  pipe and processed by Canamera Geological's dense 
media separation plant. Diamonds with a weight of 75.9 carats were recovered from 24.6 tonnes of processed kimberlite, for a recoverable grade of 3.09 carats per tonne. The kimberlite came from nine  drill  holes  into  the southern  and  central  parts  of  the  pipe.  The grade was found to be roughly uniform from drill hole to drill hole and from top to  bottom  in  each  of  the drill holes, considering the small size of the sample.         
<P>                 
The present results  are  an  improvement  over  the  results  for  the  initial exploration holes, and larger stones have now been recovered as well. This is as expected because of the larger sample of kimberlite 
(24.6  versus  5.8  tonnes).  Generally,  for a diamond deposit, larger stones and greater values are obtained
the larger the sample. There are nine diamonds  greater  than  0.50  carats,  53 diamonds greater than 0.20 carats and 144 diamonds greater than 0.10 carats. The five largest diamonds are 1.89, 1.53, 1.03, 0.86 and
 0.75  carats  respectively.
<P>
The DMS process does not recover all the diamonds smaller than 1.5 mm in size, which explains why the 
total grade is lower than the 5.36 carats per tonne for  stones greater  than  1  mm  reported from the earlier results using the caustic fusion recovery process. Full recovery  of  these  smaller  stones  is  not  considered
economic,  given  their  current low commercial value. 
<P>
Drilling  on  the  northern  part  on land is in progress. The deposit is calculated to be at least 20 million tonnes to a  depth of 350 metres and is still open in several directions.  
<P>                        
Exploratory drilling is continuing throughout the summer.  Additional  indicator
mineral sampling will be conducted to better define additional drilling targets.
The AK property is held 50% by Mountain Province, 40% by Glenmore Highlands  and
10% by Camphor Ventures.  For complete drill results, please call each company in Vancouver.

<DT>04/09/96<DD> Camphor Ventures have received recent results  from the AK5034 kimberlite deposit, NWT.    To date, 5,836.68 kg of exploration drill core kimberlite has been processed  by
caustic  fusion.  The  additional  1,499.10 kg of kimberlite processed since the last report of 
February 5 1996, has calculated grades that are  consistent  with previously calculated results. The largest diamond recovered from caustic fusion weighs 0.9 carats and has an octahedral form
<P>
 A summary follows:<BR>

A number of macro-sized coloured diamonds have been recovered by caustic  fusion from  the  AK5034  deposit.  At  this  early  stage, valuation of these coloured diamonds has not been pursued. 
Consequently, the  economic  potential  of  these coloured diamonds has yet to be determined.
<P>                                     
At this time, there are four drills operating on the project. Two of the  drills are  involved  with  securing  
bulk  sample  kimberlite,  one  is  drilling  the exploration targets,  and  the  fourth  is  delineating  the  AK5034  pipe.  The boundaries of the deposit are being extended and remain open to the southwest.  
<P>
The initial bulk sample core is presently being processed in the  density  media separation  unit.  
The  method of reporting diamond results from the DMS will be based on weight of recovered stones 
over 1.00 mm.  Preliminary processing of a  fraction  of  the  10  ton  batch  of  bulk  sample
kimberlite  in  the  DMS  plant  and  X-Ray sortex has returned a 1.20 carat gem quality partial octahedra 
and six diamonds of approximately  0.25  carats  each.  Processing is continuing.
<P>                                                       
The AK/CJ property is held 50% by Mountain Province, 40% by  Glenmore  Highlands
and 10% by Camphor.

<DT>03/05/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rate release of 150,000 shares from escrow. 
There are 150,000 shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>03/05/96<DD>Mountain  Province  and  Camphor  have  begun  an  aggressive  exploration   
and development program in excess of $10 million on the AK property, NWT.           
The objectives of the program are as follows:                                   
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To further define the extent of the AK5034 kimberlite pipe through a  10,000  ft
delineation drilling program; 
<LI>To collect a 100 tonne bulk sample from the AK5034 kimberlite pipe through large
diameter drilling;                                                           
<LI>To drill test at least ten, of approximately forty,  high  priority  exploration
targets  that  are  situated  in  various areas of the AK property and have been
defined by diamond indicator mineral trains as well as geophysical surveys.
</UL>
<P>
The delineation drilling has commenced. In addition, two  drills  are  presently
operating  for  the  bulk  sample  collection and the exploration drill has just
arrived on site. It is expected  that  exploration  drilling  of  the  carefully
selected targets will commence shortly.                                         
<P>
Management believes that the results of the bulk sample will be consistent  with
the  earlier  diamond results. Further, the ten exploration targets in different
regions of the AK property appear to be highly prospective for  discovering  new
kimberlite pipes. The AK/CJ property is held 50% by Mountain Province, 
40% by  Glenmore  Highlands and 10% by Camphor

<DT>11/22/95<DD>The Company announced that American Mineral Fields has withdrawn from
negotiations with Mountain Province and Camphor Ventures with respect to the AK-CJ diamond 
properties, NWT.

<DT>10/23/95<DD>The Company reported that it had entered into an
exclusive agreement with America Mineral Fields Inc. and Mountain
Province Mining Inc., pursuant to which Camphor Ventures and Mountain
Province will provide America Mineral Fields with access to technical
data and documentation relating to their AK-CJ diamond properties in
Northwest Territories, Canada.  In addition, Camphor Ventures and
Mountain Province have agreed not to negotiate with any other party the
development of, or transfer of any interest in, the AK-CJ properties, or
any other business combination or merger, for a period of 90 days. No
proposals with respect to any such transaction between the parties have
yet been considered and the parties may fail to reach agreement.

<DT>10/17/95<DD>The Company reported that a further update on the AK
property area 5034 kimberlite has been received. Extensive plans have
been made for the coming winter season.  As a consequence of the highly
favourable results obtained to date from the analysis of the AK5034, the
decision has now been made to proceed with a bulk sample.  An initial
100 tonne bulk sample will be taken with a large diameter drill, and
drilling will commence by the end of November subject having obtained
the necessary permits.  In addition to this 100 tonne bulk sample, a
significant exploration drilling program is also planned for this coming
season.  During the past summer, 1,172 till samples were collected from
AK/CJ property, most of which have been processed.  From the results of
the processing of those samples, as well as the results from a
high-sense geophysical survey to be conducted shortly, the final
definition of several identified exploration drill targets is now being
completed.  The estimated tonnage of the AK5034 kimberlite has been
updated as well, and is now calculated to be approximately 18.3 million
tonnes to a depth of 300 metres.  This tonnage figure has been derived
from a model developed from computer analysis of the delineation holes
drilled to date.  This model was created using Vulcan mine modelling
software, a state-of-the-art engineering package used world-wide for
mining and development. Processing of delineation drill core continues
and additional results are available from the Company. Cesar Palencia
has resigned as director of Mountain Province Mining Inc.

<DT>10/12/95<DD>Camphor Ventures and Mountain Province Mining Inc. were
pleased to announce that effective October 2, 1995,  they have been
upgraded to the senior board of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, under
the classification "Resource".

<DT>8/30/95<DD>Camphor Ventures Inc. reported that further detailed
results have been received from the processing to date of delineation
drill core from the AK property area 5034 kimberlite. Full details of
the drill hole may be obtained from the Company.  The Company (10%
interest), and its joint venture partners, Glemore Highlands Inc. (40%
interest) and Mountain Province Mining Inc. (50% interest) are
particularly pleased with the results received to date from the AK023
drill hole.  While the evaluation of grades remains at an early stage,
the grades received from this particular hole are encouraging, with a
total macros grade of 9.182 ct/tonne, macros greater than 1.0mm grade of
7.216 ct/tonne, macros greater than 2.0mm grade of 3.309 ct/tonne and a
total diamonds grade of 9.681 ct/tonne.  A total of 38 delineation holes
have been drilled in respect of the AK 5034 discovery. Based on
preliminary internal evaluations of the delineation efforts so far, the
companies believe that a minimum of 12 million tonnes have been
delineated to date.  At this time, the pipe still remains open in the
central and southern portions to the south, west and east.

<DT>07/20/95<DD>Directors and employees have been granted options on
638,635 shares at $2.86 expiring July 10,1997. Trading was halted at the
opening of trading on July 20,1995 and resumed at 7.00 am on July 20,
1995 after an annoucement was made.  Details results were received from

<P>
Incorporated in 1986, the Company changed its name from Sierra Madre
Resources Inc. on February 19, 1993. The Company holds a 10% working
interest in a diamond prospect in the Lac de Gras region of the
Northwest Territories.  It also holds a 25% working interest in a
diamond prospect in the Candle Lake area of Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories</B>
<P>
The Company holds a 10% working interest in  AK/CJ diamond prospects
covering approximately 600,000 acres in Lac de Gras area, Northwest
Territories.  The initial discovery was made in February 1995 at the
"5034" area and since then a program of delineation drilling and core
processing has followed to determine the size of the kimberlite deposits
and demonstrate the high diamond content. As at the end of August 1995,
38 delineation holes have been drilled in respect of the AK discovery.
Grades received from AK023 drill hole were particularly encouraging with
a Total Macros grade of 9.182 ct/tonne, Macros greater than 1.00mm grade
of 7.216 ct/tonne, macros greater than 2.00mm grade of 3.309 ct/tonne
and a total diamonds grade of 9.681 ct/tonne.  The AK/CJ property is
held 50% by Mountain Province Mining Inc., 40% by Glenmore Highlands
Inc. and 10% by Camphor Ventures Inc.
<P>
Over the next year, the joint venture partners will continue their
program of pipe delineation and sampling.  Indicator minerals have been
found on other areas of the AK property and further exploration is
planned for fiscal 1996 in anticipation of finding additional kimberlite
pipes.  The joint venture partners will continue to explore the CJ claim
where strong indications of kimberlite exist.  At least five separate
mineral trains with associated geophysical targets have been established
on the CJ claims.  Plans for drilling are being finalized.
<P>
<B>Candle Lake, Saskatchewan</B>
<P>
The Candle Lake claims are located in Central Saskatchewan and consists
of 96 separate claim blocks. Camphor Ventures with Mountain Province
Mining Inc., War Eagle Mining Company Inc. and Great Western Gold Corp.
each held a 25% interest on the Candle Lake Joint Venture Partnership.
At the end of 1994, the agreement was amended and Mountain Province's
interest was reduced.  Under the new agreement, Kennecott Canada Inc.
will earn a 60% interest in the claims leaving each of the four other
joint venture partners with a 10% interest.  After Kennecott has earned
its interest, each Company could further reduce its interest to a 7.5%
carried interest through a positive feasibility study.  The Candle Lake
claims are strategically located near kimberlite discovery sites and
Kennecott has already initiated an exploration program.

<DT>11/07/96<DD>Cimmaron Minerals has received soil geochemical results from one of its Victoria
county,  New Brunswick base metal-silver properties. Soil sample values of up to 4% lead and 0.2% zinc have been obtained from a grid covering a portion  of  the Lower  Blue  Mountain  claim  group.  The  intensity  of  these  metal values is unusually high for soil samples and are thought to exceed  those  overlying  the
nearby Sewell Brook deposits being drilled by Chapleau Resources.    Cimmaron has recently expanded its land position in  this  mineral  play  region from  17  claims  to 395 claims. Field work continues over its properties in the district.

<DT>10/10/96<DD>Connecticut Development has extended its back-in option to acquire a 5% interest
in  Castle  Rock  Exploration's  option  to  acquire a 50% interest in the large Absolut property adjacent to Castle Rock's NBK property in Labrador.     
<P>       
No additional consideration is required as a result of the  extension,  however, to  exercise  the  August  1995  back-in option and acquire a 5% interest in the Absolut property and a 10% interest in the NBK, NBJ, NBH,  NBD,  OKA  and  OKA-1 properties,  Connecticut  must pay to Castle Rock $300,000 on or before August 1
1997. In August 1995, Connecticut granted to Castle Rock  a  similar  option  to acquire a 10% interest in Connecticut's Voisey's Bay claims 783M, 784M, 812M and 813M on the same terms.      
<P>                                                   
In a rececent news release of September  11  1996,  Castle  Rock  announced  asignificant  new nickel-copper-cobalt discovery associated with ultramafic rocks on the Absolut property. A number of samples collected over a 300m strike length graded  higher  than 1.00% nickel. Field crews recovered a sample that had value
of 3.30% nickel, 3.60% copper and 0.40%  cobalt  from  one  taken  from  massive sulphide band within the ultramafic unit.

<DT>09/30/96<DD>The company has engaged Mr Bob Kolt, a director of the company, as its  investor
relations  representative  beginning  September 30 1996. 
<P>
Mr Whelan also reports encouraging zinc-lead mineralization has  been  obtained  from  a  recent  drill
program  on  the  company's New Brunswick Tower Group claims. The property is 60 kilometres from Bathurst and 15 kilometres  from  the  Caribou  zinc-lead-silver deposit currently being prepared for production.                                
An initial hole, CDC-96-1, designed to test a  geological  theory  developed  by examining  previous  exploration  data,  undercut two holes completed during the 1970's and succeeded in extending the  mineralized  zone  beneath  the  area  of previous drilling.  Complete drill core results are available from the company on both the initial drill hole <B>CDC-96-1 and  the second hole <B>CDC-96-2</B>, which extended  the  mineralization  to  the north of the previous drilling.                                                 
<P>                                                                                
Zinc-lead mineralization is contained within a more  extensive  strong  zone  of chlorite-pyrrhotite-sulphide  alteration  containing  5-40%  sulphides.  Several narrow massive sulphide sections were also cored.   
<P>                            
A third hole, drilled 100 metres south of the initial hole cored strong chlorite alteration.  The current program has indicated that the zone, which has a strike length of at least 170 metres, is open to the north along strike as well  as  to depth.             
<P>                                                            
The   extensive   chlorite-sulphide-zinc-lead-copper   mineralization-alteration encountered  in  the  diamond  drilling  is encouraging and warrants significant additional exploration

<DT>09/24/96<DD>Connecticut Development has granted an option to Cimarron Minerals to acquire  a
50%  undivided  interest  in  the  company's  230-claim  Lower Blue Mountain and Stewart Mountain claim groups adjacent to and near the Chapleau  Resources  base metal discovery in New Brunswick.       
<P>                                        
In addition, Cimarron can earn an additional  15%  interest  in  the  claims  by completing  a  bankable  feasibility study by July 31 2000. Cimarron will be the operator during the  option  period,  and  following  exercise  of  the  option, Connecticut  will  be  the operator so long as its interest in the claims is not
less than 50%.

<DT>09/20/96<DD>On September 4 1996, directors  and  employees  have  been  granted  options  on
150,000 shares at $0.27 expiring August 2 1998.
 
<DT>09/18/96<DD>The company has purchased the remaining 50% interest in the Aztec, Inca  and  Mayan  claim groups  from  its joint venture partner was completed. Connecticut now owns 100% of these claims.                                                                
<P>
The Aztec, Inca and Mayan claim groups comprise 112 mineral claim units covering 6,900 acres north of the Iskut River in northwestern BC. 
<P>                       
The company is presently conducting a prospecting and silt sampling  program  on
the  claims  to  identify  targets  for  a  more  comprehensive autumn or spring
evaluation program.

<DT>09/03/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing a sale agreement dated August  17  1996  between
the  company  and  Seguro  Project  Inc  (beneficially owned by Donald A. Simon) whereby the company has acquired a 50% undivided interest in the Inca, Mayan and Aztec  mineral claims north of the Iskut River in northwestern BC. Consideration is $12,218.00 and 100,000 shares.

<DT>08/23/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing a request to issue 75,000 shares of the  company
to  Peter  Dimmell in regards to two licences (24 mineral claims) in Voisey Bay, Labrador. 

<DT>08/22/96<DD>The company has purchased the remaining 50% interest  in  the  Aztec,  Inca  and
Mayan  claim  groups  from  its  joint venture partner. Following this purchase, Connecticut will own 100% of these claims. 
<P>                                     
The Aztec, Inca and Mayan claim groups comprise 112 mineral claim units covering 6,900 acres north of the Iskut River in northwestern BC.     
<P>                   
The company expects, this month, to implement an estimated  $50,000  prospecting and  silt  sampling  program  on  the  claims  to  identify  targets  for a more comprehensive autumn or spring exploration program.

<DT>08/19/96<DD>The company plans to initiate a diamond drilling program on the 32  claim  Tower
Group  property  in  the Bathurst mining district within the next two weeks. The drill program will consist of at least two holes will  assess  a  sulphide  zone where  intercepts  of  up to 10.74% lead-zinc over 1.7 feet and 4.5 oz Ag/t over 16.1 feet were obtained from previous drilling.    
<P>                             
Limited lithogeochemical sampling has indicated a strong Na  depletion  zone  on the property.
<P>                                                                   
The airborne electromagnetic survey by the provincial  and  federal  governments for    the    Bathurst,    NB    base    metal    mining   camp   indicates   an electromagnetic/magnetic anomaly coincident with  known  mineralization  on  the Tower  property.  As  well,  another  airborne  target may be associated with an undrilled ground electromagnetic/gravity anomaly. Following a brief confirmatory ground survey a diamond drill contract will be awarded.

<DT>07/30/96<DD>Followup work on the company's Rambler South claim groups,  on  the  Baie  Verte
Peninsula  of  northeast Newfoundland, optioned from Krinor Resources, a private Newfoundland company.   
<P>                                                        
The claims host  the  southwestern  extension  of  the  Krissy  trend,  a  major east-northeast  trending  auriferous  shear  system, which cuts intrusive quartz porphyry and the Pacquet Harbour mafic  volcanics.  The  source  of  the  Krissy boulder,  which  contains  visible  gold  and has assay values up to 69.8 g/t is
believed to  lie  within  the  Krissy  shear.  Trenching  and  drilling  to  the northeast,  along  the  shear, has located values in a trench of up to 1m of 3.2 g/t Au in a 2.7m wide shear in quartz porphyry and  narrow  drill  intersections with  economic  grades  (up  to  6.9  g/t  / 0.3m). Pyrite with minor galena and chalcopyrite are associated with the gold mineralization.  The  shear  zone  has been  traced  by airborne geophysics to the southwest of the Krissy property for 5km. No gold exploration has been carried out along the southward  extension  of the structure and a similar subparallel structure to the southeast.    
<P>        
The claims also cover a  strong,  gold  in  till  anomaly  which,  according  to Overburden Drilling management, the contractor, is close to source. The anomaly, with values up to 23 g/t and gold grain counts up to 197 grains per  sample,  is located to the southeast, cross ice, of the Krissy trend. The gold is associated
with chlorite suggesting  a  shear  zone  host  in  the  mafic  Pacquet  Harbour volcanics  which  also host the Rambler North deposits approximately 10km to the north, that are owned by Ming Minerals. Ming  Minerals  is  in  the  process  of installing  a gold circuit in their flotation mill to allow them to process gold ores. The proximity to Rambler North may allow the exploitation of even a  small gold deposit if discovered on Rambler South.  
<P>                                  
Followup work, which  will  begin  immediately,  will  consist  of  linecutting, geochemistry, geophysics, geological mapping, prospecting and trenching followed by a drill program if warranted.

<DT>12/06/95<DD>Because of weather conditios and other hindrances New Dolly Varden has been unable to expend the $ 500,000 it committed to expend before November 30, 1995 on the three properties in the Voisey Bay area of Labrador owned by Connecticut Development Corporation.  The agreement with CDC has been amended in that CDC agreed that New Dolly's option to earn a 50% undivided interest in the three properties remains in full force by New Dolly making an optional cash payment, issuing optional shares and agreeing to continue to expend moneys during the 1996 season.  About $ 200,000 was expended on the properties in 1995 providing results which justified further work.  A penelty will be paided to CDC if New Dolly does not incur the expenditures required.

<DT>11/29/95<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing a property option agreement dated October 16, 1995
whereby the company can acquire, from Peter Dimmell and Terry Merserea, a 60% interest in five mineral licences known as the Ramble South properties, Baie Verte area, Newfoundland for $ 10,000, 200,000 shares in work related stages, and work expenditures totalling $ 250,000.

<DT>11/14/95<DD>The Company has negotiated a non-brokered, flow-through
private placement consisting of 310,000 units at $0.16.  Each unit
includes one flow-through share and one warrant.  In turn, each warrant
will entitle the holder to purchase one non-flow-through share for $0.16
during the first year, and for $0.18 during the second year.  Proceeds
will be used for exploration of the Company's Newfoundland mineral
properties.
<P>
Further followup geophysical analysis will be undertaken this spring to
review the results of the autumn's aeromagnetic surveys when several small
anomalies were identified on the Company's various Voisey Bay properties. 
Further exploration has been postponed until spring due to weather
constraints.  In addition, a small exploration program has commenced on the
Rambler South properties, located in the Baie Verte area of Newfoundland.

<DT>11/09/95<DD>The Company failed to receive regulatory approval on the
Hebron property acquisition, which was announced on October 16, 1995.  The
Company had signed a letter of intent with September Resources for an option
to earn a 50% undivided interest in property licences in Labrador for cash
and shares to be issued to September Resources no later than October 30,
1995.  Further, the Company has cancelled the non-brokered, flow-through
private placement consisting of 1,000,000 units at $0.30 which had been
announced on September 25, 1995.

<DT>10/13/95<DD>The Company has signed a letter of intent with September
Resources to acquire an undivided 50% interest in mineral licenses 3400M,
3411M, 3412M and 3413M, in the Hebron area of Labrador, Newfoundland. 
Connecticut may exercise the option and earn a 50% undivided interest in the
licenses, by paying $20,000 and issuing 50,000 shares of Connecticut, no
later than October 19, 1995.  Further, the Company must incur eligible
exploration expenditures on the licences totalling not less than $60,000 by
June 15, 1996, and delivering a geological report to September Resources by
August 1, 1996.  Connecticut will be the operator during the option period

<DT>10/04/95<DD>The Company reported that three new Nickel-Copper-Cobalt
discoveries, recently located by Castle Rock Exploration Corp.'s field
crews, the NBK, the Okak and the Krinor, will be drill tested beginning
approximately October 16, 1995.  These discoveries were located between 60
and 120 km north of the Voisey Bay discovery.  Drill permits for all three
properties have been granted.  It is Castle Rock's intention to drill test
both the NBK and the Okak discoveries at approximately the same time.  The
winter camp recently established at Iglu Lake will serve as the Company's
base of operations for the three properties:
<P>
NBK Discoveries:  Airborne electromegnetic surveys, ground max-min EM
surveying and surface prospecting have defined six EM conductors associated
with elevated Nickel-Copper-Cobalt values.  A minimum of six holes are
planned to test the EM conductors.  The NBK property is 100% owned by Castle
Rock with a 10% back-in interest to Connecticut Development.  Values up to
1.71% Ni, 1.90% Cu and 0.23% Co were recorded from one of the showings.
<P>
Okak Discovery:  Semi-massive to massive sulphide mineralization carrying
consistent elevated values in Ni, Cu, and Co have now been recorded along
the edge of northwest-trending valley for approximately 3 km.  Consistent
values exceeding 1.0% Ni have been recorded over a 500m strike length with
the highest sample recorded at 1.76% Ni, 1.34% Cu, and 0.21% Co.  The
mineralization appears to be associated with geology similar to the Voisey
Bay discovery some 120km south.  A max-min electromagnetic survey conducted
in the valley immediately north of the massive sulphide zone has detected a
strong EM conductor trending parallel to the mineralization.  Initially,
five holes are planned to test the Okak discovery.  The Okak property is a
joint venture between Castle Rock and United Compass Resources whereby both
companies can each earn a 35% interest from Newfoundland Mining &
Exploration.
<P>
Krinor Discovery:  a number of massive sulphide zones trending northeasterly
and northwesterly have been identified on the Krinor property, a joint
venture between Castle Rock, Consolidated Magna Ventures and the Arc
Resource Group.  Surface samples confirm highly anomalous values in Copper,
Nickel and Cobalt.  The best value to date was 0.52% Cu, 1.31% Ni, and
0.212% Co.  Airborne EM and magnetic surveys are scheduled to be completed
October 10 over the Krinor property.  Ground max-min EM surveys are being
conducted over the massive sulphide zones to define the potential drill
targets. Castle Rock will operate and can earn a 33.33% interest in the
Krinor property.  It is the Company's intention to drill this property this
year.
<P>
All the above discoveries are within the Nain Plutonic suite and all have
the potential of hosting economic Nickel-Copper -Cobalt deposits.
	
<DT>10/03/95<DD>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has accepted for filing an agreement dated July 1, 1995, whereby
Charles Michael Development Corporation, controlled by Kevin Whelan, will provide the Company
with management services for $4,000 per month.

<DT>09/22/95<DD>The Company reported that a non-brokered, flow-through
private placement consisting of 1,000,000 units priced at $0.30 per unit has
been negotiated.  Each unit includes one flow-through common share of the

purchase one non-flow- through common share of the Company for $0.30 during
the first year following the closing date, and for $0.35 during the second
year following the closing date.  The proceeds from the private placement
will be used for exploration of the Company's Newfoundland mineral
properties.

<DT>09/11/95<DD>Recently completed airborne electromagnetic and magnetic
survey over the NBK property has confirmed four distinct conductive zones
that are interpreted to be caused by massive sulphide mineralization.  All
four conductors are entirely within the NBK property limits.  Surface
samples have been taken from several of the anomalies.  Tests show that
significant concentrations of nickel, copper and cobalt were found.  Work
will continue on the property over the winter including a drill program.

<DT>10/25/96<DD>The company has signed an agreement to acquire a 100% undivided interest  in  18 mineral  claims  in  Manitoba.  The claim are in the Little Bear Lake region 100 miles northeast of Winnipeg.
<P> 
The Little Bear Lake property  was  previously  explored  by  several  companies including  Highwood  Resources  which  adopted  a regional exploration approach, establishing an extensive grid system  and  conducting  ground  geophysics.  The geophysical  program  identified several large conductors ranging up to one mile in length which are interpreted to be mineralized shear zones with the potential to host bulk tonnage gold deposits.    
<P>                                         
Several high grade  gold  and  silver-bearing  quartz  veins  exist  within  the company's claim boundaries and these occur in highly deformed, intensely altered rocks of  variable  composition.  Aerial  photography  has  also  confirmed  the existence of large cross-cutting structures on the property.   
<P>          
In recent years, sampling of vein  material  on  the  property  returned  assays ranging  from 0.97 ounce to 3.2 ounces gold per ton, although historical records indicate values as high as 9.2 ounces or better. A major forest fire has exposed considerable outcrop which will simplify prospecting and associated work. Proposed Exploration Program       
<P>                                             
The company intends to implement a geophysical program over the entire  property in  the  next few months. The existing grid system will be improved and expanded to enable correlation of previous trenching  and  other  sampling  results  with targets  defined  by  the  upcoming  geophysical program. Initial exploration is
scheduled to begin in February or March in advance of a major  diamond  drilling program.

<DT>10/17/96<DD>Mr Donald Huston of NCC Mining along with Mr David Duval of Cordal Resources and Mr Robert Paul of Sarabat Gold report further to news release of September 10 1996, the companies have amended  the terms of the agreement for the Ogden township property.        
<P>                 
Pursuant to the terms of the revised agreement, Cordal has agreed  to  fund  the first  $100,000  of  exploration expenditures on the property and contribute one third of the total option payments owed by  Sarabat  and  NCC  to  the  original property vendors up to a maximum of $40,000.  The Ogden property consists of 51 claims and  is  six  kilometres  east  of  the Band-Ore discovery in the Timmins gold camp.

<DT>10/09/96<DD>The company will not be  proceeding  with  the  private  placement  announced on September 30 1996.

<DT>09/27/96<DD>The company has arranged a non-brokered private placement to sell up to  400,000
units  at  $0.75. 
<P>
The net proceeds will be used to explore the 51 claim Ogden  township  property, six  kilometres  east  along  strike  from  the  Band-Ore  gold discovery in the prolific Timmins mining camp.

<DT>09/17/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing the company's proposal to issue 79,546 shares at
$0.44 to settle outstanding debt.

<DT>09/09/96<DD>NCC and Sarabat have entered into an agreement with Cordal whereby  Cordal  will
acquire from each of Sarabat and NCC a 16.5% interest in their Ogden property in the Porcupine mining division, Ontario. 
<P>
The Ogden property consists of 51  claims  and  is  6km  east  of  the  Band-Ore discovery in the Timmins gold camp along strike on the Destor/Porcupine fault.  
<P>
NCC, the operator, has begun a ground geophysics program on the Ogden  property, results of which are expected to confirm the existence of anomalous targets that will be tested in the ensuing weeks by a diamond drill program.

<DT>08/27/96<DD>The company has completed an internal assessment of the projects  in  Kazakhstan
that it was proposing to acquire from Interscope Company.                       
<P>
The company has decided not to proceed with the acquisition of the Arkharly  and Bolshevik  projects  given  their  limited  reserves and the capital commitments associated with developing these properties as full-fledged mining operations.  
<P>
However, Cordal is undertaking to re-negotiate under more favourable  terms  the exploration license and joint venture agreement for the Skyline project. Skyline encompasses 9,000 sq km of highly prospective exploration  ground  abutting  the Bakyrchik gold mine in northwestern Kazakhstan.  Cordal's  representative  office  in  Kazakhstan  is  also   investigating   the acquisition  of  other license in areas with historical production and developed infrastructure.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cordal Resources Limited</B></FONT>
<P>
Incorporated in British Columbia in 1981, the Company changed its name from Twin Eagle Resources Inc. to its present name in 1993 on the basis of one new share for four old shares.  In addition to its US and Canadian interests, the Company is in a joint venture with the Kazakhstan Geological Institute in acquiring two significant producing gold and silver properties:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Arkharly Project, Kazakhstan</B>
<P>
<P>
This property hosts seven discrete ore deposits, the most prominent of which, Arkharly, was mined by open pit and underground mining methods between 1964 and 1995.  According to Kazakh authorities, the mine has recoverable gold reserves of 53.1 tonnes (1.7 million ounces), along with 847.6 tonnes (27 million ounces) of silver, representing a resource of 10 million tonnes averaging 5.3 grams gold per tonne (0.15 oz/t) and 84.6 grams (2.5 ounces) silver. Further underground development work will be required to access known veins and prove up additional mineable reserves for future production.
<P>
Exploration has been limited on adjoining deposits but authorities have incorporated data from these areas into a geological resource for the Arkharly license area which is now estimated to be 69.7 tonnes (2.2 million ounces) of gold and 960.9 tonnes (31 million ounces) of silver.
<P>
Arkharly and its satellite deposits include epithermal gold-silver vein occurences situated within and outside of a caldera (a volcanic collapse structure) with which gold deposition in the region is associated.  More than 300 veins have been discovered to date, sixty of which are mineralized with gold and silver in a sulphide-deficient environment.  The metallurgical characteristics of the ore appear to be very favourable and conducive to standard recovery methods including gravity separation.  Commercial tonnages have been outlined to depths of 150 metres and drilling has indicated vein continuity to depth, suggesting the reserve estimates may be significantly understated.
<P>
Internal estimates indicate a capital cost of $15 million to achieve production which would include the construction of a mill with an optimum capacity of 200,00 tonnes per year.  An assessment of Arkharly's reserve status is planned by the Company employing North American mining industry standards.
<P>
<P>
<B>Bolshevik Deposit, Kazakhstan</B>
<P>
<P>
The Bolshevik Deposit is structurally-controlled and is associated with a major east-west trending fault structure that hosts numerous gold deposits, several of which are being mined at present.  The Bakyrchik deposit, five kilometres to the east, has reserves of 9 - 15 million ounces (some of which are highly refractory) and is being developed by Bakyrchik Gold, a London Stock Exchange listing.  Mining entrepreneur Robert Friedland is involved in a consortium that is a major shareholder in Babyrchik Gold.
<P>
Deposits in the region occur within a prominent fault zone that is hundreds of metres wide, a feature that is amenable to developing large reserves.  Five discrete orebodies have been identified on the Bolshevik property and reserves have been defined by 96,000 metres of drilling to a depth of 600 metres.  The arsenic content appears to be ten times less than Bakyrchik, suggesting refractory ores will not be a problem in a production scenario.
<P>
The Kazakhs have established reserves of 32,420 kilograms (1.0 million ounces) for the project at an average grade of 6.4 grams per tonne (0.19 oz/t).  Open pit mining would be applicable to 18% of the indicated reserve base and the remainder would have to be recovered by underground methods.  The existing mining operation includes a crushing plant and involves rail shipments of crushed material to a processing facility 180 kilometres away, followed by smelting at another facility 1,100 kilometres further away.  A rationalization of the project would include the construction of a minimum 200 tonne per day production facility on site at an estimated cost of $3 - 4 million.

<DL>
<DT>10/29/96<DD>The company is currently negotiating a private  placement  of  up  to  3,000,000 shares at $0.66 for gross proceeds of $1,980,000. 
<P>
Proceeds are to be used for further development of the Sarcee  project,  Mexican exploration projects and general working capital.
<P>
<DT>10/25/96<DD>The initial results of the company's testing program at its Sarcee  9-1-23-4  W5
well  on  the  Tsuu  T'Ina  Indian Reserve a few miles west of Calgary have been received. A test of the Crossfield member  of  the  Devonion  Wabamun  formation resulted in the recovery of formation water with no associated hydrocarbons. 
<P>   
The company is now in the process of testing  the  Mississippian  Turner  Valley formation, which is the major producing zone in this area.                      

<DT>10/17/96<DD>Completion and testing operations have begun on the Sarcee 9-1-23-4 W5  well  on
the  Tsuu T'ina Indian Reserve a few miles west of Calgary. This well, which was drilled and cased to a total depth of 3847m earlier this year by Young West  Oil &  Gas, penetrated 171 net feet of potential pay in the Crossfield member of the Devonian Wabamun formation. In addition, the well encountered 166  net  feet  of
potential pay in the Mississippian Turner Valley formation.   
<P>                  
Mart, along with its partners Dynamic Ventures, Dalton  Resources  and  Neutrino Resources,  expect  to  have  initial test results from the Crossfield member by early next week. Testing of the Turner Valley zone will then follow immediately.  The 9-1 well is on a 19 1/2 section permit  on  the  Reserve  from  which  eight
sections  of leasehold will be selected upon completion of the production tests.  Mart and its partners plan to proceed quickly with further development  of  this acreage based on thorough analyses of the test results.

<DT>10/04/96<DD>The the results from  the  recently  completed  6  hole  diamond  drill  program
completed  on the Guadalupana property, near the village of Potrero de Bojorquez in southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico have been received.        
<P>                   
The Guadalupana mine has a production  history  dating  back  to  the  Spaniards searching for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains in the 1700's. During the early 1940's the property operated for several years as a high  grade  copper-tungsten producer,  with  production  being  derived  from at least three high grade vein
systems up to 5  metres  in  width.  Since  the  company's  acquisition  of  the property, exploration efforts have concentrated on the potential of developing a large, open pit polymetallic  porphyry  deposit  within  a  1.5  X  3  kilometre alteration  zone surrounding the old workings. To date, a total of 10 widespread
drill holes have been completed within a 1 X 1.5 kilometre portion of this zone. Results from the first four holes were previously released. The latest six holes combined with the earlier results indicate an  overall  grade  of  approximately 0.02  opt  gold equivalent, with a significant number of sections above 0.08 opt
equivalent.  For complete drill results on this Mexican property, please call the company.                                   
<P>                                                                               
In addition, the property is now in a position to enable production of a limited tonnage of high grade copper ore with significant gold and silver, values. Based on the strength of these encouraging results, the company intends to advance the pace of exploration over the coming months.

<DT>10/02/96<DD>An agreement has been reached regarding the acquisition of a  100%  interest  in
the Goldnote property, in Pershing County, Nevada. This gold property covers 686 acres and includes two former producers. One of  these  is  the  Goldnote  mine, which  has  over  3.5  miles  of underground workings developed on at least five different veins and produced ore early in the century that graded 0.75  oz/t  Au and  12.0 oz/t Ag. 
<P>
A second set of old workings consisting of four adits  occurs  in  the  southern portion  of  the  property.  Here  a  shallow  dipping  zone, or zones, has been measured at 9 ft true thickness and has returned values of  0.136  oz/t  Au  and 1.97 oz/t Ag.
<P>                                                                   
In addition, the property hosts another, newly uncovered gold  bearing  vein  in the central area of the property. 
<P>                                              
The company  plans  an  aggressive  and  comprehensive  exploration  program  to commence as soon as possible.  
<P>                                                 
The terms of the acquisition require the company to issue 250,000 shares to  the vendor,  pay  US$23,400  to  the  vendor  and  finance an independent geological report.

<DT>09/30/96<DD>The company has negotiated a private placement of 1,000,000 shares at $0.80 with its  employees.   Proceeds are to  be  used  for  general  working  capital  and  resource exploration expenditures.

<DT>09/26/96<DD>The company has acquired a 75% interest in nine mining claim blocks in  McArthur
township,   Porcupine   mining   division  near  Timmins,  Ontario.  Preliminary prospecting has located a massive quartz vein, approximately 15 feet wide, which contains  abundant  pyrite chalcopyrite and occasional fine free gold. Nine grab samples taken across the vein have returned significant metal values.  Please call the company for complete details of the sample values received.             
<P>
Encouraged by the results of initial  sampling,  the  company  has  mobilized  a diamond  drill  to  the  site  to  begin an aggressive drilling program prior to freeze up.

<DT>09/17/96<DD>Dynamic Ventures Ltd. has been advised by Young West Oil & Gas  that  they  have
transferred their 40% participation in the Tsuu Tvina Reserve Oil & Gas Drilling program  to  Mart  Resources  for  cash  shares,  overriding  royalties,  and  a consulting contract.        
<P>                                                    
Young  West  further  advises  that  Mr  Keith  Ferries,  president  of  Ferries Engineering  has  been  retained  to  provide  the  engineering  supervision for completion and testing of the Sarcee 9-1 well. He will be assisted  by  Mr  Hugh Leiper,  a  well known drilling and completion specialist, in the scheduling and testing of the well.                                                            
<P>
Testing will take approximately three  weeks  as  the  logs  indicate  potential production  from 210 feet of net pay in three zones encompassing the Wabamun and Turner valley formations.
<P>
In addition, the company has been advised by the operator  of  their  intent  to re-enter  the Sarcee BP 3-26-23-4-W5 well drilled seven years ago with indicated production from the Upper Turner Valley zone. Three  D  seismic  indicates  this well  is  on  the  western  edge  of  the Turner Valley zone so the well will be horizontally drilled 1,000 metres to the east where seismic indicates  that  all three Turner valley zones should be encountered in a new pool. The well could be comparable to the Sarcee Shell 12-6 well, two miles south, which has produced 86 bcf  and  273,000  of  bbl  condensate.  The company has 40% participation, Mart
Resources 40%, Dalton Resources 10% and Neutrino Resources 10%.

<DT>09/09/96<DD>After prolonged negotiations, Tucan  Ventures  has  reached  an  agreement  with
Dynamic  Ventures  by  which  they  will  purchase  a  25%  interest  in  twelve exploration permits in western Newfoundland. Under the same  agreement,  Tucan's joint venture partner, Canadian Roxana Resources, will also sell a 25% interest, giving Dynamic a 50% participation interest. 
<P>                                   
Upon completion of this transaction, Tucan and Roxana  will  have  retained  and jointly  hold  a  50%  interest  in  13  permits totalling approximately 419,000 hectares located onshore along the west coast of Newfoundland.     
<P>             
In August, Dynamic increased its holdings in Tucan's original exploration permit No.  93-101 to a 50% participation interest. This permit has been the subject of extensive geological and geophysical investigation over past months.  Tucan  and its partners have obtained approximately 87km of seismic data over this permit.

<DT>07/26/96<DD>Tucan's joint venture with Canadian Roxana Resources and Dynamic  Ventures  will
continue  to  focus  its  efforts  on  its broad and diverse onshore oil and gas permit holdings along the western coast of Newfoundland.     
<P>                   
Hunt Oil Company's decision to release a jack-up drilling rig  working  offshore from  the  Port au Port No. 1 discovery well will not affect the company's joint venture exploration plans. Hunt, PanCanadian and Mobil are now expected to focus their  attention  on  their onshore holdings also located on Newfoundland's west
coast.                                                                          

<DT>07/24/96<DD>Young West Oil and Gas and its partners Dynamic Ventures  and  Dalton  Resources
have  receined  an  update  on  the status of the YWOG et al Sarcee 9-1-22-4 W5M  exploratory well.                                                               
Young West is proposing that a service rig be moved in to test  all  potentially productive zones as identified from log analysis. Young West is planning to move a drilling rig onto the BP Sarcee 3-26-23-4 W5M location  that  was  drilled  in 1989  and  tested  gas in the top of the Turner Valley zone. Young West plans to
reenter this  well  and  drill  horizontally  towards  a  thicker  pay  zone  as determined from 3D seismic.                                                     
It is anticipated that work on these two wells will commence in  the  very  near future.

<DT>07/19/96<DD>The second phase drilling program has commenced  on  the  company's  Guadalupana
property in Chihuahua, Mexico.   It is anticipated that a minimum of 5,000 feet of drilling will be completed  in this phase.

<DT>07/10/96<DD>The company has dispatched personnel to Calgary for the  purpose  of  completing
negotiations for joint venture participation in twelve recently acquired oil and gas exploration permits totaling approximately 900,000 acres along  the  western coast  of  Newfoundland.  Four of these permits are in southwestern Newfoundland partially bordering permits operated by Hunt Oil in partnership with PanCanadian and  Mobil.  Hunt  Oil's  deep  test  currently driilling in 275 feet. 
<P>
Tucan's principal project is a joint  venture  with  Canadian  Roxana  Resources Limited  and  Dynamic  Ventures  Ltd  of  Calgary.  Data from a recent completed seismic acquisition program is currently being processed and additional work  is planned  for  this  summer.  The  considerable  acreage  position is the largest on-shore holding in western Newfoundland and hold multiple target opportunities.
Sealed bids covering off-shore parcels well north of the Hunt discovery will  be announced the 30th of this month. The company's joint venture nominee, Sandhurst Roxana Exploration Ltd holds two tracts on-shore bordering the shoreline in this region.

<DT>07/05/96<DD>Mr Robert Fedun has acquired 2,629,616 shares pursuant  to  a  transfer  with-in

<DT>07/02/96<DD>The company's joint venture with Dynamic Ventures and Canadian Roxana  Resources
has completed a 73.16km seismic acquisition program over its 85,928 acre oil and gas exploration permit located onshore in southwestern  Newfoundland  along  the Bay of St. George.
<P>                                                              
The venture had previously reprocessed 13km of additional data acquired in 1989. Of specific interest is an anticlinal feature known as the Flat Bay Anticline on which several shallow core holes indicated the presence  of  hydrocarbons.  This feature  covers  in  excess  of  20,000  acres and was the target of most of the
acquired seismic data. 
 <P>                                                       
On March 22 1996,  the  company,  as  part  of  a  separate  joint  venture,  wa successful  in  acquiring 12 additional tracts totalling close to 900,000 acres.  These tracts are positioned  in  various  blocks  along  the  western  coast  of Newfoundland  and  offer  promise  of  a diverse range of sediments and trapping mechanisms. Remote sensing using photogeology and satellite imagery is currently under  way  and will be followed with surface studies and geophysical evaluation as soon as practicable.

<DT>06/28/96<DD>Tucan Ventures has taken note of Talisman Energy's announcement that  tests  did
not justify a completion attempt on a well drilled from an onshore location to a point under the Bay of St. George in southwestern  Newfoundland.  Tucan's  joint venture  partners,  Dynamic  Ventures  and  Canadian  Roxana  Resources  are not affected by this event as  the  target  was  a  geologic  feature  separate  and
distinct  from  the joint venture's property. Hunt and PanCanadian continue with their offshore test six miles south of their onshore discovery well.   
<P>         
As of this date, a seismic acquisition program is being completed  over  one  of the  venture's  exploratory  permits.  The  85,928  acre oil and gas exploration permit EP 93-101 is located in the carboniferous basin across the bay  from  the Hunt discovery well. 

<DT>06/25/96<DD>The company has awarded a  contract  to  Sierra  Madre  Drilling  SA  De  DV  of
Chihuahua,  Mexico  for  its second phase of diamond drilling at the Guadalupana mine site in the State of Chihuahua. It is anticipated that a minimum  of  5,000 feet of drilling will be completed in this phase. Planned drilling will commence by July 8 1996, with assay results released as they become available.           
The decision to advance the exploration program to  the  second  phase  drilling stage  was  based on encouraging results from first phase drilling and anomalous copper, gold and  silver  results  from  a  recently  completed  soil  and  rock geochemical sampling program.

<DT>06/12/96<DD>The company has reached an agreement to acquire a private company holding  a 
 5% working interest in 86,000 acres 32 miles east of Cape St George, with Sandhurst Roxana. 
<P>                                                                        
Dynamic has also reached an agreement to acquire a private company which holds a 90%  working  interest and co-operatorship in approximately 860,000 acres on the west coast of newfoundland. Sixty miles of these permits  offset  the  Hunt  and Talisman lands, presently being drilled in St Georges Bay.                      
<P>
On June 10 1996, Dynamic and Sandhurst Roxana jointly commenced  a  50  mile  2D seismic  program 
over a 40 sq mile anticlinal structure, currently delineated by aeromagnetic and seismic data, on the eastern edge of St Georges  Bay.  Gas  and oil  shows,  at  shallow  depths,  have  been  reported on the north end 
of this structure in the late 1950's.
Sedimentary basins yielding substantial oil  and  gas  reserves  from  Paleozoic rocks  occur  along  the  Appalachian  mountain  trend of eastern North America. Western Newfoundland contains sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age,  very  similar to  those  found  in Texas and Oklahoma. Lower Ordovician St George group rocks, (the same age and lithology as the Ellenburger group rocks of Texas), have  been extensively  folded  and  faulted,  resulting  in  large  structures  capable of trapping major hydrocarbon reserves. In western Newfoundland,  Lower  Ordovician St  George  group  rocks,  (the  same age and lithology as the Ellenburger group rocks of Texas), have been extensively folded and faulted,  resulting  in  large structures  capable  of trapping major hydrocarbon reserves. This, combined with the presence of oil shows, oil seeps, minor oil. production from the Ordovician, and  relative  lack of exploratory drilling, marks western Newfoundland as 
a new and exciting frontier for oil exploration.   

<DT>06/11/96<DD>The company's joint venture with Dynamic Ventures and Canadian Roxana Resources,
known  as  Sandhurst  Roxana has completed surveying and is currently concluding seismic data acquisition on the venture's 85,928 acre oil and gas  permit  along the  Bay  of St. George in southwestern Newfoundland, bordering the permit under which  Talisman  is  currently  drilling  a  3,600  metre  test. 
<P>
The joint venture nominee company, Sandhurst Roxana  Exploration,  has  recently acquired   12  additional  permits  along  the  western  shore  of  Newfoundland approximating 1 million  acres.  An  extensive  photo  geology  study  utilizing current satellite imagery is planned. As of this date, the company is assembling
for evaluation a database consisting of known and available geophysical data and geological studies.

<DT>05/02/96<DD>Barry Kaplan Associates of Fair Haven, New Jersey, have been  appointed  
as  the company's   financial   public   relations  consultant  for  the  US,  effective immediately.                                                                The initial term of the agreement  is  for  six  months  at  a  monthly  fee  of US$3,500.

<DT>04/30/96<DD>Young West Oil & Gas and its partners Dynamic Ventures (40%),  
Dalton  Resources(10%), and Neutrino Resources (10%) announce that its foothills exploratory well
YWOG et al Sarcee 9-1-23-4-(W5M) has been drilled to total depth and  logs  were run  in  the  porous section of the Crossfield zone. Casing will be run to total depth and then further testing will be conducted.                               
Studies are under way for the location of the next well.

<DT>04/22/96<DD>An independent engineering and geological report on Encal et al Gilby  6-22-40-3
W5M  has been prepared. Based on results of openhole logging, the well exhibited several potential 
pay zones to be evaluated and completed after spring  breakup.  Oil  in  place  from  a  16.5  metre  net oil 
pay zone in the Banff formation is greater than 8 million barrels. Using a conservative 15% recovery factory,  
this pool should be capable of producing in excess of 1.2 million barrels of oil.  Further exploitation of the 
Banff zone could be accomplished through drilling on 160  acre  spacings  in  the  section.  Other 
hydrocarbon potential in this well includes a 30 metre gas/condensate zone in the Nisku formation, 
and  a  7  metre oil zone in the Camrose formation.

<DT>04/03/96<DD>The company has finalized an agreement to acquire a private  company  holding  
a 25%  interest  in  petroleum  exploration  permit  No. 93-101, comprising  85,928 acres. The permit 
is along the Bay of St  George  in  southwestern  Newfoundland within close proximity of the reported 
Hunt Port au Port No. 1 light oil wildcat discovery in Newfoundland.
<P>                                        
The private  company  being  acquired  by  Dynamic  is  in  advanced  stages  of negotiations to acquire an additional 25% in permit No. 93-101.  Notwithstanding the above discussed position, the company's  
partner,  Sandhurst Roxana  Exploration,  was  successful  in  acquiring an additional 250,000 acres
adjoining to the south. By prior agreements, the company will have a first right refusal in participation.

<DT>04/02/96<DD>The company has received results from exploration on its Guadalupana 
property in Mexico's Chihuahua state.  
<P>
Two exploration  targets  on  this  high  temperature,  polymetallic  epithermaldeposit  are being 
tested. The primary target is a 5,000 x 3,000 foot alteration zone surrounding  the  high  grade  
copper-gold-silver  vein  systems  with  the secondary  target being the down dip extensions of 
the veins. 37 bedrock samples collected across a 1,700 foot north-south cross section of this 
alteration  zone returned  an  average  assay of 0.028 opt Au equivalent. One sample grading 0.32 opt Au 
and three samples grading up to 32 opt Ag  were  excluded.  Local  miners sporadically mine the 
residual gravels in this area for placer gold. The largest nugget recently recovered apparently 
weighed 7 grams less  than  2  kilos.  Four diamond  drill  holes,  designed  to test the 
boundaries of this section and its potential  to  host  significant  porphyry  values,  were  recently  
completed.  Alternate 5 foot sections of the holes that were split and sent to Chemex Lab in
Vancouver.  Results from the lab are available from the company.                                        
<P>                                                                               
The current metal prices are $4.50  to  US$20/tonne,  or  an  average  value  of
US$12.25/tonne.  ICP  analysis  of random core samples suggest the zone may also
carry significant molybdenum and  tin  values  which  may  further  enhance  the
overall  value.  At  these values the economics are excellent, particularly when
the total zone has the potential to host  reserves  of  up  to  200-250  million
tonnes to the 500 foot horizon. 
<P>                                                
On the secondary target, dewatering the workings permitted sampling of the  main
vein  at  the  bottom  of a winze 120 feet below the existing workings. Two chip
samples across a 6 foot section of the vein returned an average assay  of  13.7%
Cu and 16.5 opt Ag.   
<P>                                                         
A six ton bulk sample was cut from the main vein on the No.  4  level  and  hand
cobbed  to check the potential for producing high grade direct shipping ore. Two
splits from the resulting two ton high grade sample were sent to the Asarco  and
San Luis smelters for analysis. Results are available from the company.                        
<DT>03/27/96<DD> The joint venture of Young West Oil,  Dynamic  Ventures,  Dalton  Resources  
and Neutrino  Resources  have  received  information that record drilling time for a foothills well 
has been achieved to date on its YWOG et al  Sarcee  9-1-23-4(W5) and  that intermediate casing 
is expected to be run this weekend into the top of the Turner Valley zone which is the first of many 
zones to be  tested.  As  this well is classified as tight-hole, no further information can be released 
at this time.

<DT>03/07/96<DD>The company has completed the first  phase  of  exploration  on  its  
Chihuahua, Mexico  property.  The  company  anticipates  having assays available within ten
days.           
<P>                                                                
Messrs Doug Robertson, Robert Fedun and Jeff Arsenych report Dalton Resources, 
Dynamic Ventures and Neutrino Resources have  formed  a  joint sponsorship  of a 
Tsuu T'ina Nation individual in the Southern Alberta Institute of  Technology,

T'ina Nation lands. The well is expected to reach total depth  in  approximately
eight weeks.

<DT>02/25/96<DD>Encal et al Gilby 6-22-40-3 W5M has been cased after the completion  
of  logging and  testing.  Encal  and Dynamic are moving forward with the completion of this
well. The company has increased its interest by an additional 10% to 30% working interest in 
this project. The  company  has  begun  an  exploration  program  on  its  Chihuahua,   
Mexico exploration property.

<DT>02/19/95<DD>The Encal et al Gilby 6-22-40-3 W5M well has been drilled  to  total  depth  and
logging has been completed. Currently the well is being tested.

<DT>02/15/96<DD>The company reports YWOG et al Sarcee 9-1-23-4W5M  has  commenced  
drilling  on  the  Sarcee  Indian reservation, 12 miles southwest of Calgary. This well will evaluate 
multi zone uphole  potential,  as  well  as  the  Turner Valley  and  Wabamun.  A recent 3D seismic 
program has revealed a large folded Wabamun feature with an area extent of six square miles.                        
Potential reserves could be in excess of 200 bcf plus liquids.  This  well  will take approximately
90 days to drill to a depth of 3700m.

<DT>02/07/96<DD>The company is negotiating a private placement of a  minimum  
of  $5,000,000  at $0.95 per share with a group of European banks.  Drilling is continuing 
on Encal et al Gilby 6-22-40-3 W5M. Moving of the rig for the Sarcee location has 
commenced and it is anticipated that it will spud within one week.

<DT>01/01/31<DD>Mr Robert Fedun, pleased  to  report  that  the corporation  has  been  
informed  that  YWOG  et al Sarcee 9-1-23-4 W5M has been licensed on the Sarcee Indian Reserve.                                          
The well is expected to be spudded by February 8 1996. Drilling is  expected  to take three 
months to complete.  Encal et al Gilbey 6-22-40-3 W5M, commenced drilling on  January  14  1996.  
The well intends to test the Nisku and Leduc formations.  Drilling is continuing.    

<DT>01/30/96<DD>The company has reached an agreement in principle to acquire a  private  
company holding  a  25% working interest in a petroleum exploration permit along the Bay
of St George in Southwestern Newfoundland within close proximity of the reported
Hunt Port au Port No. 1 light oil wildcat discovery.  The private company is currently 
negotiating for an additional working  interest in the petroleum exploration permit.                                            
The company anticipates receiving a  drilling  license  on  its  Sarcee  project
within days.                                                                    

<DT>01/12/96<DD>Encal et al Gilby 6-22-40-3 W5M is preparing to spud, targeting the
Leduc formation.  A four sq mile 3D seismic program has identified a full Leduc pinnacle reef
buildup showing clear separation from the main Rimbey - Homglen Leduc reef trend.  Dynamic
Ventures holds a 20% BPO working interest in this prospect and a 20% working interest in two
additional sections of land indicating a possible second Leduc pinnacle reef buildup.  Drilling
expected to take up to four weeks.
 
<DT>01/10/96<DD>Dalton Resources has acquired a 10% working interest in the Young West Oil &
Gas Sarcee participation agreements with the Tsuu T'ina Energy Corp.
Dalton to pay 10% of the cost to drill a 3,600m Wabamun test well to earn a 7.5% interest after payout
in an eight section block.  The shallower Rundle formation in this block has produced in excess of 165 bcf
from two wells over a 30 year period.  Dalton has the ability to earn an 10% interest in up to 25,000 acres.
The first well is expected to spud in the next 30 days.

<DT>12/06/95<DD>The Company is pleased to announce by an agreement made and entered into as of August 31, 1995 it acquired all the shares of 663654 Alberta Ltd., a private company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Alberta, from Young West Oil & Gas Ltd., in consideration of the issuance of 1,600,000 treasury shares of the Corporation at a deemed price of $ 1.05 per share and the assumption and payment of $ 1,000,000 in debt due by 663654 Alberta Ltd. to Young West Oil & Gas Ltd.  Full details are available from the Company .  Please phone: +1 (604) 861-5573 for agreement details.
	
<DT>12/04/95<DD>The Company reported that it has entered into an agreement with an intermediate oil and gas company to earn a working interest, 20% before payout and 15% after payout, in two sections of land in west-central Alberta, with an option on two additional sections.  With reference to this property, two Leduc pinnacle reefs have been identified by a 4 sq. km. 3D seismic shoot which images the main Leduc reef trend and identifies clear separation of the pinnacle reef plays from the main Leduc reef trend.  It is anticipated that
the first well will spud in early 1996.  The Company has advanced $400,000 as its drilling commitment
and is obligated to  issue 250,000 shares at $0.60 per share in connection with this transaction.
The Company also reported that it has dropped its interest in two blocks of land in the Voisey Bay area of
Labrador straddling Tasisuak Lake and the Musselwhite property in Northern Ontario.  In addition, the
Company has earned a 10% working interest in each of the Mary Mac prospect and Frederickson Lake
prospect by issuing 100,000 shares for each prospect for a total of 200,000 shares.  The Company has no
further obligation to issue any additional share consideration in respect of these two prospects and has no
right to earn any further interest, other than the 10% working interest which has been fully earned.

<DT>11/15/95<DD>The Company reported that G.A. Tomlinson of Tulsa,
Oklahoma has been appointed as a director to fill a vacancy as a result
of the resignation of Nestor Pukalo.  Robert Fedun, President, has been
appointed as chief financial officer.  Mr. Tomlinson has been a
professional engineer since 1953 and has been engaged in the acquisition
and development of mining properties in Mexico as an owner of Esperenza
Mining.

<DT>11/13/95<DD>The Company reported that it was renegotiating its
involvement in the following properties: Musselwhite; Frederickson Lake
propect; Marymac prospect; and Voisey Bay property comprising 81 claim
blocks straddling Tasisuak Lake.  It is management's intention to reduce
the Company's financial obligation to the above properties with a view
to focusing its efforts on its oil and gas prospects in Western Canada
and its mineral prospects in Mexico.

<DT>10/11/95<DD>The Company reported that a horizontal re-entry well has
been commenced at 15-34-45-28 W4M in the Westerose area of central Alberta. 
Two wells recently re-entered and completed by a major oil company have
realized extraordinary production rates.  The one re-entry well immediately
offsets the company's lands in section 34.  A third reentry well is
currently drilling north of the company's location at 3-46-28 W4M.  The
horizontal section of the company's well will be evaluated within two weeks. 
If successful, an additional directional/horizontal well will be drilled in
the same location.

<DT>09/29/95<DD>The Company reported that the Pretero mine in the Mexican
state of Chihuahua is scheduled to go into production within 30 days.  The
mine development has revealed that the system contains a central core area
that hosts several wide massive quartz sulphide veins carrying impressive
high grade copper values. The veins that have been explored so far vary in
width between 3 to 10 feet, have a vertical elevation of 600 feet and a
lateral distance of approximately 1,200 feet.  The mineralization consists
of chalcopyrite, chalcocite and covellite.  Ore that was shipped previously
from this location graded an average of 12% copper, with varying amounts of
gold and silver.  The Company is cuurently acquiring and shipping equipment
to the mine site.  The equipment will be capable of mining 50 tons per day
of high grade copper ore.  Associated with the copper will be gold, silver
and tungsten.  It is estimated that the ore mined at this location will have
a gross return of US$500 to US$600 per ton. It is further estimated that the
current indicated reserves are 206,000 tons of ore grading an average of 7%
copper with associated gold, silver and tungsten.  This places an estimated
value on the ore body of US$111,650,000. While the high grading mining
operation is occurring, additional diamond drilling along the strike and at
depth will take place whereby it is felt that the 206,000 ton ore reserve
can be increased substantially.  Originally developed as a high grade
tungsten property, during the preliminary assessment exploratory work done
at the mine site, the brecciated zone carrying scheelite values appears to
occur inside the tunnelling on both the hanging wall and footwall sides of
the central core area.  This preliminary examination suggests that high
grade scheelite values occur as (up to 50 ft) lenticular pods along strike.
One sample cut on the level No. 4 returned values of 2.24% tungsten per ton. 
Diamond drilling will also occur at this location.  It is Dynamic Ventures'
plan to expand and expedite its program in Mexico by staking additional
surrounding ground and accelerating the production and exploration end of
the operation.

<DT>09/21/95<DD>Further to the news release of September 13, 1995, the
Company, effective September 18, 1995, has acquired all the issued shares of
663654 Alberta from Young West Oil and Gas, pursuant to an exempt takeover
bid.  Pursuant to the share exchange agreement, Dynamic is obligated to
issue 11,600,000 shares and is seeking regulatory approval to do so.  As
part of the transaction, Dynamic has advanced $1 million to 663654 Alberta
to retire $1 million of indebtedness to Young West Oil and Gas.  663654
Alberta has the right, as a participant to earn an undivided 40% interest
before pay-out in a block of exploratory lands southwest of Calgary upon
which a program of approximately 62 sq. km. of 3-D seismic has been run. 
Geological and geophysical interpretation indicate the possibility of two
large potential deep gas reservoirs as well as shallow oil and gas
prospects.

<DT>09/19/95<DD>Young West Oil and Gas entered into an agreement to acquire
1,600,000 shares of Dynamic Ventures by way of a private transaction
involving the sale of shares of a private corporation to Dynamic Ventures
After this acquisition, Young West Oil and Gas will hold 11.7% of the total
issued shares of Dynamic.  At present, Young West Oil and Gas has no
intention to increase its holdings of Dynamic's shares.

<DT>9/12/95<DD>Dynamic Ventures has entered into a lock-up agreement with
the major shareholder of 663654 Alberta, Young West Oil & Gas, to acquire
all of the issued shares pursuant to an exempt takeover bid.  The company is
obligated to issue 1,600,000 shares and $1 million to acquire all of the
issued shares of 663654 Alberta.  663654 Alberta has the right to earn an
undivided 40% interest before pay-out in a block of exploratory lands
southwest of Calgary.  The company also negotiated a private placement of a
minimum of 600,000 and a maximum of 1,500,00 units at $1.05.  Each unit
consists of one share and one warrant exercisable at $1.10 for one year.

<DT>08/21/95<DD>Chandeleur Bay Production Company has signed a letter of
intent with Dynamic Ventures to participate in a diamond drill program on
their 3,000 acre Lac Fiedmont claims in the Val d'Or mining region in
Quebec, which is the site of seven producing gold mines in Canada. Upon
completion of the Phase Three of the drill program, Chandeleur Bay and
Dynamic Ventures will enter into a joint venture agreement. Preliminary
trenching and sampling on the property has revealed values of gold, copper,
zinc and silver. Diamond drilling has commenced and initial results are
expected to be available within ten days.

<DT>08/16/95<DD>Phase I Drill program has commenced on the company's Lac
Fiedmont property in Val d'Or, Quebec. The Phase I program will consist of
eight drill targets for a depth of 500 feet each.  The company's targets on
this property will be gold, copper, zinc and silver.

<DT>08/01/95<DD>Dynamic Ventures has entered into an agreement to earn up to
a 65% interest in four properties in the North Caribou-Greenstone belt,
northwestern Ontario.  The properties are on the same geology and same iron
formation that hosts the Musselwhite gold deposit owned by Placer Dome (68%)
and TVX Gold (32%).  The Company believes that these properties have
excellent potential for more Musselwhite type deposits.  Consideration for
the acquisition is comprised of $200,000 and 400,00 shares.

<DT>07/13/95<DD>The Company announced that it has negotiated the acquisition
of 50 square kilometre property in Labrador in the Lake Avineau region,
south of the Diamond Field's discovery.  This property covers a mineralized
trend 20 kilometres in length.  The Company is consulting with its engineers
to formulate a work program for this property.

<DT>07/11/95<DD>The Company has negotiated the acquisition of a 50% interest
in two separate claim blocks comprising of an aggregate of 81 claim blocks
in the Voisey Bay area of Labrador, Newfoundland.  These properties straddle
the Tasisuak Lake which is immediately south of Absolut Resources' property
identified as Block No. C.

<DT>06/19/95<DD>Dynamic Ventures is preparing a work program to commence
within one week on its recently announced acquisition in the Lake Avineau
area of Labrador.  The work programs will consist of line cutting, mag and
VLF instrument work followed by trenching and diamond drilling. The comapny
also announced that it has acquired an interest in 3,000 acres in the Lac
Fiedmont property in Val d'or, Quebec.

<DT>06/13/95<DD>The Company has completed a major property acquisition in
Labrador in the Lake Avineau region, some 225 km north of Schefferville, and

<B>Mexican Mineral Properties</B>
<P>
The Company has acquired 66.6% interest in three separate properties in
Mexico, which were acquired for the exploration of gold, copper and silver,
and related mining equipment for $300,000, subject to certain adjustments.
<P>
The Chihuahua Property is situated in the State of Chihauhau near the small
village of Petrero and covers approximately 600 hectares.  This particular
area was mined and controlled by the Mexican government for its initial
years of operations.  This mine was of particular interest to the government
because of its Tungsten reserve.  Previous smelter returns on ore from this
location indicated copper values running at 15% to 20%, gold at 0.25 ounces
per ton and silver at 10 to 15 ounces per ton.  An independent geologist has
been engaged to confirm these values.  Dynamic Ventures has met with the
Minister of Mines and Minerals for Mexico and the Mexican government has
given a total commitment and assistance with road upgrading,
telecommunications and with the procurement and installation of additional
mining equipment.  This property has the potential of being mined and milled
at the rate of 100 tons per day producing mainly high grade copper and
associated gold and silver.
<P>
The Sonora Property is located in the State of Sonora and covers
approximately 400 hectares.
<P>
The Copper Valley Property covers approximately 700 hectares and is located
in the Copper Valley district of Mexico.  This area is a known copper
producing area in Mexico.  No values have been determined for this property
at this time.
<P>
<B>Oil & Gas Properties, Alberta</B>
<P>
The Company acquired a 15% interest in the Westerose Property on April 7,
1995.  Currently the Company is negotiating the acquisition of 0.04%
interest in the Cyn Pem Cardium D Unit No. 1 located in the Cyn Pem area of
west central Alberta.  The purchase price of $40,000 includes all tangible
and intangible equipment, including but not limited to down hole equipment,
wellhead, flowlines, tankage, pipelines, separator and compressor, if any. 
Past total production from this property is estimated to be in excess of
4,000 BOPD.
<P>
<B>Oil & Gas Properties, Saskatchewan</B>
<P>
A private individual has indicated his willingness to sell his entire
interest in 16 producing wells located in southeastern Saskatchewan, having
approximate net production of 125 BOPD.  The Company has sent a petroleum
engineer to conduct final diligence on this property and an engineering
evaluation prepared by Chapman & Partners of Calgary, Alberta has been filed
with the ASE.  The estimated purchase price for the entire interest is
$1,000.000.  Subject to a favourable engineering evaluation, the Company
intends to acquire up to a 50% interest in the property package.
<P>
<B>Gold Properties, Ontario</B>
<P>
The Company entered into an agreement to earn up to 65% interest in four
properties, comprising of 541 claims, in the North Caribou-Greenstone belt,
northwestern Ontario.  These properties are on the same geology and same
iron formation that hosts the Musselwhite Gold Deposit which is jointly
owned by Placer Dome (68%) and TVX Gold (32%).  An all year round road to
the Musselwhite Gold Deposit has been completed by Placer Dome and the
partners are presently at advanced feasibility stage with a production
decision, according to Placer Dome, pending by year end or early 1996.  The
other major company active in the area is Pangea Goldfields who has acquired
the karl Zeemel gold deposit, 10 kilometres southeast of Musselwhite
Deposit.
<P>
<B>Gold Properties, Quebec</B>
<P>
Dynamic Ventures and Chandeleur Bay Production will enter into a joint
venture to develop the 3,000 acre Lac Fiedmont claims in Val d'Or mining
district of Quebec upon completion of the diamond drilling program of which
Phase One commenced in August 1995.  Initial results are expected soon on
the exploration program for gold, copper, zinc and silver.  The Val d'Or
mining district is the site of seven producing gold mines in Canada.
<P>
<B>Voisey Bay and Labrador Properties, Newfoundland</B>
<P>
In Voisey Bay, the Company acquired approximately 12,000 acres of property
in the vicinity of Diamond Fields' Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Discovery.  First
Western Minerals Inc. of Vancouver, B.C. was granted an option to acquire up
to 51% interest over three years by making cash payments of $200,000 ,
issuing 300,000 shares and completing work expenditures totalling $1.5
million.  Also, First Western Minerals has the option of acquiring an
additional 29% interest for a cash payment of $1.5 million.
<P>
In Labrador, the Company acquired an area of approximately 50 square
kilometres located in the Lake Avineau region, some 225 kilometres north of
Schefferville.  Previous exploration work on the claims included extensive
geophysical and geological surveys and 25 core drill holes.  Results of the
work to date have defined a zone containing a minimum of 1.1 million tons
grading 2.02% copper and 0.45% nickel; and containing 1.0 g/t platinum and
3.1 g/t palladium.  The Company intends to acquire additional claims in the
area to protect favourable geology.  An exploration and developemtn program
is being planned to commence shortly to evaluate potential extensions to
known zones and to test new targets with the objective of expanding reserves
to a minimum of 10 million tons.

<DT>11/15/96<DD>The company has a number of appointments and changes designed to further enhance
and  strengthen  its  board  of  directors.  The  board named a new chairman and appointed four new directors, enlarging the board from  seven  to  nine  members with the accepted resignations of three current directors.   
<P>                   
These changes in the structure  and  membership  of  the  company's  board  will strengthen  its  effort  to grow Epic into a mid-level international oil and gas company in the shortest possible time.  
<P>                                        
Gerald J. Maier,  becomes  the  company's  new  chairman,  replacing  Robert  O. Anderson, who will remain a member of the board as chairman emeritus.  The other new directors are: Dr Bohdan Hawrylyshyn, John M. Beddome, and  Brooke N. Wade.     
<P>                                                                   
In addition to Mr Anderson, the other current directors remaining on  the  board are  Ronald K. Cormick, president and CEO of Epic, John B. Zaozirny, Laurence G. Decore, and Edward Sampson.

<DT>11/12/96<DD>Niko has purchased two million special warrants of Epic for $2 million  as  part
of  Epic's  private placement. In September, Niko acquired 5.6 million shares of Epic's issued and outstanding shares. Upon completion of the private  placement, Niko  will  hold  approximately 7.6 million shares, or 12.2% on a diluted basis, taking into account issued and outstanding special warrants of Epic. The special
warrants  purchased  have  provisions for additional warrants and are subject to escrow restrictions of the ASE.   
<P>                                              
Niko has purchased the  shares  of  Epic  for  investment  purposes.  Mr  Edward Sampson,  executive  chairman  of  Niko,  has  become  a  member of the board of directors of Epic.    
<P>                                                          
Epic, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is  party  to  a  production  sharing agreement  with  its  Ukraine  partner, Krymgeologia, which provides the company with pre-emptive rights to explore and develop oil and gas reserves  in  Crimea, Ukraine, an 11,000 square mile area with significant hydrocarbon accumulation.  
Niko has appointed Conrad Kathol to its board of directors.

<DT>11/08/96<DD>The company has completed a private placement of 20,000,000 special warrants for
gross  proceeds  of  $20,000,000.  Investors include several major institutional funds. Upon exercise, the special warrant holders will  receive  one  share  and one-half  of  one  warrant,  with  each  whole  warrant  entitling the holder to purchase an additional share for $1.20 for one year. One-half  of  the  proceeds
have  been  escrowed  pending  receipt  for  a  prospectus qualifying securities issuable on exercise of the special warrants. Canaccord acted as the  agent  for the offering.    
<P>                                                               
Proceeds will be used by the company in its Crimea oil and gas  exploration  and development projects. Approximately $5 million of the proceeds is believed to be sufficient capital to aggressively develop the shallow oil fields of  the  Kerch Peninsula,  augmented  by  internal  cash  flow.  The  planned  program includes drilling  more  than  100  shallow  production  wells,  expanding  the  existing transportation  and  storage  facilities, and drilling several exploratory wells designed to add more shallow oil reserves to the company's ledger. 
<P>             
An additional $8-10 million will be used to evaluate the potential of the deeper oil-gas-condensate  fields  by  conducting comprehensive feasibility studies and potentially re-completing two to three preserved, Ukrainian-drilled  wells.  The company  also  expects  to drill a new test well in the most economically viable
field discovery. The remaining funds will be available for contingencies.   
 <P>  
Epic, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is  party  to  a  production  sharing agrement with its Ukraine partner, Krymgeologia, which provides the company with pre-emptive rights to explore and  develop  oil  and  gas  reserves  in  Crimea, Ukraine.  To  date,  Epic  has reported successful completion and oil production
from the first four shallow production test wells drilled in the  Aktash  field, and has worked over two additional producing wells.    
<P>                         
Edward Sampson has been appointed to the board of directors.  Mr  Sampson  is  a director and executive chairman of Niko Resources.

<DT>10/01/96<DD>Approximately 22 million shares representing 52% of the outstanding shares, have
been  purchased  from the majority shareholder by current members of management, institutional investors, and Niko Resources of Calgary, Alberta. 
<P>               
The participation of institutions in the purchase and sale  was  facilitated  by Canaccord  Capital Corp which has also been engaged by the company to complete a special warrant offering of $15 to $20 million on terms previously reported.    

<DT>09/26/96<DD>Epic Energy has engaged Canaccord Capital Corp to  complete  a  special  warrant
offering  of  a minimum of $15 million and a maximum of $20 million.   On  closing,  50%  of  the  proceeds  will  be retained  in  escrow  pending  issuance  of  the receipts. In the event that the receipts are not obtained within 120 days of the date of closing, investors will be  entitled  to  either  a  prorata refund of the escrowed funds or 110% of the securities issuable on exercise  of  the  special  warrants.  This  offering  is anticipated  to  be  completed  on  or  about October 15, 1996 and supersedes all previously announced financing efforts by Epic.  
<P>                               
Epic intends to use the proceeds of this offering to fully develop  its  shallow oil  field  opportunities  in  Crimea,  Ukraine;  to  conduct additional seismic exploration and to test the deeper potential of certain identified fields.   Epic, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is  party  to  a  production  sharing
agreement  with  its  Ukraine  partner, Krymgeologia, which provides the company with pre-emptive rights to explore and develop oil and gas reserves  in  Crimea, Ukraine,  an  11,000 square mile area with significant hydrocarbon accumulation.
<P>
To date, Epic has reported successful completion and production from  the  first four  shallow  oil  wells  drilled  in  the Aktash field and has worked over two additional producing wells.

<DT>08/14/96<DD>The company's jointly-held Ukraine company, KrymTexasNafta Ltd, is now receiving
sufficient  income  to  cover  local  operating  costs.  Oil production from the company's first four evaluation wells in the Aktash field, Crimea has been  sold to the Lviv refinery.       
<P>                                                    
To support an immediate expansion in oil production and sales from  Aktash,  the Company  is  also  acquiring  the additional tanker trucks needed to get the oil from the field to the nearby railhead.   Delivery of additional pipe and well heads in the next couple of weeks will also allow  the  company  to  move  rapidly with an aggressive drilling program. Full development of Aktash requires drilling another 12-16 wells during the next  few months.      
<P>                                                                   
KrymTexasNafta has let road-building contracts to improve access to both  Aktashand  the  next  two oil fields slated for development, Voykov and Priozorny. The new roads will provide year-round access to these three  oil  fields  to  ensure that  the  Company's  drilling  program  of  more  than  40 wells can proceed on
schedule. 
<P>                                                                     
KrymTexasNafta also plans to build roads into two new prospect areas  which  are scheduled  for  drilling exploratory wells this winter. These two areas have the same geological characteristics as Aktash, but are forecasted  to  contain  from two to three times as much oil.    
<P>                                             
Technical studies of the cores retrieved from the third production test well  in Aktash  confirm  earlier Ukraine analyses that the oil production is from highly porous, carbonate reservoirs. The studies also established that these reservoirs are  encased  in  very  fine-grained, clay-rich shales which sometimes plug well bores. To prevent this, future wells will be perforated  to  exclude  any  shale zones, keeping them behind pipe.       
<P>                                        
The fourth well was completed in three reservoir zones and is now  producing  on natural  flow  at  a steady rate of 150 barrels per day during this test period.  The well's reservoirs appear capable of higher rates and, 
at a later  date,  the company plans to place the well on pump.  Ryder-Scott, a petroleum engineering consulting firm, will receive  delivery  of the  latest  production  history  data  this week. It plans to release a reserve report on the Aktash field in two to three weeks.

<DT>06/26/96<DD>KrymTexasNafta, the Ukraine company jointly held by HHO  Ltd,  (a  wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  Epic  Energy)  and  Krymgeologia,  a  Ukraine  State  geological enterprise, hereby confirms the accuracy  of  the  information  contained  in  the company  press release  of  June  25  1996.  This announcement provided details in respect of KTN's recent test well program carried out on the  Aktash  field,  located on the Kerch Peninsula in Crimea, Ukraine.         
<P>                                
The four well  test  program  in  the  Aktash  field  has  been  completed  with very encouraging  results.  Initial production tests totalled more than 1,000 barrels per day for the four wells. The field has now been placed on production with oil being sold to the Lviv Refinery.      
<P>                                         
KTN, with funding provided by  Epic,  through  HHO  Ltd,  along  with  technical support from Krymgeologia intends to immediately commence further development of the Aktash field, as previously announced.                                      

<DT>06/24/96<DD>The company has completed the initial test production drilling  program  in  the
Aktash  field  in Crimea. The first four wells in the field can be produced at a combined, sustained rate of approximately 1,000 barrels  of  oil  per  day.  The first  oil  from  the field was recently sold to a refinery in Ukraine, netting, after transportation, a world market price of US$18 per barrel. Last  week,  the
refinery posted pre-payment for another delivery, which is expected this week.  
<P>
The company's  production  sharing  agreement  gives  them  and  their  partner, Krymgeologia,  a  Ukraine  state geological enterprise, the right to explore and develop the oil and gas resources in a  7  million  acre  region  where  earlier discoveries indicate potential recoverable resources.                           
<P>
The company is planning to drill up to 15 more  wells  to  complete  the  Aktash field  and  then  move  immediately  to develop another nearby shallow oil field later this year.  The company will obtain maximum recovery over a sustained  period  by  resisting the  urge  to  produce the Aktash wells at high daily rates and risk early water
invasion of the reservoir.  
                                                    
The third well #103-03, completed in May, is producing from reservoirs IV and V. Like  the  first two wells, in this field, production on pump is capable of high daily rates, but a sustained rate is more likely at 200-250 barrels per day.    
<P>
The fourth well, #115-04, was recently drilled, cored, logged and  completed  in reservoirs  IV,  V,  and  VI.  It  has  been placed on pump at approximately 225 barrels per day.
<P>                                                                
Because of the success of producing oil from reservoir IV in the third and fourth wells, the company and their Ukraine partners are planning to re-evaluate the potential from this zone in the first two Aktash wells, #104-01 and #109-02. In  addition,  reservoir IV will be re-mapped across the whole Aktash field, and proven, producible reserves will be calculated.

<DT>05/14/96<DD>The company is now testing its third well  No.103-03  in  the  Aktash  field.  A previously untested zone 4 is presently producing high-quality oil.  Prior to testing, the well was cored and logged thoroughly for good  engineering data. Core recovery is limited due to the soft nature of the sediments. However, the company believes that sufficient material has been recovered to allow  Ryder Scott,  the  petroleum engineering firm, to make important conclusions regarding the performance of the oil-bearing reservoirs in Aktash. Cores were  split  into halves  with one half being analysed by Epic's partners, Krymgeologia, in Crimea and the other half studied by a western core laboratory.                        
Logs  and  cores  from  zone  4  were  quite  encouraging.  They  indicated  oil saturations  through  an  interval up to two metres thick. Zone 4 is not totally continuous across the whole Aktash field, according to the earlier Ukraine data, and it had never been tested for oil.                                           
<P>
The well log and core data  also  indicated  a  four  metre  zone  of  carbonate reservoir  representing either the expansion of zone 6 and absence of zone 5, or the merging of the two reservoirs without an  impermeable  shale  between  them. Porosities and permeabilities are very high, consistent with the previous wells.
A gradual shaling out occurs at the bottom of the reservoir.   Perforations of zones 4 and 6 were scheduled.  Latest  reports  from  the  field confirm  that  zone 4 has been perforated and completed. Initial swabbing of the zone has produced an excellent  lubricant-quality  oil,  with  typical  greenish caste.  The zone is flowing a small volume of oil, less than 50 barrels per day, and awaits installation of a  pump  for  subsequent  production  tests.  If  the production  tests  on  zone  4 prove positive, this would add proven, producible
reserves to the field. Zone 4 was not given any oil  reserves  in  the  original forecasts for the field.                                                        
<P>
After initial production tests on zone 4 have been completed to the satisfaction of the engineering consultants, zone 6 will be perforated and tested.  Latest reports on the oil production from the first  two  wells  indicates  that there  is  no  water  problem with the crude. Subject to confirmation of another crude oil sale payment arriving in our Ukraine bank account, the  next  shipment of crude oil is ready for transport via rail to the Lviv, Ukraine refinery.

<DT>04/16/96<DD>The company has recently received its first revenues from the sale of crude oil.
Epic  has  now  begun  the critical transition from an expense-based exploration company to a 
revenue-generating international oil production company.           
<P>
The full development of Aktash and other shallow oil  fields  in  Crimea,  along with  the  successful completion of negotiations to acquire proven producing oil reserves in the North Sea, will go a 
long way  this  year  to  establishing  the company's  revenue-gathering capacity. In the company's 
next quarterly financial statements, it plans to begin offering basic earnings per share forecasts.      
<P>
Epic's  Ukraine  subsidiary,  KrymTexasNafta,  has  been  paid  for  its   first significant  load of 
crude oil from the Aktash field. The purchaser was the Lviv pilot refinery plant, Lviv, Ukraine, 
which has a limited  contract  to  purchase the   company's   oil   production   at   a  net after 
transportation  price  of approximately US$18 per barrel.                                                 
<P>
Once the company has successfully conducted a number of initial sales, it  plans to  negotiate a 
long-term contract for about 60,000 metric tons per year (approx 413,000 barrels/yr)  which  represents  
the  refinery's  present  short-fall  of available  feedstock  oils.  Production from Aktash and other 
shallow oil fields will quickly exceed this small refinery's capacity.  Therefore,  unless  another
Ukraine  refinery  is  willing  to  pay equivalent world-market prices with hard currency, the company 
will begin exporting its oil for probable sale to a  Greek refinery.
<P>                                                                       
Epic and its Ukraine partner, Krymgeologia, have a production sharing  agreement to  explore  and  
develop  oil  and  gas resources within the 11,000 square mile region of Crimea where oil and gas 
have already  been  discovered.  The  company estimates a potential for more than 1.3 billion barrels of 
oil equivalent in the region.

<DT>04/11/96<DD>The company also reports that it has spudded its third well in the  Aktash  field.  It  is  presently coring  the whole interval of approximately 75m that contains up to six possible reservoirs in 
various parts of the field. Reservoir zones 5 and  6 have tested significant production in the earlier two wells
drilled by the company.
<P>
Next week, the company expects that the well will be logged,  tested,  completed in reservoir 
zones 5 and 6, and then placed on pump.
<P>
The company continues to collect important production datas from the  first  two producing  wells  
for  the independent engineering study. The crude oil is being stored in local storage tank facilities 
beside a rail head and then  transported via rail to the Lviv, Ukraine refinery for sale.

<DT>04/10/96<DD>The company has engaged C.M. Oliver (UK) to complete a euro-equity 
 offering  of $13  million,  on a best efforts basis. The offering is expected to be comprised of 
10 million units at $1.30 per unit.This  offering  is  anticipated  to  be completed on or about 
April 30 1996.                                            

<DT>04/02/96<DD>Epic has entered into a letter of intent to purchase a private company which has
agreements to acquire North Sea Productions.  Net producing reserves to Epic will be 7.5 mmbbls.                                                                  
The purchase price will be $3,200,000 plus 1,500,000 shares. In  addition,  Epic has agreed to issue 
a further 3,000,000 shares upon successful completion by the private company of the acquisition 
of additional production and reserves.  This transaction is subject to a number of conditions, 
including due  diligence,  obtaining necessary financing and board and regulartory approvals.                              
<P>
Closing is set to occur on April 30 1996.  Further details will be announced upon formalizing 
the terms of the acquisition.

<DT>03/22/96<DD> The company's Ukraine subsidiary, Krym Texas Nafta, had signed  a  contract 
for the  initial sale of crude oil from the Aktash field in Crimea. The oil is being sold  to  the  Lviv   Pilot   Refinery   Plant,   in   Lviv,   Ukraine,   at   a net-after-transportation price of US$18 per barrel.                             
The Lviv refinery, specializing in the production of lube oils for  the  Ukraine market,  is  willing to pay a premium price for the high quality crude available from Aktash.     
<P>                                                               
This is the first contract for the sale of oil  from  the  company's Crimean project.  The company  
expects its first sale of Aktash crude will occur during March. After a period of initial sales, and 
subsequent to increased  production, it  intends  to  negotiate  long-term contracts with the Lviv refinery 
and other buyers.
<P>
The company is drilling and testing four confirmation wells in the Aktash field.  It  expects production 
and associated cash flows to increase as it develops this first field, which has an estimated 8 million 
barrels  of  recoverable  oil.   As  the  company's  Crimean project moves along and production
increases, it will eventually be selling its products on world markets.  The company holds a production 
sharing agreement to explore and develop oil  and gas resources in an 11,000 square mile region.
It estimates a potential for more than 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the region, where oil 
and gas have already been discovered.                                                        

<DT>03/14/96<DD>Epic Energy has signed a comprehensive licensing  agreement  with  
Ukraine.  The agreement  covers  the  exploration and development of all shallow oil fields in
the Kerch peninsular area. In addition, it provides specific licensing  coverage for Epic's 
subsequent development of the deeper and larger oil and gas fields in the same area.        
<P>                                                          
Although the licensing  agreement  is  specific  to  Epic's  active  development
program  in  the  Kerch  peninsula,  it provides valuable confirmation of Epic's
rights under its original production sharing  agreement.  The  PSA  assigns  the
company  the  right,  with  its  Ukraine  partner,  Krymgeologia, to explore and
develop the oil and gas potential of the Crimean  peninsula,  an  11,000  square
mile  region  where  there  is  an estimated potential for more than 1.3 billion
barrels of oil-equivalent.
<P>
This latest agreement is a detailed clarification of items and issues  that  are
covered   in   more   general  terms  within  the  PSA,  including  exploration,
development, export, cost-recovery, taxation, etc.     
<P>                         
The agreement has been signed and/or ratified  by  all  levels  of  the  Ukraine
government  from  the  local  administrative authorities in Crimea, to Ukraine's
various environmental authorities, and including the State Committee for Oil and
Gas.  Most importantly, the agreement has been signed by the State Committee for
Geology and Utilization of  Mineral  Resources,  which  is  Ukraine's  principal
licensing authority for oil and gas development and productions.

<DT>02/29/96<DD>The company's first confirmation well, Aktash 104-01  in  the  Aktash 
field  in Crimea, Ukraine, has been placed on pump and is now producing 250 barrels of oil
per day. As part of its reservoir performance testing program, Epic  expects  to produce  oil  
from  this  well for the next few weeks at three or four different flow rates ranging from 100 
to 500 barrels per day.
<P>                             
Having completed the first two confirmation wells in the Aktash  field  earlier, Epic  will 
now place well 109-02 on pump and then proceed with the remaining two wells of the test 
program. Thereafter, the company plans to drill two test wells in  each  of  two  other  
nearby,  Aktash-like,  oil  field  discoveries  before continuing with the full development of Aktash.
<P>                                 
Epic holds a production sharing agreement to explore and develop the oil and gas
resources in an 11,000 square mile region. The company estimates a potential for
more than 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the region, where oil and gas
have already been discovered.

<DT>02/21/96<DD>The company's Ukraine subsidiary, KrymTexasNafta, had signed 
a  contract  for the  initial sale of crude oil from the Aktash field in Crimea. The oil is being
sold  to  the  Lviv   Pilot   Refinery   Plant, in Lviv, Ukraine, at a net-after-transportation 
price of US$18 per barrel.                             
<P>
This is the first contract for the  sale  of  oil  from  the  Company's  Crimean
project.  The  Company  expects its first sale of Aktash crude will occur during
March. After a period of initial sales, and subsequent to increased  production,

<P>
The company is drilling and testing four confirmation wells in the Aktash field.
It  expects production and associated cash flows to increase as it develops this
first field, which has an estimated 8 million barrels  of  recoverable  oil.  As
long  as  local refineries are willing and able to pay for crude at world market
prices with hard currency, the Company  will  continue  selling  its  production
within  Ukraine.  As  the  company's  Crimean project moves along and production
increases, it will eventually be selling its products on world markets.

already been discovered.                                                        

<DT>12/18/95<DD>The Company's Crimean project continues to exceed expectations.  Epic, through 
its wholly-owned subsidiary HHO Ltd, holds the first right to explore and develop oil and gas resources 
in an 11,000 square mile region of the Crimean Peninsula.
<P>
The company is moving quickly to develop its first Crimean field, the Aktash field, which is estimated to
have more than 8 million barrels of recoverable oil.  When it reaches full production, scheduled for
mid - 1996 Aktash is expected to produce more than 6,000 barrels per day, creating a positive 
cash flow that will be used for further development of Crimea's oil and gas reserves.
<P>
In addition, Epic is taking a number of other significant steps to strengthen its financial position, including
the recent completion of a private placement of 2,666,666 special warrants at $ 0.75 per special warrant.  This has provided just under $ 2 million in proceeds to the company, which will be used primarily for the drilling and exploration program in Crimea.
<P>
Epic is presently negotiating the final terms of an offering of up to $12 million in convertible debentures to be 
completed early in 1996.  It is anticipated that one of the principal subscribers to the offering will be the Ukraine Enterprise Corporation.
<P>
Board to increase from five to seven.  Ronald K. Cormick, Robert O. Anderson, John Zaozirny,
Laurence Decore, R. Michael Zwack, Rod Husband and Bobby Long.  Chairman to be Mr. Anderson.
<P>
<DT>12/05/95<DD> Mr Robert O. Anderson, former chairman and CEO
 of Atlanctic Richfield and Mr. John B. Zaozirny, former minister of Energy and Natural Resources for the Province of  Alberta, have been appointed as directors.

<DT>09/29/95<DD>The Company entered into a letter of intent through its
wholly owned subsidiary HHO Ltd. with Ecumed Resources Ltd, a private European
Company.  The letter of intent provides for a 50% participation by Eucumed
in the Company's oil and gas exploration and development project in Ukraine. 
HHO has the rights pursuant to a production sharing agreement with
Krymgeologic, the Crimea state property fund to explore for, develop and
produce the oil and gas potential of a 28,000 square kilometres area of
Crimea.  HHO is entitled to 80% of the production until cost recovery and
60% of the production after cost recovery.  Ecumed has the right to earn 50%
of the HHO interest covered by the production sharing agreement.  To earn
its interest, Ecumed must contribute US$10,167,000 of the next US$12,000,000
in development costs of the Aktash field, including 100% of the first
US$6,500,000. Ecumed will contribute US$16,670,000 of the first
US$25,000,000 in development costs on various Crimean Plains projects.  The
Company has consented to a conveyance by Ecumed of 50% of Ecumed's interest
under the letter of intent to Canadian Leader Energy of Calgary, Alberta.

<DT>08/01/95<DD>Epic's second discovery confirmation well, No. 109-2, in the
Aktash field, Crimea, Ukraine tested at a combined rate of 530 barrels per
day.  The Company has completed testing of this second well and is preparing
the field facilities to put its first two wells into production.  Epic is
going to begin producing oil from the Aktash field immediately, with a total
production anticipated to be more than 400 barrels per day.  The oil will be
sold at world market prices for US dollars.  This will provide the Company
with an early revenue stream.  As soon as the first two wells have been
placed in production, the Company plans to begin drilling the third well in
the four well test program.  Contract engineering studies have begun.

<DT>07/19/95<DD>Haglund Industries International is continuing with its
reorganization and has been granted an option by Epic Energy to acquire a
100% interest in eight mineral claims located in Revelstoke mining division,
BC and all of Epic's interest in an option agreement dated March 25, 1995
between Epic and Bethlehem Resources and Goldview Resources regarding the R
and W claims and seven additional claims located in the Revelstoke mining
division, BC (the Brew claims).  The option requires the issuance of 100,000
shares to Epic and the expenditure of $125,000 in exploration and
development prior to December 31, 1995.  In addition, and subject to certain
back in rights, the Company must incure the net? $250,000 in exploration and
development expenditures.

<DT>06/28/95<DD>Epic's second discovery confirmation well, Aktash 109-02, in
the Aktash field in Crimea, Ukraine tested at 280 BPDD from a 1 metre zone. 
These initial results, from the lowermost primary reservoir at 367 metres
depth suggests that this well has a higher production potential than
original estimates indicated. This is consistent with earlier tests of the
first well, Aktash 104-01, about 1,300 metres to the east.  After it
finishes testing this first zone in Aktash 109-02, Epic will move back up
the well and perforate horizon 1A.  This 2 metre zone, at 328 meters depth, also
appears from the well logs to be oil saturated. 

<DT>06/22/95<DD> Drilling operations in the Aktash Field in Crimea, Ukraine, are progressing at a 
substantially improved pace, following the resolution of several unexpected procedural
issues with the first well.  Epic has just finished drilling, casing, and
logging the second well in the initial four well test program. Logs from
this second well, the Aktash 109-02 indicate that the primary target
reservoirs are oil-saturated and that pay- zone thicknesses are consistent
with earlier predictions.  The well was drilled to its depth of 375 metres.
Two zones, horizons V and VI, a depth of 360 to 367 metres, are being
perforated and tested now. Following this, the oil-saturated subzone of
Horizon I will be perforated and tested.  Epic has received receipt for a
prospectus qualifying the common shares and warrants issued upon exercise of
5.525 million special warrants.  The 2.2 million warrants which have been
issued on conversion of the special warrants are exercisable at $0.75 per
share on or before June 30, 1995.

<DT>06/16/95<DD>Epic Energy has extended the period for exercising its
outstanding special warrants as well as the exercisable period for the
warrants issuable upon exercising of the special warrants, to June 30, 1995.
The exercise price of the warrants shall remain at $0.75 for the duration of
the exercise period.

<DT>06/12/95<DD>Shareholders of OTM International Development Inc. approved
on February 3, 1995, the reverse takeover of the Company by HHO Ltd. and the
change of the company to Epic Energy Inc.  The common shares of Epic Energy
will commence trading on the Alberta Stock Exchange at the open of June 14,
1995.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Epic Energy Inc. - Properties</B></FONT>
<P>
In February 1995, Epic Energy Inc. transformed itself into an international
oil and gas company by acquiring HHO Ltd. and a 100% interest in the Crimean
contract area covered by a Production Sharing Agreement with the Ukraine
goverment.
<P>
<B>Crimea Project</B>
<P>
The Company is a partner in the venture to explore and develop oil and gas
resources in an 11,000 square-mile region in the Crimea, Ukraine with
Krymgeologia, a Ukraine State Geological Production Enterprise, an
accomplished exploration company that has done all of the exploration in the
region over the past 50 years.  The new venture is based on a Producing
Sharing Agreement between Krymgeologia and Epic's wholly-owned subsidiary,
HHO Ltd.  The exploration and development effort is being managed by a joint
venture company, KrymTexasNafta Ltd., which includes HHO Ltd., Krymgoelogia
and the State Property Fund.
<P>
The project area is divided into two geological regions: the Kerch
Peninsula, which has an overall estimated 875 million barrels of petroleum
liquids and one trillion cubic feet of gas; and the Crimean Plains, which
has an estimated 470 millions barrels of petroleum liquids and two trillion
cubic feet of gas.  In the Kerch Peninsula, there are five shallow oil
fields discoveries.  In the first field targeted for development, the Aktash
Field, the Company will be developing reservoirs that were discovered and
proven by more than20 earlier exploration study wells.  Of special interest
is the fact that the discoveries to date were made without advanced western
exploration technology.  This means that the size and value of future
discoveries could far exceed that of currently projected reserves.
<P>
The Aktash Field is the first new oil field being developed by Epic.  A
preliminary development plan for Aktash was filed with the Ukrainian
authorities prior to starting the present test well program.  Based on
available data of the time, the plan calls for 30 wells at approximately 30
acre spacing to completely product the field.  Although it is still too
early in the test program to calculate the final well-spacing, a reasonable
scenario exists.  At 30 wells, averaging 250 bpd, Epic's gross production
share during cost recovery would be 6,000 bpd and, after cost recovery,
4,500 bpd.  The declining life of the first well is expected to be across a
10 year period. Once the revised development plan for Aktash has been
approved by the Ukrainian officials, the field will be quickly brought into
full production and the oil will be exported by this fall.
<P>
The Company has been evaluating three additional shallow oil field
discoveries and ten undrilled, shallow prospects recently developed by its
partners.  All of these oil field opportunities are in the Aktash field
vicinity.  Detailed studies have significantly upgraded the proven and
probable recoverable oil reserves.  These satellite oil field opportunities
are planned for immediate evaluation after the test program is completed at
Aktash.  Several other major field discoveries are being evluated, and the
Company plans to begin developing these fields at a rate of at least one
every 18 months.  The goal is to develop four fields in the first five
years.

<DT>10/30/96<DD>Mr Franco S. Cecconi has resigned from the company's board of directors.

<DT>10/18/96<DD>The company has no material changes in its affairs to  account  for  the  recent
market activity.

<DT>10/09/96<DD>The Company reports that Rowenta-Werke Gmbh of Offenbach, Main in  Germany  is  evaluating  the  Fountain House  FH 2000 Drinkscentre to determine the possibility of manufacturing and/or
distribution  involvement.  Rowenta  is  a  large  European   manufacturer   and distributor of home kitchen and a variety of other appliances.

<DT>09/25/96<DD>Samples of the FH 2000 Drinkscentre and consumables have  been  shipped  to  the
product  as  well  as  as engineering departments of Sunbeam Corp of Schaumberg, Illinois at Sunbeam's request for assessment to determine  possible  brand  name and retail marketing involvement.

<DT>08/18/96<DD>Further to the company news release of September 18 1996, HSN Direct has  requested  that in  addition  to  the  countries  referred  to in the draft of the international marketing and distribution agreement dealing with the proposed marketing of  the FH  2000  Drinkscentre  through  direct  response  television facilities, it now wishes to have the US, Canada and Mexico included in the any final agreement.

<DT>09/17/96<DD>The company has  received  a  draft  copy  of  an  international  marketing  and

Based on this  information,
and  after also taking into consideration convenience and logistical factors and size of initial manufacturing  orders,  the  company  intends  to  transfer  all necessary tooling from mainland China to Canada.

<DT>07/29/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 375,000 shares from escrow. There are
375,000 shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>05/23/96<DD>As a result of the company's review of the result  obtained  to  date  from  the
company's  Belen-Margaja  property in the Republic of Panama, it has decided not to do any further work 
on this property. Consequently, the company's  option  to acquire an interest in this property has been terminated.

<DT>03/07/96<DD>On February 7 1996 directors and  employees  were  granted  options  on  
154,000 shares at $0.54, expiring February 7 2001.

<DT>01/10/96<DD>The company has received results from the 1995 exploration program at the 
compant's Belen-Margaja property in Panama.  Fresco has an option to earn 50% interest in the property.  During 1995, geologic mapping, prospecting and silt and soil sampling identified a 1.0 by 2.0 kilometre
area of various anomalous gold mineralization.  The Margaja gold anomaly returned up to 11 g/t gold in
soil and silt sampling.  The area of the Margaja gold anomaly contains the formerly producing Margaja
gold mine as well as extensive colonial and pre-colonial pits and trenches representative of significant 
placer activities.  The mine existed for more then 30 years and consisted of narrow high-grade quartz veins.
<P>
In December 1995 Fresco completed an eight hole, 1425 meter diamond drilling program testing the most significant portions of the Margaja gold anomaly.  Fresco is presently evaluating the results of the 
exploration program prior to determining what further work may be recommended at the Belen-Margaja property.  Please contact the company at<BR>
(604) 688-3008 for complete drill results of the eight hole drill program.

<DT>11/06/95<DD>The Company is pleased to announce that diamond drilling has begun on the company's 
Belen-Margaja property in Panama.  An intial drill program of 6 to 8 drill holes are planned on the Margaja gold anomaly.  The Margaja gold anomaly has a minimum extent of 1.0 by 2.0 kilometres and covers extensive old surface trenching, pitting and placer working that pre-date colonial times.  The anomaly is similar in size to Adrian's Molejon gold deposit located on its Petaquilla property, thirty kilometres to the east.  The Margaja gold anomaly displays numerous gold -in-soil geochemical assays in excess of 1.0 g/t over its large extent, to a peak value of 36.1 g/t gold.  Fresco has an option to earn a 50% interest in the Belen-Margaja property from
Minera Atlantida, S.A., a private Panamanian Company.

<DT>10/04/95<DD>The Company announced that preparations were underway to
begin diamond drilling at the company's Belen-Margaja property in the
Republic of Panama.  Actual drilling should start at month end.  Adrian
Resources, as exploration operator for Fresco, has recommended a minimum
1,500 metre drilling program to evaluate the extensive Margaja gold anomaly
which is similar in size to Adrian Resources' Molejon gold deposit located
on its Petaquilla property, 30 kilometres to the east.  The Margaja gold
anomaly also displays numerous gold-in-soil results in excess of 1.0 g/t
over its large extent, to a peak value of 36/1 g/t gold.  Fresco's
anticipated target at Margaja is a large, low-grade Molejon-style open pit
deposit with local areas of high -grade, underground vein-style
mineralization.  Fresco has an option to earn a 50% interest and
operatorship in the Belen-Margaja Property from Minera Atlantida, S.A., a
private Panamanian Company.

The 1995 US $250,000 Phase I exploration program, consisting of regional
prospecting and silt sampling has been completed over the priority target
areas on the Belen and Margaja Concessions.  The US $500,000 Phase II
exploration program, consisting largely of diamond drilling and expanded
geochemical sampling and prospecting is expected to begin in the fourth
quarter of 1995.
<P>
Very little modern exploration has been carried out on the Belen-Margaja
concessions.  However, at least four pre-Columbian gold mines (the Margaja,
El Molinete, Veraguas and Belen) are situated within the Belen-Margaja
property, one of which, the Margaja, reportedly produced 800 kilograms of
gold when last in production during the 1930s.  A level plan from the
Margaja site prepared by the last operator outlines a vein width of 0.81
metres with a weighted average gold grade of 92.6 g/t (2.7 oz/ton) with
individual gold assays as high as 1653 g/t or 48.3 oz/ton.  The four mine
sites display a similar multi-generational, brecciated stockwork quartz
veining from which recent sampling near the Belen site has returned values
of up to 20.33 g/t gold and 4.4 g/t silver.  Preliminary silt sampling in
the areas of the Belen and Veraguas mines returned values of up to 4.48 g/t
and 4.07 g/t gold, respectively.

Fresco Developments Ltd. is earning a 50% interest in the Margaja and Belen
Concessions located in the Petaquilla Mineral District of Panama, where
Adrian Resources Ltd. along with Teck Corporation and Inmet Mining
Corporation have outlined 7 mineral deposits totalling greater than 2
billion tonnes containing 20 billion pounds of copper, 8.2 million ounces of
gold and 568 million pounds of molybdenum.
<P>
Fresco has an option to earn a 50% undivided interest and the operatorship
of the Belen and Margaja Concessions from Minera Atlantida, S.A. by making
cash payments totalling CDN$250,000 over four years, issuing 200,00 shares
over three years, and incurring exploration and development expenditures
totalling US$2,500,000 over four years.  In addition, Fresco must issue to
Atlantida an additional 100,000 shares on commencement of commercial
production.
<P>
<B>Margaja Concession</B>
<P>
The Margaja concession is a 50 square kilometres in size and covers three
pre-Columbian underground gold mines.  A recently completed six square
kilometre soil grid survey has outlined a significant grouping of gold
anomalies over a 1.5 x 1 km extent that is open to expansion to the east,
north and south.  Peak soil, silt and rock samples returned 11 g/t, 10 g/t
and 9.6 g/t gold respectively.  The gold anomaly is similar in extent to
that of Adrian's Molejon Deposit, located on the nearby Petaquilla
Concession which is reported to contain in excess of 1.25 million ounces of
gold grading 3.2 g/t in 12.3 million tonnes.  The area of the Margaja gold
anomaly contains extensive old surface trenching and placer workings, as
well as the Margaja underground gold mine.  This area has been worked since
pre-Columbian times and has never undergone any modern exploration work.  A
level plan of the Margaja Mine, prepared by the last operator in the 1930s,
outlines a vein width of 0.81 metres with a weighted average gold grade of
92.6 g/t (2.7 oz/ton), Fresco's expected target here is a low grade "Molejon
Style" open pit deposit, with local areas of high grade, vein style
underground potential.
<P>
<B>East and West Belen Concessions</B>
<P>
At the East Belen Concession soil geochemistry has been completed over the
twelve square kilometre concession.  Gold results from soil up to 1.9 g/t
and up to 20.3 g/t in rock have been returned to date.  This concession also
covers three pre-Columbian underground gold mines and extensive areas of
placer development.
<P>
The West Belen Concession covers an area of 10.5 square kilometres and
contains one pre-Columbian gold mine.  Based on encouraging results from the
East Belen and Margaja Concessions, a similar initial program of exploration
is planned for the West Belen Concession.

<DT>10/29/96<DD>Despite the inevitable subzero temperatures and early  snow  accumulation  which
signify  the  end  of  the Placer mining season in the Cariboo, Gallery has been successful in the completion of its state of the art, 150 cubic yards  per  hour production facility at its Cariboo placer gold property.       
<P>                
This facility was constructed between September and October 20, and consists  of a derocker, screen deck and circular jigs. Prior to the winter weather shutdown, 200 yards of material were processed from the company's Slade pit area.      
<P>   
The company is  now  confident  that  its  processing  facility  is  capable  of processing  over  2,200  cubic  yards  a day. The company's technical staff have spent the summer implementing a multi-phase exploration  program  consisting  of refraction seismic surveys, reverse circulation drilling and bulk testing, which have been successful in the  preliminary  identification  of  large  volumes  of deeply buried, potentially-rich tertiary gold-bearing gravels, and large volumes of lower grade, glacial bench gravels.              
<P>                            
In addition to  the  preliminary  exploration  phases  of  this  property,  more detailed stages of ore reserve development have been identified. Bulk testing of shallow bench gravels developed considerable mineable ore reserves in the  Slade pit  area  and  in  an  area north of the Moustique Creek bridge. These results, along with the preliminary seismic and reverse circulation  drilling  from  1995 and  1996,  will  be  released shortly in a detailed geology report. A digitized base has been created for the Cariboo placer gold property,  containing  all  of the  previous exploration data included on up-to-date maps. This will enable the company's geological staff to complete a set of mining plans and to  assess  ore reserve sections in order to sustain production well into the future.         
<P>  
The company is looking for an exceptional, full season of gold production and  a positive cash flow in 1997.

<DT>10/05/96<DD>The company's reports that its diamond drilling program on its  Okak  Bay  property  in  Northern Labrador  is progressing favourably. The first vertical hole, OK-1, of a planned five hole, 1,500 metre program will be completed late this week to  a  depth  of 350  metres.  To  date,  the first hole has intersected a strong alteration zone highlighted by  strongly-enriched  silica,  chlorite  and  carbonate  containing widespread disseminated pyrite mineralization.         
                         
The company's geologist and project manager, Vic French, reports that the degree of  silicification  is  so intense that the rate of drilling footage to date has been considerably  slower  than  anticipated  because  of  the  very  hard  rock structure.  For complete details of the drilling program please call the company at its Vancouver office.
<P> 
The company will report the results of the first assays as soon as  the  reports become available. The company's drilling program continues.

<DT>09/16/96<DD>As of September 14 1996, the company has completed a combined max-min,  mag  and 
VLF-EM  ground  geophysics survey over a strong, circular magnetic anomaly which has been targeted for a 1,500 metre diamond drilling program. The results of the survey confirmed the presence of a spectacular magnetic anomaly and has returned higher readings than were originally obtained during an earlier airborne survey.
<P>
The area targeted for drilling has also turned up an  interesting  copper  bearing  mineralization discovered by the prospecting crew over the past few days.   
<P>                   
The diamond drilling crew is now enroute to the property and the  drill  program will  commence  on  September 18 1996 with a scheduled completion of the planned 1,500 metres by mid October.   The ground geophysics survey crew has moved to the Sango Bay southwest  property to  test several coincident mag and EM anomalies. Early results from the max-min phase of the survey are positive with electrical responses typical  of  sulphide generalization.  The company will carry out a total of 15 kilometres of combined max-min and VLF-EM survey over three separate grids.

<DT>09/11/96<DD>In 1995 the company embarked upon an ambitious program of placer and  lode  gold
explorations  on  its 30 placer leases and its 72 units of mineral claims in the renowned Cariboo mining district  near  Wingdam,  BC.  The  company  will  begin production on these properties with two weeks.       
<P>                           
Currently the company has completed the preliminary  geophysical,  drilling  and geological  investigation  of this large property outlining multiple deep placer channels with indications that sufficient gold ore reserves  can  be  proven  to allow  for  a  minimum  of  10 years production. 
<P>
This program involves continued development of significant shallow mineable gold ore reserves by  bulk  sampling at  a  rate  of  approximately  8  tons per hour to test the consistency of gold content along the channel, which appears to run for several kilometers. To date, with less than one quarter of the bulk test pits completed for 1996, results are indicating that the high glacial bench gravels of the Mostique  Creek,  (in  one
area tested) will provide at least one year's full production.         
<P>       
These grades are estimated at $10 per ton with a production cost of less than $3 per  ton. The company will be in a position to mill a minimum of 180 days of the year at a rate of 3,000 tons per day. Based on these calculations,  this  should provide the company in excess of $5,000,000 yearly.
<P>
A state-of-the-art production plant arrive on site approximately two weeks  ago, and  during  this  time,  it  has  been  undergoing  assembly.  Upon  completion production will commence as early as possible. The  plant  will  be  capable  of processing approximately 200 tons per hour.           
<P>                          
Recently, legal claim surveys have been completed to consolidate  the  company's land  position  in  preparation  for  production  mining  leases  with long term exploration and mining plans, forestry plans, and reclamation plans in place  to facilitate long term production planning.

<DT>08/28/96<DD>The company has finalized plans for a 1,500 metre drilling program  to  commence
mid September on its Okak Bay property in northern Labrador. The drill target is a large, high amplitude, circular magnetic anomaly identified during an airborne survey completed in June of this year.      
<P>                                    
A follow-up ground geophysics, max-min survey which is scheduled for  completion during  the  next  few  days  is being carried out to give better definition and tighter control of the drill target. All the necessary work  and  drill  permits have  been  approved.
<P>
Line cutting crews have completed grid work over  several  areas  of  coincident magnetic  and  electromagnetic  anomalies  on  the company's Sango Bay southwest property 70 miles south of Nain. Upon completion of the ground geophysics survey on  the  Okak  Bay  property,  the  survey  crew  will be mobilized to the Sango property to carry out 15km of max-min survey over the gridded areas. The company is  confident  that  the  results from the max-min survey could lead to a second drilling program in the fall of this year on the Sango Bay  southwest  property, which covers favourable rocks of the Flowers River Intrusive Suite.

<DT>08/12/96<DD>Gallery is commencing a detailed ground geophysical survey  on  an  interesting,
circular,  magnetic  anomaly  on its Okak Bay property in northern Labrador. The survey represents the second phase of the ground follow-up work  implemented  in July  96, when a geology field crew were dispatched to the property to carry outa detailed surface mapping and  sampling  of  the  magnetic  anomaly  identified
during  an  earlier  airborne  magnetic  and  electromagnetic  survey.  A ground geophysical survey is scheduled for completion by August 20 1996  and  is  being conducted  to  provide  an  accurate definition of targets to be tested during a planned diamond drilling program. The company has applied  to  the  Newfoundland Department  of Mines for a drilling permit and expects approval by mid September
1996. Once approval is granted a 1,500 metre  drilling  program  will  test  the uniformly  circular,  magnetic  anomaly  which  bears  a  striking similarity to circular responses commonly associated with kimberlite pipes.     
              
Gallery  is  proceeding  with  its  exploration  program   on   the   basis   of recommendations  received from Aero Surveys which conducted the airborne survey. Project geologist Victor French who is managing the  field  work,  and  industry consultants  who  have  reviewed  the  geophysical  data,  have  agreed upon the
reliability of the data and its kimberlite type signatures.   
                  
Gallery's  aggressive  exploration  approach  on  its  Labrador  properties  has resulted  in  the  identification  of  an  attractive  coincident  magnetic  and electromagnetic anomaly on the Sango Bay South-West property approximately  45km south  of the Voisey's Bay Ni-Cu-Co deposit. The highly conductive EM anomaly is
situated at the favourable contact zone  between  troctolitic  and  anorthositic rocks of the Nain Plutonic Suite and metasedimentary rocks. The strength of this anomaly   could   signify   important   concentrations   of   massive   sulphide mineralization  and  coincides  with  geochemically  anomalous concentrations of
nickel and copper in lake bottom sediments. A total of 15km of grid  lines  will be  surveyed  with a max-min ground geophysical survey. The max-min survey is an effective exploration method used to locate massive  and  semi-massive  sulphide mineralization.

<DT>07/15/96<DD>The company reports that a  combined airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey at Okak  Bay,  completed in  June  by  Aero  Surveys  of  Richmond  Hill, Ontario, has identified strong, circular magnetic anomalies which have been  recommended  for  immediate  ground follow-up.  The company is presently mobilizing an experienced crew to carry out extensive prospecting and sampling of the 200 claim property. The ground surveys are expected to produce positive results  which  will  define drill  targets to be tested during a late summer drilling program. The potential for discovering mineralization on the Okak  Bay  property  is  enhanced  by  the favourable   regional  geology,  and  encouraging  results  obtained  by  mining companies currently carrying out exploration programs on other properties in the area.  To date these programs being carried out by the companies have outlined a regionally significant northwest trending magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies along which the company's property is situated.     
<P>                            
The drilling program on the company's Cabot Lake property, 25  km  southeast  of the Voisey Bay deposit has been stopped to allow interpretation of drill results obtained to date. The spring drilling program, although encountering  uneconomic anomalous Ni-Cu-Co mineralization in rocks similar to  the  host  rocks  at  the Voisey  Bay  deposit. A prospecting crew is presently on the property completing ground surveys which were disrupted last fall  by  heavy  snow  conditions.  The results  of  these surveys being carried out on areas of structurally controlled gossan zones and coincident geophysical anomalies will  soon  be  available  and should  assist  in deciding on whether or not further exploration efforts should continue on this property.

<B>Cariboo Production Update </B>
<P>                                                      
Production permits for the 1996 mining season have been approved.  Work  on  the site has been completed in preparation for production. The state-of-the-art gold production and recovery plant, with the capacity to process up to 200  tons  perhour  is completed, and presently undergoing final modifications to be installed
and operating in 25 days.      
<P>                                                 
An additional smaller bulk sampling plant capable of processing up to 8 tons  an hour  has  been  installed  for additional ongoing reserve tests. The plant will continue to operate proving up additional reserves, while production  begins  on existing reserves. The processing plant is new and has a long life expectancy of
15 years.                                                                       

<DT>06/12/96<DD>The company has identified an initial quantity of gold-bearing  gravels  on  its
Hannandor placer property in the Lightning Creek-Cariboo region.  Approximately 25,000 tons of gravel 
have been identified for  immediate  milling at an average of $31 to $32 per ton on the first three feet from the surface, on the PML 6015 claim. These gravels are easily accessible, due to the existence of very  little  overburden.  The  company's geologist is of the opinion that these gold-bearing gravels are 1000m in length by  500m  in  width  and  could  easily extend  through  onto  the  PML  6016 claim as well. This potential extension of additional channel gravels translates into a volume of  approximately  1,120,000 tons  of  material,  which  would  represent a substantial revenue boost for the company.     
<P>                                                                   
As an initial step in the drilling  and  bulk  sampling  of  these  gold-bearing gravels. Gallery  has purchased a portable wash plant and has retained RMS Ross Machinery and Mr Art Den Duyf  for  the  design  and  assembly  of  a  materials handling  and  gold  recovery  system.  The  company  has  recently  completed a
state-of-the-art pulsating jig gold recovery plant as part of Gallery's  overall production  circuit.  The permit upgrades for production have been submitted and the installation of the materials handling system  should  be  completed  within approximately  45  days. Drilling and bulk sampling results will be announced as
details become available.

<DT>06/11/96<DD>A high resolution helicopter-borne geophysical survey  presently  being  carried
out by Aero Surveys has identified several interesting magnetic anomalies on two of  the  company's  mineral  licences  at  Okak  Bay,  in   the   Voisey's   Bay nickel-copper-cobalt  exploration camp in north-central Labrador. These magnetic anomalies, which do not carry an electro-magnetic response, define a cluster  of
circular-shaped,  very  strong  magnetic highs, ranging in diameter from 200m to 1600m.  For complete details on the Aero Surveys please contact the company.                                                                          
<P>
Although  Gallery  Resources  is  principally   searching   for   Voisey's   Bay mineralization  on  its Labrador properties, the company is encouraged over this new discovery, and feels that it could lead to a new diamond exploration camp on the  company's  Okak  Bay  claims.  The  potential  for  discovering diamonds in
Labrador can be equated  to  the  potential  for  a  major  nickel-copper-cobalt deposit prior to the DFR discovery at Voisey's Bay. Although very little diamond exploration has actually been undertaken in Labrador,  there  has  long  been  a recognition  of a favourable geologic environment for hosting diamonds. 
<P>
In 1982, Monprose Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DeBeers, reportedly collected samples from  kimberlite  dykes  in  north-central  Labrador  by  the  fact that Archean Resources was initially searching for diamonds in  1993  on  behalf  of  Diamond Fields when they discovered the nickel-copper-cobalt deposit at Voisey's Bay.   
These magnetic anomalies are  in  the  Nain  structural  province,  which  hosts numerous  kimberlite and ultramafic lamprophyre occurrences, as well as diatreme breccia pipes, indicating that the area has an excellent potential  for  hosting diamonds.  The  same  area  in  Labrador  was  once  joined to the west coast of
Greenland, where over 500 occurrences of kimberlite and ultramafic  lamprophyres have  recently  been documented  and  are known to include at least three areas containing diamonds.                                                            
<P>
In accordance with the survey recommendations, Gallery's geology work crews  are
being  mobilized  to  carry out sampling and prospecting ground surveys over the
area of the magnetic anomalies.
<P>
Gallery  will  join  with  Western  Premium Resources  in order to drill identified targets along the property borderline of the two companies. More drill rod has been ordered and the crew will be drilling to a depth of 600m commencing in approximately seven days' time. Further details of this drill program will be disclosed as they become available.     

<DT>05/14/96<DD>Gallery's reports the company has drilled  two new  holes  on  the  Creek  zone,  
located  in  the  NW corner of the Cabot lake property.
<P>                                                                       
The first hole, No. CL 96-1, was drilled at an angle of 45 degrees  towards  the NW and terminated at a 
depth of 241.0 metres.                                   
<P>
The second hole, No. CL 96-2, was drilled at an angle of 45 degrees towards  the SW,  to  a  depth  of  
305.0  metres.  This  hole  was  cased  to 4.5 metres and intersected gabbro from 4.5 to 80.0 metres. Altered  greenish  breccia  rock  of possible ultrabasic origin was found at depths of 80 to 305.0 metres. The second
drill hole is viewed with  great  interest  because  of  the  intermittent  fine grained   pyrrhotite   mineralization  in  the  ultrabasic  breccia  rock.  More important, this rock type adds a new geological dimension to the Cabot lake camp as it was never observed in outcrop in the deeply weathered terrain in the area.
<P>
The mineralization is currently being  evaluated  in  a  comprehensive  assaying program  and mineralogical study of core samples. The company expects results in approximately ten days. Additional drill testing including deepening of hole  CL 96-2 is planned, pending results of the core sample analysis.
<P>                   
Gallery has recently completed a 1,000,000 private placement,  consisting  of  1 common  share at $0.75 with a warrant at $0.80 to be exercised within a two year period. This private placement is subject to a one year hold period. The  placee is  Mr  Bruce  Costerd, President and CEO of the company. These proceeds will be
utilized for the spring and summer's mining and exploration budget  as  well  as general working capital purposes.

<DT>05/01/96<DD>Gallery Resources acquires additional prime property in Voisey's Bay            
Gallery Resources, in its  on-going  program  of  exploration,  acquisition  and development of 
properties in the active Voisey's Bay area, has acquired a large property 15 km SW of Okak Bay 
area in Labrador just below  Uniakovik  Lake.  The property,  consisting  of  200 hard rock units 
covering an area of 12,500 acres, straddles a large magnetic anomaly  and  contains  a  potential  
basic  magmatic intrusion  identified  from previous government flown regional airborne magnetic
survey. The company has again contracted Aero Survey's Inc in order  to  conduct more  intensive  
helicopter-borne  magnetic  and EM surveys to test for sulphide conductors in the intrusion. These 
surveys will commence immediately. A  further field  prospecting  program  in order to follow up 
anomalous trends is scheduled for the summer of 1996.
<P>
During the 1995 exploration season, Gallery initially tested the Cliff  zone  on the  Cabot  Lake  
property,  which  contains  a  large  gossan with a coincident magnetic anomaly with four holes from 
two set-ups in  the  first  hole  drilled.
<P>
The  drilling  program  intersected  a  complex geological  system  of  contact  metamorphic  magnetite 
skarns with disseminated pyrrhotite and calcopyrite mineralization, but no  significant  economic  values
were returned.                 
<P>                                                 
On the  nearby  Voisey's  Bay  properties  at  Harp  Lake  and  Sango,  airborne geophysical, lake sediment geochemical and Landsat data sets are currently being assessed by the company's geologists with the 
objective  of  targeting  a  field follow-up program during the summer of 1996.  Gallery implements major drilling program at the Hannandor  property,  Lightning Creek, BC.
<P>                                                                      
Gallery conducted the digging of a series of test pits  on  the  Bonanza  Bench. (Located east of the Hannandor pit where mining was previously carried out). Due to encouraging results and detailed evaluations of seismic refraction  data,  it is  expected  that  the  Bonanza  Bench  hosts  potential for multiple, stacked, auriferous channels.
<P>
For further testing, Gallery has planned a major  reverse  circulation  drilling program  comprising  of  45  holes  on a 100 x 50 meter grid. Drill permits have already been received and the drill has arrived on the 
site as of yesterday, and drilling has commenced.    
<P>                                                     
Upon completion of this extensive drilling  program,  an  ore  reserve  will  be calculated  for  production  purposes.  A  processing  plant  is currently being assembled for production to start early this summer.
<P>                            
In another significant development, the company has acquired  additional  claims  to complement its holdings in the Lightning Creek, Cariboo area:                
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Five Placer claims in the Moustique Creek area, which adjoin the Hannandor  placer leases. 
        These claims will be evaluated for gold potential in the general Moustique Creek area. These 
        claims cover a total of 500 acres.     
<LI>Sixteen hard rock claims which underlie all of the company's Channex and  Hannandor placer 
        leases in the Lightning Creek area.
</OL>
<P>
The hard rock claims acquisitins are important because after detailed  satellite imagery  analysis,  the  company  has  concluded that the Bonanza Bench alluvial gravels are hosted in a  major  junction  of  intersecting  WNW-ESE,  NW-SE  and NNE-SSW bedrock faults. A detailed field program will be 
carried out to prospect for gold in these thrust fault targets which are inferred from geologic studies.
Bedrock  samples  obtained  from the scheduled drilling program will be taken to validate the concept 
that a major source of  the  placer  gold  may  be  on  the company's property.

<DT>04/17/96<DD>The company has had approval to arrange  a  private  placement  on  
a  best effort  basis of up to 1,000,000 units at $0.75 to be held for a 12 month period
from the date of advancement of funds. The company's president and CEO is subscribing 
for a minimum of  $500,000  worth  of these  private  placement  units  which  will  be  done 
on a flow-through basis.  Proceeds from the flow-through portion of the units will be  used  
for  Canadian exploration.  The  balance  of  these  private  placement units will be used for
general working capital purposes.

<DT>03/20/96<DD>Gallery Resourcs will resume its on going drilling program on its 
Cabot Lake Property commencing  the first week of April 1996. The company's existing 
camp and crew will resume drilling  on the Creek zone which consists of a NNE-SSW trending  
sulphide  mineralized  fault  in  the northwest part of a zoned gabbro intrusive. A series of angle 
holes will be drilled in this  location  to  200  - 350m  for  initial  testing.  Cliff zone and Creek 
zone drilling results will be announced upon completion of  the program.<BR> 
<P>                                      
Gallery is also gearing up for an extensive drilling and backhoe  bulk  sampling
program on a recently identified claim known as the Bonanza Bench. This claim is 
located east along a  strike  of the Hannandor open pit area, where mining production 
was carried out in 1994.   
<P>
Geologically, the Bonanza  Bench  area  holds  potential  for  multiple  stacked
auriferous  gravel  systems  which have never been explored. This promising area
was identified  originally  through  a  1994  backhoe  trenching  program  which
discovered  near-surface gold in these auriferous gravels from approximately 0 - 28 feet 
in depth to bedrock, yielding an average minimum $29.00 per  cubic  yard
for  the  six  two yard samples tested.   In order to identify the potential
reserves of this  high  grade  channel  the  following  exploration  program  is
scheduled to take place from April to May 1996. Estimated costs for this program
are $150,000.
<P>                                                                   
The company's exploration program includes 45 reverse circulation holes arranged
on  100m spaced north-south grid lines with drill stations 50m apart; 15 backhoe
trenching sites to further evaluate  a  25  ft  section  of  auriferous  gravels
outlined  from previous work; an ore reserve estimate based on detailed sampling
five feet to ten feet spaced.                                                   
<P>
Gallery will announce results of this extensive exploration work upon completion
of this program.

<DT>01/30/96<DD>The company has purchased an additional key block of properties  
in  the  Voisey Bay  region  of  Labrador.  The  new property, consisting of a 200 unit 
group of claims, is comprised of 12,500 acres approximately 2km south of  Uniakovik  Lake
and  some  15km  southwest  of Okak Bay. Early indications from these properties
show a similarity in Landsat magnetic imagery on a north,  northwest  trend,  to
select  claim  blocks  presently  being  held  by  Noranda  Mines and Kennecott,
immediately to the south of  Gallery's  new  properties. 
<P>
Gallery is also continuing its presence on its  Cabot  Lake  property  with  its
extensive exploration program by relocating its Longyear LF-70 diamond drill and
will await favourable weather conditions in  order  to  immediately  resume  its
drill program.   
<P>                                                               
Negotiations are now under way to vend in additional properties in the Lightning
Creek  area  of the active Cariboo gold field of BC. These properties consist of
hard rock and placer claims that could prove  to  be  very  significant  to  the
company's  overall  land  holdings  and  reserves  base.  Further  announcements
regarding  these  important  acquisitions  will  be  made  upon  completion   of
negotiations.

<DT>01/09/96<DD> The Company reports that Gallery Resources is resuming its winter
drilling program by January 12th.  The drill will be moved to the Creek Zone to test a sulphide
mineralized fault.  To date Gallery has completed four holes on it's Cliff Zone of its 
Cabot Lake property.  Results from these holes along with the results from the Creek Zone 
drilling will be released upon completion. 

In reference to rumors being spread regarding potential take-over bids on Gallery Resources Ltd.,
Mr. Bruce Costerd, President and C.E.O. reports that management is not aware of any
group that has taken a position in the Company with a view to acquire control and the Company
has had no official indication that any group plans to do so.

<DT>12/12/95<DD>The Company has arranged a private placement for investment purposes of up to 1,000,000 units at a price of $1.28 per unit to be held for a period of 12 months from the date of advancement of the funds. 500,000 units will consist of one flow-through share and one non-transferable share purchase warrant to purchase one additional common share of the Company for a period of two years at a price of $1.56

 Bruce Costerd, President of the Company, has subscribed for 390,000 of the 500,000 flow-through share
share units for aggregate proceeds to the Company of approximately $500,000.


<DT>12/01/95<DD>Mr. Jens Touborg, VP/Explorations of the Company, reported that two diamond drill holes have been completed on the Cliff Zone.  The Cliff Zone hosts a coincident magnetic anomaly and surface rust zone around intersecting ENE-WSW and NNE-SSW fault zones within the border zone of a gabbro and anorthosite intrusive body approximately 6 kilometers in diameter.  Hole CL 95-1 was drilled at -45 degree angle, on 160 degree azimuth, terminated at 226.5 metres depth.  Hole CL 95-2 was drilled at 60 degree angle, on 160 degree azimuth, to 329.5 metres depth.  Hole CL 95-3, located 50 metres west
of the first drill set-up, will be drilled parallel to CL 95-1 to test a gozzan around a fault intersection.
Mineralized sections of Hole CL 95-1, from  163.5 to 184.6 metres, and of Hole CL 95-2, from 167.7
to 171.3 and 270 to 300 metres, have been submitted for assay.  The core has been sampled in detail.
A zone of disseminated sulphide mineralization has been intersected, averaging 10% sulphides over 33
metres and up to 25% over 0.75 metres.

<DT>11/14/95<DD>The Company announced that its geologist, Mr. Jens
Touborg, reported that the winter drill program is on schedule.  The
Artic style winterized camp has been completely set up and functional
since Sunday, November 12, 1995.  The camp is well situated in a
comfortable, protective zone, a short walking distance, approximately
400m, from the drilling area.  The Company's exploration staff and the
drilling crew are presently on site, as the drilling is being organized.
This morning, the brand new Longyear LF-70 flyweight drill has been
broken down and is being flown in by a B-2 helicopter to the Cabot Lake
drill site.  The drill will be assembled and installed into the drill
shack located on the target at the Cliff zone.  The drilling shifts will
commence either this evening or Wednesday morning at the latest.  The
three zones to be drilled have been identified as the Cliff zone,
followed by the Central zone and the Creek zone.  The first zone to be
drilled will be the Cliff zone to test a large sulphide mineralized
gossan coincident with a magnetic VLF signature within a gabbro
intrusive body.  The crew will drill a minimum of three to four holes
averaging 200 to 400m in length to test the nickel/copper potential of
the sulphide zone.  Communications have been established on site and
everything is a go.

<DT>10/30/95<DD>Mr. Jens Touborg, VP/Explorations of Gallery Resources has
reported that the previously announced drill program on the Cabot Lake
property continued on schedule.  Having completed an archaeological survey
at the Cabot Lake property on October 18, the Newfoundland government
licensed archaeologist and an authorized representative of the Labrador
Inuit Association of Nain found no archaeological artifacts on the proposed
drill area and determined there were no objections for permitting to drill. 
Pursuant to the verbal authorization, by the land use officer for the
Newfoundland government to commence with drilling, an official drill permit
(stamped, hard copy) should be imminently issued.  A fully equipped ten man
winterized camp arrived this past weekend from Yellowknife, Northwest
Territories and is being presently constructed.  A standard, detailed ground
geophysical survey (magnetic, VLF, Max-Min) to pinpoint the most favourable
drill targets, has just been completed.  A leased satellite phone will be in
the camp for a two month period to provide outside communications.  The new
Longyear LF70 diamond drill, which was successfully tested over a three week
period, has been shipped and is expected to arrive in Nain this week.  The
crew of Logan Drilling will operate the program, which will take three to
five weeks to complete.  Drilling will be announced upon commencement.

<DT>10/03/95<DD>Gallery Resources confirmed recent press reports that it is
presently holding discussions with several companies concerning its Cabot
Lake property in Voisey Bay, Newfoundland.  These discussions range from
technical exchanges of information to outright joint venturing and/or the
sale of certain rights in the property.  The Company confirmed that its
consulting geologist, Jens Touborg of Jens Touborg Consulting Limited is
being dispatched to the Cabot Lake property later this week to complete
detailed ground geophysical work comprised of magnetic, VLF and max-min EM
surveys on a 100m spaced grid with spacings 50m apart.  This work will
precisely define drill targets for the approximately 10,000 feet of diamond
drilling that the Company will conduct on its Cabot Lake property in Voisey
Bay in early November.  The Company confirmed that it has passed $150,000 to
Logan Drilling of Stewiacke, Nova Scotia for the work that will be conducted
between October 25 and November 5 subject to the delivery of the drill to
Nain.

<DT>09/25/95<DD>Gallery Resources Limited announced that it has decided to
forego further sampling through trenching and will commence approximately
10,000 feet of diamond drilling on its Cabot Lake property in Voisey Bay,
Labrador in November.  Of three potential drill targets on the northwest
corner of Gallery's Cabot Lake property, Jens Tourborg of Touborg Consulting
Limited has advised the company to drill off one large magnetic anomaly that
is approximately 400 meters in diameter.  The preferred target contains two
major chimney-shaped highs that are each approximately 75 by 100 meters in
extent. These chimneys, which are highly suggestive of sulfide mineralized
structures, lie on either side of the "Cliff Zone", a highly altered "rust
zone of gabbroic rocks and gneissic inclusions with heavy disseminations of
pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.  To precisely define its drill targets, Gallery
will shortly begin detailed ground geophysical work comprised of magnetic,
VLF and max-min EM surveys on a 100 meter spaced grid with spacings 50
meters apart.  Jens Touborg and his team spent a total of 16 days on the
property and took a total of 90 samples.  Assays on less than a third of
these samples have been received.  When all assays have been received, a
comprehensive report on geology, geophysics and assays will be compiles and
released.  Gallery hope to complete a $1 million tranche private equity
financing today and anticipates completing a further $2 million tranche
later this week.  The private placement offering is for $3 million units
consisting of one common share and one warrant having a two year expiry date
from the date of subscription and is subject to a twelve month hold period. 
Upon the completion of this private placement offering, the Company would
have raised a total amount of $4 million in the last month.  The proceeds
will enable Gallery to independently explore it Voisey Bay, Harp Lake and
Sango Bay properties.

<DT>09/18/95<DD>The Company announced that it has identified a large
mineralized area containing massive sulfides on its Cabot Lake property in
Voisey Bay, Labrador.  Jens Touborg, the company's geologist established
base camp in the Cabot Lake property twelve days ago.  In a preliminary
report, he confirmed that his team has traced mineralization lying across
the northwest corner of the property that extends over a strike area of
approximately 1.5 kilometers in length by 1 kilometers in width.  The
massive sulfide mineralization was "a disseminated halo around a large
mineralized body" and there are "unusual layered gabbro bodies with vast
amounts of gneisses inclusions showing varying amounts of contamination,
digestion by basic magma".  Based on prior geological work done in Labrador,
these showings may suggest the presence of platinum group elements (PGE), as
well as Nickel, Copper and Cobalt normally associated with this type of
geology.  Field work completed so far confirmed the findings of Jens
Touborg's enhanced Landsat imagery that indicated a 3 kilometer area within
which to work.  It also confirmed the initial results from the extensive
mapping of the property by the recently completed aerial magnetometer
survey.  To date, more that 70 damples have been taken from the area and
sent to a lab for assay.

<DT>09/08/95<DD>Without having to give away any percentage of its Voisey Bay
holdings through joint venturing, the Company internally financed its budget
goals for work plans on its holdings in the Voisey Bay and the Cariboo
through 1996 by the exercise and/or sale of director, officer and employee
stock options and stock.  Approximately $1,000,000 has been placed into the
company's treasury over the last several weeks.  At its annual meeting in
August, the Company received a promising interpretation from the satellite
imagery on its Voisey Bay properties.  The Company is now equipped with
sophisticated printing and computer equipment to provide initial
interpretation of its aerial magnetometer and other results within three to
five days.  The Company is waiting for geological seismic interpretation of
a possible channel on its Channex placer gold property in the Cariboo.

<DT>07/26/95<DD>Gallery Resources President, Bruce Costerd announced initial
details of the first stage of the Company's exploration program on its
Voisey Bay properties.  The initial exploration survey will focus in the
area between Konrad Brook and Cabot Lake, located approximately 30
kilometers S.W. of the Voisey Bay/Diamond Fields discovery..  The airborne
survey work will be carried out by Aero Survey Inc. and will commence during
the first week of August, 1995.

<DT>07/25/95<DD>The Company announces that exploration programs on both the
Hannandor claims (Lightning Creek) and the Channex claims (John Boyd-Barry
Creek) have commenced.  A geologist is on site full time initiating survey
and field work which will help to locate the ancient buried channels along
the John Boyd-Barry Creek confluence.

<DT>06/15/95<DD>The Company announced the acquisition of an additional 800
claims in the Voisey Bay and Harp Lake areas of Labrador, Newfoundland. 
These high quality claims extend over 50,000 acres and were selected on the
recommendation of geological experts.

<DT>04/17/95<DD>Gallery Resources and Sensors Signals Systems of Lexington,
Massachusetts are in negotiations for the licensing of advanced sensing
technology for specific applications, including minerals exploration and
recovery, petroleum exploration and recovery, soil remediation and
construction.  Gallery Resources presently plans to use the technology on
its mining properties in the Cariboo Mining District of B.C. and its
recently acquired Voisey Bay Property in Labrador, Newfoundland.

<DT>04/11/95<DD>The Company announced the successful completion of
negotiations in acquiring its Voisey Bay property. Consisting of 96 claims
covering approximately 6000 acres, the Voisey Bay property was purchased for
150,000 shares of Company stock.

<DT>02/28/95<DD>Gallery Resources announced that they are currently in
negotiations to acquire claim blocks in the Voisey Bay area of Labrador in
close proximity to Diamond Fields discovery.

<P>
Gallery Resources Limited is currently conducting exploration programs on
its properties: Hannandor Gold Mine, Cariboo District of B.C. and Voisey Bay
Property, Labrador, Newfoundland.
<P>
With the significant development potential in Labrador, Newfoundland, and
the Company being refinanced by recent market activities, Gallery Resources'
Voisey Bay claims have become the company's main focus of its 1995 and 1996
exploration program.  As of the end of September 1995, the airborne survey
had been completed on the Cabot Lake property consisting of a total of 96
claims.  In addition to the aerial magnetometer survey, a total of 90
surface rock samples were taken from the reported area and have been
forwarded to a lab for assay.  On September 25, 1995, Gallery Resoucres
Limited announced that it has decided to forego further sampling through
trenching and will begin its ground geophysical work comprising of VLF and
MAX-MIN EM survey, and early in November, approximately 10,000 feet of
diamond drilling will begin on its Cabot Lake property.
<P>
Gallery Resources Limited began an extensive exploration program July 25,
1995 in the Cariboo mining district of British Columbia.  The program
consists of seismic surveys, drilling and bulk sampling on both the
Hannandor and Channex properties.  The company believes this work will
dramatically increase Gallery's Gold reserves for future production.

<P>
Incorporated in Alberta in 1987, Gallery Resources Limited changed its name
from Gallery Gold Mines Ltd. on June 4, 1990 with a share conversion of 1
new share for 5 old shares. The Company holds 100% interest in two gold
properties in the Lightning Creek near Quesnel, B.C.: the Hannandor gold
property which comprised of 8 claims and the Channex property which
consisted of 9 claims.  In the third quarter of 1993, with a
"state-of-the-art" gold recovery plant, the Company processed an average of
1,683 cubic metres of gravel per day yielding 2,119 oz. of gold.  In 1994,
Gallery Resources took another trial production yielding 1268 oz. of gold.
In 1995, the Company expanded its exploration program on its gold properties
to confirm the volume of gold in the gravels on other claims on the
properties.
<P>
<B>Voisey Bay Projects</B>
<P>
Gallery Resources Limited acquired 896 promising claims, total area of
54,000 acres in close proximity to the Diamond Fields' discovery.  The
claims are in the areas of Cabot Lake, Sango Bay South West, Sango Bay West,
Harp Lake Intrusive #1 and #2, Flower's River and Sango Brook.  In the Cabot
Lake area, other mining companies report encouraging mineral indication. 
Harp Lake Intrusion has been one of the three major areas targeted during
the Labrador staking rush.  The other claims in the southern portion of the
Nain Pultonic Suite are all strategically located between 50 to 70
kilometres south of the Diamond Fields' Discovery.

<DL>
<DT>11/01/96<DD>During 1996, the  company  launched  a  local  sales  program  with  its  unique
advertising  medium,  TransActionMedia,  to  address  the  advertising  needs of retailers surrounding the company's contracted chains. These cost effective  and locally  targeted  ad  messages were initially published on the receipt tapes of Food Lion stores in the Carolinas. This will build a  local  marketing  presence
for  the  company.  The  company  believes that further chains can be brought on board and different message delivery systems can augment such a  local  program.
<P>
Initial sales figures are encouraging and future expansion is expected.   
<P>
As previously announced, the company has completed its first run of  advertising on  the  back  of  SwissRail  tickets  in  Switzerland.  In  1997 SwissRail will celebrate its 150th year of operations. Because of this, many  advertisers  will be  implementing  promotional  programs and the company expects to tap into this
opportunity. 
<P>
The company has established  two  operating  partnerships,  one  in Switzerland and one in France, owned 51% by the company. The corporate objective of allying the company with other organizations of proven success and  expertise in areas which complement the company will be duplicated as expansion continues.
The company's partner, NCR Corp, is the dominant supplier of transaction receipt forms in Europe.

<DT>06/25/96<DD>The company has won the rights to  publish  advertising  on  tickets  issued  by
SwissRail to its passengers, and has already made a significant sale in this new medium.          
<P>                                                               
NCR, the company's partner, already prints over 70 million tickets per year  for SwissRail  on  an  exclusive  basis.  The  first  order for advertising on these tickets, worth over $100,000, has already been sold. This is the single  biggest order the company has received to date.   
<P>                                      
Ads in German and French for a major Swiss magazine publisher will  appear  over the  next  three  months on the reverse of tickets issued to daily commuters all over Switzerland. Demand for the new product is such that the company expects to be able to sell it at higher rates in the future.       
<P>                        
SwissRail ticket advertising is part of the company's family of TransActionMediawhich  deliver quality advertising messages on transaction receipts such as cash register rolls, pharmacy prescription forms, tickets and ATM receipts. NCR,  the company's  exclusive partner, is the world's largest manufacturer of transaction
receipts.
 
<DT>04/30/96<DD>A new medium has been launched that is designed to give better exposure for drug
chain marketers to pharmacy patients. Known as Tyrannosaurus Rx, the medium uses the prescription receipt issued to patients to deliver advertising  messages  to patients  as  they receive their prescription. An extensive distribution network and fully paid advertising have already been secured.                           
<P>
The company has won exclusive rights to distribute T Rx at Kmart pharmacy  (over 1700  pharmacy  locations) and Kroger pharmacy (over 650) pharmacies). This will allow the publication of  T  Rx  preprinted  advertising  on  over  100  million prescription  forms per annum, with annual potential revenue of over $3 million.
<P>
The company is working rapidly with its partner NCR to extend T Rx  distribution to  other  major  pharmacy  chains.  NCR already supplies consumable supplies to nearly all of the top 10 drug chains in the US.
This development further  strengthens  the  company's  available  reach  against pharmacy  customers,  since  the  company  already  has exclusive rights to sell advertising on cash register rolls distributed by CVS/pharmacy (4th  largest  US drug chain with 1341 stores).
<P>                                                   
First publication of T Rx will be at Kmart pharmacy locations  in  the  southern US, with advertising for 
Ray O Vac hearing aid batteries. Ray O Vac has chosen TRx because of the targeted delivery against older audiences  and  because  their product   is   featured  right  on  prescription  counters  at  pharmacies.  The
advertising is  printed  on  the  front  of  the  form  beside  drug  disclosure
information.                                                                    
<P>
The company decided to develop a pharmacy related product after it  observe  the massive  investment  in  conventional  advertising media occasioned by new, more stringent drug disclosure requirements in the US.  Other  trends,  such  as  the approval  of  many  drugs  for  conversion  to  OTC (over the counter) sale have
contributed to the trend.

<DT>02/29/96<DD>The company has secured the rights to distribute its TransactionMedia,  
the  new class of  print advertising media it has developed with AT&T/NCR within Safeway
stores. This is a very important  development  because  it  establishes  a  huge
presence  for  the  company's Shoppers Digest cash register roll magazine in the
western US. The addition of Safeway rights for Shopper's Digest to those already
won  for  Kroger and Food Lion stores means that Shopper's Digest is the fastest
growing in-store advertising network in terms of distribution in US  advertising
history.  This critical mass reach is  vital  for  the  company  to  compete  effectively  with
national television and magazine advertising. Kroger is the largest grocery chain in the US, 
Safeway is  the  second  largest.
<P>
The company has already had 11  requests  for  proposals  from  advertisers  for
advertising   at  Safeway  on  Shopper's  Digest.  NCR's  IMC-trained  staff  of
specialists is now racing to complete  the  building  of  the  Shopper's  Digest
network to include the Northeastern US.

<DT>02/20/96<DD>Further to its release of July 26 1995, the company  began  selling  
advertising space  in  the  Food  Lion chain, and published its first advertising program in
Food Lion stores on December 23. The program, entitled Holiday savings from Food
Lion,  featured  advertisements  from  ten  different advertisers, including Mrs
Cubbisons Foods, Read Prepared Salads, McCain's French Fries, Schulze and  Birch
Biscuit  Company, Armor Swift Eckrich meats, Dean Foods vegetables, Gwaltney hot
dogs, Ore-Ida potatoes, and In-Style magazine. The latter ad was run  under  the
continuing Time-Warner contract, announced in Stockwatch August 1 1995.         
Increased sales performance of register receipt advertising is being  tested  by
Food  Lion through examination of bar codes scanned at their cash registers. The
company expects to announce Food Lion scanner  performance  results  within  the
next  two weeks as a followup to previous scanner research. In previous research
tests  conducted  for  the  company  by  Efficient  Marketing  Services   during
September,  it  was  found  that  sales  of  Bic Twin Select razors increased by
approximately 38% in Kroger stores during the first week of the  promotion,  and
by an average of 15.8% over the full eight weeks the program ran.
<P>               
Further to news September 8 1995, the company  is  developing  its working  relationship with
Gannett by extending its contact with various Gannett divisions. 
<P>
The company has also  signed  a  joint  selling  agreement  with  Co-Options,  a
Connecticut  based  organization  which  develops  themed  advertising  programs
combining various media in effective programs for  its  clients.  Joint  selling
efforts with Gannett and Co-Options will take some time to commence. 
<P>
The company's relationship with  AT&T  Systemedia  continues  to  flourish.  The
company  trained  a  hand-picked  AT&T  sales team in October to further enhance
distribution of the company's media, AT&T Systemedia has since elected to return
to  its  original name of NCR, the name under which it established itself as the
world's leading supplier of transaction receipts. The company has  an  exclusive
ten  year  contract  with NCR to publish advertising on those receipts, in a new
class of media called TransActionMedia.         
<P>                                
Under this contract, NCR secures distribution for the  company's  media  at  NCR
retail  customers.  NCR  has  requested  that  the  company  aggressively pursue
opportunities in countries in addition to  the  US  in  order  to  stake  out  a
mutually  powerful  position  in  strong  advertising  markets. Accordingly, the
company has trained an NCR sales force in Canada, and expects  to  announce  the
acquisition of distribution agreements there imminently.     
<P>                   
The company has also trained an NCR team in the UK, and has conducted  extensive
market  research in that market over the past year. A new subsidiary, Integrated
Media Communications (UK), has  been  formed,  with  offices  at  88  Gloucester
Avenue,  London  NW1.  Managing  director  is  Ken  Melville, COO is Christopher
Stevens.  Each  officer  has  over  20  years  experience  in  ad  media  sales.
Negotiations  with  the  leading grocery and drug chains for distribution rights
have commenced.
<P>                                                                 
NCR has also asked the company to examine opportunities in  continental  Europe,
and  the  company  has appointed management staff there, with a view to securing
joint ventures and commencing operations in  France,  Switzerland  and  Germany.
Further developments on this subject are expected shortly. In order to focus its
resources on these major markets, the  company  has  decided  to  terminate  its
operations  in  South Africa and Costa Rica. In addition, the company has turned
down an invitation to enter the Australian market in order to further focus  its
efforts on revenue development.

<P>
Incorporated in 1987, the Company underwent various name changes and
operated as Cost-Miser Coupons (International) Inc. until February 1994,
when a new board of directors was elected to conduct a financial
restructuring of the Company and to settle long-term debt obligations.  The
Restructuring included a 5-old-for-1-new rollback of the Company's common
shares and a name change to Integrated Media Communications Inc.  Integrated
Media's focus became the "$65 Billion marketing dollars" identified by AT&T
being shifted annually to more targeted forms of ad message delivery
systems.  To that end, in June 1994 IMC began negotiations with AT&T Global
Information Solutions which controlled over 60% of the world's blank cash
register tape distribution acquired by the prior acquisition of NCR.  The
negotiations culminated in a 10-year joint venture agreement being signed in
October 1994 between the two companies.  In combination, IMC and AT&T GIS
are providing new products which offer advertisers a highly cost-effective,
targeted advertising medium.  The Joint Venture places high-quality,
four-color ad messages on the back of transaction documents which are handed
to shoppers at the time of purchase.  IMC's unit cost is much lower than
other target media and is comparable to mass-market media such as the free
standing inserts delivered in local newspapers or by mail. However, in IMC's
case, the ad messages are placed directly into the hands of the consumer
group advertisers want to target most: <EM>shoppers who make the buying
decisions.</EM>
<P>
Through the Company's <B><EM>Shopper's Digest</EM></B>, an in-store cash
register receipt magazine, shoppers get interesting information about
products and services as well as horoscopes, helpful hints and recipes. 
With <B><EM>Video Choice</EM></B>, the Company delivers a four-colour
ad/coupon on the back of video rental contracts, perfect for snacks,
beverages and other "TV time" brands.  On the <B><EM>T Rx</EM></B>
prescription forms delivered into the hands of consumers at pharmacies, the
Company places ads on the back of the forms for HBA and OTC pharmaceutical
brands.
<P>
Kroger Stores and Montgomery Ward are among the chains that have signed up
for the program. The Gannett organization, Time Warner Inc. Turner Home
Entertainment Inc. and Food Lion grocery stores signed up within the last
four months.
<P>
<B><EM>Shopper's Digest</EM></B> has a potential circulation of 4 billion ad
and spaces per year within Kroger and Food Lion grocery stores alone.  In
fact, its circulation growth has been faster than any other US in-store
advertising Company.  Production and distribution of Shopper's Digest is
handled by the Company's strategic alliance partner AT& T Global Information
Solutions.  To date, some 767 Kroger, 1,033 Food Lion and 365 Montgomery
Ward stores have agreed to carry <B><EM>Shopper's Digest</EM></B> on their
cash register receipts.  By February 1996, over 5,000 grocery stores are
anticipated to be part of the program.

<DT>11/08/96<DD>The company intends to make an application to the VSE for an  extension  of  the
filing  deadlines for the two private placements arranged on August 22 1996. The two private placements involved a total of 93,000  units  at  $2.15.   The gross  proceeds  to be realized under the two private placements are $195,950. 
<P>
The company has  withdrawn  the  private  placement  arranged  on  June  5  1996 involving 785,000 units at $2.55 and the private placement arranged on August 23 1996 involving 46,000 units at $2.17.     
<P>                                      
The company has been advised that IHI  International  Holdings,  a  wholly-owned Bermuda  subsidiary,  has  arranged  a  private  placement  involving 14 million shares. There are currently outstanding 36,000,000 shares of IHI  International.
<P>
The  placee  is  R.A.R. Consultants, a company controlled by Mr Roger A. Rached, the president of the company. The shares will be issued at  $0.04  for  a  total purchase  price  of  $560,000,  payable  on  terms.  All  of  the  shares of IHI International held by the company were issued at $0.01 per  share.  On  June  17
1996,  IHI International acquired the right to the building technology developed by Mr Rached for $200,000 (together with a net profits royalty of 1%). Following completion  of  the  private  placement,  Mr Rached and his associates will hold directly 28% of the outstanding shares of IHI International. Proceeds  from  the
private  placement  will be used for working capital purposes, and primarily for patent costs. Following completion of the private placement, Mr Rached will have an  equity  stake  in the international development and commercialization of the building technology of approximately 65%. This position is consistent  with  the
plan  of  reorganization  set  out  in  various  news  releases of the company's predecessor. The private placement is subject to shareholder approval.
<P>
The Company also reports earthwork and dynamic densificiation has commenced at the Hopcott Road property. Silt  removal  and  sand  replacement  will be completed by November 10 1996 and dynamic densification will be completed by mid  December  1996.  With  over  130 panels having already been produced at its Surrey pilot facility, the company is well on its way to meeting its objective of completing the construction  of  the permanent  manufacturing  facility  by mid 1997. The panels, measuring 13,000 sq ft, are destined for use at Hopcott Road  for  the  factory's  production  floor area.      
<P>                                                                     
During the first six months of 1996 the company received confirmation of  patent protection  over its licenced technology in several key jurisdictions, including Taiwan, South Africa and several other African nations. Recently,  patents  have been  issued  in  the  Bahamas  and  Iran. Patent grants are expected shortly in
Bolivia, Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia  and
Zimbabwe.

<DT>11/04/96<DD>The company has arranged a private placement for the  purchase  of  a  total  of
82,000  units  at  $1.61. 
<P>
The total proceeds of  $132,020  will  be  used  for  the  construction  of  the manufacturing  facility and acquisition and installation of production equipment on the company's Hopcott Road property and for general working capital purposes.

The company has arranged two private placements for the purchase of:<br>

More than 350 people and media gathered for a spade turning ceremony  on  August 15 in Delta, BC for the company's new automated construction facility. The plant on a 14+ acre site will produce panelized homes and buildings for  30%  less  in construction  cost than those built using traditional methods and materials. The
facility will be made using the company's own  patented  technologies  and  will initially employ 70 people, with the potential to provide jobs for up to 300.   
<P>
In the  company's  patented,  environmentally  friendly  manufacturing  process, computers  are  loaded  with  detailed  architectural drawings and reproduce 3-D images of the design. The computers direct robotic arms  and  laser  cutters  to cut,  shape  and  f  it steel frames to the drawings. The insulated steel-framed
wall and floor  panels  are  reinforced  with  concrete  and  lightweight  rigid insulation.  Unique steel joints on panels allow for quick assembly and strength unmatched by wood-framed construction.       
<P>                                   
The facility, the first of its kind, will also produce new plants that  will  be shipped  abroad for production with joint venture partners. The constant flow of product from this inaugural plant will both stimulate demand  for  more  product and prime the pump for production around the world.

<DT>05/09/96<DD>Letters patent, in respect of over 72 claims, are now available for issuance  
by the Taiwanese Patent Authority.      There is a promise of  renewed  optimism  and  growing  business  confidence  in Taiwan,  following  the  recent  national  elections in that country, and IHI is seriously considering Taiwan as its base for  manufacturing  operations  in  the expanding far east markets.                                                     
Further to the company news release of May 8 1996, the proposed conventional construction

next two to four months.                                   
<P>
Obtaining the US patents will help secure for us an exclusive  and  preferential position   in   product,   features,  performance  and  costs  compared  to  our competitors, while assuring the company  the  
widest  possible  application  and broadest potential market for its products in the North American market.

<DT>04/23/96<DD>The company has arranged a private placement for 31,100  units  at  $3.22. 
The  total proceeds of approximately $100,142 will be used for costs in relationto the development 
of the   cmpany's  Hopcott  Road  property  and  for  working capital purposes.                                                               

<DT>04/11/96<DD>The company has received  a  favourable  international  preliminary  examination 
report  from  the International Preliminary Examining Authority under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.                                                             
<P>
The report indicates that all key concepts and  components  of  the  earthquake, fire  and  wind  resistant  prefabricated  building  panels  that  comprise  the company's  building  technology  satisfy  the  PCT  requirements  for   novelty, inventive  step  and  industrial applicability. 
<P>
National phase applications will now be filed, where patent examiners in 70 nations  (including  nations  
in  the European  Patent  Convention  community  and Canada) are expected to endorse all claims that 
have been  favourably  regarded  in  the  International  Preliminary Examination report.                                                             
<P>
Certain patent applications filed outside of  the  PCT  have  been  allowed  andpatents  have  been  issued  in  Burundi, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jordan, Malta, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria and Zaire.                          
Results from the examination of the patent application  in  the  US  Patent  and Trademark Office are 
expected to be available shortly.

<DT>04/08/96<DD>For the year ended December 31 1995  revenue  from  licensing  arrangements  was
approximately  $1.2 million. During fiscal 1995 the company raised approximately $1.4 million in equity 
capital from private investors. Subsequent to December 31 1995 the company arranged further private 
placements of $3 million.      
<P>             
These figures reflect the company's plan to  secure  cash  flow  from  licensing activities and to arrange 
financing in order to bring its product to market.    The company invested approximately $700,000 to 
pay for the costs associated with obtaining  patents  and  approximately $500,000 to develop its technology. 
These activities will permit the company to achieve a manufacturing capability at  its 13  acre Tilbury Island industrial area site, which is strategically located for easy access to raw material supplies and all forms of transportation.           
<P>
For the year ended December 31 1995, operating expenditures  were  approximately $2.2  million.  This  
increase  reflects the costs associated with the company's activities in relation to the development of its 
building technology,  including the  marketing  and  proposed  licensing  thereof.  Following another successful demonstration event in Luxembourg in October 1995, IHI  International  Holdings, the   
company's  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  has  been  particularly  active  in identifying suitable strategic partners in various countries who will be able to assist in development and exploitation of the technology outside of Canada.

<DT>04/02/96<DD>The VSE has consented to the transfer within escrow of 21,470,672 shares 
from R.Abou-Rached to R.A.R. Consultants.

<DT>03/27/96<DD>Construction of a permanent manufacturing facility will commence  in  June.  
The facility,  which  will  be  constructed  in  the Tilbury industrial area at 7393
Hopcott Road, Delta, BC, will consist of approximately  62,000  square  feet  of
manufacturing capacity.                                                         
<P>
Initially, it is expected that the facility  will  produce  approximately  5,000 square  feet  of  
finished  housing  per  shift,  using one production line. The production plant startup, construction 
and capital costs for one production line are expected total approximately $7 million.
<P>                                    
In conjunction with a Vancouver firm of architects, the company has developed  a project  
schedule  for the permanent manufacturing facility. Engineering for the facility has commenced and 
is expected to be completed by the end of April 1996.
<P>
The  manufacturing  facility  will  be  constructed  from prefabricated building panels  produced  
at  Canadian  hi-Tech's  pilot  manufacturing,   testing   and development   facility  in  Surrey,  BC.  
It  is  expected  that  equipment  and construction tendering will be completed by the end of 
May  1996  and  that  the installation  of  pilings  will  commence  in  June  1996.  Construction  of the
permanent manufacturing facility is expected to be completed in early 1997.  The company  will  be 
prepared to accept, on a firm commitment basis, orders for its product in the fall of 1996.
<P>                                                   
The company will finance construction costs for the first production line with a combination  of  preferred  and common share offerings and conventional mortgage financing. The company's objective is to finance construction costs for  further production  lines  from  a  combination of debt and equity offerings and, 
at the option of the company, cash flow generated from its manufacturing operations. As
announced  earlier this year , the company entered into a letter of intent with a US-based investment  
banker  respecting  a  proposed  offering  of 1,000,000  non-voting  preferred  shares  and  3,000,000 
warrants at US$5.00 per share.  Also earlier this year the company entered into an agreement with a Vancouver  mortgage  company,  to provide mortgage financing of  up  to  $7 million.  This agreement will be completed by April 1996.
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996 the company has raised a total of $3 million in  equity  capital  in  connection
with  private  placements  of  its  shares.  If  all  of  the warrants issued in connection with those private placements are  exercised,  the  proceeds  to  the company  will range from approximately $3 million 
to $3.45 million, depending on when the warrants are exercised.                                                
<P>
The company is continuing with discussions  with  members  of  the  private  andpublic   sectors   in   Atlantic  Canada  for  the  establishment  of  a  second manufacturing facility in Canada.

<DT>02/20/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an amendment  dated  February  16  1996 
 to  the company's  filing  statement  (No. 22/93) dated May 13 1993. The amendment is as
follows:    
<P>                                                                    
The last paragraph of section 1.3 (escrow share transfer and  top-up  of  escrow
shares), on page 13, is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:      
Pursuant to the policies of the Exchange, the transferred escrow shares and  the
performance escrow shares will be released from escrow on the basis of one share
for each $0.295 of cash flow earned by the company after giving  effect  to  the
2-for-1 split of the company's common shares completed on January 24 1994.      
The effect of the amendment is to correct an  error  whereby  the  escrow  share
earn-out  price was based on the cumulative cash flow of the company's 65% owned
subsidiary, Canadian Hi-Tech Manufacturing, rather than the cumulative cash flow
of International Hi-Tech Industries.

The technology is a proposed building construction process that utilizes
completely manufactured prefabricated panels.  All major structural
components can be created using the process, including foundations, floor
panels, wall panels and roof panels.  The prefabricated panels are composed
of special reinforced concrete, rigid foam and cold formed metals, with
built-in rectangular hollow metal tubing acting as panel framing members. 
The panels will be manufactured at a plant to be constructed in the Tilbury
Industrial area at 7393 Hopcott Road, Delta, British Columbia and shipped to
a particular site for erection.  The floor and wall panels are complete with
interior and exterior finishes, windows, plumbing and electrical services. 
Likewise, the foundations are completely prefabricated with fully integrated
structural, electrical services and plumbing connections.  Spaces such as
kitchens can be pre-assembled and transported as three-dimensional modules.
<P>
The basic design of a wall panel entails the use of structural steel members
as a framework, tensioned by steel cables.  Rigid foam forms the centre
section of the panel sandwiched between concrete and stucco/concrete on the
inside and outside, respectively.
<P>
The density and thickness of the wall panel will vary accordingly to the
building location and application and will be determined by a special
computer program developed by R.A.R. Consultants Ltd., a Company controlled
by Mr. Roger Abou-Rached.  The program, which allows architectural drawings
to be used as a basis for determining panel size and configurations, is the
property of RAR Consultants and is not subject to the Canadian Licence
Agreement.  As the Technology does not utilize molds, panels can be
manufactured in virtually any size and configuration.

<DT>11/06/96<DD>Project feasibility projections prepared by Bateman Minerals & Industrial Ltd of South Africa, indicate earnings for International Panorama in excess US$900 million after-tax over a ten year period from its interest in the Kambove/Kakanda tailings project in the Shaba region of Zaire.     
<P>                                              
Bateman is a multi-national engineering firm with  extensive  expertise  in  the development  of  tailings  deposits and a history of operations in Zaire. It has been engaged by  International Panorama  to  produce  a  full  feasibility  study  on  the Kambove/Kakanda project. International Panorama is 51% owner and operator of the project under a joint venture with Gecamines, the  state  mining  enterprise  of Zaire.  The agreement was approved and signed into law by the Zairian parliament in September.  
<P>                                                                 
Total tailings reserves on the project site are estimated to exceed  61  million tonnes, grading an average of 0.19% cobalt and 0.98% copper. This equates to 255 million pounds of cobalt and 1.3 billion pounds of  copper,  with  an  in-ground metal  value  of over US$6 billion, based upon current metal prices. Preliminary
metallurgical tests indicate recovery rates  of  70%  for  cobalt  and  90%  for copper.  Capital  costs  for  a  processing facility capable of 5 million tonnes annual throughput, are estimated at less than US$190  million.  The  plant  will consist   of   agitated  vat-leaching,  solvent  extraction  and  electrowinning treatment, and a sulphuric  acid  production  facility.  Plant  construction  is scheduled to begin in May 1997, with commercial metals production by late 1998. 
<P>
International Panorama President, Kenneth MacLeod, said "We are very pleased with the Bateman report,
especially their projection of achieving capital payback in the first year of production and the generation of approximately US  900 million in after tax profits for International Panorama over a ten year project life.  This forecast is based on an average cobalt price of approximately US $12 per pound.  <b>Currently the price is over US $ 20.".
<P>
The Bateman summary states, "A sensitivity analysis indicates the project to be successful at cobalt prices of US $$ 6 per pound or more, and to be relatively insensitive to all other input variables.
<P>
Cobalt is used in high temperature alloys, tool steels, rechargeable batteries, as well as permanent magnets.
<P>
International Panorama's operations at Kambove  and  Kakanda  are  proceeding  swiftly  and smoothly.  Dump  &  Dune Drillers have completed the drilling program at Kambove and Kakanda on schedule. The samples have been shipped to Johannesburg for assay and metallurgical analysis.   
<P>                                                  
The company has not experienced any delays or disruptions in conducting business in  Shaba  or  at  the  office  in  Kinshasa. Two of the company's directors, Mr Gilbert Mundela and Mr John Tyson, are  supervising  the  company's  affairs  in Zaire.  The  unrest  on  the  Rwandan  border is occurring over 1,000km from the
company's operations at Kambove and Kakanda and is  a  continuation  of  a  long standing  traditional  rivalry  between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes. The company's Zairian management are of the opinion that the current strife  will  not  affect future operations.       
<P>                                                       
This transaction was approved by shareholders on September 12 1996.

<dt>09/16/96<dd>The Government of Zaire has formally ratified an  agreement  between  Gecamines, the   state-owned   mining  enterprise  and  International  Panorama  Resource's wholly-owned subsidiary, PTM Minerals (Cayman) Ltd, to develop the cobalt/copper tailings deposits at Kambove and Kakanda in the Shaba Region of Zaire.          
<P>
Reserve  estimates  provided  by  Gecamines  for  the  Kambove/Kakanda  deposits indicate  over  61  million  tonnes  of  tailings grading 0.19% cobalt and 0.98% copper. This equates to 255 million pounds of cobalt and 1.3 billion  pounds  of copper,  which,  at  current  market  prices,  provides  a  value exceeding US$6 billion.                                                                        
IPRC holds a 51% interest in the tailings and is operator of the project.       
<P>
International Panorama has initiated a feasibility study which will provide  for a  bankable  document  defining the scope of the project, establish plant design and thoroughly define capital and operating costs.
<P>                              
Drilling  is  scheduled  to  begin  September  21 and completion is expected by the end of October 1996.                                            
Negotiations are presently underway to secure the services of an internationally recognized  engineering  consulting  firm to provide project management services during the implementation of the  feasibility  study.  Proposals  are  currently under  review  and  management anticipates that selection of the successful firm will be made during September.

<DT>09/12/96<DD>The  company  has  completed  the  acquisition   of   51%   the   US$6   billion
Kambove/Kakanda cobalt/copper deposit in Zaire on August 6 1996. The deposit has reserves of 61 million tonnes at 0.98% copper and 0.19% cobalt, which translates into  1.3  billion pounds of copper and 255 million pounds of cobalt. At current metal prices this values the deposit at over US $6  billion.  Initial  forecasts indicate  that revenues to International Panorama could exceed US$75 million per year over a ten year mine life. The company expects that 25 million shares  will be  issued  on  a  fully  diluted  basis after completion of the acquisition and project financing. A seven to ten year tax holiday is being finalized  with  the government of Zaire. 
<P>                                                           
Several valuation scenarios have been applied  to  the  company's  copper/cobalt asset.
<P>
London based<B>HSBC James Capel Stockbrokers</B> assigned an initial value of  between
US$0.04  -  US$0.06  per  lb  of copper equivalent, which would translate into a current valuation for the company's interest of between US$138 - US$200  million or  US$8.65 - US$12.60 per share. It was indicated that the feasibility study in progress could significantly increase that valuation based on comparable  mining
company property acquisitions.   
<P>                                               
A  preliminary  financial  analysis  indicates  the  project  to  be   extremely successful  at  cobalt  prices  of  US$6.00/lb  or  more  and  to  be relatively insensitive to all other input variables.    The bankable feasibility study is expected to be completed by February 1997 with preliminary  results  due  in  December  1996. Plant construction is expected to commence in May 1996 with the commencement of production fourteen months later.  The company is financing the bankable  feasibility  study  and  working  capital requirements  out  of  current  funds.  Bank debt finance will be negotiated for 50-75% of the total project finance currently estimated to be about $90 million, with a payback of capital within one year. The company is commencing discussions with underwriters to finance the project.   
<P>                                    
The Kambove/Kakanda tailings is a world class deposit which has the potential to transform  International  Panorama into a significant metals producer. Zaire has tremendously rich mineral potential, the political situation is  improving,  and it  is  attracting significant interest from major mining companies. The quality
of the Kambove/Kakanda tailings deposit in terms of  grade,  tonnage,  operating costs  and  profitability  are  excellent.  Technical  risks associated with the project are low given the nature of the deposit and its history.

<DT>08/28/96<DD>The company is providing information on  exploration  completed,  and  currently underway,  on  three claim blocks: Lic No. 1962M, Lic No 1959M and Lic No 1925M, under joint venture with Indocan Resources of Richmond  Hill,  Ontario,  in  the Okak Bay, and Napaktok Bay areas, northern Labrador, Newfoundland, Canada.     
<P> 
A combined EM and magnetic airborne survey over the three areas  has  identified 15  AEM  anomaly  systems. Of those, nine are considered worthy of ground follow up.  Time  domain  EM  surveys are suggested for three high priority targets: one on each claim block. Horizontal loop EM  surveys  (MaxMin)
will be carried out on the remaining six targets.  
<P>
<font size=+1>Claim Block 1962M</font size>
<P>
Airborne results  show  widespread  EM  activity  with  fairly  strong  magnetic responses. Two main EM anomalies (A&B) were identified on this block. Anomaly A, the first of three high priority targets for the three claim groups, is a single moderately-strong  EM  conductor  which  occurs at the south end of an 800m long
magnetic anomaly. The strength of the EM response and magnetic reading indicates the source of this anomaly may be related to pyrrhotite. It is believed that the magnetic anomaly extending from anomaly A to the north emanates  form  the  same source  but  cannot be detected by the AEM system due to its depth. Anomaly B is
an area that also warrants further examination. It records a  magnetic  response of  over  1,000  nano  Teslas  (nTs)  within  a  strike  length of 800m. The AEM anomalies identified in  association  with  the  magnetics  suggest  a  possible sulphide body.    
<P>                                                             
<font size=+1>Claim Block 1959M</font size>
<P>                                                               
Geophysical data indicates that anomaly E on this group,  the  second  of  three high priority areas, is a flat lying target with high conductivity and records a coincident moderate magnetic response of 300 nTs. These properties may  indicate the  presence  of  a  pyrrhotite  rich  zone.  The  ground geophysics, presently
underway, will aid in determining the cause of the conductor and identifying the type of mafic intrusion associated with the anomalies. Six other anomaly systems were also identified on this block and will be followed up with  further  ground work as suggested by Indocan's consultants.  
<P>                                   
Anomaly C, the third of the three high priority targets, is a good  AEM  anomaly sandwiched  between  two  faults  running  west  and north westerly. This is the preferred structural orientation for deposit of Nickel-Copper mineralization  in this  area of Labrador. The AEM anomaly appears to have high conductivity and is
associated with a comparable magnetic anomaly again indicating  the  possibilityof pyrrhotite mineralization.  
<P>                                               
Indocan's consultants are encouraged by the exploration results to date and  are presently  conducting ground geophysics over strong conductive and high magnetic areas to determine the necessary of implementing a diamond drill program on  the three  high  priority  AEM  anomalies.  International  Panorama will continue to
report results as they become available.

<DT>08/16/96<DD>On August 14 1996, directors and employees have been granted options on  346,000
shares at $3.30 expiring August 14 2001.

<DT>08/07/96<DD>Further to the Company news release of August 6 1996, additional information, related  to the acquisition of the Kambove and Kakanda tailings resource, is provided by the company.        
<P>                                                                
The cash payment of US$250,000 to PTM Minerals will be paid  immediately.  Field crews  are  currently  being mobilized to commence a pre-feasibility study which will incorporate a review of existing records and an  independent  valuation  of the  reserves  stated by Gecamines. Following acceptance of the valuation report
and the pre-feasibility study by the company, the  valuation  will  be  used  to determine the total number of shares to be issued for the acquisition of PTM, to a maximum of 11,500,000 shares. At that time, the company will issue 25% of  the shares to PTM.

<DT>08/06/96<DD>The company has secured the rights to a joint venture to  develop  copper/cobalt
tailings  near  the  concentrators at Kambove and Kakanda in the Shaba region of Zaire.
<P>                                                                          
The acquisition has been accomplished through the purchase of all of the  shares of PTM Minerals, a Cayman Islands company which has entered into a joint venture agreement with La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines,  the  state-owned  mining company  of Zaire. The PTM/Gecamines agreement has been formally ratified by the government of Zaire.   
<P>                                                         
Gecamines reports that the tailings at Kambove and Kakanda  contain  61  million tonnes  grading  an  average  of  .19%  cobalt and .98% copper. 
<P>
The company has allocated from its treasury up to US$3 million to  commission  a feasibility  study  to  verify the stated reserves and determine the appropriate recovery techniques. The feasibility study Is expected to be completed by spring of 1997, following which production could commence within two years. The company
will act as operator on the project.   For complete details please see the <a href="../stockTALK/spr807.html"> Acquisition</A> under  special stockTALK Report.

<DT>03/01/96<DD>The company's private placement announced on February 23,  has  
been amended as follows:  The company has secured commitments from Rick Rule of Carlsbad,  
California  (as to  250,000  units)  and other placees, for a private placement of up to 650,000 units 
at $1.16 per unit.  Proceeds of the private placement will  be  used  to  fund  the  investigations, 
demonstrate  project  financing  ability and to provide for working capital. The company is 
continuing its investigation of advanced mineral projects  in  Africa and additional exploration 
properties in Myanmar.

<DT>02/27/96<DD>Report by Brian Fagan in the February Asian World Stock Report
says International Panorama can  expect to attract a lot of attention from the market during 1996.
Part of his assertion is based on the fact that Myanmar (formerly  Burma)  where
the  company's  main project is located is little known at the present time, but
that may all change when Robert  Friedland  takes  Indochina  Goldfields  public
later  this year.  The tract  Panorama  has  now  is  a  1,400 square kilometre concession 
containing a number of widely spread gold occurrences.  Contact the company for complete
details.

<DT>11/06/95<DD>The Company announced that it has commenced a 6 month US$160,000 work program on its Exploration Concession over Block 9 near Thayetkone in central Myanmar (formerly Burma).  A recent field assessment of the gold potential of Block 9 by the Company's geological consultants, Dr. Ian Gray and
Dr. Duncan Large, identified an area 1.5km by 1.5km containing a well developed system of quartz gold
veins and stockworking contained in locally silicified and altered migmatites, peripheral to an intrusive
granite.  Individual veins are up to 1 km long, 1.5m wide with gold grades to 1 ounce/ton and carry
associated chalcopyrite, tourmaline and fluorite.  The deposit has <B>bulk mining potential</B> with ready
access to water, hydropower and rail transportation.  The exploration program will initially focus on
outlining the gold reserve potential of this area.  Block 9 is located on the Shan Fault, a major 2000km
long fault which is closely associated with alluvial and hard rock gold mineralization over a 1,200km
strike length in Myanmar.  Following a gold rush to the southwest part of Block 9 in 1982, extensive
surface work and some shallow drilling by the Myanmar Department of Geological Survey & Mineral
Exploration (DGSE) outlined widespread gold mineralization east of Thayetkone.  Results from this
work established the basis for subsequent small scale selective near-surface mining and production from
an on-site 50 tpd pilot gravity flotation mill.  International Panorama has established a base camp at
Thayetkone and compilation of extensive DGSE geology and assay data is underway.  The initial
program will focus on outlining the gold resource potential at Thayetkhone.

<DT>08/30/95<DD>The Company announced that at their Annual General Meeting held on August 14, 1995 in Vancouver, B.C., the shareholders approved a special resolution increasing the Company's authorized share capital from 25,000,000 to 100,000,000 common shares without par value.  The Company also announced the
granting of incentive stock options to directors and employees of the Company to purchase up to 140,000
shares of the Company for a period of five years, commencing on August 30,1995 at $1.00 per share.
The granting of the said options is subject to acceptance by the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  Options
granted to insiders of the Company are further subject to ratification by the shareholders of the Company
prior to exercise thereof.

<DT>08/28/95<DD>The Company announced that Dr. Ian M. Gray had joined the Board of Directors.  Dr. Gray is a mining geologist from the Royal School of Mines and a Professional Engineer with 37 years experience in the international mining industry.  He has held senior management positions with INCO Ltd. and BP Minerals.  He is also a former President of Fairbanks Gold Ltd., the Company which successfully
demonstrated the Fort Knox gold deposit in Alaska.  More recently, Dr Gray was President of Bolivar
Goldfields Ltd., a TSE-listed company involved in gold exploration in Latin America.  He is also a
current director of several reporting companies.  Dr. Gray's extensive experience will greatly benefit
International Panorama in its continuing efforts to pursue outstanding domestic and international mining
projects.

<DT>08/25/95<DD>The Company announced that it has signed an agreement with the Myanmar Ministry of Mines for the exploration and development rights to Block No. 9, a 1,400 sq. km. gold exploration property in the Pyinmana region of Upper Myanmar (formerly Burma).  Block No. 9 is situated on the Shan Scarp
Fault structure, considered to be the most important structure related to gold mineralization in Myanmar.
The property contains gold that is being mined on a limited scale by Mining Enterprise #2, a division of
the Myanmar Ministry of Mines.  The accord provided International Panorama with an operational base
for additional acquisitions in this mineral-rich nation.  The agreement incorporated the principal terms of
a future 50/50 joint venture between International Panorama and the Ministry of Mines should the
feasibility analysis lead to a production recommendation.
<P>
At a formal signing ceremony held in Yangon, the Minister of Mines, Kyaw Min, stated that the
agreement with International Panorama was consistent with the objective of the Government of Myanmar
to accelerate the development of the country on the basis of a market-oriented economic system.
Considered to be the last frontier for economic development in Southeast Asia, Myanmar has only
recently invited foreign capital and technical expertise to assist in its economic advancement.  Increasing
investment in Myanmar by mainly Singaporean, Thai, British, French and Japanese companies has
stimulated oil and gas exploration, hotels and tourism, fisheries, logging and mining projects.  Foreign
governments and international agencies are moving to establish normal relations.  Myanmar recently took
the first step to gaining membership in ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

<DT>08/01/95<DD>The Company announced the following appointments:
<P>
<B>ADRIAN HARTMANN</B> as Chairman of the Board:- Mr. Hartmann has been a director of the

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> International Panorama Resource Corp. Properties </B></FONT>
<P>
Incorporated in British Columbia in 1980, the Company changed its name from Panorama Resources Ltd. On April 14, 1993 with a share conversion of 1 new share for 5 old shares.
<P>
<B>Voisey Bay, Labrador, Canada</B>
<P>
The Company has a 100 % interest in 2,341 claims that span 150,000 acres, placing the Company among the largest claim owners in the Voisey Bay region.  In the Harp Lake area, 100 km. southwest of the Diamond Fields discovery, the Company owns 1,023 claims that occur in layered gabbro and olivine anorthosites formations.  In Merrifield Bay, 50 km. southeast of the Diamond Fields discovery, the Company owns 998 claims in an area considered an excellent prospect for nickel-cobalt mineralization.  The Company owns a further 220 claims in Okak Bay and 100 claims in Napaktok Bay, 100 km. north of the Diamond Fields discovery.  These claims have elevated nickel-cobalt-copper showings contained in ultramafic dikes.  Great care has been taken in staking and acquiring these properties based on the most promising geologic, geophysical and geochemical formations.  An exploration program is being prepared.
<P>
<B>Mandalay, Union of Myanmar, Southeast Asia</B>
<P>
The Company has acquired 1,400 sq. km. of exploration property in the Union of Myanmar (formerly Burma) that contains high-grade gold mineralization.  This property is situated on the Shan Scarp Fault and is regarded as the most important gold mineralization structure in Myanmar.  Gold has previously been mined from this area by Mining Enterprise #2, a division of Myanmar Ministry of Mines.  Gold mineralization on the property is known to occur in quartz veins in thicknesses up to 1.5 metres and vein systems extend for up to 1,000 metres.  The Company has been granted exclusive exploration and development rights and final government ratification was given on August 11, 1995.  The exploration program has began with the establishment of a base camp at Thayetkone.
<P>
<B>Spanish and Platoro Projects, U.S.A.</B>
<P>
The Company has a 100% interest in The Spanish Mine, a gold property located in the Grass Valley district of Nevada County, Northern California.  Open-pit reserves of heap-leachable ore have been defined at 2.4 million tons at a grade of .053 ounces per ton gold.  The ore deposit is a quartz stockwork and is one of several that have been discovered on the property.  A pre-feasibility study done by Vector Engineering Inc. in 1989 concluded that there are drill indicated gold reserves of 127,000 oz. and potential gold reserves of 300,000 oz.  To date, the Company has spent over US$5,000,000 to acquire and develop the mine.  An extensive drilling program is required to complete the feasibility study.
The Platoro Mine, located in the San Juan Mountains of south-central Colorado, is a gold-silver joint venture between International Panorama (38.61%) and Union Gold Incorporated.  Underground exploration has blocked out 605,200 tons of mineable ore, averaging 0.174 oz. gold per ton and 5.96 oz. silver per ton, as concluded in an American Mine Services feasibility report of 1989.  This is equivalent to 150,000 oz. and potential gold reserves of 1,000,000 oz.  To date, the Company has spent US$5,770,000 to acquire their interest and develop the mine.  The Company retained the right to earn up to 60% property interest through a further expenditure of US$2,500,000.  At $400 gold and $5 silver, payback would occur in the third year of operation.

<P>                                    
IRD further announced that Octagon Capital Canada Corp of Toronto,  Ontario  has exercised  its  right  of  conversion  contained  in  a  special  broker warrant agreement dated February 29 1996.  Accordingly,  IRD  caused  to  be  issued  to Octagon  Capital  Canada  Corp  two  warrants  each allowing the Octagon Capital

The net proceeds were used to redeem all class E preferred shares of the company with the balance used by the company for working capital purposes.

<DT>08/19/96<DD>The board of directors has authorized management to conclude an  arrangement  to
acquire  the  Teleride  Sage  (TSL)  suite of software products, pursuant to the memorandum of understanding announced by IRD on July 11 1996.    
<P>               
TSL is a leading supplier of  integrated  software  solutions  for  the  transit industry.  TSL's  line of software products help fleet managers more efficiently manage their operations. Established in 1977, TSL has systems installed  in  the US  and  Canada,  and  recently in the UK. TSL has an installed base of over 200 systems worldwide with on-going maintenance and service contracts, sales in 1995 of $5 million and a confirmed order backlog exceeding $2.5 million.   
<P>          
The TSL software products will merge easily  with  IRD's  TransView  system  and other  technologies  to  form  a focused business unit within IRD. Over the past year, IRD and TSL have already worked together to  supply  integrated  solutions combining IRD's technologies with TSL software suites.  The combined operations will expand and enhance IRD's  presence  in  the  global transit  and  fleet management markets. 
<P>
The TSL facilities in Toronto and the UK will provide IRD with an established operations  base,  a  significant  existing market presence with confirmed new contracts and the credibility provided by the extensive installed base to pursue the growing opportunities in this market. The transit and fleet management includes automated-real time dispatch and automatic vehicle location systems that use the global positioning system (GPS)  satellite network  and  wireless  communications  technologies.  TSL provides the enhanced software products  and  capabilities  to  complement  IRD's  state  of  the  art TransView technologies.  
<P>                                                    
The combination of TransView and TSL will provide transit  and  fleet  operators the  tools  to  become  more  efficient,  cost-effective  and  competitive.  The acquisition of TSL establishes IRD as a total solutions supplier and accelerates the company's penetration of the global transit and fleet management markets.   
Further, Octagon Capital Canada and  MacDougall,  MacDougall  and  MacTier  have agreed  to  act  as  agents for the private placement of up to 2 million special warrants at $1.40, for up to $2,800,000. The closing is expected to  take  place on September 6 1996 and upon closing the funds will not be held in trust.       
<P>
In the event that IRD does not file and obtain a receipt from the Ontario,  BC  and  Saskatchewan  securities  commissions  for  a  prospectus qualifying  the securities underlying the special warrants on or before December 1 1996, and in the event that IRD does  not  use  its  best  efforts  to  obtain
conditional  approval  for the listing of all its common shares on the TSE on or before February 28 1997, then in that  event,  each  unit  would  be  deemed  to consist of 1.1 common shares and a half warrant.                                
Octagon Capital will continue  to  work  closely  with  IRD  and  its  board  of directors  in  its continuing role as a financial adviser to among other things, assist the company in financing its aggressive growth plans.

<P>                                      
1996 is proving to be an important year for both IRD and  its  key  market,  the Intelligent  Transportation  Systems business. IRD's increased revenues, coupled with the highest order backlog in the firm's history, make  us  optimistic  that this will be a record year for sales and profits.     
<P>                         
The automation of highway  weigh  stations  using  IRD's  weigh-in-motion  scale technologies  and  computer  systems continues to be the major source of revenue growth. New orders totaling $6.7 million were received during  the  period  from customers  in  the  US,  Canada  and  South  America.  In  addition, the company
increased its presence in the toll-road market with its patented  DYNAX  sensorsand  unique axle detectors. Production and engineering capacity was increased in Saskatoon and, in Mississauga, Ontario, additional assembly space  was  acquired to accommodate IRD's contract for the new Highway 407 toll road.                
<P>
While IRD's order book ensures the company will be busy into next year,  we  are confident  the  ITS market is still in the early stages of a large expansion. We have a strong position in the North American ITS market, and  are  developing  a growing presence in South America and Asia.  Please contact the company at

<DL><DT>03/21/96<DD>The company reports the following quarterly results.
For the three months ended February 28 1996 revenues increased substantially due
primarily  to  the transition and maturation of IRD's Intelligent Transportation
System industry. For the last few years, IRD has  been  supplying  products  and
services  to  demonstration  projects  around  the  globe.  These  projects have
established IRD as a leading supplier of advanced ITS technology systems and has
produced  a  growing  international backlog of orders from customers integrating
IRD's  products  into  specialized  traffic  monitoring  and  data   collection,
weight-in-motion and toll road systems.   
<P>                                      
The increase in revenues produced significantly improved profit margins for  the
company.  Gross  margins grew to 32.7% from 27.8% the prior year. Administration
and sales expenses increased 20% to  $669,821  from  $557,235  the  prior  year,
primarily  due  to  an expansion of facilities required by the growth in orders;
however, as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased to 22% from  33%  the
prior year.
<P>                                                                     
Research and development expenses in the first  quarter  increased  to  $197,586
from  $130,030  the  previous  year  as  the  company continued to invest in its
proprietary products, including further development of  the  SmartSonic  vehicle
detection system acquired from AT&T last year.
<P>                                  
The excellent first quarter results produced during what is  historically  IRD's
slowest period indicate the company should deliver record results for the year.
Please contact the company for complete details.

<DT>02/21/96<DD>Octagon Capital Canada Corp of Toronto has  agreed  to act as  
agent  for  the private  placement  of 700,000 special warrants at $0.85 each for gross

Each special warrant is convertible into one  unit  within  twelve  months  from
closing  at no additional cost. Each unit consists of one share and a half share
purchase warrant. Each whole share purchase warrant can be exercised to purchase
one  share  at $1.25 per share. In the event that IRD does not file and obtain a
receipt from the Ontario Securities Commission for a prospectus  qualifying  the
securities  underlying  the  special  warrants  on or before August 20 1996, the
exercise price shall be subject to adjustment.

<DT>02/14/96<DD>The company had a 41% increase in  sales  to  $11,033,000  for  
the  year  ended November 30 1995 compared with $7,834,000 the previous year. 
The increased sales resulting from the awarding of new contracts produced a net profit  of  
$125,000 or  $0.014 per share compared to a loss of $544,000 or a loss of $0.09 per share
in 1994.

The company's improved profits  were  produced  through  the  third  and  fourth
quarters as investments in new technology and demonstration projects were turned
into orders and an improved order backlog.
<P>
A confirmed backlog of orders as at November 30 1995 stands at  a  record  $11
million.
<P>                                                                        
Integration and installation of systems for  the  US$5.5  million  Oregon  Green
Light program continue. The second phase of this contract is expected to proceed
in mid 1996. In January, the company  completed  the  acquisition  of  worldwide
manufacturing  and sales rights to SmartSonic technology from AT&T. This product
will be aggressively marketed to Operation Timesaver, a recently  announced  $10
billion project planned for 75 major US cities.

<DT>01/16/96<DD> As per the acquisition of SmartSonic  technologies  from  AT&T, the company has
completed this acquisition with a combination  of  shares  and  cash,  and  an  agreement  for  a
continuing  business  relationship.  AT&T will represent and sell the SmartSonic product for IRD 
in some off-shore markets and in the defense industry.  On January 10 1995, in Washington,  DC 
at  the  Transportation  Research  Board Conference,  US  Secretary  of Transportation, Federico Pena announced Operation Timesaver. Operation Timesaver is a more than $10 billion project planned for 75
major  US  cities.  As  stated  by  Secretary  Pena, Timesaver will use advanced technologies 
break highway gridlock and cut 15% off the average commute time in the next decade.     

<DT>01/09/96<DD> The Company is pleased to announce the purchase from AT&T of the worldwide
manufacturing and sales rights for the SmartSonic traffic surveillance system has been concluded.  
Based on acoustic-sensing and signal processing technologies originally developed by AT&T for US
defence applications, the SmartSonic traffic surveillance system detects passing automobiles, buses
and trucks by listening for the sounds they make.  The transaction culminates a business relationship
between the two companies which has focused on tailoring the SmartSonic system for vehicle detection
applications.  For the past year thecompany has been a distributor of the system for AT&T.

<P>
With the purchase of the Real Time-Wireless Dispatch System, known as
TransViewTM, from its developer, International Road Dynamics Inc. (IRD)
added new technology to its already diverse traffic management and
monitoring systems.  TransViewTM Software System is an Automatic Vehicle
Location (AVL) and a wireless communications-computer dispatch system.  The
system automatically monitors the location of specially equipped fleet
vehicles via the Global Positioning satellite (GPS) network.  The system
coordinates all dispatching functions and communicates in real-time with its
fleet of vehicles via Radio Frequency or Cellular radios.  The system is a
merged effort utilizing IRD's engineering communications and hardware
technologies and integrating the specialized TransViewTM .  There are many
complementary applications for AVL, automatic real-time dispatch and the
wireless communications and IRD has targeted a number of complementary-niche
markets for theTransViewTM system and forecasts revenues to exceed $3
Million in the first year.
<P>
IRD will design and install up to 17 Automated Truck Weigh Stations and
Downhill Safety Systems throughout the State of Oregon in the First Phase of
the Oregon Department of Transportation "Green Light" Project.  The contract
to IRD is in the amount of US$5.5 Million.  The second phase, with a budget
of US$14 Million, is currently being planned.
<P>
AT & T named IRD as the Canadian distributor of AT & T SmartSonicTM Traffice
Surveillance System.  This system used advanced, aerially mounted acoustic
sensors to detect vehicles from the sounds they make and is designed to
replace magnetic-loop sensors in a variety of highway applications. 
Installing the SmartSonic system is quick, easy and does not result in
damage to highway surfaces because SmartSonics sensors mount overhead on
existing overpasses, traffic signs and lighting structures.  IRD plans to
incorporate SmartSonic acoustic traffic sensor into its traffic, toll-road
and weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems.
<P>
Working together at commercial vehicle weigh stations, IRD's WIM systems and
Perceptics Corporation's LPR (License Plate Reading) System save commercial
vehicle operators time and money and optimize station efficiency by
targeting only those vehicle that are suspected of overweight and/or other
safety violations.  These systems will provide accurate and comprehensive
information about targeted vehicles, reduce highway and operation costs and
improve highway safety.

<DT>10/31/96<DD>Revenues for the three months ended September 30 1996  were  $10.1  million,  an
increase  of  19%,  as compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 1995. Net earnings for the three months ended September 30 1996 were $3.4  million  before taxes  and $2.5 million after taxes as compared to $2.6 million before taxes and $1.4 million after taxes for the same period in 1995. Earnings per share for the
three months ended September 30 1996 were $0.11, an increase of 22%, as compared to $0.09 for the same period in 1995.       
<P>                                    
With the successful opening of the new Hopland Sho-Ka-Wah Casino  in  September, the  company had in excess of 3,100 video gaming terminals in place on a revenue participation basis as at September 30 1996, an increase of over 1,300  machines since December 31 1995.  
<P>                                                       
In the third quarter ended September 30 1996, the company continued its  history of  posting  strong  earnings  growth.  Further positive developments within the company and the California gaming market strengthen the company's commitment  to the  expansion  of  its  existing  markets  and  the  aggressive  pursuit of new
opportunities.     
<P>                                                             
The company is optimistic about the recent direction taken in the negotiation of compact  agreements  between  the  state  of California and the Indian tribes in California. Governor Pete Wilson, of California, has authorized the creation  of a  model compact with the Pala Band of Mission Indians that will likely serve as the basis for future agreements with other tribes.  The  company  is  poised  to develop  further  relationships,  using  its  understanding  and success in this marketplace, by assisting other California tribes interested in pursuing  gaming activities.  <B>For a complete financial earnings report, please call the company at its Vancouver, B.C. offices.                                                                    

<DT>09/19/96<DD>The company would like to register its securities and achieve  reporting  issuer
status in the US, and in this regard, is in the proocess of preparing a form 20-F for filing with the SEC. The company hopes to file the form 20-F  with  the  SEC within  the  next 45 days. Registration in the US would be a prerequisite should the company wish to list on a US exchange.                                      

<DT>09/17/96<DD>The company has signed a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  Tandem  Computers
Canada,  pursuant  to  which  the  company  and  Tandem intend to jointly pursue business opportunities in Canada. Founded  in  1974,  Tandem's  parent  company, Tandem  Computers, designs and delivers high-technology products and services to lottery and gaming organizations worldwide, and to companies in  other  business sectors.  Tandem  Computers  is  headquartered in Cupertino, California, and has offices, strategic partners and providers in more than 50 countries  around  the world.  For  the fiscal year ended September 30 1995, Tandem Computers generated consolidated revenues of US$2.3 billion.   
<P>                                    
To further develop a mutually beneficial relationship between  the  company  and Tandem,  Mr  Andre  J. Desjardins, Tandem's vice-president of lottery sales, has joined the company's new advisory board.

<DT>09/11/96<DD>Governor Pete Wilson of California has agreed to  negotiate  compact  agreements
with  Indian tribes in California to operate gaming facilities. The new decision will begin with the creation of a model compact with the Pala  Band  of  Mission Indians  with  others  to  follow.
<P>
The compacts are expected to cover all aspects of gaming including video  gaming equipment. Further, it is expected that compacts covering video gaming equipment would, to conform with the recent California  supreme  court  decision,  be  for lottery-style  games  where players compete against each other and prize payouts are controlled. There are approximately 106 California Indian tribes of which 30
tribes currently operate casinos.
<P>
Management is encouraged by these developments as the company has, over the last few  years, established its relationships with many of the tribes in California. More importantly, the company has supplied approximately 50% of the 12,000 video machines in the various casinos, either through revenue participation or through direct sales. The company has also sold casino supplies and accessories to  many of  the  tribes  involved  in gaming in California. The company will continue to build further relationships, using its understanding and success in this  market place,  by  assisting  other  tribes in California interested in pursuing gaming activities. International Thunderbird is also continuing to pursue its expansion
into the global gaming markets.

The new  Hopland  Sho-Ka-Wah  casino  successfully  opened  just  prior  to  the September  Labour  Day  long  weekend.  The  casino,  north of San Francisco and operated by the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians, is the most  luxurious  casino  on the  north  coast  of California. The company and its joint venture partner, the
Viejas Band of Mission Indians, have  initially  installed  300  of  500  gaming terminals  on  a revenue participation basis for a term of five years.   Revenues  from  the  initial operations of the gaming terminals have been consistent with the company's experience at other revenue sharing locations.   The Hopland casino is the second turnkey project that the company has completed.

<dt>08/12/96<dd>The  company  has  closed  its  arrangement  with  Eagle Co to manufacture
electro-mechanical  slot  machines  in  Canada.  Eagle  is  a  leading  Japanese manufacturer of gaming technologies and software.    
<P>                           
Under the terms of the agreements, Eagle America has  been  established  by  the principals  of  Eagle,  which  in  turn  has  formed  a new joint company called Thunderbird  Eagle  Gaming.  Thunderbird  Eagle  has  an   issued   capital   of US$1,000,000  with  International Thunderbird owning 75% of the shares and Eagle
America owning the remaining 25%. Both shareholders have funded their respective portions  of  the  issued capital. Thunderbird Eagle will have an exclusive open ended license from Eagle, subject to minimum sales quotas and royalties, to  use Eagle's  technology  to  manufacture and market electro-mechanical slot machines
and change machines in  licensed  territories  which  include  North  and  South America, and the Caribbean Islands.  
<P>                                           
Thunderbird Eagle  has  acquired  the  assets  and  assumed  the  lease  of  the manufacturing  plant  which was previously operated by Thunderbird Manufacturing in Vancouver, BC. The plant is being modified for the commencement of production expected  to be sometime in the fourth quarter. Upon commencement of operations, Thunderbird Eagle will be the only Canadian manufacturer  of  electro-mechanical slot  machines.  Through  Thunderbird  Eagle,  the company will benefit from the research and development carried out by Eagle.      
<P>                            
The  licensing  agreement  with  Eagle  is  a  continuation  of   the   business relationship between the company and Eagle. The company has already successfully marketed Eagle's products, including  change  machines,  to  customers  such  as Caesar's and Circus Circus.

<DT>07/24/96<DD>Revenues for the three months ended June 30 1996 were $10.1 million, an increase
of  94%,  as  compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 1995. Net earnings for the quarter ended 
June 30 1996 were $3.17 million  before  taxes  and  $2.27 million  after  taxes compared to $842,000 before taxes and $459,000 after taxes for the same period in 1995. 
<P>
Earnings per share for the quarter  ended  June  30 1996  were  $0.11, an increase of 120%, as compared to $0.06 for the same period in 1995. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.09 for 1996 as
compared to $0.01 for 1995.
<P>                                                     
For the six months ended June 30 1996, revenues increased 100% from $8.9 million in  1995  to $17.8 million in 1996. Net earnings for the six months increased to $5.6 million before taxes and $3.7 million after taxes in 1996 compared to  $1.5 million  before taxes and $0.9 million after taxes. Basic earnings per share for
the six months ended June 30 1996 were $0.19 compared  to  $0.10  for  the  same period in 1995.
<P>                                                                 
The company continued to show impressive growth  in  its  revenue  participation operations  with  the  number  of  video  gaming  terminals  placed  in  casinos increasing to 2,849 machines as at June 30 1996 which represents an increase  of 1,019  machines  since December 31 1995. 
<P>
In addition, the company will initially be installing 300 gaming terminals by August 31 1996  in  a  new  casino  to  be operated  by the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians based on a joint venture agreement
between  the  company  and  the  Viejas  Band  of  Mission  Indians  of  Alpine, California.  This  will  bring  the  total  number  of  terminals  under revenue participation to greater  than  3,100.  The  agreement  with  the  Hopland  Band requires  a  total  of  500  video  gaming  terminals  to be placed on a revenue participation basis.
 
<DT>07/10/96<DD>The company and their legal advisors have now  completed  their  review  of  the
decision  of the Supreme Court of California, released June 24 1996, in the case of Western Telcon, Inc et al versus the California State  Lottery.  The  company has  concluded  that  the  impact  of  the  decision on their operations will be minimal, if any, and will not materially affect their operating results.   
<P>     
The company has now developed the  software  modifications  required  to  change their  video  gaming  terminals  to  a  lottery  format,  in accordance with the requirements of the Western  Telcon  decision,  should  those  modifications  be required  by  California state officials. These modifications can be implemented
quickly and inexpensively, if required, without affecting revenues generated  by the video gaming terminals.      
<P>                                              
** Separately, the company has completed their turnkey casino project for the  TuleRiver  Tribe in California. The casino is now in operation with 200 video gaming terminals in place. The number will be  increased  to  1,000  terminals  as  the facility expands and video gaming terminals become available.  In addition, the company is proceeding with their joint venture for  500  gaming terminals  in revenue participation at a new casino in California to be operated by the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians. The joint venture is  between  the  company and  the  Veijas  Band  of  Mission  Indians  of Alpine, California, a federally recognized Indian tribe, which has decided  to  pursue  economic  activities  on other  Indian lands. The facility is expected to open, with 300 gaming terminals initially, by the end of August 1996.

<DT>06/25/96<DD>The company reports that, in a  decision  released  yesterday  in  the  case  of
Western Telcon, Inc. et al v. the California State Lottery, the Supreme Court of California held that the state of California's Keno lottery violates the state's own lottery regulations.  
<P>                                                      
The Western Telcon case has been followed closely by the Native American  casino industry  because  of similarities between the state's own Keno lottery machines and the video gaming terminals commonly used  in  California's  Native  American casinos.  In  the  opinion of the company's legal counsel in the US, the court's
decision suggests that the Native American casinos in California will be able to continue   to   use   video   gaming   terminals  with  appropriate  programming modifications. It is expected that existing video gaming terminals will continue to operate as these modifications are made.

<DT>06/20/96<DD>The company reports first quarter results.
<P>
The first quarter ended March 31 1996 demonstrated another quarter of  continued growth and new developments for the company. In January 1996 the company entered into its first turnkey casino development project by signing an  agreement  with the  Tule  River  tribe,  a  federally recognized Indian tribe in Tulare County, California to finance and build a state of the art  turnkey  casino.  Under  the terms  of the agreement, the company will sell all the necessary casino supplies to  the  casino  and  provide  up  to  1,000  gaming  terminals  on  a   revenue participation  basis for a period of five years. The company expects to generate
a cash flow in excess of $68 million from this casino over the five year term of the  agreement  after  allowing  for the repayment by the casino of all advances made by Thunderbird to construct the casino.   
<P>                                 
In February 1996, the company's shares commenced trading as an exempt company on the  Toronto Stock Exchange. The company also entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Eagle Co Ltd, a leading Japanese developer  of  gaming software,  video gaming terminals and electromechanical slot machines. Under the terms of the joint venture, a new company, Thunderbird  Eagle  Gaming  Inc,  has been  formed  to  manufacture  and  market  a new line of electromechanical slot machines. These new electromechanical slot machines,  together  with  the  video gaming  terminals already being manufactured by the company, will be marketed in North and South America as well as other internationally licensed markets.     
<P> 
For the three months ended March 31 1996, revenues were $7.7  million,  compared to  $3.7  million for the same quarter in 1995. Net earnings before income taxes were $2.46 million, compared to $665,000 for  the  same  quarter  in  1995.  Net earnings  after  income  taxes  were $1.47 million, compared to $475,000 for the
same quarter in 1995. Earnings per share  after  income  taxes  were  $0.08,  an increase of 60%, compared to $0.05 per share for the same quarter in 1995. Revenues and earnings in the first quarter continued to grow  at  an  impressive rate.  Earnings  per share were lower than originally projected due primarily to
the dilution effect of the shares issued by the company for an equity  financing during the fourth quarter of 1995 and the issuance of shares upon the conversion of debentures.              
 <P>                                                   
The company's casino operations division had over 1,800 gaming  terminals  under revenue  participation  as  at  March 31 1996. The continually growing cash flow from these gaming terminals has  now  reached  approximately  $1.8  million  per month.  In May 1996 the company announced that under a new three year agreement, the company  is  placing  an  additional  800  gaming  terminals  on  a  revenue participation  basis  at  an existing location and 250 gaming terminals at a new location. As a result, the total number of gaming terminals in operation by  May 31  1996  under  revenue  participation  will  grow  to  over 2,850. The company currently has contracts to add another 1,500 gaming terminals over the next  six months   and   is   negotiating  to  place  more  gaming  terminals  on  revenue participation  at  several  new  locations.  Under  the  revenue   participation agreements,  the  company  continues to own the gaming terminals while receiving
between 14% to 25% of the net revenues generated by the gaming terminals.
<P>
In an effort to capitalize on a new and untapped market, the company has entered into  a  joint  venture  agreement  with  IGC  Internet  Gaming  Corp  and Axion Communications to develop an on-line Internet casino. Under  the  terms  of  the joint  venture,  the  company  and  Axion will each have the right to earn a 20% interest in the Internet  casino  by  providing  necessary  expertise  and  some startup capital. IGC will be the operator of the Internet casino and will retain a 60% interest in the Internet casino. This joint venture will allow the company to  become  involved  in what could potentially be a very explosive market while
still keeping complete focus on its core business.

<DT>06/13/96<DD>The company has signed a new joint venture agreement to install up to 500 gaming
terminals  on  revenue participation at a new casino in California, north of San Francisco. The casino is to be operated by the Hopland Band of Pomo  Indians,  a federally  recognized  Indian  tribe.  The  term of the agreement is five years.
<P>
Based on the company's past experience, the joint venture  expects  to  generate revenues of in excess of US$22 million over the tenure of the agreement.        
<P>
The joint venture is between the company and the Viejas Band of Mission Indians, Alpine,  California,  a  federally recognized Indian tribe, which has decided to pursue economic activities on other Indian lands. 
This is  the  first  agreement for  the  company  in  partnership  with  a  major  tribe  to  develop  a gaming
opportunity together. 
<P>
The terms of the agreement call for the financing of up to US$1.125  million  for  a temporary casino by the joint venture partners and theinstallation of an initial 250 gaming terminals. A  permanent  facility,  to  be
constructed in the near future, will house an additional 260 gaming terminals.  Viejas will loan US$1.125 million to the joint  venture  and  the  company  will provide the first 250 machines. The amount of loan will be repaid by the Hopland Tribe to the joint venture at the rate of 5% of the net win per month  from  the
gaming  machines. The company will receive 50% of the loan repayment received by the joint venture towards the cost of 125 machines at the rate of  US$4,500  per machine.  All proceeds from the joint venture's portion of the operations of the gaming terminals will be split as to 50% each by Viejas and  the  company.  With
the  company's  250 machines from this joint venture, the revenue share division will have in excess of 3,000 gaming terminals in operation.

<DT>05/10/96<DD>The company is pleased to announce that  a  further  800  gaming  terminals  
are presently  being  installed,  under  a  new  three  year  revenue  participation agreement dated 
May 7 1996 at an existing casino in California. The company  has 514   gaming  terminals  at  this  
casino  under  a  previously  signed  revenue participation agreement. The casino, operated by a company owned by a  federally recognized  Indian  tribe, is south of Los Angeles and caters to a population of
over ten million people within a one hour driving distance from the  casino.  At present,  the  company 
receives $675,000 per month from the 514 gaming terminals at this casino. Management expects the
new  800  gaming  terminals  to  generate revenues  of  $700,000  per  month  during  the  next few 
months while the final touches to the casino expansion are  being  completed  and  increasing  to  over
$900,000  per  month upon total completion of the expansion. This will result in total revenues of 
over $1.5 million per month from this casino alone.

On January 19 1996, the company had announced  an  agreement  with  a  federally recognized  Indian 
tribe to set up a turn-key permanent casino to be located 120 miles north of Los Angeles metropolitan 
area. The company and the tribe now have agreed  to  set  up an initial temporary casino to house 
250 gaming terminals to generate revenues until July  1  1996,  the  expected  completion  date  of  the
permanent  facility.  In  the  permanent  casino,  the  company  will install an additional 250 gaming 
terminals with the total number of terminals increasing to 1,000  by  December  31 1996. The company expects to generate $250,000 per month from the temporary facility.                                                    
<P>
After the installations of the 800 and 250  terminals,  the  company  will  have approximately 2,900 
gaming terminals under revenue participation by May 31 1996. By July 1 1996, the beginning of the 
third quarter, the number of  terminals  on revenue participation will be in excess of 3,100.

<DT>05/09/96<DD>For the first quarter ended March  31  1996,  revenues  were  $7.7  million,  an
increase  of  107%,  as  compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended March 31 1995. Net earnings 
for the quarter ended March 31 1996 were $2.46 million before taxes  and  $1.47  million  after  taxes  compared  to $665,000 before taxes and $475,000 after taxes for the same period in 1995.                               
<P>
Earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31 1996 were $0.08 per share,  an increase of 60%, as compared to $0.05 per share for the same period in 1995. Revenues and earnings for the quarter 
continued to grow at an  impressive  rate. Earnings  per  share  were  lower than originally projected due primarily to the dilutive effect of the company's equity financings during the  last  quarter  of
1995  and  the issuance of shares on the conversion of debentures. 1996 revenues and earnings are 
projected to exceed $55 million and $12 million  for  the  year.  For complete details on the companies 
first quarter financial results please call the company in its Vancouver office.

<DT>04/25/96<DD>Further to the company news release of March 28 1996, Axion Communications  
has  reached agreement  with  International Thunderbird Gaming and Cenco Petroleum to develop
and operate a virtual on-line Internet  casino.  The  Internet  casino  will  be established  through  a new company owned jointly by Cenco (as to 60%) and Axion and Thunderbird (as to 20% each). The 
joint venture will be  operated  by  Cenco with  both  Axion and Thunderbird contributing startup 
capital and technological expertise.
<P>                            
In a recent research report released by  Smith  Barney,  it  is  estimated  that legalized  on-line  betting  
could be a $10 billion a year industry within three years. With the Internet expanding at an exponential 
rate, a growing  number  of users  will  be able to gamble on-line in their own home. There are currently in
excess of 40 million people on-line  using  the  Internet  today.  In  a  recent Financial  Post  article, the number of Internet users is projected to reach 100 million by 1998.                                                                
<P>
Cenco has called a shareholders meeting to approve a name change to IGC Internet Gaming  Corporation, 
to approve a share split of its capital on a 3:2 basis, and to approve a private placement of $5.25 million through  the  issuance  of  1.75 million  post-split  shares.  Cenco  has  received the proceeds from the 
private placement and is in the process of making necessary filings  with  the  relevant regulatory authorities.

<DT>04/24/96<DD>Effective at the opening, April 25 1996, the series A share purchase warrants of
the  company  will  trade  for  cash. The warrants expire April 30 1996 and will therefore be delisted at the 
close of business April 30 1996.

<DT>04/18/96<DD>The company, following on its  strong  financial  results  for  the  year  
ended December 31, 1995 is continuing its growth into the new fiscal year. The company
has experienced its strongest first quarter in its history with results expected to be released within 
the next few weeks.                                       
<P>
At the recent International Gaming Business Expo show in Las Vegas, the company, in  association  
with  the  Japanese  company,  Eagle Co Ltd, presented some new electro-mechanical gaming machines. 
These new machines were well  received  with 50  electro-mechanical machines ($486,000) sold in a new market for the company.
<P>
Other recent sales include 105 m achines ($880,000) in  the  US.  The  company's accessories  and  
supplies  division  also  recently sold six change machines to Caesars, in Atlantic City. The relationship 
with Caesars is a continuation  from the previously fulfilled orders received from Caesars in August 1995.
The company has made good progress in its expansion into  international  markets with an initial sale 
of ten machines in Turkey in April 1996. Representatives of the company were also recently in  Australia  
and  in  New  Zealand,  where  the company's  products  were  well  received.  Arrangements with representatives to oversee those and the Southeast Asia expanding markets are being made.          
<P>
Representatives of Eagle are expected to be in Vancouver at the end of the month to  finalize  and 
execute the agreement whereby Eagle and the company, through a new  joint   company,   
Thunderbird   Eagle   Gaming   Inc,   will   manufacture electro-mechanical  slot machines in 
Vancouver to be marketed in North and South America and the Caribbean Islands. This venture 
is more completely described  in the Ccmpany's press release of February 28 1996.  Further to news 
of January 22 1996, the Tule River casino project  is proceeding  as  planned  and  on schedule where 
the company will be supplying an initial 400 gaming terminals on revenue participation in  addition  to  
all  the other  casino  supplies and accessories for the casino. 

<DT>04/01/96<DD>The company reviews the impact of the US Supreme Court decision, 
Seminole  Tribe of Florida vs. State of Florida.                                                
<P>
On March 27 1996, the US Supreme Court issued its opinion in Seminole  Tribe  of Florida v. Florida. 
The rendering of this decision has created uncertainty as to the impact of the decision as it pertains 
to casinos on native lands.  In  order to  fully  understand  the  impact and to update the company's shareholders, the company reviewed the decision with its legal counsel  and  a complete
summary of the interpretation of the decision by the company's legal counsel is available from the
company.
<P>   
Due to the court's decision many legal  scholars  feel  that  the  court's  opinion  leaves  many  questions
unanswered.  The  ultimate  outcome  of  the  Seminole decision on Indian gaming remains  to  be  seen.  However,  it  is  clear  that  IGRA  withstood   overall constitutional  attack.  The  Supreme  Court merely severed that portion of IGRA which forces a state into federal court. Consequently, IGRA continues 
to control indian gaming.                                                                  
<P>                                                         
In summary, the Seminole decision potentially gives tribes much more latitude in dealing  with  states  
who  refuse  to  negotiate compacts. The state may either submit to the jurisdiction of the federal 
courts and mediate a compact,  or  the state  may  refuse  to submit to federal jurisdiction and allow 
the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe the conditions for class III gaming within the  state.
Consequently,  the  company's  management  believes  that  the  decision is very favorable for the 
business activities of the company.

<DT>03/27/96<DD>International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation wishes  to  announce  that  it  has 
entered  into  discussions  with  two related companies, Cenco Petroleum Ltd and Axion 
Communications Inc, with the view of entering  into  a  joint  venture  to develop a new virtual on-line Internet gaming project.  Cenco proposes to change its name to IGC  Internet  Gaming  Corporation  and  to develop  
a  virtual  on-line  Internet  gaming  business  which will effectively constitute operation of an on-line casino.   In addition to  its  expertise  in  the Internet and related fields, Axion will also provide some startup capital for its interest in the  joint  venture.  Thunderbird  will similarly  participate  in this venture by contributing 
some startup capital, as well as the necessary gaming  related  software  technologies  to  IGC  for  its
interest.  Thunderbird,  through its research and development division, develops and markets an array of different proprietary gaming related software products.

The casino, which is operating out of  temporary  facilities  housing  over  600
gaming terminals, is expected to move to its new permanent facility in 1997. The
new permanent facility will be managed by Harrah's Entertainment and is expected
to house approximately 3,000 gaming terminals.  In North and South Carolina total 
demand for gaming terminals is expected to  be in excess of $100 million over the next two years.

<DT>02/27/96<DD>International Thunderbird has finalized negotiations by entering into 
agreements with  Eagle, a leading Japanese manufacturer of gaming technologies and software
including pachinko, video gaming  terminals,  electromechanical  slot  machines, change  machines

edition that the Company's stock has soared 190 percent since June 1994.
Reporter Gary Lamphier said that the rise reflected growth in its
revenue and earnings.  In the nine months ended September 30, 1995,
International Thunderbird earned $2..3 million or 19 cents a share.  The
company's earnings were driven by a revenue-sharing scheme it developed
as a way to market its gaming equipment to undercapitalized casinos run
by US native groups.  The Company has about 1,500 video gaming machines
in use and that number will double by the end of January 1996, based on
contracts in hand.

<DT>11/13/95<DD>The Company reported that its revenues for the third
quarter ended September 30, 1995 were $8.5 million as compared to $1.2
million for the third quarter of the previous year.  Net earnings for
the third quarter before taxes were $2.66 million and after taxes were
$1.4 million compared to a net loss of $0.1 million for the same period
in 1994.  Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.09 per share.
During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the Company added 480 slot
machines on revenue participation, bringing the total machines on
revenue participation to 1,180 machines as at September 30, 1995.  The
Company has since placed an additional 356 slot machines on revenue
participation bringing the machines on revenue participation to over
1,500 as of November 13, 1995.  These machines are expected to provided
the Company with a monthly revenue stream of over $1.5 million effective
November 1, 1995.  As previously announced, the Company is in the
process of adding another 420 slot machines at the Pechanga Casino in
the greater Los Angeles area which will bring the slot machines under
revenue participation to over 1,900.
<P>
The Company also expects significant growth during the fourth quarter in
its direct sales of slot machines as it is in the process of finalizing
sales orders for over 1,000 slot machines over the next two weeks which
will generate revenues of over $8 million.  The Company will announce
further details upon receipt of deposits for these sales.  The Company
has entered into an Agreement, effective November 3, 1995, with a new
casino in the Western United States to provide up to 1, 000 slot
machines under revenue participation over the next 90 days and has
advanced US$25,000 as a loan to this casino. A Full Statement of
Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1995 is available from
the company.

<DT>10/26/95<DD>The Company has added a further 356 gaming terminals to
the existing 224 gaming terminals previously placed on a revenue
participation basis at the Pechanga Casino, located in the greater Los
Angeles area, California.  The Pechanga Casino is operated by the
Pechanga Development Corp., a Company owned by the Pechanga Band of
Mission Indians, a federally recognized Indian Tribe. Further, the
Company under its exclusive arrangement with the casino will be adding a
further 420 gaming terminals, increasing the number of gaming terminals
under revenue participation to 1,000 by the end of December 1995.  The
Pechanga Casino is located south of Los Angeles and caters to a
population of over ten million people within a one hour driving distance
from the casino.  Based on the current revenues from the previously
installed 224 gaming terminals, the Company expects to receive, under
its revenue participation percentage, net revenues of over US$650,000
per month based on 580 gaming terminals currently in operation at this
casino.  This revenue is expected to increase US$1,200,000 per month
(US$14,400,000 per year) at this casino upon the installation of the
additional 420 gaming terminals by the end of December 1995.  The
addition of the 356 gaming terminals brings the total of gaming
terminals currently under the company's revenue participation division
to over 1,500 gaming terminals.  This number will increase to over 1,900
gaming terminals by the end of December 1995 upon delivery of the
remaining 420 gaming terminals to the Pechango Casino.

<DT>09/12/95<DD>The Company has entered into an agreement with a native
Indian tribe to build a casino near San Francisco, California.  The

Founded in 1992, International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation has worked
to develop a diversified approach.  The Company has emerged as a leader
in the manufacture, sales and marketing of gaming terminals in North
America.  It is on the threshold of expanding its operations into the
world market.  The company has successfully negotiated with a major Japanese-based Company to
formulate a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing and selling a
new line of mechanical slot machines for the worldwide market.
<P>
The Company's sales of gaming equipment and accessories continue to
grow.  The Company has a total of 3,100 gaming terminals on revenue
participation.  These machines are expected to provide the Company with
a monthly revenue stream of over $2.3 million in the third quarter of 1996.
<P>
Additional revenues are created through the sale of gaming industry
products, management, training, support services, and where viable, the
building of turnkey casino developments.
<P>
The Company carries out its business through four wholly-owned
subsidiaries:
<P>
<B>Thunderbird Gaming Inc.</B><BR>
On April 30, 1994, International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation acquired
51% of Thunderbird Gaming Inc. ("TGI"), then a Saskatchewan
corporation.  The purchase of the remaining 49% was completed in
August, 1995.  TGI constitutes the sales and marketing arm of the
Company's organization.  Originally, TGI would purchase gaming
terminals from manufacturers at wholesale prices and market them under
its own brand at retail prices.  TGI has developed a number of contacts
in the Native American community resulting in its securing revenue
participation arrangements with seven Native American operated casinos.
TGI has also developed a line of casino gaming products and accessories
for sale.
<P>
<B>Thunderbird Manufacturing Inc.</B><BR>
Thunderbird Manufacturing Inc. ("TMI") was formed in 1994 as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to assemble button control and
touch screen gaming terminals for sale to TGI or third parties.  The
Company is exploring the manufacturing and selling of a new line of
mechanical slot machines from this facility through a joint venture with
a major Japanese corporation.  Recently, TMI moved into a new 16,300
square foot manufacturing plant in Vancouver, B.C. with adequate space
to provide for TGI's Vancouver based employees.  The TGI employees are
expected to move into the new office once remodelling of the plant is
complete.
<P>
<B>Thunderbird Gaming (North Carolina), Inc.</B><BR>
The Company acquired 51% of PARS Electronics, Inc. ("PARS") a North
Carolina corporation on December 31, 1994.  The purchase of the
remaining 49% interest was completed in July of 1995.  PARS manufactures
and distributes a series of touch screen and button control gaming
terminals to TGI and outside markets.  PARS was formed in 1989 in North
Carolina for the business of manufacturing and developing gaming
products.  PARS is a proprietary manufacturer of gaming terminals.  It
operates a 14,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Charlotte,
North Carolina and employs 16 full time employees.  Since its inception,
PARS has developed approximately 40 games currently used in the gaming
industry.  The games produced by PARS have received  certification from
Gaming Laboratories International of New Jersey, the only independent
testing laboratory of gaming software in the U.S. and from the U.S.
Federal Communications Commissions.
<P>
PARS has the capacity to manufacture both button control and
touch-screen gaming terminals.  The touch-screen gaming terminals are a
multi-game terminal offering up to 16 different games to the player.
Further, PARS has developed its own progressive jackpot display to be
incorporated with their gaming terminals.  PARS facility can produce 200
gaming terminals per month.  The on-site engineering team creates new
product lines as well as improve existing products.  The gaming boards
are developed and tested on-site and then sent off for mass production
by a third party.  Upon return of the boards, the gaming terminals are
manufactured in assembly line fashion from start to finish.  Recently PARS 
Electronics Inc subsequently changed its name to Thunderbird Gaming (North Carolina) Inc .
<P>
<B>Thunderbird Gaming (Colorada), Inc</B><BR>
On December 31, 1994, the Company acquired 51% of RamStar Incorporated,
a Colorado corporation.  The remaing 41% interest was acquired in August
1995.  RamStar was purchased to complement PARS' line of touch screen
gaming terminals with a line of button control gaming terminals.
RamStar was formed as a corporation in 1993 in Colorado.  Prior to 1994,
it operated as a limited partnership.  RamStar's operations originally
consisted of the assembly and sale of button control gaming terminals
predominantly to the amusement industry.  Sales to the gaming industry
commenced in 1993.
<P>
Through its own successful efforts and the acquisition of subsidiaries,
International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation has become a one-stop
supplier to the gaming industry.  Gaming is the fastest growing sector
of the U.S. entertainment industry.  As governments in Canada, the
United States and overseas seek additional sources of revenues, the
liberalization of gaming laws is accelerating.  The Company is a full
service design and manufacturing corporation that is poised to enjoy
impressive growth in the foreseeable future. .  Recently Ramstar Incorporated
subsequently changed its name to Thunderbird Gaming (Colorado) Inc

<DT>11/04/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an agreement dated September 1 1996 whereby  ITL
Capital  Corp  and Riley Resources Ltd have been granted an option to earn a 50% interest (25% each) in  the  Kalimantan  claims  in  Indonesia for  payment  of US$50,000  to  obtain a preliminary geological report, C$125,000 upon the vendor concluding a formal contract of work with the government of Indonesia,  issuance
of  100,000  shares  by each of ITL Capital and Riley, and incurring exploration
expenditures totalling $300,000 by July 3 1997. 

<DT>11/04/96<DD>Mr Christian Brule has been appointed to the company's board of directors.

<DT>10/28/96<DD>ITL Capital has been  informed  by  Heath  and  Sherwood Drilling that mobilization problems have resulted in a delay in the collaring of the joint venture's first drill hole on the Durham-McEwen claim block  near  the community of Red Lake, Ontario.  The drill program is now scheduled to begin within the week. 

<DT>10/17/96<DD>The company has awarded a drill contract to Heath and Sherwood Drilling  Ltd  of
Kirkland  Lake,  Ontario for a minimum 4,000 ft deep vertical diamond drill hole on its Durham-McEwen claim block near Red Lake, Ontario. Drilling will  commence on or before October 20 1996 and is expected to continue into the new year.     
<P>
The drill program is designed to test for strike extensions to the  gold-bearing horizons  in  the Arthur White mine, which is expanding production to 150,000 oz gold per year, and the Campbell Red Lake (320,000 oz gold  per  year),  both  of which lie within a three kilometre strike length of the Durham-McEwen property. 
<P>
Historically, the Red Lake camp has been the highest  gold-producing  region  in Canada  and  recent  discoveries  at  depth in the Arthur White mine suggest the reserve potential of the camp has yet to be fully realized.                     

<DT>10/09/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an agreement dated  September  17  1996  whereby
Rupert  Resources  Ltd  has  granted  an  option to the company to acquire a 50% undivided interest in the Durham-McEwen claim block consisting of 16 continguous mineral  claims in the Balmer Township, District of Kenora, Ontario.

<DT>09/24/96<DD>The Company reports that it has completed  its initial reconnaissance exploration of the South Kelian prospect on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia. The prospect comprises of 16,830 ha  50km  south  of  the Kelian  mine  (which  has  reported  annual  production of 450,000 oz gold). The exploration program consisted of both regional and detailed  geological  mapping and geochemical sampling.   
<P>                                                    
Geochemical assay results of the samples indicate anomalous gold  mineralization is  present  in  several  parts  of the property. Anomalous stream sediment gold occurrences near the northern and southern borders of  the  COW  block  indicate sulphide   mineralization  may  be  present  in  the  project  area.  The  field
exploration also resulted in the discovery of iron  oxide  and  manganese  oxide veins in argillically altered and weathered sedimentary rocks.   
<P>              
The anomalous gold assays and hydrothermal veining  in  rocks  similar  to  that which  host  the Kelian deposit to the north are very encouraging. A multi-phase exploration program recommended by independent geological consultants consisting of  further  stream  sediment  sampling,  an airborne magnetometer survey, power auger soil sampling and an extensive trenching program will commence immediately
to identify locations for a followup diamond drilling program.    
<P>              
Corsair is the operator of the property and ITl and Riley have the right to earn a   combined   50%  interest  in  the  property  through  financing  of  further exploration.

<DT>09/19/96<DD>The company has been granted  an  option  to  acquire  a  50%  interest  in  the
Durham-McEwen claim block, held by Rupert Resources in the Red Lake gold camp of northwestern Ontario.                                                           
The 625 acre Durham-McEwen claim block is bounded  to  the  west  by  Goldcorp's Arthur  White  mine which lies adjacent to Placer Dome's Campbell Red Lake mine.
<P>
Recent discoveries at depth by Placer  Dome  and  Goldcorp  on  their  Red  Lake production properties have revived one of Canada's oldest and most prolific gold camp. Goldcorp's recent high grade 1.9 million ounce discovery lies one mile  to the west of ITL and Rupert's Durham-McEwen claim block.      
<P>                   
ITL, as operator, will commence drilling on  the  joint-venture's  Durham-McEwen claim block to test for the possible extension at depth of the Arthur White mine ore horizon.

<DT>08/27/96<DD>Eri Ventures has entered  into  an  agreement  whereby  ITL  Capital  and  Riley
Resources  may  each  acquire  a  25%  interest  in ERI's interest in the 36,400 hectares KP 96MEP135 property in which ERI holds an option to  acquire  from  PT Iroda  Mitra  Corp  it  70%  interest  in  the property. 
The KP is in West Java Indonesia, and is presently held 70% by Iroda and 30% by Pt Aneka Tambang.
<P>      
ITL and Riley may each acquire their 25% interest by making a deposit payment of US$136,522 (as to US$68,261 each) and issuing 100,000 common shares each to ERI.
<P>
The KP 96MEP135 property is adjacent to ERI's KP 866, where ERI is developing  a geological  resource  of  approximately  8.0 million tonnes with an extensive 52 hole drill program  under  the  direction  of  Kilborn  Engineering  as  project managers. Drill results are expected to be received starting October 1996.

negotiations with a group of companies regarding a potential joint venture
of ITL Capital and Riley Resources' 101,492 acre claim block located in Lac
de Gras diamond exploration region in the Northwest Territories, Canada. 
The joint venture candidates have a strong interest in diamond exploration
in the "Corridor of Hope" which contains the major diamond discovery of Dia
Met Minerals Ltd., and most recently of Mountain Province Mining Inc.  ITL
Capital and Riley Resources have spent approximately $1,200.000 on
exploration programs which include airborne geophysics, ground geophysics
and geochemistry.  In the event a "suitable joint venture agreement" is not
achieved in the near term, ITL/Riley have adequate capital to commence their
own drill program.

<P>
ITL Capital Corporation and Riley Resources Ltd., granted  Ming Financial
Corporation an option to acquire 50% interest in their mineral property
known as the CJ Claim Group located in the Lac de Gras area of the Mackenzie
Mining District in the Northwest Territories, Canada.  Under the terms of
this option agreement, Ming Financial will have the right to acquire a 50%
interest in the Property by incurring $4,000,000 of exploration expenditures
over the next three year period and delivering a feasibility study by June
30, 1998.  Ming Financial must also deliver, as to 50% each, a total of
250,000 free trading common shares of Ming, to ITL Capital and Riley
Resources.  Canamera Geological Ltd. will continue to act as operator and
will commence drilling on or about October 1, 1995.
<P>
The CJ Claim Group consists of 101,492 acres and are located approximately
40 kilometers northeast of Mountain Province Mining Inc.'s diamond discovery
and adjacent to Mountain Province's CJ project.  During 1993 and 1994, ITL
Capital and Riley Resources spent approximately $1,200,000 on airborne
geophysics, ground geophysics and geochemistry that identified the existence
of 25 potentially diamondiferous Kimberlitic drill targets.  Refined
geophysics and geochemistry on the CJ Claim Group has identified a strong
presence of indicator minerals and the accompaniment of numerous magnetic
highs and lows.  This exploration has helped to further define the targets
which will be drilled this fall.  The primary targets located on the CJ
Group can be reached by drilling from land or, in certain cases, more
preferably from water locations.  Therefore, initial drilling will involve
those targets which more practically require land setup, and drilling on the
water-based targets will commence thereafter upon freezeup and the
establishment of an ice station, projected to occur in mid-November of 1995.

<B>CJ Claim Group, Northwest Territories</B>
<P>
The Company entered into an option agreement on September 8,1992 to acquire
100% interest in Lac de Charloit diamong prospect, 41 claim units, 100,000
acres, 335 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife in the Lac de Gras area of
the Mckenzie Mining District in the Northwest Territories, Canada.  On
January 9, 1993, the Company entered into an option agreement, amended
February 1, 1994, with Riley Resources Ltd.  Under the terms of the amended
agreement, Riley Resources has the option to acquire 50% of the 100%
interest in the mineral property.  In consideration, Riley Resources paid
$150,000 to the Company and is to spend $375,000 of exploration expenditures
on the property.  In addition, both companies agreed that at the completion
of the $1,000,000 of exploration expenditures, the party incurring the
lesser amount shall pay to the other such sum as would be required to
equalize the amount incurred by both parties. Both companies will share
equally in future cash payments required under the underlying option
agreement.
<P>
The Company has paid $65,000 to the owner of the property, paid $25,000 in
1993 and 1994, and is obligated to make additional property payments of
$25,000 on December 31 of each year until the option is exercised, issue up
to 200,000 shares, in blocks of 50,000 shares each over time as exploration
work progresses and incur $1,000,000 of exploration expenditures on the
property by July 15, 1995. Subsequent to May 31, 1995, this option was fully
exercised.  The owner of the property has retained a 3% gross overriding
royalty, and also has the right to back-in for a 25% interest within two
years of the exercise of the option by incurring the lesser of $1,000.000 of
exploration expenditures on the property or such amount as is necessary to
put the property into commercial production.

<DT>11/04/96<DD>the  company  has  received  regulatory approval of its option agreement on the Mt Shea mineral property in northern BC, which agreement has been amended so as to reduce the net smelter  royalty  being retained by the property owners from 4% to 2%.   
<P>                               
Upon receipt of regulatory approval, 50,000 shares of the company were issued to the property owners subject to a hold period expiring on October 31 1997. The company has also granted to the property owners a 2% net smelter  return  on the  Mt Shea 2 mineral claim, which the company has recently staked and which is
contiguous to the Mt Shea mineral property.

<DT>10/28/96<DD>The company has entered into an option agreement with Michael Gerg  of  Burnaby,
BC,  to  acquire a 100% undivided legal and beneficial interest, subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty to Gerg, in five mineral claims in  the  Trail  Creek mining  division  of  BC.  The property lies south of the City of Trail with the Columbia River on the east and the US border to the south. 
<P>                     
The company plans to begin, upon receipt of a reclamation permit, an exploration program  which  includes  sampling  and  diamond  drilling.  Proceeds  from  the previously announced brokered private placement of flow through shares  will  be applied  towards  this  exploration  program insofar as such funds have not been
used for exploration on the Mt. Shea property in northern BC.

<DT>10/22/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an agreement dated  June  14  1996  whereby  the
company can acquire from John Schussler and Ernst Karl Hatzl, a 100% interest in the Mt Shea claim comprising of 20 units in the Liard  mining  division  of  BC.

<DT>10/10/96<DD> The Company reports further to its news release of, September 19, regarding the private placement  of up to 1,000,000 units at $0.24, the deadline for VSE filing has been extended to
November 8 1996.

<DT>09/18/96<DD>Further to the company news release of July 29 1996, regarding  the  private
placement  of up to 500,000 units at $0.24, the company proposes to increase the offering to 1,000,000 units. The private placement will be conducted through the facilities  of  Pacific International Securities. All other terms of the private placement remain the same.

<DT>09/17/96<DD>Further to the company's news release of May 2 1996, 194,444 of  the
units  privately  placed  by  the  company  have  been cancelled and returned to treasury due to non-payment. Proceeds derived by the company  from  the  private placement was therefore $406,000 as opposed to $476,000 as previously reported.

<DT>09/13/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing a services  agreement  dated  September  3  1996
between  the  company  and  Genis  Intl Corp (beneficially owned by Eric Stephen Cohen). Consideration is the payment of expenses to a maximum  of  US$2,000  per month.

<DT>09/03/96<DD>U.S. Investor Relations firm hired.  The company has arranged an agreement with  Genis  Intl  Corp  of  North  Miami, Florida,  USA,  whereby Genis will provide information services in the US to the
company on a monthly basis.     
<P>                                                
The company and Genis deal at arm's  length  and,  to  the  company's  knowledge neither Genis nor its owner, Eric Cohen, at this time has any ownership interest in the company.                                                                 

<DT>08/16/96<DD>A well has been drilled to the depth of 2,600 feet to test the Entrada formation
on  the  Gonzales  Ranch.  Although  oil  and  gas  was  present,  it was not in commercial quantities to justify completing the well due to an unexpected thrust fault.  Gas  shows  in  the  Dakota formation looked prospective. 
<P>
The company is currently studying the possibility of drilling another  well  and  is  reviewing drilling costs to test the Mancos Shales, the Dakota and Entrada Formation on an alternate location. This second well will involve  drilling  to  a  considerably shallower  depth  on the oil lease earned by the company by completing the first test well.

<DT>08/16/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing documentation pertaining to an  agreement  dated
February  14 1996, as amended May 21 1996 whereby the company can reacquire from Orion Resources Inc a 24.03% beneficial interest in the Sierra  Leone  exclusive prospecting   license   No.   expl.   5/94  for  diamond  offshore  concessions. Consideration is the issuance of 2,600,000 shares in two equal stages. 
<P:
The first tranche  of  1,300,000  shares  is to be issued upon exchange acceptance and the
remaining tranche of 1,300,000 shares upon filing a geological report acceptable to  the  exchange  with recommendation for further work on the concessions. Upon exercising of an underlying agreement dated August 4  1995,  between  Orion  and Malaysia  Mining  Corp, the company would subsequently retain a 7.03% beneficial interest in the concessions.  
<P>                                                  
Pursuant to an agreement dated January 28 1995,  Orion  acquired  the  company's beneficial  interest of 24.03% for consideration in forgiving the company's debt to Orion of US$86,317 and a C$70,000 loan with  accrued  interest.  The  company retained a 15% net profits interest.

<DT>08/14/96<DD>In January 1995, the discovery was made of gem quality diamonds on the 660 sq km
offshore  diamond leases in Sierra Leone territorial waters held by the Casierra Syndicate, in which Loumic Resources held 26.7% interest,  An  option  agreement was  concluded  October 1995 with Malaysia Mining Corp Berhad (MMC) granting MMC the right to earn a 51% interest in the property  in  return  for  carrying  out further  exploration and development of the project and bringing the property to commercial production.        
<P>                                                  
Prior to concluding the option agreement MMC funded an evaluation of the  marine sediment  sample  concentrates  recovered  during the 1995 survey carried out by Casierra. The concentrates, derived from 1.3 tonnes of core sample material from 48 sample sites, returned 639 micro diamonds. Of these 69 were in the size range 0.6 mm to 1.2 mm.
<P>
MMC carried out a sampling program on the leases in March - June 1996 at a  cost of  US$3.3  million.  13 high quality gem stones were recovered in this sampling with a size range of 0.2 carats to 2 carats. These initial results  confirm  the presence  of gem diamonds on the offshore leases but cannot be used to determine
the grade or size of the deposits. De  Beers  has  been  carrying  out  a  US$13 million  program  on  leases  adjacent  to  the  Casierra  leases  indicating  a substantial level of interest in the same geological environment. MMC,  however, has just advised Casierra that it is terminating the option. 
<P>                   
The sampling carried out by MMC did not follow an optimized search based on  the geophysical data acquired in the previous year. No detailed geophysical work was carried out by MMC to define the channels and submerged beach strands identified in  1995.  The  sampling  was principally by airlift dredge from an anchored but moving platform which resulted in generally shallower sampling than planned.    
<P>
The Casierra views the diamond recoveries from this  recent  work  as  a  strong indication  of  the excellent potential for substantial marine alluvial deposits in the shallow and placid waters of the coast of Sierra Leone. The  presence  of the 2 carat gem stone gives an indication that larger stones can be concentrated
in the marine environment.      
<P>                                                
The Casierra Syndicate members, Loumic  and  Phrygian  Mining  Corp  with  53.4% interest,  and  three private entities are negotiating to place their respective interests into a new public company to be traded on a Canadian  stock  exchange. This  vehicle  will  include  in  its  assets  the offshore leases together with
diamond leases in the interior of Sierra Leone that have a valuation  previously accepted by the VSE at over US$15 million.

<DT>07/16/96<DD>The company has been  advised that  drilling  on  the  Scoten  prospect will start on
July 16. Pursuant to the agreement entered into with American Freehold Oil Corp, upon completion of  this
well,  the  company will earn an 80% net revenue interest in the Scoten prospect on the Gonzales ranch in Rio Arriba, New Mexico and also earn the right to drill additional  wells  on  the  16,000  acre  Gonzales  ranch. The company will make results public upon completion of the drill program.

<DT>06/19/96<DD>The company has entered into an option agreement with John Schussler, prospector
and  drilling  contractor,  whereby  the company has an option to acquire a 100% undivided legal and beneficial interest  in  the Mt. Shea claim comprising 20 units in the Liard Mining Division of BC.        
<P>                                                  
The Mt. Shea claim covers 500 hectares, 66 km east-southeast of Dease Lake,  BC.  According to a preliminary investigation, the area covered by the Mt. Shea claim has been identified as anomalous in gold-silver-copper. The prior work conducted in  the  area  in  1985-1986  includes  an airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey, prospecting and geological mapping. The company has  not  yet  finalized
the work program to be started on the Mt. Shea property.

<DT>05/28/96<DD>An agreement has been reached  with  American  Freehold  Oil  Corp  whereby  the
company  is  to  fund 100% of the costs required to drill an exploratory well to test the Entrada formation on the Scoten prospect  on  the  Gonzales  Ranch  and totalling  3,680  acres  in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. 
<P>
The depth of the well will be  2,400  feet  and  will  test  the  Mancos  Shale,  Dakota  and  Entrada
formations.  The  estimated  cost  to  drill  the  well is US$105,000 however if increased drilling  costs  are  encountered,  the  company  is  responsible  for completing the well. Upon completion of the well the company 
will have earned an 80% net revenue interest in the Scolen prospect.                                
<P>
The analog field for the cretaceous reservoirs on  the  Gonzales  Ranch  is  the Price-Gramps  Oil  field six miles to the northeast of the company's drill site.  The Price-Gramps Field has produced  10  million  barrels  of  oil  since  1935, however,  the  company  may  have an advantage of being structurally high to the Price-Gramps Field.             
<P>                                               
Upon drilling of the Gonzales No. 1 well the company will have earned the  right to  drill  additional  wells  on  the  16,000 acre Gonzales Ranch, in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico.

<DT>05/09/96<DD>The company has discovered gem quality diamonds on the offshore  diamond  
leases of  the  Casierra  Syndicate  in January 1995, an option agreement was concluded with Malaysia Mining Corp Berhad (MMC) allowing MMC to earn a  51%  interest  in the  property in return for carrying out the further exploration and development of the project and bringing the property to commercial production. The  cost  of all such works is to be borne by MMC.                                           
<P>
Prior to concluding the option agreement MMC funded an evaluation of the  marine sediment  sample  concentrates recovered during the first surveys carried out by the syndicate. The concentrates, derived 
from 1.3 tonnes of core sample material from 48 sample sites, returned 639 micro diamonds. Of these, 
69 were in the size range 0.6mm to 1.2mm and would be classified in Canadian  exploration  terms  as
macro diamonds.
<P>
MMC started a three month sampling program  on  the  leases  in  March  1996  to evaluate  the preliminary geophysical data presented from the syndicate work and to confirm the significance of the earlier discovery 
of diamonds. The program is being carried out through a contract with Alpine Ocean Seismic which engaged the survey ship Lady "S" of Gal Marine, South Africa. The work is being carried  out with  a  vibracorer  and an airlift dredge sampler. A heavy media plant on board ship, complete with an x-ray diamond sorter unit is being used to produce  heavy mineral concentrates. These concentrates are packaged in sealed cans while still
inside a secure glove box, prior to shipping for further evaluation.  Work to date has recovered macro diamonds of apparent gem quality. One of  these is estimated by the syndicate consultant estimated to 
be 2 carats in size and is reported to be clear and white in colour.                                       
<P>
These initial results confirm the presence  of  gem  diamonds  on  the  offshore leases  but  cannot  be used 
to determine the grade or size of the deposits. The geological consultants for the syndicate advise that the  occurrence  of  the  2  carat  stone is significant because there is a high statistical chance of having
many more diamonds in the size range 1 to 0.1 carats  accompanying  this  larger one.  The syndicate views 
the new work to indicate a significant step forward in the evaluation of the leases.

Further work is continuing on the leases with highest priority  being  given  to the  most  prospective  areas.  The offshore leases to the west of the syndicate leases have been the subject of an announced US$13  million  evaluation  program carried  out  by  a subsidiary company of De Beers using the survey ship Douglas
Bay. While no data has been released by De Beers related to this work, it  is  a substantial expenditure compared with most early stage exploration activity.   Sierra Leone has recently completed national elections to  select  a  democratic government  as  promised  by  the  former  military junta. A multinational peace
keeping force has recently been  invited  into  Sierra  Leone  with  units  from Britain, France and the US contributing to the enforcement of the new democracy.  This opens up the possibility that the  syndicate  will  be  able  to  start  up evaluation  of  the 1900 hectare diamond lease held in the Hima area on the Sewa
River and production on the 58 hectare diamond  mining  lease  in  the  renowned Koidu production area. Government reports of earlier work on the Hima lease show an indicated resource of 1.8 million carats  on  the  Hima  lease.  A  valuation carried  out  by Midas Minerals (now Midas Capital Corp) indicated a net present
value of $4.5 million for 26.7% of the production from the  Hima  lease  ($16.85 million total).
<P>                                                                 
The Koidu area lease covers the subcrop trace of a kimberlite dyke mapped by the geological  survey  of  Sierra Leone. The extensive alluvial workings associated with this dyke suggest that it is diamondiferous. 
The 968 carat Star  of  Sierra Leone  was reportedly discovered in workings downstream from the lease area held by the syndicate.
 
<DT>05/02/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 187,500 shares from escrow. There 
arenow no shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>05/01/96<DD>Further to the company news of  March 25 1996, the company has  withdrawn  its
application to the VSE for approval to its agreement with Verideg Inc to acquire an undivided 70% interest 
in additional off-shore  mineral  concessions  in  the Sierra  Leone.  The  company's  agreement  with  Orion Resources to reacquire an interest in the Sierra Leone as announced by the company on February 16 and February 21 1996 is still proceeding. 
<P>                                                   
The private placement of units as announced by the company on February 29  1996  has closed,  however,  
the  price was increased from $0.28 to $0.36 per unit and the number of units was decreased  to  
1,322,221  units  from  the  1,700,000  units previously  announced. 

<DT>04/30/96<DD>On March 26 1996, directors and employees have been granted options  on  587,000

<DT>04/11/96<DD>Further to Company news release  of March 25 1996 concerning the  
company's  agreement with  Verideg  to  purchase  an  undivided  70%  interest in additional 
offshore mineral concessions in Sierra Leone, the company  has  now  been  advised  that, 
notwithstanding  the  agreement,  the additional concessions have been sold to a third party. The 
reacquisition of concessions from  Orion  is  still  proceeding and filings to obtain approval in that 
regard have been made with the appropriate regulatory authorities and are under review.  The company 
is reviewing its legal rights with respect to the agreement.

<DT>03/22/96<DD>Further to the company's news release dated February 29 1996, the 
company has entered into an agreement with Verideg of Coquitlam, BC, to acquire an 
undivided 70% interest in additional offshore mineral  concessions  comprising  approximately  
300  square kilometres in Sierra Leone. These concessions are beside the mineral concessions
inwhich the company is reacquiring an interest from Orion  Resources as reported in company 
news releases of February 16 and 21 1996.                              
<P>
The agreement requires the company to pay US$160,000 and to issue 60,000  shares to  Verideg,  
who  will  retain  a  fully  carried 30% undivided interest in the mineral concessions such that 
the company shall be required to pay 100%  of  all exploration  costs  on  the  concessions  and  
all fees required to maintain the concessions in good standing.

<DT>03/06/96<DD>Phase two of the exploration work is starting on two Casierra leases this  month
under the management of Malaysia Mining. The Casierra Syndicate, in which Loumic has a 26.7% interest, 
is involved in diamond exploration on offshore  leases  on the  coast  of Sierra Leone in West Africa. Malaysia Mining is planning to carry out a systematic program of bulk sampling on the leases  over  a  two  to  three
month  period.  
<P>
The  work  program  is  being  carried  out as part of an option agreement to earn a 51% interest in the leases.                                 
Survey work carried out by the syndicate in 1995  identified  a  large  area  of potential marine alluvial 
diamonds in channels at the mouths of the Moa and Mano rivers. Initial sorting of concentrates  from  
some  40  samples,  amounting  to approximately  1.3  tonnes  of sample material, identified four diamonds 
ranging from 0.54 carats with 7 mm length to 0.34 carats with 4 mm length. Further  work by  Orex  Laboratories  in Vancouver recovered 67 macro diamonds ranging between 0.6 mm and 1.2 mm and 572 micro 
diamonds 0.6 mm or smaller.  The distribution of small and larger stones in this initial  sampling  indicates
good  potential  to  locate  significant diamond reserves on the offshore leases controlled by the Casierra  
Syndicate.  The  adjacent  offshore  leases  to  the northwest  are  being  tested  by  a  subsidiary  of  DeBeers,  which company is reportedly spending $13 million on a bulk sampling program.

<DT>02/28/96<DD>The company is currently negotiating  to  acquire  additional  offshore  
mineral concessions in Sierra Leone. These concessions are contiguous to the concessions
in respect of which the company is reacquiring an interest from Orion  Resources.
The company has not yet finalized the  acquisition  and  further  details  will  be  announced  
upon conclusion of negotiations.          
<P>                                          
The company has arranged a private placement of 1,700,000  units  at  $0.28  per unit. The 
funds will be  used for  corporate  working  capital  and  to enable the company to proceed 
with its plans in Sierra Leone if the above-noted negotiations.

<DT>02/20/96<DD>Further to the company's  news  release  dated  February  15  
announcing the agreement in principal between the company and Orion
Resources, it  desires  to  clarify  and  correct  certain  of  the  information
disclosed therein. The option granted to Malaysia Mining to acquire an undivided
51% interest in the offshore diamond concessions has been granted by  Orion  and
two  of  the other five owners in the concessions as to a 17% undivided interest
each such that, if exercised by Malaysia Mining, the interest being acquired  by
Loumic from Orion and ultimately retained by Loumic will equal a 7.03% undivided
interest in the concessions. In addition,  reference  in  the  news  release  to
Malaysia  Mining placing the concessions into commercial production on or before
August 15 1996, or paying US$500,000 each full six month period thereafter until
commercial production is achieved, should have read August 15 1998.

<DT>02/15/96<DD>The Company announced that an agreement in principal has been reached between the Company and Orion Resources Inc. pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire Orion's interest in Sierra
Leone Exclusive Prospecting License Number Expl. 5/94, being off shore diamond rights in Sierra Leone
(the "Concessions").  As announced in the Company's new release of January 25, 1995, the Company originally 
had a 26.7% interest in the Concessions which was subsequently sold by the Company to Orion Resources Inc. in
consideration of Orion cancelling all debts owed to it by the Company and assuming the Company's financial obligations in connection with the further exploration of the Concessions.  In addition, the Company retained 
a 15% net profits interest in the interest being transferred by the Company to Orion.  At the time of transfer to Orion, the Company was unable to meet its financial obligations in connection with further exploration of the Concessions and was therefore in jeopardy of forfeiting its interest. 
<P>
Pursuant to an agreement dated August 4, 1995 with Malaysia Mining Corporation, Malaysia was granted 
an option to acquire an undivided 51% interest in the Concessions by paying to the owners (which includes Orion) the sum of US$750,000 cash and by placing the Concessions into commercial production on or before 
August 15, 1996 or if commercial production is not achieved by that date paying to the owners US$500,000 on August 15, 1996 and at the end of each succeeding full six month period thereafter until commercial production is achieved.  
<P>
Under the agreement, Malaysia is to incur, on or before August 15, 1996, expenditures for further exploration and development of the Concessions in such an amount that when added to previous expenditures incurred by the owners equals US$1,800,000.  The interest in the Concessions which the Company proposed to re-acquire from Orion consists of 24.03% beneficial interest (subject to the 15% net profits interest already held by the Company in Orion's interest and further subject to the aforesaid option to Malaysia Mining Corporation to acquire an undivided
51% interest in the Concessions).  In consideration of the proposed acquisition, the Company proposed to
issue to Orion up to 2,600,000 common shares in the capital of the Company (being equal to  approximately 18.7% of the then outstanding share capital of the Company) subject to approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities.  The number of shares the Company proposed to issue to Orion equals
the anticipated value of Orion's 24.03% interest in the Concessions based upon prior payments made by
the owners to acquire such rights, previous exploration expense and proposed future exploration in 1996.
The proposed per share issuance price is equal to $0.19, being ($0.25) less a 25% discount due to the hold
period which will otherwise attach to the shares as a result of the Securities Act (British Columbia).  The
proposed acquisition from Orion is subject to the preparation of formal documentation between the
Company and Orion and the receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals and, if necessary, shareholder approvals.

<DT>09/11/95<DDThe Company announced that it will not be proceeding with the 3 million unit private 
placement as announced on June 23, 1995.  The Company is pursuing alternative financing opportunities for its
mineral exploration program planned for Voisey Bay.

<DT>07/04/95<DD>The Company announced that, subject to the approval of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, it planned to issue stock options to purchase up to 506,000 common shares at $0.19 per share exercisable for
2 years.  Of the 920,893 options allocated by the Company as announced by News Release dated
May 3, 1995, 460,466 options have been exercised.

<DT>06/23/95<DD>The Company announced that it is negotiating mineral claims in the Nain Plutonic Complex, Labrador.  These rocks host the spectacular nickel-copper discovery made by Diamond Fields Resources near
Voisey Bay.  The claims for which the negotiation has been initiated are part of a large package of
ground on which the owner has started flying airborne geophysical surveys with Aerodat as their contractor. 
MPH Consulting Ltd. (Toronto) is acting as project manager for the claim package, having been selected for 
their established record in exploration and for their staff experience in Labrador.
<P>
The Voisey Bay area is the subject of a major staking and exploration boom with no parallel since the
Kidd Creek discovery in the early 60's.  Labrador has only been explored in a limited manner and has
great potential for further mineral discoveries of the type found by Diamond Fields.
<P>
The Company also announced that it has retained Pacific International Securities Inc. to conduct a
brokered private placement of 3 million units at $0.15 per unit.  Each unit is comprised of 1 share and 1
warrant exercisable for 2 years at $0.15 per share in year one and $0.17 per share in year two.  The
agent will receive a commission of 7.5% of the units sold, payable in units.  The funds will be used to
enable the Company to proceed with its acquisition in Voisey Bay.

<DT>05/15/95<DD> The Company announced that Mr. Ben Ainsworth resigned as a director of the company.

<DT>10/26/94<DD>The Company announced that Casierra Syndicate, of which Loumic is a partner, is in 
the final stages of acquiring additional marine leases at the mouth of the Mano and Moa Rivers in Sierra Leone, West Africa.  Loumic has made a payment on October 20, 1994 in the amount of US$79,600 to cover the
company's interest of 26.7% in the project.  The payment will cover part of the cost surveying the sea
bed and some sampling.

<DT>07/25/94<DD>The Company announced that the Casierra Syndicate, in which it has a 26.7% working interest, has been granted 560.5 sq. km. offshore licences by the Government of Sierra Leone.  These licences are located at the mouth of the Mano and Moa Rivers which have historically been noted for gem diamond
production.  These leases cover prime marina alluvial ground which has the potential for diamond reserves comparable to those being exploited by De Beers et. al. along the coast of Namibia, S.W. Africa.
<P>
Government sources in Sierra Leone indicate that De Beers and Diamond Fields Resources have applied
for licences on adjacent parcels.  Exploration will start in the area as soon as crews can be mobilized and
work will be conducted year round.  A programs of surveying with side-scan sonar and seismic profiling
with sparker sampling with specialized drilling tools.
<P>
The Casierra Syndicate has acquired two other licences for diamonds in Sierra Leone.  The Hima licence
on the Sewa River covers 19 sq. km. of river and its terraces in an area where the Geological Survey of
Sierra Leone indicated a potential diamond reserve of 1.8 carats.  The Sedafu licence, in the principal
diamond mining centre of Sierra Leone near Xoidu, covers 59 hectares of diamond bearing ground that is
reportedly upstream from the location of the 968 carat Star of Sierra Leone discovery.  A kimberlite dyke
is mapped crossing the licence and will be the principal exploration target. Sierra Leone, once the second diamond producer in the world, also has excellent potential for other minerals.

<DL>
<DT>09/23/96<D>The Company reports that field work on the Waratah property has been completed. The  objectives  were  to determine the strike length and gold mineralization potential of the Cooper zone
and to evaluate the gold potential of an inferred northwest-trending  structural zone  in  the  eastern  parts of the property. The structural zone hosts several gold occurrences, including the Cooper zone.                                    
Significant gold assay results from quartz-sulphide veins  and  sulphide-bearing shear zones discovered within the structural zone.  Please contact the company for the complete list of assay results.                          
<P>
The Cooper  zone  is  a  sulphide-bearing  shear  zone,  exposed  through  blast trenching  at  four  locations  over  a  strike  length  of  approximately 150m.  Significant gold values were also found                                            
<P>
The above trench results, and a VLF-EM survey, indicate that along strike to the southeast the Cooper zone is truncated by a fault, and to the northwest the zone pinches out. A seven-hole diamond drill program carried out  in  1990  indicates that the zone also pinches out at depth.     The Waratah property hosts approximately 20 high grade gold occurrences and  has excellent  potential  to  host a high grade, shear zone-hosted or vein type gold deposit, similar to the Snip deposit. A proposed access road to the  Snip  mine, currently  being  surveyed  and  cut, would vastly improve logistics for mineral exploration and the economic  feasibility  of  mineral  deposits  in  the  Iskut region. This access road will pass directly through the Waratah claims.         
Exploration is planned to continue in the spring of 1997 on the Waratah 4, 5 and 6  claims  immediately  east  of  the  Snip  mine.  Work  is expected to include linecutting/grid establishment, prospecting, VLF-EM and  magnetic  surveys,  and blast trenching. Diamond drilling, if warranted, will be carried out as a second
phase program.          
<P>                                                       
Maple Mark International and Royal Bay Gold are joint operators of the property.

<DT>08/19/96<DD>Trench sampling from the Cooper zone on the Waratah property  has  returned  the
 significant assay results.  Please call the company for the results at (604) 474 - 7999                                            
 <P>                                                                              
The 1996 program has defined the Cooper  zone  as  a  sulphide-rich  shear  zone ranging  from  3  to  5m  in width over a strike length of approximately 150m. A sulphide-rich interval in trench T96-5,  which  returned  low-grade  gold  assay results, indicates the zone is open to the northwest.       
<P>                    
Assay results from trench T96-6, 25m northwest from T96-5  are  expected  within the next two weeks.

<DT>08/12/96<DD>Maple Mark International has received preliminary results from  its  exploration
of the Waratah mineral claims in the Iskut River area near Prime Resources' Snip mine in northwestern BC. The company's geologists, Reliance Geological Services, is presently conducting a geological mapping, blast trenching, rock sampling and magnetic/VLF-EM  geophysical  survey  program  on  the  Waratah  property.   The objectives  of  the  program  are  to define the surface extent and grade of the Cooper zone and to locate other gold-enriched quartz veins.  Twenty-Eight (28) rock samples have been collected.  Complete details and
results are now available.  Please call the company for the results to be sent to you        
<P>             
A new showing is on trend with the Cooper zone and indicates a  strike  length of over 1,500 metres.                                                           
Previous trenching on the 195 metre long Cooper zone returned gold values of 5.3 g/mt  over  4.40  metres,
8.7 g/mt over 3.05 metres, 24.6 g/mt over 2.50 metres, and 104.0 g/mt over 0.50 metres. Seven drill holes totalling 540 metres returned gold values of 19.9 g/mt over 0.68 metres, 15.6 g/mt over 1.52 metres, 13.1 g/mt
over 0.61 metres, and 34.6 g/mt over 0.45 metres.                  
<P>             
To date, seven trenches have been excavated  during  this  summer's  exploration program and further results are expected in due course. The company also intends to undertake a summer and autumn drilling program to further define  the  extent of the Cooper zone and other showings.

<DT>07/09/96<DD>The field crews have been mobilized for a  summer  exploration  program  on  the
Waratah mineral claims, Iskut River area, northwestern BC.  The initial exploration program will include linecutting and  ground  geophysics to  develop  drill  targets on the Waratah claims' Cooper zone and several other areas of interest identified in previous exploration programs.     
<P>             
Detailed exploration in 1990 identified the 195 metre  long  northwest  trending Cooper  zone,  with  gold values from trench sampling as high as 0.156 oz/t over 4.4 metres, 0.254 oz/t over 3.05 metres, 0.717 oz/t over 2.5 metres,  and  3.033 oz/t  over  0.5  metres.  Seven  drill  holes totalling 540 metres returned gold intercepts up to 0.58 oz/t over 0.68 metres, 0.455 oz/t over 1.52 metres,  0.382 oz/t over 0.61 metres, and 1.009 oz/t 
over 0.45 metres.
<P>
In 1987, detailed work on the Golden Spray zone  outlined  a  northwest-trending zone,  approximately  
300 metres long, consisting of the Golden Spray vein and a number of subparallel veins that have returned gold values up to 0.156 oz/t over 1.4  metres,  0.372  oz/t  over 0.6 metres, and 0.270 oz/t over 0.65 metres from trenching. Fifteen drill holes, totalling 608 metres, returned  gold  intercepts up to 0.206 oz/t over 
0.48 metres, and 0.136 oz/t over 0.3 metres.  
<P>            
Based on preliminary information, the Golden Spray zone appears related  to  the Cooper  zone  and  the Waratah's Swamp and Bluff veins, forming a 5.7km long and 200 metre wide northwest trending structural zone.

<DT>06/10/96<DD>Mr Kevan Garner has resigned as a director, effective June 7 1996.   The board is now comprised of Mr Kevin C. Whelan, president, Mr Glen C.  Wallace and Mr Robert J. Kolt.

<DT>05/21/96<DD>The Company reported that with Royal Bay Gold, it had completed an intensive joint staking program in which 680 mineral claim units covering nearly 42,000 acres were staked in the Iskut River area of northwestern British Columbia.  The mineral claims are north, east and southeast of Prime Resources'
Snip gold mine and Royal Bay's Waratah mineral claims, on which Maple Mark is mobilizing field crews
for a spring and summer exploration program.  The Company has also received from its geologists an
analysis of past work on the Waratah mineral claims as part of the comprehensive planning of its spring
and summer exploration program.  Detailed work carried out in 1987 over the Waratah 6 claim's Swamp
and Bluff veins returned an impressive 10.072 oz/t gold in a 1.1 metre chip sample across the Swamp
vein.  The Swamp vein was tested by two trenches and six drill holes totalling 251.5 metres.  The best
gold values from trenching include 6.251 oz/t over 1.9 metres and 1.458 oz/t over 0.34 metres.  The best
drill intercept was 0.37 oz/t over 0.25 metres.  The Bluff vein was tested over a 75 metre strike length by
five trenches and 11 drill holes totalling 420.7 metres.  The best gold values from trenching include 1.1
oz/t over 0.45 metres, 1.422 oz/t over 0.30 metres, 0.32 oz/t over 0.6 metres, metres, and 0.984 oz/t over
0.33 metres.  Ten of the eleven drill holes intersected significant gold mineralization.  The best intercepts
include 0.343 oz/t over 2.45 metres, 0.416 oz/t over 1.10 metres, 0.374 oz/t over 1.10 metres and 0.288
oz/t over 1.5 metres.
<P>
Detailed exploration of the Waratah 7 claim in 1990 outlined the 195 metre long northwest trending
Cooper zone.  The best gold values from trench sampling include 0.156 oz/t over 4.4 metres, 0.254 oz/t
over 3.05 metres, 0.717 oz/t over 2.5 metres, and 3.033 oz/t over 0.5 metres.  Seven drill holes totalling
540 metres returned gold intercepts up to 0.58 oz/t over 0.68 metres, 0.455 oz/t over 1.52 metres, 0.382
oz/t over 0.61 metres, and 1,009 oz/t over 0.45 metres.
<P>
A detailed 1988 airborne Aerodat VLF-EM and magnetometer survey outlined several conductors on the
Waratah claims.  The most significant anomalies coincide with the Iskut River and may not be suitable for
follow-up field work.  The survey did, however, clearly outline a dominant northwest-trending structural
trend.
<P>	
The Company also reported that it has acquired a 100% interest in 104 mineral claim units covering 6,400
acres adjacent to and near the Waratah mineral claims in the vicinity of Prime Resources' Snip gold mine
in northwestern BC.  The mineral claims, known as the Jazz and Skut claim groups, include the Golden
Spray zone discovered in 1987.  Based on preliminary information, the Golden Spray zone appears related
to the Waratah property's promising Cooper zone and Swamp and Bluff veins forming a 5.7 km long and
200 metre wide northwest trending structural zone.
<P>
In 1987, detailed work on the Golden Spray zone outlined a northwest trending zone, approximately 300
metres long, consisting of the Golden Spray vein and a number of subparallel veins that have returned
gold values up to 0.156 oz/t over 1.4 metres, 0.372 oz/t over 0.6 metres, and 0.270 oz/t over 0.65 metres
from trenching.  Fifteen drill holes, totalling 608 metres, returned gold intercepts up to 0.206 oz/t over
0.48 metres, and 0.136 oz/t over 0.3 metres.
<P>
The Company acquired the Jazz and Skut claim groups in a non-arm's length transaction from Charles
Michael Development Corporation and The Wallace Family Trust for $27,989, being the vendors' cost,
subject to a 5% nsr royalty in favour of the vendors.

<DT>05/17/96<DD>The Company reported that it has engaged Mr. Bob Kolt, a director of the Company, as its investor relations representative.  The Company will pay Mr. Kolt $4,000 per month for three months.

<DT>05/15/96<DD>The Company has appointed Mr. Bob Kolt as a director effective May 15, 1996.

<DT>05/15/96<DD>The Company changed its name from H.L. International Inc. to Maple Mark International Inc.  There is no consolidation of capital.  Effective at the opening April 17, 1996, the common shares of Maple Mark will be posted and called for trading on the Alberta Stock Exchange and the shares of H.L. International will be delisted.

<DT>05/01/96<DD>The Company with its joint venture partner Royal Gold Corporation reported that planning for the mobilization of field crews for a spring and summer exploration program on the Waratah mineral claims has begun.  Reliance Geological Services of North Vancouver has been engaged as the project geologists, and drilling contracts are currently being negotiated.  The Waratah property consists of four mineral claims (80 units) in the Iskut River area of northwestern BC.  The property is adjacent to the Snip deposit and near Johnny Mountain and Eskay Creek deposits.  The Company may earn a 50% undivided interest by issuing to Royal Bay Gold 500,000 shares and incurring exploration expenditures totalling $2,000,000 over the next three years.

<DT>04/16/96<DD>The Company reported that further to their news release of April 15, 1996, the Alberta Stock Exchange review of the reverse takeover transactions is complete and trading of the company's shares will resume Wednesday, April 17, 1996.  As part of the reverse takeover, the Company changed its name to Maple Mark International from H.L International and changed its trading symbol on the Alberta Stock Exchange to MAP from HLI.

TD Bank 1,000,000 NFT; Altamira Management, A/C  No.  31  512,000  FT;  Altamira Management, A/C No. 181 443,000 FT; and six others.                             

<DT>10/10/96<DD>Further to the Company news release of  September 17 1996,  the  company  has  closed  the first tranche of a special warrant financing.   
<P>                                
Eagle & Partners acted as the agent for  the  company  in  connection  with  the private  placement  of  a total of 2,675,000 special warrants at $4.90 for gross proceeds of $13,107,500.      
<P>                                                  
The common shares issuable upon exercise of 1,025,000 of the special warrants will be designated as  flow-through  shares for Canadian income tax purposes.                                               
<P>
The company will file a prospectus in BC for the purpose of qualifying the units issuable upon exercise of the special warrants. If the company does not obtain a receipt for its final prospectus with 120 days from the  closing,  each  special warrant will be exercisable into 1.1 units.   
<P>                                  
The company will use the net proceeds to finance the underground bulk sample  of the  5034 pipe on the company's AK property in the Northwest Territories and for additional exploration on the AK and CJ properties.       
<P>                      
The securities which comprise this private placement were not offered or sold in the  US  and  have not been registered under the US Securities Act of 1933. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell  or  the  solicitation  of  an offer to buy these securities in the US.

<DT>09/19/96<DD>The Company reports processing of the remaining 79 tonnes, of the total 104 tonne mini-bulk  sample, by  Canamera  Geological  Ltd's  dense  media  separation  plant  (DMS) has been completed and is considered to be a success. Diamonds  were  recovered  from  42 bulk  sample drill holes, which were spaced in such a way to uniformly cover the entire surface area of the pipe. As a result, planning for a  feasibility  study of  the  5034  pipe has begun. It is anticipated that this will include a 10,000
tonne underground bulk sample to provide a large enough quantity of diamonds for evaluation  purposes.  It  is expected that underground operations will start in the spring of 1997. An aggressive exploration program will continue for the next several months.
<P>
The processing of the remaining 79 tonnes of kimberlite was accelerated  by  not doing  a  final crush of the ore. This meant that a large fraction of the 1 to 3 mm diamonds were not recovered from the kimberlite chips,  that  were  up  to  a centimeter in size. The main purpose of the mini-bulk sample was to determine if
it is warranted to proceed to the underground bulk sample and not to recover all the  diamonds.  The  key  aspects of the mini-bulk sample were to determine if a sufficient grade of  diamonds,  uniformly  spaced,  is  present,  including  the presence  of  larger stones and a representative number of quality stones. These
key conditions have all been met, making the bulk sample a success.    
<P>         
Diamonds with a weight of 257 carats were recovered from 104 tonnes of processed kimberlite,  for a recoverable grade of 2.48 carats per tonne. As expected, this is lower than the 3.09 carats per tonne for  the  first  25  tonnes,  which  did undergo a final crush. The grade of the diamonds greater than 2mm in the largest
dimension is 2.10 carats per tonne. There were three diamonds over  two  carats, eight diamonds equal to or greater than 1.5 carats, 43 diamonds over 0.50 carats and 556 diamonds over 0.10 carats. The largest diamond is 2.88 carats  and  four of the largest eight stones are of gem quality. A value for the diamonds will be
determined by  several  diamantaires  and  will  be  reported  as  soon  as  the information is available. 
<P>                                                      
An extensive exploration program, involving the expenditure of $4 million,  will continue for the next several months. 1,000 heavy indicator mineral till samples will have been collected by the end of September from five  different  areas  on the  AK  claim  group  and  335 samples from the CJ claim group to better define
drilling targets. It is anticipated that up to 15  land-based  targets  will  be drilled  on the AK and up to five on the CJ claims this fall. Lake-based targets will be drilled this winter.    
<P>                                                
Planning for the  underground  bulk  sample  has  started  with  the  filing  of applications for the initial permits and with the work on environmental issues.  The AK and CJ properties are held 50% by  Mountain  Province,  40%  by  Glenmore Highlands and 10% by Camphor Ventures.

<dt>09/16/96<dd>The company has engaged Eagle Partners of Toronto, Ontario to act as its  agent, on a best efforts basis, for a private placement financing of up to $15,067,500.  The financing is expected to close within 30 days.                
<P>              
The net proceeds will be used to finance the underground bulk sample of the 5034 pipe  on  the  company's  AK  property  in  the  Northwest  Territories  and for additional exploration on the AK and CJ properties.                             
These securities have not been and will not be offered and sold in  the  US  and have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act of 1933.

<DT>07/18/96<DD>On June 24 1996, directors and employees have been granted  options  on  500,000
shares at $5.05 expiring June 24 1998. 

<DT>06/05/96<DD>Mountain Province has received results of the first quarter  of  the  100  tonne
mini-bulk  sample  taken  of  the  5034  diamond  pipe and processed by Canamera Geological's dense 
media separation plant. Diamonds with a weight of 75.9 carats were recovered from 24.6 tonnes of processed kimberlite, for a recoverable grade of 3.09 carats per tonne. The kimberlite came from nine  drill  holes  into  the southern  and  central  parts  of  the  pipe.  The grade was found to be roughly uniform from drill hole to drill hole and from top to  bottom  in  each  of  the drill holes, considering the small size of the sample.         
<P>                 
The present results  are  an  improvement  over  the  results  for  the  initial exploration holes, and larger stones have now been recovered as well. This is as expected because of the larger sample of kimberlite 
(24.6  versus  5.8  tonnes).  Generally,  for a diamond deposit, larger stones and greater values are obtained
the larger the sample. There are nine diamonds  greater  than  0.50  carats,  53 diamonds greater than 0.20 carats and 144 diamonds greater than 0.10 carats. The five largest diamonds are 1.89, 1.53, 1.03, 0.86 and
 0.75  carats  respectively.
<P>
The DMS process does not recover all the diamonds smaller than 1.5 mm in size, which explains why the 
total grade is lower than the 5.36 carats per tonne for  stones greater  than  1  mm  reported from the earlier results using the caustic fusion recovery process. Full recovery  of  these  smaller  stones  is  not  considered
economic,  given  their  current low commercial value. 
<P>
Drilling  on  the  northern  part  on land is in progress. The deposit is calculated to be at least 20 million tonnes to a  depth of 350 metres and is still open in several directions.

A number of macro-sized coloured diamonds have been recovered by caustic  fusion from  the  AK5034  deposit.  At  this  early  stage, valuation of these coloured diamonds has not been pursued. 
Consequently, the  economic  potential  of  these coloured diamonds has yet to be determined.
<P>                                     
At this time, there are four drills operating on the project. Two of the  drills are  involved  with  securing  
bulk  sample  kimberlite,  one  is  drilling  the exploration targets,  and  the  fourth  is  delineating  the  AK5034  pipe.  The boundaries of the deposit are being extended and remain open to the southwest.  
<P>
The initial bulk sample core is presently being processed in the  density  media separation  unit.  
The  method of reporting diamond results from the DMS will be based on weight of recovered stones 
over 1.00 mm.  Preliminary processing of a  fraction  of  the  10  ton  batch  of  bulk  sample
kimberlite  in  the  DMS  plant  and  X-Ray sortex has returned a 1.20 carat gem quality partial octahedra 
and six diamonds of approximately  0.25  carats  each.  Processing is continuing.
<P>                                                       
The AK/CJ property is held 50% by Mountain Province, 40% by  Glenmore  Highlands
and 10% by Camphor.
 
<DT>03/05/96<DD>Mountain  Province  and  Camphor  have  begun  an  aggressive  exploration   
and development program in excess of $10 million on the AK property, NWT.           
The objectives of the program are as follows:                                   
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To further define the extent of the AK5034 kimberlite pipe through a  10,000  ft
delineation drilling program; 
<LI>To collect a 100 tonne bulk sample from the AK5034 kimberlite pipe through large
diameter drilling;                                                           
<LI>To drill test at least ten, of approximately forty,  high  priority  exploration
targets  that  are  situated  in  various areas of the AK property and have been
defined by diamond indicator mineral trains as well as geophysical surveys.
</UL>
<P>
The delineation drilling has commenced. In addition, two  drills  are  presently
operating  for  the  bulk  sample  collection and the exploration drill has just
arrived on site. It is expected  that  exploration  drilling  of  the  carefully
selected targets will commence shortly.                                         
<P>
Management believes that the results of the bulk sample will be consistent  with
the  earlier  diamond results. Further, the ten exploration targets in different
regions of the AK property appear to be highly prospective for  discovering  new
kimberlite pipes. The AK/CJ property is held 50% by Mountain Province, 
40% by  Glenmore  Highlands and 10% by Camphor.

<DT>02/06/96<DD> Further results have been received from the processing to  
date  of  delineation drill core from the AK property area 5034 kimberlite.                           
The results from the  processing  completed  since  the  last  news  release  
of October 18 1995 have been summarized by drill hole.  The results are positive and
comprehensive.  Due to the large number of results, please contact either company for 
the complete results.

<DT>10/17/95<DD>The Company reported that a further update on the AK
property area 5034 kimberlite has been received. Extensive plans have
been made for the coming winter season.  As a consequence of the highly
favourable results obtained to date from the analysis of the AK5034, the
decision has now been made to proceed with a bulk sample.  An initial
100 tonne bulk sample will be taken with a large diameter drill, and
drilling will commence by the end of November subject having obtained
the necessary permits.  In addition to this 100 tonne bulk sample, a
significant exploration drilling program is also planned for this coming
season.  During the past summer, 1,172 till samples were collected from
AK/CJ property, most of which have been processed.  From the results of
the processing of those samples, as well as the results from a
high-sense geophysical survey to be conducted shortly, the final
definition of several identified exploration drill targets is now being
completed.  The estimated tonnage of the AK5034 kimberlite has been
updated as well, and is now calculated to be approximately 18.3 million
tonnes to a depth of 300 metres.  This tonnage figure has been derived
from a model developed from computer analysis of the delineation holes
drilled to date.  This model was created using Vulcan mine modelling
software, a state-of-the-art engineering package used world-wide for
mining and development. Processing of delineation drill core continues

<P>
Incorporated in December 1986, the Company's main focus in 1995 has been
the discovery of the "5034" diamondiferous kimberlite on the AK Claim in
the Lac de Gras region of the Northwest Territories.  Mountain Province
Mining Inc. also has diamond prospects in Saskatchewan and a
gold-silver-lead property in the Yukon Territory.
<P>
<B>Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories</B>
<P>
The Company holds a 50% interest in AK/CJ diamond prospects covering
approximately 600,000 acres in Lac de Gras area, Northwest Territories.
The intial discovery was made in February 1995 at the "5034" area and
since then a program of delineation drilling and core processing has
followed to determine the size of the kimberlite deposits and
demonstrate the high diamond content. As at the end of August 1995, 38
delineation holes have been drilled in respect of the AK discovery.
Grades received from AK023 drill hole were particularly encouraging with
a Total Macros grade of 9.182 ct/tonne, Macros greater than 1.00mm grade
of 7.216 ct/tonne, macros greater than 2.00mm grade of 3.309 ct/tonne
and a total diamonds grade of 9.681 ct/tonne.  The AK/CJ property is
held 50% by Mountain Province Mining Inc., 40% by Glenmore Highlands
Inc. and 10% by Camphor Ventures Inc.
<P>
Over the next year, the Company will continue their program of pipe
delineation and sampling.  Indicator minerals have been found on other
areas of the AK property and further exploration is planned for fiscal
1996 in anticipation of finding additional kimberlite pipes.  The
Company is continuing to explore the CJ claim where strong indications
of kimberlite exist.  At least five separate mineral trains with
associated geophysical targets have been established on the CJ claims.
Plans for drilling are being finalized.
<P>
<B>Candle Lake, Saskatchewan</B>
<P>
The Candle Lake claims are located in Central Saskatchewan and consists
of 96 separate claim blocks. Mountain Province with Camphor Ventures
Inc, War Eagle Mining Company Inc.and Great Western Gold Corp.,each
held a 25% interest on the Candle Lake Joint Venture Partnership.  At
the end of 1994, the agreement was amended and Mountain Province's
interest was reduced.  Under the new agreement, Kennecott Canada Inc.
will earn a 60% interest in the claims leaving each of the four other
joint venture partners with a 10% interest.  After Kennecott has earned
its interest, each Company could further reduce its interest to a 7.5%
carried interest through a positive feasibility study.  The Candle Lake
claims are strategically located near kimberlite discovery sites and
Kennecott has already initiated an exploration program.
<P>
<B>Fort a la Corne, Saskatchewan</B>
<P>
This property covers 8,698 acres in Fort a la Corne located in Central
Saskatchewan.  Last year, the Company increased their interest to 37% in
nine claims located on the eastern side of the Fort a la Corne property
in the vicinity of a number of previous discoveries.  Following
geophysical surveys undertaken during the year, the Company determined
that claims on the western side of the property did not warrant further
exploration and they were dropped.
<P>
<B>Molanosa Arch, Saskatchewan</B>
<P>
The Company holds a 50% interest in more than 50 separate claim blocks
in the Molanosa Arch , Central Saskatchewan as part of a joint venture
with Consolidated Pine Channel Gold Corp. Although drilling completed in
recent years led to recommendations for further ground magnetic
exploration, additional exploration was curtailed during 1995 due to the
Company's focused activity in Lac de Gras.  The properties in Molanosa
Arch are clustered with anomalies, likely due to kimberlite intrusions,
identified by government survey maps.  The anomaly clusters at the
Molanosa Arch are strikingly similar to those found in the discovery
region in the area.  An abundance of key diamond indicator minerals have
already been discovered in this region, and the positive geological
features provide an ideal environment for a world-class diamond
discovery .  Further drilling is under consideration.
<P>
<B>Ketza River Gold Project, Yukon Territory</B>
<P>
The Company's 11,000 acres Ketza River gold project adjoins the Ketza
Mine which produced 100,000 ounces of gold between 1988 and 1990.  Over
the past year, exploration activity was ongoing at nearby properties.
On the North Zone property, an exploration program is planned for
August/September where the Company will be trenching and drilling
prospective targets.

<P>
Incorporated in September 1983, the company underwent various name changes
and operated as Interactive VideoSystems Inc. unitl August 1995.  The
management of the company decided to change its business direction from its
STARMAKER Video business to that of a natural resources company engaged in
the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. 
Shareholder approval to change its name to NCC Mining Corporation was sought
at the Company's annual general meeting on June 28, 1995.  Effective at the
opening August 16, 1995, the common shares of NCC Mining Corporation were
posted and called for trading on the VSE, and the common shares of
Interactive VideoSystems Inc. were delisted.  The name NCC was chosen
because the company was focused on the exploration for and development of
Nickel, Copper and Cobalt deposits in the Voisey Bay region of Labrador,
Newfoundland.
<P>
The Voisey Bay, Labrador area was catapulated to the forefront of
international mining with the staggering find of a massive
nickel-copper-cobalt deposit by Diamond Fields Resources Ltd. in November
1994.  The Vosiey Bay deposit is considered by many to be the most
significant discovery of this century and may become thelowest cost nickel
producer in the world with a mine life in excess of 20 years.
<P>
NCC Mining Corporation acquired strategically located mineral properties
totalling 2,004 mineral claims in the Harp Lake, Vosiey Bay and Okak Bay
areas, north and south of Diamond Fields' discovery deposit.  These
properties include Harp Lake, Mealy Mountain, Kyfanin Lake, Michikamau and
Hebron.  These acquisitions provide for multiple exploration opportunities,
thereby increasing the Company's potential for success and a new opportunity
to create value for its shareholders.
<P>
<B>The Properties:</B>
<P>
<B>Voisey Bay area, Labrador, Newfoundland - Harp Lake</B><BR>
The Company has 1,204 claims on the Harp Lake intrusive complex, an
anorthositic intrusive geologically similar to the Nain Plutonic Suite at
Voisey Bay, Labrador.  The area is known to be well mineralized and has
numberous nickel-copper-cobalt occurences and geochemical anomalies.
<P>
<B>Mealy Mountain</B><BR>
The Company has 100 claims on the Mealy Mountain intrusive, south of Harp
Lake.  An easier area to work with because of its close proximity to Goose
Bay.  Recent staking in this area has been intense.
<P>
<B>Kyfanin Lake</B><BR>
The Company has 100 claims on the Kyfanin Lake layered intrusive southeast
of Mealy Mountain, and similar to the Kingpait intrusive staked by Diamond
Fields.  Areas of elevated nickel-copper have been identified through
sedimentary geochemistry but this property is essentially unexplored.
<P>
<B>Michikamau</B><BR>
The Company has 200 claims on the Michikamau intrusive, similar to both the
Harp Lake and Nain intrusives.  Mineral claims have been filed covering this
entire intrusive by various companies including Kennecott Minerals.
<P>
<B>Hebron</B><BR>
The Company has 400 claims north of Voisey Bay in the Tassiuak gneiss. 
Considered to be a possible extension of the Voisey Bay discovery area as
the unit is rich in sulphur, which is necessary to precipitate the
nickel-copper-cobalt in the intrusives.  This area is also heavily staked.
<P>
<B>Jolly Lake, Lac De Gras</B><BR>
<B>MacKenzie Mining District, Northwest Territories</B><BR>
The company has acquired an undivided 50% interest in the Jolly Lake claim
group located in the Lac de Gras region of the MacKenzie Mining District in
an agreement with Winspear Resources Ltd..  The Jolly claims consist of
approximately 300, 000 acres and are located approximately 50 kilometers
southwest of the Diamet/BHP diamond discovery at Lac de Gras.  Under the
terms of the joint venture, NCC Mining agreed to expend $2,200,000 in
exploration expenditures over the next four years, deliver a feasibility
study by July 30, 1998 and deliver 500,000 free trading common shares to
Winspear Resources Ltd.  The exploration program to date has consisted of
airborne EM and Mag ground geophysics and heavy mineral sampling which has
identified several drill targets and the Company has expended approximately
$1,100,000.

<DT>09/17/96<DD>The  company's  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Environmental  Well   Control,   has
effectively  completed  the  design  modifications  on  the  Split-Ball  Blowout Preventer. The company has made application with the patent  office  to  protect the design changes. Construction of the working prototype has begun.

<DT>06/25/96<DD>Engineers have revised the split ball blowout operator design. With the  aid  of
the  Pro-Engineer  conceptual  design  software, the engineers have been able to address all of  the  company's  original  concerns.  The  following  large-scale changes have been made to the current design:                                   
Reverse the actual ball valve so that the pressure assists better in closure;   Decrease surface friction between the ball and the ring  seal  by  changing  the angle on the first 75% of travel allowing no contact;                           Redesign the ball joints so that changeover is quicker;   
<P>                      
The body design is spherical allowing a  greater  pressure  with  less  material weight than the conventional square designs currently on the markets.   These changes are significant enough to upgrade the existing  SBBOP  patent  and allow patent pending protection for further refinements.  The conceptual aspect of the project is now complete and the company is ready to order  materials for the prototype. The largest single advantage for this design is that it will achieve greater pressures with less material.
 
<DT>04/16/96<DD>The Company reported that its wholly owned subsidiary, Environmental Well Control Inc. has entered into preliminary negotiations with parties based in England and Ireland with respect to establishing joint ventures to manufacture and market the company's five patented oilfield products.

<DT>03/18/96<DD>The Company reported that its shareholders have approved the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Environmental Well Control Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 5,749,400
Class "A" Common Shares of the Company at a deemed issuance price of $0.25 per share.
<P>
Environmental Well Control Inc. has developed 5 patented oilfield related products.  The products include a wild well capping device designed to quickly bring well blowouts under control, a new generation blowout preventor with dramatically higher capabilities then current designs, and a unique offshore rig design which was developed in conjunction with Hyundai Maritime Research Institute, a division of Hyundai Heavy Industries of Korea and the University of British Columbia.
<P>
The addition of Environmental Well Control Inc. coupled with the existing oilfield marketing strengths
of the Company's other subsidiary, Templar Control Systems Ltd., represents a dramatic opportunity for
the Company to grow exponentially.
<P>
In addition, the Company reported that it has negotiated a private placement of 625,000 Class "A"
Common Shares of the Company at a price of $0.40 per share for aggregate proceeds of $250,000.
Attached to each share is a warrant exercisable at $0.45 to acquire an additional common share within 15
months of the closing of this placement, which is scheduled for on or before April 20,1996.  The
Company anticipates the negotiation of several additional private placements over the ensuing months
to capitalize on the opportunities presented to the Company resulting from the acquistion of
Environmental Well Control Inc.
<P>
As a result of the completion of the acquisition, Environmental Well Control Inc. has become a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company.  There is no change of control resulting from this transaction.

<DT>12/08/95<DD>The Company reported that Environmental Well Control Inc., formerly 668426 Alberta Ltd., which is being acquired by the Company, has entered into an agreement with Pascol Engineering Ltd. of
Thunder Bay, Ontario to manufacture units of the patented Blowout Well Control Device developed
by Environmental Well Control Inc.  In addition, Pascol Engineering Ltd. will assist the Company in
developing the patented split-ball Blowout Preventor from its present working model to a final prototype.

<DT>10/31/95<DD>The Company reported that it has entered into a non-arms length letter of intent with the shareholders of 668426 Alberta Ltd. to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of 668426 Alberta Ltd. of 
Edmonton, Alberta.  668426 Alberta Ltd.'s assets are comprised of 5 separate patented oilfields products.
These products are believed to be synergistic with the products of the Company's wholly-owned
subsidiary Templar Control Systems Ltd.
<P>
Product number one (Canadian Patent Application Serial #2,088,794) is a blowout well control device
which radically speeds up the process of finally capping an out of control well.  This product has been
tested, fully developed and is ready for market use.  Product number two (Canadian Patent Serial
#472,500) is a split ball annular blowout preventor, this design allows smaller preventors to be used on
higher pressure wells, saving both BOP costs and rig costs.  This product is in final design stages and
represents a major opportunity.  Product number three (Canadian Patent Serial #472,498) is a riser
handling system for offshore rigs which substantially decreases running and retrieval time and therefore
reduces operating costs.  Product number four (Canadian Patent Serial #472-499) is a Sub-Sea BOP Stack
Control System. The system utilises a radical design technology similar to submarine hydraulics to effect
BOP control for offshore drilling and production platforms.  Finally, product number five (Canadian
Patent Serial #472-497) is a floating offshore drilling vessel.  This unique tested design for a mobil
offshore drilling unit has a number of advantages including the ability to drill in deep or shallow water
and the rig can be converted from a drilling to a production platform after the well is drilled.  The vessel
requires much less service and can burn bunker C crude, allowing huge operating cost savings in harsh
climates.  With land based oil reserves of the world ever dwindling, this product holds great potential in
both Canada's offshore oilfield future and the rest of the world.

Incorporated in Alberta in 1987 as Northside Resources Ltd., the Company changed its name to its current one in May 1995 on the basis of 1 new for 5 old shares.   The Company engages in the sale of control systems through its wholly-owned subsidiary Templar Control Systems Ltd.
<P>
In January 1996, the Company agreed to acquire Environmental Well Control Inc. for 5,749,440 common shares valued at $0.25 per share.  Environmental Well Control Inc. owns the patents to five separate designs for oilfield equipment products.  More than $1.3 million has been spent on their development which took place in conjunction with Hyundai Maritime Research Institute, a division of Hyundai Heavy Industries of Korea and the University of British Columbia.  The well-capped device has been publicly tested to 10,000 psi and performed perfectly.  In capping blowouts, it produces dramatic reductions in pollution, firefighting, and environmental clean-up costs.  It represents a faster and safer method of capping blowouts than almost any other method now available.  The blowout preventor is compact, light in weight, and utilizes very few moving parts.  It is capable of being manufactured at significantly lower cost than conventional products and will generate substantial savings on both blowout preventor and overall rig costs.

<DT>11/04/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing an agreement dated September 1 1996 whereby  ITL
Capital  Corp  and Riley Resources Ltd have been granted an option to earn a 50% interest (25% each) in  the  Kalimantan  claims  in  Indonesia  for  payment  of US$50,000  to  obtain a preliminary geological report, C$125,000 upon the vendor concluding a formal contract of work with the government of Indonesia,  issuance
of  100,000  shares  by each of ITL Capital and Riley, and incurring exploration expenditures totalling $300,000 by July 3 1997. 

<DT>09/24/96<DD>The Company reports that it has completed  its initial reconnaissance exploration of the South Kelian prospect on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia. The prospect comprises of 16,830 ha  50km  south  of  the Kelian  mine  (which  has  reported  annual  production of 450,000 oz gold). The exploration program consisted of both regional and detailed  geological  mapping and geochemical sampling.   
<P>                                                    
Geochemical assay results of the samples indicate anomalous gold  mineralization is  present  in  several  parts  of the property. Anomalous stream sediment gold occurrences near the northern and southern borders of  the  COW  block  indicate sulphide   mineralization  may  be  present  in  the  project  area.  The  field
exploration also resulted in the discovery of iron  oxide  and  manganese  oxide veins in argillically altered and weathered sedimentary rocks.   
<P>              
The anomalous gold assays and hydrothermal veining  in  rocks  similar  to  that which  host  the Kelian deposit to the north are very encouraging. A multi-phase exploration program recommended by independent geological consultants consisting of  further  stream  sediment  sampling,  an airborne magnetometer survey, power auger soil sampling and an extensive trenching program will commence immediately
to identify locations for a followup diamond drilling program.    
<P>              
Corsair is the operator of the property and ITl and Riley have the right to earn a   combined   50%  interest  in  the  property  through  financing  of  further exploration.

Drill crews will be mobilized out of the Kirk Lake and the Kennedy camp, both of which
are SE of the property.  Four targets will be tested, as prioritized during the property  
evaluation  and target  selection stages of the program. All targets are water based and will be
drilled with vertical holes to a minimum of 500 feet, to conclusively  test  the anomalies.                                                                       The cost of the winter drill program has been budgeted at $500,000.

Baines said that he noted on Thursday, November 16, 1995, VSE officials
asked Mr. Martin to resign from Empyrean Diagnostics after they
discovered numerous disclosure violations in that company.  The reporter
asked how the VSE could remove Mr. Martin from one company, but allow
him to stay on the boards of several others.  The question apparently
stumped VSE officials, who decided to resolve the problem by asking Mr.
Martin to leave all four companies.

Riley Resources Ltd. and ITL Capital Corporation, granted  Ming Financial
Corporation an option to acquire 50% interest in their mineral property
known as the CJ Claim Group located in the Lac de Gras area of the Mackenzie
Mining District in the Northwest Territories, Canada.  Under the terms of
this option agreement, Ming Financial will have the right to acquire a 50%
interest in the Property by incurring $4,000,000 of exploration expenditures
over the next three year period and delivering a feasibility study by June
30, 1998.  Ming Financial must also deliver, as to 50% each, a total of
250,000 free trading common shares of Ming, to ITL Capital and Riley
Resources.  Canamera Geological Ltd. will continue to act as operator and
will commence drilling on or about October 1, 1995.
<P>
The CJ Claim Group consists of 101,492 acres and are located approximately
40 kilometers northeast of Mountain Province Mining Inc.'s diamond discovery
and adjacent to Mountain Province's C.J. project.  During 1993 and 1994, ITL
Capital and Riley Resources spent approximately $1,200,000 on airborne
geophysics, ground geophysics and geochemistry that identified the existence
of 25 potentially diamondiferous Kimberlitic drill targets.  Refined
geophysics and geochemistry on the CJ Claim Group has identified a strong
presence of indicator minerals and the accompaniment of numerous magnetic
highs and lows.  This exploration has helped to further define the targets
which will be drilled this fall.  The primary targets located on the CJ
Group can be reached by drilling from land or, in certain cases, more
preferably from water locations.  Therefore, initial drilling will involve
those targets which more practically require land setup, and drilling on the
water-based targets will commence thereafter upon freezeup and the
establishment of an ice station, projected to occur in mid-November of 1995.

The property is on the south end of Wekusko Lake, 30km southeast of the town  of Snow   Lake,   Manitoba.  Previous  drilling  on  the  property  has  identified mineralized copper-zinc zones.  Cugold  will  become  the  operator  and  it  is expected  that  a  crew  will  be  mobilized shortly to begin a drill program on
targets previously identified by Cugold.                                        

<DT>08/28/96<DD>The company has executed a purchase agreement with Samran Mining and Metals  and
Conbrio  to  acquire  a  270 sq km exploration permit (EP No. 49) in the diamond fields of southeast Guinea, west Africa.
<P> 
Indications pointing to the presence of kimberlites are the presence of kimberlite indicator minerals in  river  gravels and  unconfirmed  reports  of artisanal diggings. The area is poorly studied and outcrops are rare. 
<P>
A three-stage one year program commencing in October 1996 upon completion of the rainy  season  is  recommended  by  Dr  Rombouts  at a cost of US$1,035,400. 
<P>
Further, Rodera has  granted  Samran  and  Conbrio  a  one  month  extension  to September 12 1996 in respect to an agreement dated and executed on March 12 1996 regarding the acquisition of option property No. 1.

<DT>08/16/96<DD>The company has entered into a management agreement with  Mr  David  Duval,  the
president  of  the company, wherein Mr Duval will receive remuneration of $2,500
per month in exchange for providing management  services  to  the  company.  The
agreement expires on July 11 1997.

<DT>07/22/96<DD>The board of directors has accepted the resignation of  Mr  William  Trimble  as
president  of  the  company.  Mr  David  Duval,  a  director of the company, has consented to act as president 
in his place. Mitch Adam has consented to act as a director.

<DT>07/12/96<DD>The company  has  completed  a  private  placement  with  Canaccord  Capital  of
1,265,000  units  at  $0.80. 
	
The proceeds from the private  placement  will  used  partly  on  a  preliminary exploration  program  on  the  Samran property.

will be maintained until the company has completed its reorganization.

<DT>0624/96<DD>Further the company's news release of April 1 and May 29,  the  VSE has  concluded  a  review  of  an  independent  engineering report on the Samran exploration permit in Guinea West Africa. Based on  this  report,  the  VSE  has granted  approval  to the private placement of 1,336,250 units at $0.80 per unit
for gross proceeds of $1,069,000. Proceeds from the private  placement  will  be used  partly  on  a  preliminary exploration program on the Samran property, the valuation, the due diligence, and the evaluation program.                       

At the time of the Samran agreement announcement,  title  to  the  property  was unclear. Samran Metals and Mining originally had represented to the company that it had an interest in three separate mineral properties in the  Kerouana  region of  Guinea near the former Aredor diamond mines (the properties) and that Samran
was the sole registered concession holder of one  of  the  properties  and  held option  rights  to  the two additional properties. 
<P>
It has now been determined that Samran is the registered  holder  of  concession No.  49,  that it does not have rights to option No. 1 and it is negotiating for rights to option No. 2. As a result the company intends to renegotiate the terms of  the Samran agreement with shareholders of Samran. The number of shares to be issued for concession no. 49 will be revised to reflect the fact that  it  is  a grass  roots  property,  therefore the total number of shares will be limited to 200,000 shares in four blocks of 50,000 each. The number of shares to be  issued for option No. 2 will be determined once the valuation of that property has been completed.                                                                      

<DT>05/28/96<DD>Further to the company news release of  May 28 1996, the company  wishes  to  clarify
the location  of  concession No. 49 as reported in the earlier news release of March
29 1996 wherein it was stated, the  company's  properties  are  located  on  and
adjacent  to  the  former Aredor mine. The subject property is approximately 1km
from the former Aredor property and it was concession No.  1  that  was  on  and
adjacent to the property.

<DT>05/27/96<DD>The company has additional information concerning title to  the  Guinea  diamond
properties  held  by  Samran Metals and Mining. Rodera has an option to purchase the shares of Samran.                                                           
<P>
Samran has been issued a renewal of the property referred to in the March 8 1996 press  release  as  the  concession  No. 49 property. Concession No. 49 has been renewed for two years from April 19 1996.                                       
<P>
Samran will not be able to acquire the properties referred to in  the  March  28 1996 press release as 
option property No. 1.                                    
<P>
Samran is continuing to attempt to acquire the properties  referred  to  in  the March 23 1996 press release 
as option property No. 2.  Samran has commissioned a preliminary engineering report on the  concession  
No. 40 property which is currently in the final stages of preparation. All of the documentation  relating  to  the  1,500,000  unit  private  placement announced  on  March 8 1996 has been submitted to the VSE and Canaccord Capital.  Closing is subject to approval of the property acquisition by the VSE.

<DT>04/18/96<DD>Paytel Industries Ltd has changed its name to Rodera Diamond Corporation.  There
is no consolidation of capital. Rodera Diamond Corporation (ROD).  Effective at the opening April 19 1996, the  common  shares  of  Rodera  Diamond Corporation  will be posted and called for trading on the VSE, 
and the shares of Paytel will be delisted.  

<DT>03/29/96<DD>The Company reported that it has entered into a share purchase option agreement dated March 12, 1996 made among the Company, Samran Metals and Mining and Conbrio, the holder of all issued shares of Samran.  The agreement grants the Company the sole and exclusive option to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Samran, a UK company, registered as a foreign Company in Guinea where it holds certain mineral properties.  To exercise the option, the Company must spend not less that CDN$600,000
on the various activities, including exploraton.  The purchase price is the value given to the properties in
the valuation, less any liabilities of Samran, not to exceed US$1,500,000, at the date of exercise of the
option.  The Company is to satisfy the purchase price by issuing that number of shares equal to the
purchase priced divided by the lowest price approved by the exchange.  The issued shares will be subject
to a one year trading restriction.  The Company is to grant to Conbrio a 21/2% net profits interest over
the properties.
<P>
A finder's fee of 50,000 shares of the Company will be paid to each of A.E. Ratz and Bishop Rosen &
Co. of New York.  Cornelius Gallagher of Columbia, New Jersey, is to be appointed to Samran's Board of
Directors and the nominees of Paytel are to be appointed to Samran's Board of Directors.  Paytel is to pay
to the creditors of Samran an amount not to exceed US$1,500,000.
<P>
Conbrio and William Trimble, President of Paytel, have entered into a post vend-in share sale agreement
dated March 12, 1996.  Conbrio will sell to Trimble or his nominees 50% of the shares to be issued by
PayTel pursuant to the option agreement with Samran at $0.0001 per share.
<P>
Samran has represented to the Company that it has an interest in three separate mineral properties in the
Kerouane region of Guinea near the former Aredor Diamond Mines.  Samran is the registered concession
holder of one of the properties and holds certain option rights to the two additional properties.  Samran
is the registered holder of concession No. 49, a 420 square kilometre mining concession.  It has advised
the Company that it holds a non-registered option to acquire an approximately 364 square kilometre	mining concession.  Samran has agreed to use its best efforts to acquire an approximately 400 square
kilometre mining concession.
<P>	
The Company does not have evidence at this time that the properties hold proven or probable mineral
reserves.  Exploration and development on the properties could lead to the establishment of a
commercial diamond mining operation.  There is doubt as to the title of Samran to the properties.  At this
time, Samran has not provided any documentation relating to either option property No. 1 or option
property No. 2.  There is also doubt whether concession No. 49 will be renewed unless certain documents
are received and there is a possibility of a competing claim for option No. 1.  The whole issue of title is a
significant risk and will remain so until the company is able to carry out the due diligence that it expects
to carry out over the next few months.
<P>
The Company's properties are on and adjacent to the site of the former Aredor Diamond Mines.  The
Aredor mine was operated from 1984 to 1991 by an Australian Company, Bridge Oil, which sold its 50%
interest to the government of Guinea in 1994.  Aredor operated an alluvial mine that produced over
l,000,000 carats of diamonds with a value in excess of US$300 million.  Mining operations, which yielded
large and valuable gemstones, were suspended in 1991 because of the high operating costs relating to the
transportation of the ore, civil disruptions and security problems posed by artisan miners on or near the
mine.  The Company has been advised that the security situation has improved and that it would now be
possible to operate in the area.  The Company plans to retain the services of experienced European
diamond mine operators to manage the development and exploraton of the properties.  Experienced and
capable people have expressed an interest in becoming involved and are participating in the Company's
due diligence program.

<DT>03/08/96<DD>The Company announced that it proposed to complete a brokered private placement of 1.5 million units at $0.80 per unit, each unit consisting of one share and one warrant to purchase an additional share at $0.85 per share for six months.  The agents will receive a commission of 10% of the net proceeds.
Proceeds will be used to fund exploration efforts of the Kerouane-Banankora diamond claims in the
African country of Guinea.

<DT>03/04/96<DD>The Company announced that it has entered into a conditional option to purchase the shares of Samran Metals and Mining, a UK private company that holds a 421 sq. km. diamond concession in the Kerouane-Banankora area of the African country of Guinea.  The obligations of the parties is conditional
on the representative of the shareholders of Samran providing to Paytel on or before March 31, 1996,
certain information concerning the shareholders, the concession and the financial  state of Samran.  If the
conditions are met, Paytel will have the option until August 30, 1996 to purchase the shares of Samran for
a price equal to the fair value of the assets of Samran, as determined by an independent engineer.  Paytel
will pay for the shares by issuing shares to the vendors at the lowest price allowable.  The option is
conditional on Paytel spending no less than C$600,000 exploring the property, confirming the terms of
the concessions and negotiating arrangements with an operator and a diamond marketer.  Paytel is to 
commission, pay for and deliver the independent engineer's valuation and to pay US$1,500,000 of debt
incurred by Paytel.

<DT>02/26/96<DD>The Company reported that it has executed a non-binding letter of intent relating to an option to acquire the shares of Samran Mining and Metals of London, England, which owns a 420 sq. km. mining concession in the Republic of Guinea, West Africa.  The Company expects to negotiate a formalagreement over the next 30 days.

<DT>01/30/96<DD>The Company has completed its non-brokered private placement of 1,250,000 units at $0.225 per unit.   Proceeds were applied towards the Company's general	working capital.

<DT>01/22/96<DD> The Company reported that Robert Paul has been appointed as a director of the Company.

<DT>10/09/96<DD>The company has closed a brokered private placement of 835,000 units,  including
455,000  flow-through  units, at $0.25.

<DT>09/30/96<DD>The VSE has accepted for filing, subject to the  transaction  closing  no  later
than 45 days from July 10 1996, a private placement of 835,000 shares (of which 445,000 are flow through)                 
at a price of $0.25 per share plus a warrant.   Some placees are as follows:  Jim Thomas 100,000 shares; Michael Halvorson 100,000 shares; Jens Hansen  80,000 shares; and 24 others.                                      

<DT>09/23/96<D>The Company reports that field work on the Waratah property has been completed. The  objectives  were  to determine the strike length and gold mineralization potential of the Cooper zone
and to evaluate the gold potential of an inferred northwest-trending  structural zone  in  the  eastern  parts of the property. The structural zone hosts several gold occurrences, including the Cooper zone.                                    
Significant gold assay results from quartz-sulphide veins  and  sulphide-bearing shear zones discovered within the structural zone.  Please contact the company for the complete list of assay results.                          
<P>
The Cooper  zone  is  a  sulphide-bearing  shear  zone,  exposed  through  blast trenching  at  four  locations  over  a  strike  length  of  approximately 150m.  Significant gold values were also found                                            
<P>
The above trench results, and a VLF-EM survey, indicate that along strike to the southeast the Cooper zone is truncated by a fault, and to the northwest the zone pinches out. A seven-hole diamond drill program carried out  in  1990  indicates that the zone also pinches out at depth.     The Waratah property hosts approximately 20 high grade gold occurrences and  has excellent  potential  to  host a high grade, shear zone-hosted or vein type gold deposit, similar to the Snip deposit. A proposed access road to the  Snip  mine, currently  being  surveyed  and  cut, would vastly improve logistics for mineral exploration and the economic  feasibility  of  mineral  deposits  in  the  Iskut region. This access road will pass directly through the Waratah claims.         
Exploration is planned to continue in the spring of 1997 on the Waratah 4, 5 and 6  claims  immediately  east  of  the  Snip  mine.  Work  is expected to include linecutting/grid establishment, prospecting, VLF-EM and  magnetic  surveys,  and blast trenching. Diamond drilling, if warranted, will be carried out as a second
phase program.          
<P>                                                       
Maple Mark International and Royal Bay Gold are joint operators of the property.

<DT>08/19/96<DD>Trench sampling from the Cooper zone on the Waratah property  has  returned  the
 significant assay results.  Please call the company for the results at (604) 474 - 7999                                            
 <P>                                                                              
The 1996 program has defined the Cooper  zone  as  a  sulphide-rich  shear  zone ranging  from  3  to  5m  in width over a strike length of approximately 150m. A sulphide-rich interval in trench T96-5,  which  returned  low-grade  gold  assay results, indicates the zone is open to the northwest.       
<P>                    
Assay results from trench T96-6, 25m northwest from T96-5  are  expected  within the next two weeks.

<DT>08/12/96<DD>Maple Mark International has received preliminary results from  its  exploration
of the Waratah mineral claims in the Iskut River area near Prime Resources' Snip mine in northwestern BC. The company's geologists, Reliance Geological Services, is presently conducting a geological mapping, blast trenching, rock sampling and magnetic/VLF-EM  geophysical  survey  program  on  the  Waratah  property.   The objectives  of  the  program  are  to define the surface extent and grade of the Cooper zone and to locate other gold-enriched quartz veins.  Twenty-Eight (28) rock samples have been collected.  Complete details and
results are now available.  Please call the company for the results to be sent to you        
<P>             
A new showing is on trend with the Cooper zone and indicates a  strike  length of over 1,500 metres.                                                           
Previous trenching on the 195 metre long Cooper zone returned gold values of 5.3 g/mt  over  4.40  metres,
8.7 g/mt over 3.05 metres, 24.6 g/mt over 2.50 metres, and 104.0 g/mt over 0.50 metres. Seven drill holes totalling 540 metres returned gold values of 19.9 g/mt over 0.68 metres, 15.6 g/mt over 1.52 metres, 13.1 g/mt
over 0.61 metres, and 34.6 g/mt over 0.45 metres.                  
<P>             
To date, seven trenches have been excavated  during  this  summer's  exploration program and further results are expected in due course. The company also intends to undertake a summer and autumn drilling program to further define  the  extent of the Cooper zone and other showings.

<DT>07/09/96<DD>The field crews have been mobilized for a  summer  exploration  program  on  the
Waratah mineral claims, Iskut River area, northwestern BC.  The initial exploration program will include linecutting and  ground  geophysics to  develop  drill  targets on the Waratah claims' Cooper zone and several other areas of interest identified in previous exploration programs.     
<P>             
Detailed exploration in 1990 identified the 195 metre  long  northwest  trending Cooper  zone,  with  gold values from trench sampling as high as 0.156 oz/t over 4.4 metres, 0.254 oz/t over 3.05 metres, 0.717 oz/t over 2.5 metres,  and  3.033 oz/t  over  0.5  metres.  Seven  drill  holes totalling 540 metres returned gold intercepts up to 0.58 oz/t over 0.68 metres, 0.455 oz/t over 1.52 metres,  0.382 oz/t over 0.61 metres, and 1.009 oz/t 
over 0.45 metres.

<DT>07/03/96<DD> The company has negotiated a brokered private placement consisting of  1,000,000
units  at $0.25 per unit, of which 500,000 units will be flow through.  The  agents are Union Securities of Vancouver.  Proceeds will be used for exploration work on the company's Iskut River properties,  and  for  
working capital.                                                                         

<DT>05/21/96<DD>The Company reported that with Maple Mark International Inc., it had completed an intensive joint staking program in which 680 mineral claim units covering nearly 42,000 acres were staked in the Iskut River area of northwestern British Columbia.  The mineral claims are north, east and southeast of Prime Resources'
Snip gold mine and Royal Bay's Waratah mineral claims, on which Maple Mark is mobilizing field crews
for a spring and summer exploration program.  The Company has also received from its geologists an
analysis of past work on the Waratah mineral claims as part of the comprehensive planning of its spring
and summer exploration program.  Detailed work carried out in 1987 over the Waratah 6 claim's Swamp
and Bluff veins returned an impressive 10.072 oz/t gold in a 1.1 metre chip sample across the Swamp
vein.  The Swamp vein was tested by two trenches and six drill holes totalling 251.5 metres.  The best
gold values from trenching include 6.251 oz/t over 1.9 metres and 1.458 oz/t over 0.34 metres.  The best
drill intercept was 0.37 oz/t over 0.25 metres.  The Bluff vein was tested over a 75 metre strike length by
five trenches and 11 drill holes totalling 420.7 metres.  The best gold values from trenching include 1.1
oz/t over 0.45 metres, 1.422 oz/t over 0.30 metres, 0.32 oz/t over 0.6 metres, metres, and 0.984 oz/t over
0.33 metres.  Ten of the eleven drill holes intersected significant gold mineralization.  The best intercepts
include 0.343 oz/t over 2.45 metres, 0.416 oz/t over 1.10 metres, 0.374 oz/t over 1.10 metres and 0.288
oz/t over 1.5 metres.
<P>
Detailed exploration of the Waratah 7 claim in 1990 outlined the 195 metre long northwest trending
Cooper zone.  The best gold values from trench sampling include 0.156 oz/t over 4.4 metres, 0.254 oz/t
over 3.05 metres, 0.717 oz/t over 2.5 metres, and 3.033 oz/t over 0.5 metres.  Seven drill holes totalling
540 metres returned gold intercepts up to 0.58 oz/t over 0.68 metres, 0.455 oz/t over 1.52 metres, 0.382
oz/t over 0.61 metres, and 1,009 oz/t over 0.45 metres.
<P>
A detailed 1988 airborne Aerodat VLF-EM and magnetometer survey outlined several conductors on the
Waratah claims.  The most significant anomalies coincide with the Iskut River and may not be suitable for
follow-up field work.  The survey did, however, clearly outline a dominant northwest-trending structural
trend.

<DT>05/01/96<DD>The Company reported that the planning for the mobilization of field crews for a spring and summer exploration program on the Waratah mineral claims has begun.  Reliance Geological Services of
North Vancouver has been engaged as the project geologists, and drilling contracts are currently being
negotiated.
<P>
The Waratah property consists of four mineral claims (80 units) in the Iskut River area of northwest BC.
The property is adjacent to the Snip deposit and near Johnny Mountain and Eskay Creek deposits.
Maple Mark International may earn a 50% undivided interest in the property by issuing to Royal Bay
Gold Corporation 500,000 shares and incurring exploration expenditures totalling $2,000,000 over the
next three years.

<DT>11/01/96<DD>Pursuant to a loan agreement dated August 27 1996, the company borrowed $125,000
at  7%  interest per year from Mitchell M. Paul. As additional consideration for
this loan, the company agreed to a 20% bonus payable in cash.

<DT>10/17/96<DD>Mr Donald Huston of NCC Mining along with Mr David Duval of Cordal Resources and Mr Robert Paul of Sarabat Gold report further to news release of September 10 1996, the companies have amended  the terms of the agreement for the Ogden township property.        
<P>                 
Pursuant to the terms of the revised agreement, Cordal has agreed  to  fund  the first  $100,000  of  exploration expenditures on the property and contribute one third of the total option payments owed by  Sarabat  and  NCC  to  the  original property vendors up to a maximum of $40,000.  The Ogden property consists of 51 claims and  is  six  kilometres  east  of  the Band-Ore discovery in the Timmins gold camp.

<DT>09/09/96<DD>NCC and Sarabat have entered into an agreement with Cordal whereby  Cordal  will
acquire from each of Sarabat and NCC a 16.5% interest in their Ogden property in the Porcupine mining division, Ontario. 
<P>
The Ogden property consists of 51  claims  and  is  6km  east  of  the  Band-Ore discovery in the Timmins gold camp along strike on the Destor/Porcupine fault.

NCC, the operator, has begun a ground geophysics program on the Ogden  property, results of which are expected to confirm the existence of anomalous targets that will be tested in the ensuing weeks by a diamond drill program.

<DT>09/06/96<DD>NCC Mining Corp and Sarabat Gold have commenced an exploration program on  their
51-claim  Ogden  township property in the prolific Timmins gold mining camp. The property is 6km along strike and to the east of  the  Band-Ore  discovery  which ranks as the most important gold find in the region for decades.        
<P>        
Significant drill results, including visible gold in drill core  on  a  property held  by  Black  Pearl  Resources  between  Band-Ore  and  NCC's  Ogden township property, suggests the presence of a major new gold trend that is only beginning to reveal its full potential.     
<P>

<DT>07/09/96<DD>NCC Mining  and  Sarabat  Gold  have  stopped  the  drilling  program  on  their
Whitney-Cody  township gold program in Timmins, Ontario. Five holes were drilled to a total footage of approximately 3000 feet.  The  company  has  now  received assay results on all five holes and have found 
that no economic intersections of gold  bearing  carbonates  were  encountered.  The   companies   will   continue exploration  programs  on their Ogden township and Whitney-Cody township claims

<DT>06/27/96<DD>NCC and Sarabat have completed the initial drill program of 1,000 metres on  the
Whitney-Cody  Township property at Timmins, Ontario. Drill holes No. 1 to 4 have been drilled to an average depth of 200 metres over a  strike  length  of  1,600 metres.  Geophysics  completed  to  date shows the conductive zone to be open at both ends of the grid. All four drill holes have intersected  substantial  zones
of sulphides varying 10 feet to 40 feet in widths.       
<P>                       
Drill hole No. 5 has been drilled to a depth of 200  metres  to  test  a  second geophysical  conductor  300  metres  to  the  west  of the main zone. Hole No. 5 encountered a parallel zone of heavy mineralization 45 feet wide.   The mineralized zones have now been submitted for assay with  ACCU  Laboratories
of Kirkland Lake, Ontario.

<DT>06/25/96<DD>The company  will  not  be  completing  the  brokered  special  warrant  private

<DT>11/11/96<DD>WHITE ROCK, B.C.--Sept. 26, 1996--Service Systems International is pleased to appoint Terry W. Neild to the board of directors of Service Systems International Ltd. (OTC/BB)
<P> 
Neild brings to the company his many years of organizational skills as well as his expertise in public financing. Neild will play an active roll in the future development of Service Systems.
<P>
Terry W. Neild is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer of Intercell Corp. (OTC/BB:INCE) which is based in Phoenix. He is responsible for the operations of that company, directing both its research and administrative divisions.
<P>
Neild has a strong background in finance and is a professional accountant. He has served as an executive with several Fortune 500 companies. Neild has successfully organized several companies which subsequently developed into organizations producing revenues in excess of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). 
<P>
Neild was co-founder of Clearly Canadian Beverage Corp., and served that company as chairman and chief executive officer. In addition, he has been a director of Camfrey Resources Ltd., Bay West Capital Corp., and MacNeill International Corp. He served as Vice President of Finance for North American Contractors Ltd., Barwell Development Corp., and Crest Realty and Development Inc.
<P>
Neild also served as Group Controller of MacMillan Bloedel, Ltd., and as a controller of Noranda/Northwood Group.
<P>
Service Systems International Ltd. has a world leading technology in ultraviolet (UV) disinfection systems. Marketing their products and systems under the tradename "UltraGuard"(TM), the company has sales representatives on four continents. 
<P>
UltraGuard(TM) utilizes proprietary low-pressure, high-intensity, high-efficiency ultraviolet lamps to disinfect large volumes of water such as sewage effluent, industrial waste water and potable water.

<DT>07/25/96<DD>The Company is pleased to announce that it has finalized an agreement whereby the Company will purchase a controlling interest in UV SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, INC. of Burnaby British Columbia, UV Systems Technology, Inc. is the proprietary owner of UltraGuard, which is a trade name for a unique group of environmentally friendly ultraviolet disaffection systems which are designed to disinfect large volumes of fluids which include but are not limited to; sewage effluent at municipal sewage treatment plants and municipal or commercial potable water systems.  The Company will henceforth own the proprietary world-wide patents and rights to UltraGuard systems, including manufacturing and marketing.  Details of the acquisition will be revealed to the shareholders over the next few weeks as they become available.
<P>
UltraGuard systems are designed patented low-pressure, high intensity ultraviolet lamps which are so efficient that they reduce operating costs 4 to 5 times in comparisons with their competitors latest lamp technology.  Power smart UltraGuard lamps are the only UV lamps on the market which can be modulated upward or downward on demand to effect the required kill of pathogens while at the same time saving energy.
<P>
Here is how a typical UltraGuard UV system works.  After sewage has passed through primary and secondary treatment to remove the solids, and prior to being dumped back into the environment via lake, ocean or waterway, the effluent (which is germ infected water) must be sterilized to deactivate the faecal coliforms.  The water enters the UltraGuard disinfection chamber through patented diffusers which are designed to guide the water uniformly through flow guides and into the reaction chamber where a one-half second contact with high intensity UV light damages the pathogens such that they cannot replicate.  The disinfected water then passes from the reaction chamber through a patented weir which controls the flow and exits safely into the environment.
<P>
UltraGuard systems have been developed over the past several years and are constantly being up-graded to ensure that they will remain the optimum disinfection system in the future.  One such improvement is the upgrading of their already superior ultraviolet lamp through a US lamp manufacturer in California.  a second innovation is a new electronic controller which greatly expands the functional capability of the UV lamps and system.
<P>
UltraGuard has just completed an installation at Chilliwack in British Columbia and has been awarded a contract for another sewage effluent disinfection system in the State of Washington.  The Company has several other sewage treatment contracts pending in California, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Ontario, Australia and England.
<P>
The Company has now completed the installation of ten UV potable water systems in Japan and had received orders for an additional ten.
<P>
Additional information will be forth-coming.

<P>
Incorporated in Nevada in 1990, the Company was founded for the purpose of selling, marketing and installing UltraGuard disinfection systems in the United States and Canada.  UV Systems Technology Inc. of Burnaby, British Columbia is the proprietary owner and manufacturer of UltraGuard lamps and systems.  UV Systems designs, engineers and manufactures ultraviolet disinfection and sterilization systems for wastewater and sewage effluent, food and beverage industry, fisheries and marine applications, farms, pharmaceutical, disaster relief units and portable water systems.  All UV lamps, products and systems are marketed under the UltraGuard trade name.
<P>
Ultraguard's new high-intensity ultraviolet lamps compete with older generation, low intensity, low pressure lamps such as the G64T5L which have been in use since the mid-seventies.  These lamps are for the most part ineffective in treating murky wastewater and sewage effluent due to the inability of low-intensity ultraviolet light penetrating murky fluids.  UltraGuard high-intensity, high-efficiency lamps produce ultraviolet light 50 to 60 times more intense than these lamps. In addition, for municipal applications, many low intensity lamps are required - often in the thousands, making their practical application unacceptable.  One UltraGuard lamp will replace 20 to 60 of the older variety lamps and can easily penetrate dark, murky fluids.
<P>
The UltraGuard, patented treatment module that incorporates each high-efficiency, high-intensity lamp forms the most advanced ultraviolet light treatment design available today.  Recent tests carried out on actual, real time, sewage effluent situations at West Langley Sewage Treatment Plant in Langley, BC were conducted by an independent testing agency, The BC Research Corporation.  Tests showed that fecal coliform bacteria in the effluent were dramatically reduced, in most cases to zero.  Of note is that the size of the population of the fecal coliform bacteria in the effluent indicates the degree of pathogenic contamination in the effluent.
<P>
The treatment level in an UltraGuard system can be as high as 2.4 billion litres per day (635,000 US gallons) per single lamp system, with a power consumption of about 10 kilowatt hours per million litres (265,000 US gallons) of effluent treated.  For a two-lamp system, the power consumption would be doubled.  Actual capacities depend upon the quality of the effluent.  Of special note is that the UltraGuard-developed lamp control system has a unique power saving feature in that the lamp intensity is regulated by the demands of the transmission (murkiness) of the fluid and the flow rate of the fluid, thus insuring optimum efficiency at all times.
<P>
The Ultraguard high-intensity, high-efficiency lamp operates at temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees centigrade which has two advantages over their older counterparts.  First, very little energy is expended in creating heat and therefore the lamp is more efficient. Second, and more important to operating the UltraGuard system, the lower operating temperature of the high-intensity, high-efficiency ultraviolet lamps along with some unique technical design features of the UltraGuard Flow System results in almost non-existent requirements and very low maintenance costs.
<P>
With UltraGuard's leading-edge technology, Service Systems International, Inc. is now poised to launch into the lucrative California market.  The system is more economical to install, more energy efficient, and less labor intensive after installation.  Sales of UltraGuard systems over the next few years should bring very substantial returns to investors.

<DT>10/22/96<DD>A contract has been signed to have a Dighem airborne  geophysical  survey  flown
over  the  3,000  hectare Silvia massive sulphide property in Mexico. The Silvia property is along the east border of the Mamatla mineral reserve presently being explored  by  Valerie  Gold Resources. Recent drilling by Valerie has identified volcanogenic gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper  massive  sulphide  mineralization  on
their  adjacent  property.  The  Dighem  geophysical  technique  is particularly effective in locating this type of mineralization.    
<P>                          
The airborne survey is being flown  in  conjunction  with  an  extensive  Dighem survey  being  conducted  by  Valerie.  The  program  will entail five frequency electromagnetic coverage, a magnetometer survey and a radiometric survey. Flying will  commence  in early November and is expected to generate targets for ground
followup by early 1997.

<DT>10/21/96<DD>A letter agreement dated September 9 1996 between Sultan and Mr  Ken  E.  Murray
whereby  Sultan  will  acquire  100%  in  the  Summit property comprised of four mineral units and one reverted crown grant, near Salmo, BC.

A letter agreement dated August 30 1996 between Sultan and Mr  Edward  B.  Hearn and Mr Howard Martin Hearn whereby Sultan will acquire 100% in the Boncher Crown granted claim, near Salmo, BC. 

<DT>10/10/96<DD>The company has completed  1,300  metres  of  surface  and  underground  diamond
drilling  in its continuing exploration program over the Jersey-Emerald property near Salmo, BC. Preliminary exploration drilling has  been  completed  over  the Bismuth   gold   zone,   the   Emerald   gold   zone,   and  the  Iron  Mountain copper-zinc-silver zone.      
<P>                                                  
<B>Bismuth Gold Zone</B>
<P>                                                               
Consistent gold values and mineralized widths  are  being  obtained  from  drill results  over  the  Bismuth  zone  which  parallels  the east limb of the Jersey lead-zinc orebody. Surface drill hole G96-5, a 200 metre step-out to  the  north of  previously  reported underground intersections in hole UG96-1, has confirmed
the continuation of this flat lying, 9.0 metre thick zone.
<P>
A review of the mine records for drilling completed in  the  1940's  and  1950's indicates  that this gold-rich sulphide zone was intersected in drill holes over a north-south distance of 1,100 metres. These  records  suggest  that  the  body follows  the  east  side  of the Jersey lead-zinc orebody and ranges from 1.2 to
18.0 metres in thickness. The former  drilling  was  done  for  lead,  zinc  and tungsten and therefore the holes were not assayed for gold or silver.  
<P>
<P>         
<B>Emerald Gold Zone</B>
<P>                                                               
Results of the recent program have also identified a second gold  enriched  zone along  the  west  limb  of  the  former Jersey lead-zinc orebody. This zone, the Emerald gold zone, was initially intersected in a 1994 drill hole and  has  been identified and sampled at three locations along a 600 metre, north-south, strike
length. The zone is narrow but persistent and dips east at  55  degrees.
<P>
Due to the lateral continuity with areas of high grade, this zone  will  require additional testing along strike and down dip.  
<P>
<P>                                
<B>Iron Mountain Zone</B>
<P>                                                              
The company has recently completed 600 metres of drilling in three holes along a 500  metre  section  of  the  Iron  Mountain zone. This 2.5km long by 1.0km wide copper-zinc-silver soil anomaly is in an overburden covered area, 1.5km east  of the  former  Jersey  mine.  All  three  holes intersected a laminated, 160 metre
thick, sulphide-rich schist sequence, carrying  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  sphalerite and  chalcopyrite.  Within  this  zone  zinc concentrations ranged from 0.15% to 0.65% and copper values  were  less  than  0.1%.  The  three  holes  demonstrate enormous   tonnage   potential   for   this  zone.  The  banded  nature  of  the
mineralization  is  encouraging  and  suggests  that   economically   important, sediment-hosted,   massive  sulphide  mineralization  may  occur  over  adjacent portions of the zone.         
<P>                                                  
Drilling  and  surface  exploration  is  continuing  and  in  response  to   the encouraging  results  to  date,  the  company  is  considering an expanded drill program.  <B>For complete assay results, please call the company in Vancouver. 

<DT>10/02/96<DD>The company has entered into option agreements to acquire the  rights  to  three
mineral  properties  near  Salmo,  BC.  The three properties are the Summit gold property, the Boncher tungsten property and the Jumbo No. 2  tungsten  property.  All  three are situated adjacent to mineralized zones on Sultan's Jersey-Emerald property. 
<P>                                                                      
The <B>Summit  gold  prospect</B>  is  comprised  of  five  mineral  claims   situated immediately  east  of  the Jersey lead-zinc property. This property has geologic formations similar to those found over the Jersey and Emerald mines  and  is  at the  south  end  of the historic Sheep Creek gold belt. Previous exploration has
located a north-south trending gold soil geochemical anomaly on the property and assays  up to 1.0 oz/t Au or greater have been obtained from a short adit at the north end of the property. Sultan can purchase a 100%  interest  in  the  Summit property. 
<P>
The <B>Boncher and Jumbo No. 2 tungsten  properties</B>  are  individual  crown  grants within   the   Jersey   claim  block  immediately  east  of  the  Iron  Mountain zinc-copper-silver geochemical anomaly. 
Under the terms of these agreements, Sultan can purchase a 100% interest in each of the crown grants.

<DT>09/26/96<DD>Further to the company news release of July 31 the company has closed a private placement with several private investors for the issue of 200,000 units at $2.00. Attached to each unit is a non-transferable warrant. Two such warrants will  entitle  the holder  to  purchase one additional common share for a two year period at $2.20.
<P>
This financing will be  a  combination  of  flow-through  and  non  flow-through shares.

<DT>08/30/96<DD>The exploration program over the company's Jersey-Emerald property near Salmo in
southeastern  BC is expanding rapidly following completion $400,000 financing in July.    A comprehensive news release can be found under the heading;<a href="../stockTALK/spr911.html"> Summer Drill Program</A> within the stockTALK Special Report section dated September 10, 1996

<DT>07/30/96<DD>The company has arranged a private placement of 200,000 units at $2.00. 
This financing will be a combination of flow through and non-flow though shares.  Proceeds will be used to continue work on the company's Jersey-Emerald  property in BC and for working capital.

<DT>07/26/96<DD>Further to the company news release of May 6 1996, the company  has  closed  the  private placement for the issue of 350,000 units at $0.85 to several investors including the president, Mr Frank A. Lang.  The  proceeds  are  being  used  to  continue  exploration  on   the   company's Jersey-Emerald property in BC and for working capital.

<DT>0/25/96<DD>The company has entered into option agreements to acquire the  rights  to  three
mineral  properties situated adjacent to and along strike from mineralization on Sultan's Jersey-Emerald property  near  Salmo,  BC.  All  three  properties  are showing  mineralization  consistent with that of the Jersey-Emerald property and extend Sultan's presence in this mineralized region of BC. The three  properties
are  the  Tungsten  King  zinc-lead-tungsten  property,  the  Truman  Hill  zinc property, and the Leroy North gold property.                                    
<P>
The company has commenced a 2,000m diamond drill program on  the  Jersey-Emerald property. The initial holes will attempt to confirm the sampling assays of up to 0.35 oz/ton gold and 4.0 oz/ton silver in the Bismuth-Gold zone target.         
 
<DT>07/16/96<DD>Underground diamond drilling has commenced at the  Jersey-Emerald  project  near
Salmo  in  southeastern  BC.  The  initial holes will test the Bismuth gold zone where previous underground sampling has returned assays up to 0.35  oz/ton  gold and  up  to 4.0 oz/ton silver. The present drill program will attempt to confirm the presence of this zone, and determine its width, strike, dip and average gold content.
<P>                                                                        
The Bismuth zone is a flat-lying gold and native bismuth enriched horizon  which overlies  the  former 
Jersey lead-zinc-silver deposit. The zone was intersected and recognized in several surface and underground holes drilled by  Placer-Dome, the  former  operator  of  the  mine. Because of low gold prices at the time the
intersections were not assayed for gold but drill logs suggest that the zone  is up  to  60 ft thick. Drill intersections are reported over a strike length of at least 2,000 ft suggesting potential for significant tonnage.                    
Mr Ed Lawrence of Westbank, BC has been contracted to supervise the  underground drilling  program.  
Mr  Lawrence was manager of the Jersey and Emerald mines for the last six years of mining operations.  
He  was  initially  employed  as  mine geologist  at  the  Jersey mine in 1962 and was promoted to the position or mine manager in 1968.

<DT>07/12/96<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 141,000 shares from escrow. There are
234,007 shares remaining in escrow.

<DT>07/09/96<DD>The company has signed a contract with Westgate Diamond Drilling  of  Salmo,  BC
for  a  minimum  of  5,000  feet  of  surface  diamond  drilling and 500 feet of underground drilling on its Jersey-Emerald  property  in  southeastern  BC.  The drill   program  will  test  the  Iron  Mountain  copper-zinc-silver  zone,  the Emerald-Leroy gold zone and the Bismuth gold zone.
<P>                              
In preparation for the underground drill program the Dodger 4200 and Jersey 4200 portals  have been reopened and the planned drill stations surveyed and prepared for drilling. Air quality and air flow testing has recently been  completed  and ventilation fans are presently being installed.                                 
Surface exploration  is  being  supervised  by  P&L  Geological  Consultants  of Smithers,  BC.  Geological  mapping,  soil  sampling and prospecting surveys are presently underway on the property, and more than 900 surface samples have  been sent  for  assay.  The  planned  network  of access roads required for the drill
program  have  been  completely  surveyed  in  and  subsequently  inspected   by government authorities. Road construction will begin shortly.               
<P>    
The principal target is the extensive  Iron  Mountain  zone  where  drilling  is expected  to  begin  in  early  August.  This  is  a 2.5-km-long and 1.3-km-wide copper-zinc-silver soil anomaly in an overburden covered area 1.5 km east of the former  Jersey mine.
<P>
Secondary drill targets are  the  Emerald-Leroy  and  Bismuth  gold  zones.  The Emerald-Leroy  anomaly  is a 2.5-km-long, north trending zone 1.0 km west of the Jersey mine. The zone is defined by anomalous gold  tungsten  and  arsenic  soil values.  The  1995 prospecting program obtained gold grades up to 0.89 oz/t from
this zone. The Bismuth zone is an underground gold target along the east side of the  Jersey  lead-zinc  deposit.  Previous  underground  sampling  programs have returned assays up to 0.35 oz/t gold and up to 4.0  oz/t  silver  across  narrow exposures of the Bismuth zone.

final results for  the  November  1995 geochemical  survey  completed  over  its Jersey-Emerald 
property near Salmo BC.
<P>
Results for the 1,600 sample survey confirm earlier reconnaissance work and show
three  distinct  metal  rich  targets  on  the  39  sq  km  property including a
previously unknown area  east  of  the  north/south  fault.  Mineralization  was
previously  thought to stop at the fault. The three zones are referred to as the
Iron Mountain copper-zinc-silver zone; the Emerald-Leroy gold-tungsten zone and;
the Jersey lead-zinc zone.  For complete results please contact the company's investor
relation group.                                                      
<P>
Due to the size and magnitude of the anomalies discovered  by  this  recent
work program the company is currently re-assessing its options for the property.
Follow-up work is expected to commence as soon as the property is snow free.    

<DT>01/17/96<DD> On December 6 1995 directors and employees were granted 
options on 38,000 shares at $0.35, expiring December 6 2000.

<DT>12/13/95<DD>The Company has closed a private placement of 305,000 units at $0.40 representing $122,000.  Of the 305,000 units, 170,000 are flow through and have a non-transferable one year purchase warrant attached.  Two warrants entitle the holder to purchase an additional share at $0.50.  The balance of 135,000 units are non-flow through and have a non-transferable purchase warrant.  Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional  share for one year at $0.50, if exercised within the first year and $0.60, if
exercised within the second year.  The Company may receive an additional $110,000 if the warrants are
exercised within the first year.  A finder's fee of $800 has been paid to Midland Walwyn.

<DT>11/24/95<DD>In the third quarter ended September 30, 1995, the Company reported the following updated activities: Jersey-Emerald Gold Property, Salmo, B.C.: A surface exploration program was recently completed over the Company's Jersey-Emerald gold property five miles south of Salmo, B.C.  The program involved a soil geochemical survey, reconnaissance magnetometer survey and prospecting. The exploration program initially focused on two large untested airborne geophysical targets discovered in 1994.  Due to very encouraging results, the field program was expanded to cover more than half of the 30 sq. km.
property.  Final results for the soil geochemical survey are expected in early December, but results to date
show several areas of highly anomalous metal concentrations over a 9 sq. km. area centred on the former
Jersey lead-zinc mine.  Elements that show enrichment within this area are gold, sliver, copper, lead, zinc,
molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth and barium.  Three distinct targets have now been identified within this
very large area.  These are the Bismuth gold zone, the Leroy gold zone, and the Iron Mountain copper-
silver-zinc zone.  The Bismuth gold zone is a gold and bismuth enriched horizon situated within a few
metres of the former 8,000,000 ton Jersey lead-zinc deposit.  This zone was discovered in 1993 in
underground exposure 150 metres below surface in the former lead-zinc workings.  In 1994, an assay of
0.18 oz/ton gold and 2.0 oz/ton silver across 2.55 metres was obtained from a diamond drill hole that did
not wholly penetrate the zone.  Drill logs from the former lead-zinc mine suggest that this zone could be
up to 15 metres (50 feet) thick.  Geochemical sampling has now discovered a gold and bismuth soil
anomaly nearly 1 km. north of the underground exposure of the Bismuth zone, suggesting that the zone
may be exposed at surface in this area.  The Leroy gold zone is approximately 1 km. west of the former
Jersey mine.  Gold mineralization was first reported here in the 1890's but exploration ceased when lead
mining commenced in 1910.  In 1993, a chip sample taken from one of the old prospect pits assayed
0.174 oz/ton gold across 3.0 metres.  Several surface grab samples taken while prospecting this area in
1995 have returned assays of greater than 0.25 oz/ton gold.  The Leroy zone is now believed to be
associated with a north trending structure that is more than 1 km. in length.  The Iron Mountain copper-
silver-zinc zone is approximately 1 km. each of the Jersey lead-zinc deposit.  A Dighem airborne survey
flow in 1994 discovered a 1.5 km. long magnetic anomaly associated with an FM conductor in this area.
Soil geochemical sampling completed in 1995 has found highly anomalous copper, silver and zinc
concentrations over this area.  The anomaly is at least 800 metres long and 600 metres wide, but it is open
in three directions.  Results of the recently completed soil sampling survey are expected to provide a
better understanding of this zone.  
<P>
Dawson Claims, Yukon: The Company has a 50% interest in the Dawson 80 Pup property 20 km. southeast of Dawson City, Yukon in the Klondike gold camp.  The property was explored with five short diamond drill holes by Kennecott Canada in 1994.  Diamond drilling intersected important hydrothermal alteration with anomalous arsenic, molybdenum and zinc concentrations but gold values were low.  Kennecott has since dropped its option on the claims.  
<P>
Cone Hill Claims, B.C.: In 1994, Valerie Gold Resources completed a 10,000-foot drill program over the Company's Cone Hill copper-gold property near Williams Lake, B.C., just 5 km. north of the 960-million ton Fish Lake deposit of Taseko Mines.  On completion of the program, Valerie was vested with a 60% interest in the property.  Drilling intersected zones of pyrite and alteration along the margins of two granodiorite-porphyry, intrusive bodies.  Copper and gold assays were sub-economic in all holes, but the results showed values increasing to the east.  The Company's geologists have suggested that geochemical and geophysical coverage should be extended to cover the northeast portion of the property. 
<P>
Mexico Claims: The Company is still proceeding with the acquisition of an option on the Silvia 1 mineral
claim, approximately 200 km. southwest of Mexico City on the boundary between the states of Mexico
and Guerrero.  The claim is adjacent to the northeast boundary of the large Mamatia mineral reserve held
by Valerie Gold de Mexico, SA de CA.  Recent exploration by Valerie has demonstrated potential for
stratiform, volcanic massive sulphide, lead-zinc silver-gold mineralization on the adjoining property.
The Company is continuing with its strategy of searching for world-class mineral properties in accessible
areas with short-term production potential.

<DT>11/24/95<DD>In the third quarter ended September 30, 1995, the
Company reported the following updated activities:
<P>
<B>Jersey-Emerald Gold Property, Salmo, B.C.:</B> A surface exploration
program was recently completed over the Company's Jersey-Emerald gold
property five miles south of Salmo, B.C.  The program involved a soil
geochemical survey, reconnaissance magnetometer survey and prospecting.
The exploration program initially focused on two large untested airborne
geophysical targets discovered in 1994.  Due to very encouraging
results, the field program was expanded to cover more than half of the
30 sq. km. property. Final results for the soil geochemical survey are
expected in early December, but results to date show several areas of
highly anomalous metal concentrations over a 9 sq. km. area centred on
the former Jersey lead-zinc mine.  Elements that show enrichment within
this area are gold, sliver, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten,
bismuth and barium.  Three distinct targets have now been identified
within this very large area.  These are the Bismuth gold zone, the Leroy
gold zone, and the Iron Mountain copper- silver-zinc zone.  The Bismuth
gold zone is a gold and bismuth enriched horizon situated within a few
metres of the former 8,000,000 ton Jersey lead-zinc deposit.  This zone
was discovered in 1993 in underground exposure 150 metres below surface
in the former lead-zinc workings.  In 1994, an assay of 0.18 oz/ton gold
and 2.0 oz/ton silver across 2.55 metres was obtained from a diamond
drill hole that did not wholly penetrate the zone.  Drill logs from the
former lead-zinc mine suggest that this zone could be up to 15 metres
(50 feet) thick.  Geochemical sampling has now discovered a gold and
bismuth soil anomaly nearly 1 km. north of the underground exposure of
the Bismuth zone, suggesting that the zone may be exposed at surface in
this area.  The Leroy gold zone is approximately 1 km. west of the
former Jersey mine.  Gold mineralization was first reported here in the
1890's but exploration ceased when lead mining commenced in 1910.  In
1993, a chip sample taken from one of the old prospect pits assayed
0.174 oz/ton gold across 3.0 metres.  Several surface grab samples taken
while prospecting this area in 1995 have returned assays of greater than
0.25 oz/ton gold.  The Leroy zone is now believed to be associated with
a north trending structure that is more than 1 km. in length.  The Iron
Mountain copper- silver-zinc zone is approximately 1 km. each of the
Jersey lead-zinc deposit.  A Dighem airborne survey flow in 1994
discovered a 1.5 km. long magnetic anomaly associated with an FM
conductor in this area. Soil geochemical sampling completed in 1995 has
found highly anomalous copper, silver and zinc concentrations over this
area.  The anomaly is at least 800 metres long and 600 metres wide, but
it is open in three directions.  Results of the recently completed soil
sampling survey are expected to provide a better understanding of this
zone.
<P>
<B>Dawson Claims, Yukon:</B> The Company has a 50% interest in
the Dawson 80 Pup property 20 km. southeast of Dawson City, Yukon in the
Klondike gold camp.  The property was explored with five short diamond
drill holes by Kennecott Canada in 1994.  Diamond drilling intersected
important hydrothermal alteration with anomalous arsenic, molybdenum and
zinc concentrations but gold values were low. Kennecott has since
dropped its option on the claims.
<P>
<B>Cone Hill Claims, B.C.:</B> In 1994, Valerie Gold Resources completed
a 10,000-foot drill program over the Company's Cone Hill copper-gold
property near Williams Lake, B.C., just 5 km. north of the 960-million
ton Fish Lake deposit of Taseko Mines.  On completion of the program,
Valerie was vested with a 60% interest in the property.  Drilling
intersected zones of pyrite and alteration along the margins of two
granodiorite-porphyry, intrusive bodies.  Copper and gold assays were
sub-economic in all holes, but the results showed values increasing to
the east.  The Company's geologists have suggested that geochemical and
geophysical coverage should be extended to cover the northeast portion
of the property.
<P>
<B>Mexico Claims:</B> The Company is still proceeding with the
acquisition of an option on the Silvia 1 mineral claim, approximately
200 km. southwest of Mexico City on the boundary between the states of
Mexico and Guerrero. The claim is adjacent to the northeast boundary of
the large Mamatia mineral reserve held by Valerie Gold de Mexico, SA de
CA.  Recent exploration by Valerie has demonstrated potential for
stratiform, volcanic massive sulphide, lead-zinc silver-gold
mineralization on the adjoining property. The Company is continuing with
its strategy of searching for world-class mineral properties in
accessible areas with short-term production potential.

<DT>11/20/95<DD>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has accepted for filing,
subject to the transaction closing no later than 45 days from October
17, 1995, a private placement of 305,000 shares of which 170,000 are
flow-through at $0.40 per share; 170 flow-through shares having 170,000
warrants attached.  Two such warrants entitle the holder to purchase one
share at $0.50 for a one year period; 135,000 non-flow-through shares
having 135,000 warrants attached.  Each warrant entitles the holder to
purchase one share at $0.50 in the first year and at $0.60 in the second
year.  The placees are Richard Abraham 25,000; Tony Kana 25,000; Frank
A. Lang 22,500; and 19 others.  A finder's fee of $800 is payable to
Midland Walwyn.

<DT>10/13/95<DD>The Company has engaged the services of Peter E. Walcott &
Associates of Vancouver to establish a 75 line-kilometre geochemical grid
over its Jersey-Emerald gold property near Salmo in southeastern British
Columbia.  The geochemical grid will cover nearly half of the property and
represent a major expansion of a reconnaissance exploration program that is
under the supervision of P & L Exploration Services of Smithers, B.C.  The
continuing reconnaissance program has now shown several areas of highly
anomalous metal concentrations over a 9 square kilometre area centred on the
former Jersey mine. Elements that show enrichment within this area are gold,
silver, lead, zinc, copper, molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth and barium. 
Reconnaissance soil sampling has recently located a gold soil anomaly along
a major north-trending fault that marks the east margin of the Jersey
ore-body.  This anomaly may represent the south end of the Bismuth zone and
is situated nearly 1.5 km south of the bismuth rich gold anomaly reported in
a news release on September 14, 1995.  Recent prospecting has extended the
Leroy gold zone an additional 800 metres to the south suggesting a strike
length in excess of 1 kilometre.  As reported earlier, quartz boulders in
this zone have returned assays up to 0.898 oz/ton gold.  The expanded
geochemical survey will be followed up by a ground geophysical survey.  Both
programs are to be completed by the end of November.  This work is expected
to define targets for a planned winter drill program.

<DT>10/12/95<DD>Further to the October 3, 1995 private placement to several
investors at $0.40 per share, the Company announced the increase of the
total number of shares to 300,000 shares at $0.40 per share; 170,000 shares
will be flow-through.  A finder's fee of $800 is payable to Midland Walwyn.

<DT>10/03/95<DD>The Company arranged a private placement with several
private investors for the issue of up to 250,000 common shares at $0.40 per
share.  87,500 shares will each have attached a non-transferable share
purchase warrant, each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one
additional share for a two-year period at $0.50 in the first year and $0.60
in the second year.  The remaining 162,500 shares will be flow through with
a one year warrant attached, two such warrants entitling the holder to
purchase one additional share at $0.50.  The proceeds will be used to
conduct the geochemical, geophysical and prospecting programs on the
Jersey-Emerald gold property.

<DT>09/13/95<DD>The company recently contracted a company to carry out a two
- phase surface exploration program over its Jersey-Emerald gold property
near Salmo in southeastern B.C.  The phase I program is now complete and has
involved prospecting, reconnaissance soil geochemical sampling and
reconnaissance magnetometer coverage.  The work was carried out over two
large untested airborne geophysical targets adjacent to, and striking
parallel to, the former Jersey lead-zinc-silver mine.  Elsewhere on the
property prospecting has discovered a gossanous area believed to be the
surface extension of the Bismuth zone. The zone is approximately 1km north
of the underground exposure of the Bismuth zone which yielded gold assays
from previous soil tests.  Due to the success achieved to date the company
plans to immediately undertake an expanded geochemical sampling and
prospecting program.

<DT>08/18/95<DD>The B.C. Ministry of Mines has granted the Company an
exploration permit to carry out surface exploration on its Jersey-Emerald
Gold Property, Salmo, B.C.  Exploration will initially focus on two, large,
untested airborne geophysical targets located adjacent to and striking
parallel to the former Jersey lead-zinc-silver mine operated by Placer-Dome
Ltd. from 1947 to 1972.  Placer did not investigate the gold potential of
the property.  In 1994 & 1995, Sultan Minerals carried out surface and
airborne exploration surveys on other sections of the property.  The
exploration included surface sampling and the completion of 4300 feet of
diamond drilling.  Significant gold showings have been found in the initial
assay results.

<DT>08/03/95<DD>The Company filed a notice of work with the B.C. Ministry of Mines to immediately commence surface
exploration on the Jersey-Emerald property located near Salmo, B.C.  This work is expected to define
targets for a planned surface and underground diamond drill program to be carried out in the fall and
and winter of 1995.

<DT>07/04/95<DD>The Company has cancelled a private placement of 200,000
common shares at $0.50 per share as announced in Stockwatch on June 2, 1995.

<DT>06/05/95<DD>The VSE has approved a pro rata release of 50% from escrow
in the amount of 375,000 shares. There are now 375,000 shares remaining in
escrow. for the acquisition of 100% interest in two mineral licenses in the
Voisey Bay area of Labrador.

<DT>03/16/95<DD>The Company is making arrangements to acquire an 85%
interest in the SILVIA Mineral Claims, located approximately 200 kilometres
southwest of Mexico City on the boundary between the states of Mexico and
Guerrero, Mexico.

<DT>03/13/95<DD>The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr.
Arthur G. Troup, P. Eng., to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troup has been
providing geological services to Sultan Minerals Inc. And associated
companies for fifteen years.

<DT>02/06/95<DD>The Company has completed its surface diamond drill program
over the Jersey-Emerald Gold property near Salmo, B.C.  In total 4,341 feet
of NQ diamond drilling in 11 holes was completed during the program.  The
drill program focused on testing stratiform gold targets associated with the
Emerald Tungsten and Jersey Lead-zinc zones.  Significant gold assays were
obtained over both zones.

<DT>01/19/95<DD>The Company has contracted Peter E. Wallcott & Associates to
complete a 5.0 km I.P(induced polarization) survey over its Jersey-Emerald
gold property near Salmo, B.C.  The survey will attempt to trace the Bismuth
Gold Zone in order to assist in determining drill targets for the present
drill program.

<DT>12/19/94<DD>The Company has now completed nine surface diamond drill
holes on its Jersey-Emerald gold property, near Salmo, B.C.  Drilling has
been temporarily halted pending a review of the results obtained to date.
Work is expected to resume in January.  Significant gold assays were
obtained in three holes.

<DT>11/14/94<DD>The Company reported that the first diamond drill hole has
now been completed on its Jersey-Emerald gold property near Salmo, B.C.

<DT>11/07/94<DD>The diamond drilling program on the Company's Jersey-Emerald
property will commence on November 8, 1994.  The Company plans to drill a
total of seven holes of which three holes are to test the strike extension
of the Emeral Tungsten zone where recent sampling has returned values as
high as 0.25 oz./ton gold.  The other four holes will test three conductors
discovered by a Dighem airborne geophysical survey completed in January
1994.

<DT>10/13/94<DD>The Company announced that it has arranged a flow-through
private placement with several private investors for the issue of up to
350,000 common shares at a price of $0.60 per share.  Each common share is
to have a non-transferable share purchase warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one- half (1/2) additional common share for a two year
period at a price of $0.60 in the first year and $0.65 in the second year. 
The proceeds from the private placement will be used to commence a 5,000
foot diamond drill program on the company's Jersey-Emerald property, near
Salmo, B.C.

<DT>08/27/94<DD>Kennecott Canada Inc. Commenced diamond drilling on August
20, 1994 to test bulk tonnage gold targets on the 80 Pup property, jointly
owned by Arbor Resources (50%) and Sultan Minerals (50%). Located between
Preido Hill and Paradise Hill in the Hunker Creek area of the Klondike, the
80 Pup Property, the site of large scale placer gold mining, is subject to
an agreement whereby Kennecott Canada Inc. can earn a 55% interest by
spending $1.0 million by December 31, 1996.  Arbor, Sultan and Harvey/437821
would share equally in the remaining 45% interest in the 80 Pup property
upon Kennecott fulfilling the terms of its option.

<P>
As of September, 1995, Sultan Minerals Inc. has completed surface and
airborne exploration surveys and 4,300 feet of diamond drilling on its
Jersey-Emerald Property located five miles south of Salmo, B.C.  With the
granting of an exploration permit by the B.C. Ministry of Mines, the Company
will carry out prospecting and ground geophysical and geochemical surveys. 
This work will define targets for a surface and underground diamond drill
program planned for the Fall and Winter of 1995.  The Jersey lead-zinc mine
and the adjacent Emerald tungsten mine were operated by Placer-Dome Ltd.
from 1947 to 1972 but Placer did not investigate the gold potential of the
property.  In 1972, both mines were closed due to low metal prices.  Sultan
Minerals acquired the property in 1993 and has identified three stratiform
gold-bearing horizons in the vicinity of the former lead-zinc and tungsten
workings.  Assays obtained during the 1993 exploration program range from
0.18 oz./ton gold and 2.0 oz./ton silver across 8.4 feet near the Jersey
mine, to .99 oz./ton gold and 1.0 oz./ton silver across 3.0 feet near the
Emerald zone.

<B>Jersey-Emerald Mine</B>
<P>
The Company has an option to acquire 100% interest in the Jersey and Emerald
lead, zinc and tungsten mines located near Salmo in southeastern B.C.  The
two mines were operated by Placer-Dome Ltd. from 1947 to 1972. In 1993,
Sultan Minerals Inc. acquired the property and undertook to explore its
potential for gold mineralization.  In 1994 -1995, Sultan carried out
surface and airborne exploration surveys and 4,300 feet of diamond drilling
on the property and identified three zones of stratiform gold
mineralization.  Underground drilling is required to further explore the
mineralization discovered.  Several large, untested surface targets remain
to be explored on the property.
<P>
<B>Dawson Claims</B>
<P>
Sultan Minerals has a 505 interest in the Dawson 80 Pup Property located in
the historic Klondike gold camp near Dawson City, Yukon.  The property was
drill tested by Kennecott Canada Inc. in 1994.  Diamond drilling intersected
important hydro thermal alteration with anomalous arsenic, molybdenum and
zinc concentrations but gold values were low.  Kennecott is planning
additional exploration in 1995.
<P>
<B>Other Projects</B>
<P>
Sultan Minerals Inc. Holds 100% interest in the Ahbau Creek copper-gold
property located aproximately 25 km north of Quesnel, B.c.  The Company also
holds a 40% interest in the Cone Hill copper-gold property located 5 km
north of the 960 million ton Fish Lake deposit of Taseko Mines Ltd. near
Williams Lake, B.C.  Both Ahbau Creek and Cone Hill are porphyry copper-gold
prospects that have received preliminary exploration programs.  Some 50,000
tons of mineralization grading 0.30 oz./ton gold equivalent have been
indicated by previous drilling on the Ahbau Creek property.

<font size=+1>To Raise US$ 66 Million & Receives Loan</font size>
<P>
<P>
The VSE has accepted an agreement in  which  BZW  Mining Metals  Group,  a  division  of  Barclays  Bank PLC of London, will assist Banff Resources Ltd, Kasese Cobalt Company Ltd and LaSource Compagnie Miniere  SAS  to negotiate  and obtain US$66,000,000 in debt financing from institutional lenders for the Kasese project. 
<P>
LaSource Compagnie Miniere SAS, the controlling shareholder of the company,  has made  available  to  the company a demand loan facility of up to $7,900,000. The loan facility consolidates previous advances to the company  and  Kasese  Cobalt Company  by  LaSource  of  9,936,000 francs up to and including July 5 1996. the closing date of the acquisition by the company of a 55% interest in Kasese,  and of  12,352,000  francs  from July 6 1996 to September 30 1996 in connection with the continued work on the development of the Kasese project and on  the  Kilembe mine  feasibility  study. As at September 30 1996, the remaining undrawn portion of the loan facility was $2,000,000.                                            I

<font size=+1>Progress Report of Liphichi Property - Western Bolivia</font size>
<P>
<P>
A progress report is provided on the stage one exploration program currently  in progress  on  the  Liphichi property in the Altiplano region of Western Bolivia.  The company has the right to earn up to a 70% working interest in  the  Liphichi property.             
<P>                                                          
Past mining activities on the Liphichi property can be followed over a length of more  than  three  kilometres along the strike of the mineralization zone and in several levels of extensive adits spread over a vertical distance of  more  than 150  metres. These mining activities historically followed high grade zones. The stage one underground sampling program recently completed by the company focused on  the  adits  near  the  Liphichi  River  Valley.  The  assay  results for the underground channel samples from  cross-cuts  of  three  vertically  overlapping adits can be obtained by phoning the company.
 <P>
A diamond drill program is presently under way on the  property  to  define  the mineralization  zone.  Two  diamond drills are presently working on the property with the first (110 metres) hole having been completed near the  Liphichi  River Valley.  The drill core from the first hole is well mineralized to art 80 metres depth displaying abundant quartz vein-network  and  sulphide,  and  with  lesser quartz  veining  and sulphide mineralization to the end of the hole. Split cores from the hole have  been  submitted  for  assay  and  results  are  expected  in approximately two weeks. It is expected that detailed sampling from other levels of adits and along the strike, as well as drilling in progress will  extend  the mineralized  zone  along the strike and to depth which will enable a preliminary reserve evaluation to be calculated.

<font size=+1>Successful Set-up of Production Facilities </font size>

Despite the inevitable subzero temperatures and early  snow  accumulation  which signify  the  end  of  the Placer mining season in the Cariboo, Gallery has been successful in the completion of its state of the art, 150 cubic yards  per  hour production facility at its Cariboo placer gold property.       
<P>                
This facility was constructed between September and October 20, and consists  of a derocker, screen deck and circular jigs. Prior to the winter weather shutdown, 200 yards of material were processed from the company's Slade pit area.      
<P>   
The company is  now  confident  that  its  processing  facility  is  capable  of processing  over  2,200  cubic  yards  a day. The company's technical staff have spent the summer implementing a multi-phase exploration  program  consisting  of refraction seismic surveys, reverse circulation drilling and bulk testing, which have been successful in the  preliminary  identification  of  large  volumes  of deeply buried, potentially-rich tertiary gold-bearing gravels, and large volumes of lower grade, glacial bench gravels.              
<P>                            
The company is looking for an exceptional, full season of gold production and  a positive cash flow in 1997.

<font size=+1>Requires 100% interest in Manitoba Claims</font size>
<P>
<P>
The company has signed an agreement to acquire a 100% undivided interest  in  18 mineral  claims  in  Manitoba.  The claim are in the Little Bear Lake region 100 miles northeast of Winnipeg.
<P> 
The Little Bear Lake property  was  previously  explored  by  several  companies including  Highwood  Resources  which  adopted  a regional exploration approach, establishing an extensive grid system  and  conducting  ground  geophysics.  The geophysical  program  identified several large conductors ranging up to one mile in length which are interpreted to be mineralized shear zones with the potential to host bulk tonnage gold deposits.    
<P>                                         
Several high grade  gold  and  silver-bearing  quartz  veins  exist  within  the company's claim boundaries and these occur in highly deformed, intensely altered rocks of  variable  composition.  Aerial  photography  has  also  confirmed  the existence of large cross-cutting structures on the property.   
<P>          
The company intends to implement a geophysical program over the entire  property in  the  next few months. The existing grid system will be improved and expanded to enable correlation of previous trenching  and  other  sampling  results  with targets  defined  by  the  upcoming  geophysical program. Initial exploration is
scheduled to begin in February or March in advance of a major  diamond  drilling program.

The Silvia property is along the east border of the Mamatla mineral reserve presently being explored  by  Valerie  Gold Resources. Recent drilling by Valerie has identified volcanogenic gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper  massive  sulphide  mineralization  on
their  adjacent  property.  Flying will  commence  in early November and is expected to generate targets for ground followup by early 1997.

<font size=+1>Results from Port Cartier Property, Quebec</font size>
<P>
<P>
The  company  has  received  the  results  of  a  recently   completed   BeepMat prospecting,  blasting  and  sampling  program at its Port Cartier property 50km west of Sept-Iles, Quebec. 
<P>
The survey was intended to provide definitive  ground positioning  for airborne geophysical conductors within a favourable anorthosite complex known to host anomalous copper-nickel-cobalt bearing pyroxene zones.    
The focus of the company's program was an area measuring  400  metres  by  1,800 metres  near  the  northeastern  portion of the company's claim holdings. Within this area conductors  and  conductor  groupings  had  been  identified  trending northeast  from  the  previously identified B-20 showing. Test pits were blasted
and sampled along conductors, with the most significant results from  five  test pits   containing   semi-massive   to  massive  sulphides  associated  with  the westernmost conductor grouping. Here, sulphide mineralization continues  beneath overburden  outside  the  immediate  test  pit  areas (1-2 metres), making width estimates difficult without additional trenching or drilling.    
<P>               
Reconnaissance sampling at the company's Lac Mora property, 120km north  of  the Port  Cartier  property and near the eastern shore of Lake Manicouagan, returned results of up to 1.10% copper, 1.22% nickel and 0.15% cobalt from  grab  samples of  sulphide  horizons.  The  Lac Mora property is on the northwest flank of the staking rush  sparked  by  the  recent  Quebec  government  copper-nickel-cobalt discovery near Lac Manitou on Quebec's north shore.  
<P>                           
The Port Cartier property consists of 246  claims  and  the  Lac  Mora  property comprises  18  claims.  The  company  will be seeking joint venture partners for these 100% owned properties.

<font size=+1>Sales Program Update & Europeon Joint Venture</font size>
<P>
<P>
During 1996, the  company  launched  a  local  sales  program  with  its  unique advertising  medium,  TransActionMedia,  to  address  the  advertising  needs of retailers surrounding the company's contracted chains. These cost effective  and locally  targeted  ad  messages were initially published on the receipt tapes of Food Lion stores in the Carolinas. This will build a  local  marketing  presence
for  the  company.  The  company  believes that further chains can be brought on board and different message delivery systems can augment such a  local  program.
<P>
Initial sales figures are encouraging and future expansion is expected.   
<P>
As previously announced, the company has completed its first run of  advertising on  the  back  of  SwissRail  tickets  in  Switzerland.  In  1997 SwissRail will celebrate its 150th year of operations. Because of this, many  advertisers  will be  implementing  promotional  programs and the company expects to tap into this
opportunity. 
<P>
The company has established  two  operating  partnerships,  one  in Switzerland and one in France, owned 51% by the company. The corporate objective of allying the company with other organizations of proven success and  expertise in areas which complement the company will be duplicated as expansion continues.
The company's partner, NCR Corp, is the dominant supplier of transaction receipt forms in Europe.

<font size=+1>To commence <B>Waterflood Program</B> - at a cost of US$ 144,000</font size>
<P>
<P>
The company, in concert with its working interest partners  on  the  Eight  MileFlat  field  in Uintah County, Utah, will enter into a waterflood program on its wells in order to increase production.    
<P>                                      
It appears that the reservoirs have good  sustainable  oil  producing  life  and inflow  into  the  well  bore  remains  the major issue. After several months of monitoring the wells  and  flow  rates  and  following  discussions  with  other operators  in  the  area recommendations have been made to commence a waterflood
program.    
<P>                                                                    
The 4-2 well consistently produces about 20 bopd with little or no water and  is capable of producing reasonable rates from the lower perforations since the well pressure remains high and undepleted. In addition, the well produces  sufficient gas  to  run the pumping units and heaters and when combined with other wells in the field the company would have excess gas to run the entire field.  Therefore, the  company  has agreed to expend the funds necessary to clean out the existing perforations, dissolve the asphaltenes and paraffins that  are  present  in  the well  bore  and perforate certain upper zones to correlate with the perforations
in the 4-3 well in the Lower Green River  formation.  The  net  result  of  this program should be to increase production to about 100 bopd.          
<P>           
The 4-3 well, which is also maintaining pressure, is currently shut-in and  will be   converted  to  a  water  injection  well.  Although  initial  results  were encouraging, the well now produces only about one  bopd  when  allowed  to  run.  Because  there  are  common  sand bodies between the wells, the wells provide an
ideal candidate for a waterflood project. A significant increase  in  production in  the  4-2 well should be achieved once water injection rates are sustained in the 4-3 well which will take about one to two months to realize.     
<P>           
The 4-2 well has been petrophysically evaluated to have 14m of conventional  pay from  seven  zones within the lower Green River formation. Five of the zones are correlatable to the initial and offsetting well and  are  amenable  to  pressure maintenance  via a waterflood program. The company estimates primary reserves of
this well to be 70,000 barrels based on a 5% recovery  efficiency  and  40  acre drainage.  An  additional  11m  of  unconventional  oil pay is seen in fractured siltstones and fractured argillaceous carbonates in four other  zones.  Although the  North  Bonanza  field  produces from such fractured siltstones, no reserves
have yet been attributed to these zones.          
<P>                              
Waterflood analogs from the adjacent Monument Butte and other Green River fields indicate that primary recovery can be increased by an additional 2.5 times which would increase the ultimate recoverable reserves of the Federal 4-2  to  175,000 barrels.                                   
<P>                                   
It is expected that work on this project will commence about October 14 1996 and will  require  approximately  three  weeks for completion at a total cost to the partners of about US$144,000. This will allow for conversion of the 4-3  into  a water  injection  well,  recompletion  of  the  4-2  well  in the sands that are considered to be behind pipe, install a tri-plex water injection  pump  and  lay about  four  miles of poly piping from the Green River to bring water to the 4-3 well.

<font size=+1>Drill Results From Mexican Property</font size>
<P>
<P>
The the results from  the  recently  completed  6  hole  diamond  drill  programcompleted  on the Guadalupana property, near the village of Potrero de Bojorquez in southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico have been received.        
<P>                   
The Guadalupana mine has a production  history  dating  back  to  the  Spaniards searching for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains in the 1700's. During the early 1940's the property operated for several years as a high  grade  copper-tungsten producer,  with  production  being  derived  from at least three high grade vein
systems up to 5  metres  in  width.  Since  the  company's  acquisition  of  the property, exploration efforts have concentrated on the potential of developing a large, open pit polymetallic  porphyry  deposit  within  a  1.5  X  3  kilometre alteration  zone surrounding the old workings. To date, a total of 10 widespread
drill holes have been completed within a 1 X 1.5 kilometre portion of this zone. Results from the first four holes were previously released. The latest six holes combined with the earlier results indicate an  overall  grade  of  approximately 0.02  opt  gold equivalent, with a significant number of sections above 0.08 opt
equivalent.  For complete drill results on this Mexican property, please call the company.                                   
<P>                                                                               
In addition, the property is now in a position to enable production of a limited tonnage of high grade copper ore with significant gold and silver, values. Based on the strength of these encouraging results, the company intends to advance the pace of exploration over the coming months.

The Company reports encouraging zinc-lead mineralization has  been  obtained  from  a  recent  drill
program  on  the  company's New Brunswick Tower Group claims. The property is 60 kilometres from Bathurst and 15 kilometres  from  the  Caribou  zinc-lead-silver deposit currently being prepared for production.   
<P>                             
An initial hole, CDC-96-1, designed to test a  geological  theory  developed  by examining  previous  exploration  data,  undercut two holes completed during the 1970's and succeeded in extending the  mineralized  zone  beneath  the  area  of previous drilling.  Complete drill core results are available from the company on both the initial drill hole <B>CDC-96-1</B> and  the second hole <B>CDC-96-2</B>, which extended  the  mineralization  to  the north of the previous drilling.                                                 
<P>                                                                                
A third hole, drilled 100 metres south of the initial hole cored strong chlorite alteration.  The current program has indicated that the zone, which has a strike length of at least 170 metres, is open to the north along strike as well  as  to depth.

An agreement has been reached regarding the acquisition of a  100%  interest  in the Goldnote property, in Pershing County, Nevada. This gold property covers 686 acres and includes two former producers. One of  these  is  the  Goldnote  mine, which  has  over  3.5  miles  of underground workings developed on at least five different veins and produced ore early in the century that graded 0.75  oz/t  Au and  12.0 oz/t Ag. 
<P>
A second set of old workings consisting of four adits  occurs  in  the  southern portion  of  the  property.  Here  a  shallow  dipping  zone, or zones, has been measured at 9 ft true thickness and has returned values of  0.136  oz/t  Au  and 1.97 oz/t Ag.

<font size=+1>Complete Initial Exploration on Indonesian Property</font size>
<P>
<P>
The Company's reports that they have completed  initial reconnaissance exploration of the South Kelian prospect on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia. The prospect comprises of 16,830 ha  50km  south  of  the Kelian  mine  (which  has  reported  annual  production of 450,000 oz gold). The exploration program consisted of both regional and detailed  geological  mapping and geochemical sampling.   
<P>                                                    
Geochemical assay results of the samples indicate anomalous gold  mineralization is  present  in  several  parts  of the property. Anomalous stream sediment gold occurrences near the northern and southern borders of  the  COW  block  indicate sulphide   mineralization  may  be  present  in  the  project  area.  The  field
exploration also resulted in the discovery of iron  oxide  and  manganese  oxide veins in argillically altered and weathered sedimentary rocks.   
<P>              
The anomalous gold assays and hydrothermal veining  in  rocks  similar  to  that which  host  the Kelian deposit to the north are very encouraging. A multi-phase exploration program recommended by independent geological consultants consisting of  further  stream  sediment  sampling,  an airborne magnetometer survey, power auger soil sampling and an extensive trenching program will commence immediately
to identify locations for a followup diamond drilling program.

<font size=+1>Processing of 79 tonnes of mini-bulk sample a success</font size>
<P>
<P>
The Company reports processing of the remaining 79 tonnes, of the total 104 tonne mini-bulk  sample, by  Canamera  Geological  Ltd's  dense  media  separation  plant  (DMS) has been completed and is considered to be a success. Diamonds  were  recovered  from  42 bulk  sample drill holes, which were spaced in such a way to uniformly cover the entire surface area of the pipe. As a result, planning for a  feasibility  study of  the  5034  pipe has begun. It is anticipated that this will include a 10,000
tonne underground bulk sample to provide a large enough quantity of diamonds for evaluation  purposes.  It  is expected that underground operations will start in the spring of 1997. An aggressive exploration program will continue for the next several months.
<P>
Diamonds with a weight of 257 carats were recovered from 104 tonnes of processed kimberlite,  for a recoverable grade of 2.48 carats per tonne. As expected, this is lower than the 3.09 carats per tonne for  the  first  25  tonnes,  which  did undergo a final crush. The grade of the diamonds greater than 2mm in the largest
dimension is 2.10 carats per tonne. There were three diamonds over  two  carats, eight diamonds equal to or greater than 1.5 carats, 43 diamonds over 0.50 carats and 556 diamonds over 0.10 carats. The largest diamond is 2.88 carats  and  four of the largest eight stones are of gem quality. A value for the diamonds will be
determined by  several  diamantaires  and  will  be  reported  as  soon  as  the information is available. 
<P>                                                      
An extensive exploration program, involving the expenditure of $4 million,  will continue for the next several months. 1,000 heavy indicator mineral till samples will have been collected by the end of September from five  different  areas  on the  AK  claim  group  and  335 samples from the CJ claim group to better define
drilling targets. It is anticipated that up to 15  land-based  targets  will  be drilled  on the AK and up to five on the CJ claims this fall. Lake-based targets will be drilled this winter.

As of September 14 1996, the company has completed a combined max-min,  mag  and VLF-EM  ground  geophysics survey over a strong, circular magnetic anomaly which has been targeted for a 1,500 metre diamond drilling program. The results of the survey confirmed the presence of a spectacular magnetic anomaly and has returned higher readings than were originally obtained during an earlier airborne survey.
<P>
The area targeted for drilling has also turned up an  interesting  copper  bearing  mineralization discovered by the prospecting crew over the past few days.   
<P>                   
The diamond drilling crew is now enroute to the property and the  drill  program will  commence  on  September 18 1996 with a scheduled completion of the planned 1,500 metres by mid October.   The ground geophysics survey crew has moved to the Sango Bay southwest  property to  test several coincident mag and EM anomalies. Early results from the max-min phase of the survey are positive with electrical responses typical  of  sulphide generalization.  The company will carry out a total of 15 kilometres of combined max-min and VLF-EM survey over three separate grids.

<font size=+1>US$6 billion Kambove/Kakanda cobalt copper deposit acquired</font size>
<P>
<P>
The  company  has  completed  the  acquisition   of   51%   the   US$6   billion Kambove/Kakanda cobalt/copper deposit in Zaire on August 6 1996. The deposit has reserves of 61 million tonnes at 0.98% copper and 0.19% cobalt, which translates into  1.3  billion pounds of copper and 255 million pounds of cobalt. At current metal prices this values the deposit at over US $6  billion.  Initial  forecasts indicate  that revenues to International Panorama could exceed US$75 million per year over a ten year mine life. The company expects that 25 million shares  will be  issued  on  a  fully  diluted  basis after completion of the acquisition and project financing. A seven to ten year tax holiday is being finalized  with  the government of Zaire.

<font size=+1>Begins Drilling Program on Okak Bay Property</font size>
<P>
<P>
The company has finalized plans for a 1,500 metre drilling program  to  commence mid September on its Okak Bay property in northern Labrador. The drill target is a large, high amplitude, circular magnetic anomaly identified during an airborne survey completed in June of this year.      
<P>                                    
Upon completion of the ground geophysics survey on  the  Okak  Bay  property,  the  survey  crew  will be mobilized to the Sango property to carry out 15km of max-min survey over the gridded areas. The company is  confident  that  the  results from the max-min survey could lead to a second drilling program in the fall of this year on the Sango Bay  southwest  property, which covers favourable rocks of the Flowers River Intrusive Suite.

<font size=+1>Continues Expansion of the Aktash field production </font size>
<P>
<P>
As per the recent company news release the company's jointly-held Ukraine company, KrymTexasNafta Ltd, is now receiving sufficient  income  to  cover  local  operating  costs.  Oil production from the company's first four evaluation wells in the Aktash field, Crimea has been  sold to the Lviv refinery.       
<P>                                                    
To support an immediate expansion in oil production and sales from  Aktash,  the company  is  also  acquiring  the additional tanker trucks needed to get the oil from the field to the nearby railhead.   Delivery of additional pipe and well heads in the next couple of weeks will also allow  the  company  to  move  rapidly with an aggressive drilling program. Full development of Aktash requires drilling another 12-16 wells during the next  few months.      
<P>                                                                   
KrymTexasNafta has let road-building contracts to improve access to both  Aktashand  the  next  two oil fields slated for development, Voykov and Priozorny. The new roads will provide year-round access to these three  oil  fields  to  ensure that  the  company's  drilling  program  of  more  than  40 wells can proceed on
schedule. 
<P>                                                                     
KrymTexasNafta also plans to build roads into two new prospect areas  which  are scheduled  for  drilling exploratory wells this winter. These two areas have the same geological characteristics as Aktash, but are forecasted  to  contain  from two to three times as much oil.    
<P>                                             
Technical studies of the cores retrieved from the third production test well  in Aktash  confirm  earlier Ukraine analyses that the oil production is from highly porous, carbonate reservoirs. The studies also established that these reservoirs are  encased  in  very  fine-grained, clay-rich shales which sometimes plug well bores. To prevent this, future wells will be perforated  to  exclude  any  shale zones, keeping them behind pipe.       
<P>                                        
The fourth well was completed in three reservoir zones and is now  producing  on natural  flow  at  a steady rate of 150 barrels per day during this test period.  The well's reservoirs appear capable of higher rates and, 
at a later  date,  the company plans to place the well on pump.  Ryder-Scott, a petroleum engineering consulting firm, will receive  delivery  of the  latest  production  history  data  this week. It plans to release a reserve report on the Aktash field in two to three weeks.

As per the recent company news release, the  Company  has  closed  its  arrangement  with  Eagle Co to manufacture electro-mechanical  slot  machines  in  Canada.  Eagle  is  a  leading  Japanese manufacturer of gaming technologies and software.    
<P>

<font size=+2>Athlone Resources (VSE:AT)</font size>
<P>
<font size=+1>Acquires 100% of 27 Claims in Elko County, Nevada</font size>
<P>
<P>
The VSE has accepted for filing documentation pertaining to an option  agreement dated June 13 1996 between Athlone and Mr John M. Graham, the optioner. Pursuant to the agreement, Athlone will acquire an option to purchase 100% of the Daw 101 to  127  mining claims in Elko County, Nevada.
<P>
The claims are in  the  north  end  of  the  Carlin  belt,  approximately  320km northeast  of  Reno, 4.8km west of the Rossi barite mine, 4.8km northwest of the Dee gold mine and 5.6km southeast of the Ivanhoe gold mine. The 27 claims  cover an area of approximately 3km north-south by 650m east-west.   Regional mapping shows the area  to  be  underlain  by  Tertiary  volcanics  and associated  sediments.  These  rocks overlie the Paleozoic upper and lower plate sediments which host the gold mineralization in the Dee, Bootstrap, Bluestar and Carlin  mines.  Work  by  previous  operators  on  the Daw claims has identified coincident,  northerly   trending,   magnetic-induced   polarization-resistivity anomalies. There are three or four east-west trending geophysical features which may represent cross-faulting. It is postulated that these geophysical  anomalies
represent  deep  seated  structures that may host gold mineralization similar to that found in American Barrick's Meikle mine.  The  Meikle  mine  contains  high grade  structurally  controlled gold mineralization (the discovery hole returned 165m grading 14 g/t Au). Reserves at the Meikle mine as of December 31 1994  are stated  at  7.6  million  tonnes  grading 23.42 g/t Au (8.4 million tons grading 0.683 ounces per ton).      
<P>                                                    
Athlone plans a first phase  program  of  prospecting,  geological  mapping  and geochemical  sampling  in  order  to  further  evaluate  this  property. Work is scheduled to begin in mid-August.

<P>
<font size=+2>Apex Resorts Corporation (VSE:APE)</font size>
<P>
<font size=+1>B.C. Government says NO to settlement</font size>
<P>
<P>
The following release was issue by Apex Resorts on Monday July 22, 1996.
<P>
The company was informed July 19 that the proposed settlement agreement, which  would  have  released  the company's $125,000,000 lawsuit against the province of BC was rejected by the provincial  cabinet  after  being passed on by the treasury board.
<P>                                                
The decision of the provincial cabinet appears to be  politically  motivated  as the  agreement  was supported by senior government officials, recommended by the government's consultant Arthur Anderson and signed  by  
Mr  Dan  Miller,  Deputy Premier to go forward to the treasury board.
<P>                                    
Although the company is disappointed, it will be proceeding with its lawsuit.   Mr Reeves also reports, the
Company received demand for payment of the  total  amount  of  Apex  Resorts Corporation and Apex Mountain Resort's indebtedness to the Bank of Montreal from the province of BC.                                                             
<P>
The province has notified the company of its intention to file  their  writ  and statement  of  claim on August 2 1996, along with their notice of motion for the court appointment of a receiver-manager with  the  motion  returnable  August  8, 1996.
<P>                                                                           
The company has instructed its legal  council  to  vigorously  defend  all  such aforementioned  action  by  the  province  and  to  proceed  with  the company's $125,000,000 claim against the province.                                       
<P>
<B>The company intends to continue operating Apex Mountain Resort.</B>

<H2>International Road Dynamics (ASE:IRM.A)</H2>
<P>
<H3>Sales Increase By 63% - First 6 Months of 1996.</H3>
<P>
<P>
Sales rose 63% to $7,072,760 for the six month period ended May 31 1996 compared to  $4,347,056  for  the  same  period  last  year.  Net profit grew to $232,137 compared to a loss of $511,811 in 1995.   
<P>                                      
1996 is proving to be an important year for both IRD and  its  key  market,  the Intelligent  Transportation  Systems business. IRD's increased revenues, coupled with the highest order backlog in the firm's history, make  us  optimistic  that this will be a record year for sales and profits.     
<P>                         
The automation of highway  weigh  stations  using  IRD's  weigh-in-motion  scale technologies  and  computer  systems continues to be the major source of revenue growth. New orders totaling $6.7 million were received during  the  period  from customers  in  the  US,  Canada  and  South  America.  In  addition, the company
increased its presence in the toll-road market with its patented  DYNAX  sensorsand  unique axle detectors. Production and engineering capacity was increased in Saskatoon and, in Mississauga, Ontario, additional assembly space  was  acquired to accommodate IRD's contract for the new Highway 407 toll road.                
<P>
While IRD's order book ensures the company will be busy into next year,  we  are confident  the  ITS market is still in the early stages of a large expansion. We have a strong position in the North American ITS market, and  are  developing  a growing presence in South America and Asia.  Please contact the company at 
+1 (306) 653 - 6600 for complete financial details.

The company has been  advised that  drilling  on  the  Scoten  prospect will start on July 16. Pursuant to the agreement entered into with American Freehold Oil Corp, upon completion of  this well,  the  company will earn an 80% net revenue interest in the Scoten prospect on the Gonzales ranch in Rio Arriba, New Mexico and also earn the right to drill additional  wells  on  the  16,000  acre  Gonzales  ranch.

<P>
<H3> Begins Drilling on Jersey-Emerald Property </H3>
<P>
<P>
Underground diamond drilling has commenced at the  Jersey-Emerald  project  near Salmo  in  southeastern  BC.  The  initial holes will test the Bismuth gold zone where previous underground sampling has returned assays up to 0.35  oz/ton  gold and  up  to 4.0 oz/ton silver. The present drill program will attempt to confirm the presence of this zone, and determine its width, strike, dip and average gold content.
<P>                                                                        
The Bismuth zone is a flat-lying gold and native bismuth enriched horizon  which overlies  the  former 
Jersey lead-zinc-silver deposit. The zone was intersected and recognized in several surface and underground holes drilled by  Placer-Dome, the  former  operator  of  the  mine. Because of low gold prices at the time the
intersections were not assayed for gold but drill logs suggest that the zone  is up  to  60 ft thick. Drill intersections are reported over a strike length of at least 2,000 ft suggesting potential for significant tonnage.

July 2, 1996
<P>
<H2> Apex Resorts Corporation Could Begin to Rise </H2>
<P>
<P>
As per my March 28, 1996 stockTALK Alert I made reference to the fact that Apex Resorts  was to attempt to bring the corporations debt situation under control, and resolve it in the Company's favor. (Specifically the corporations $ 8 million owed to the Bank/Provincial Government - required when the native road blockades started several years ago.)
<P>
Resolving of this $ 8 million outstanding with the government is believe to be close.  The last two weeks in June, Apex (VSE:APE) saw an increase in trading activity moving  the stock price from around $ 0.14 cents per share up to a high of $ 0.21.  Apex closed the month at $ 0.17  on June 29th.
<P>
The deal  will turn this  $ 8 million into a non - trading preferred type share with dividends payable most
likely many years out.  Upon this happening the company would be debt free, people close to the 
company say this could add  $.20 to $ .40 cents to the current price of the company stock.  When 
this rise occurs it will probably happen in two or three stages..  Look for current trading activities to increase
prior to the announcement
<P>

<P>
The company has negotiated a private placement for up to 1,000,000  units,  each unit  comprised of one share and one warrant at $2.42.
<P>
The company is continuing  with  its  due  diligence  investigation  of  several advanced  mineral  projects  in  Africa, in respect of which proposals have been made. The proceeds of the private placement will be used  to  further  fund  due diligence,  to  demonstrate  project  financing  ability  and to provide working capital.

<P>
An agreement has been reached  with  American  Freehold  Oil  Corp  whereby  the company  is  to  fund 100% of the costs required to drill an exploratory well to test the Entrada formation on the Scoten prospect  on  the  Gonzales  Ranch  and totalling  3,680  acres  in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. 
<P>
The depth of the well will be  2,400  feet  and  will  test  the  Mancos  Shale,  Dakota  and  Entrada
formations.,  the  company  is  responsible  for completing the well. Upon completion of the well the company 
will have earned an 80% net revenue interest in the Scolen prospect.                                
<P>
The analog field for the cretaceous reservoirs on  the  Gonzales  Ranch  is  the Price-Gramps  Oil  field six miles to the northeast of the company's drill site.  The Price-Gramps Field has produced  10  million  barrels  of  oil  since  1935, however,  the  company  may  have an advantage of being structurally high to the Price-Gramps Field.             
<P>                                                
Upon drilling of the Gonzales No. 1 well the company will have earned the  right to  drill  additional  wells  on  the  16,000 acre Gonzales Ranch, in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico.

NCC Mining finances the company via a brokered private placement of 1,500,000 special warrants and via

<H2>Apex Resorts Corporation</H2>
<P>
<P>
The company states in a recent news release that the leaders of the three major political parties in BC, the Liberal  Party,  the New  Democratic  Party, and the Reform Party, all have made statements that road blocks are not acceptable in BC. This supports the position of the  province  of BC  which  has  obtained  an injunction from the Supreme Court of BC restricting blockades and ensuring access on the Green Mountain road which leads to the Apex resort from Penticton, BC.  
<P>                                                    
Such a guarantee from the province of BC clears the way for Apex Resorts to open its  summer  season  on  June  21  and proceed to the next ski season with great anticipation of a record year ahead

<H2>Birchwood Ventures has high hopes on Voisey Bay Property</H2>
<P>
<P>
The  company  has  a  joint  venture partner with NDT Ventures on 17 mineral properties comprised of 1,546 claims covering an area of 96,625 acres in Labrador.  A recent announcement by Cartaway Resources regarding a new discovery on the Cirque Property in the Staghorn Lake area of northern Labrador has caused excitement  and  anticipation  of  another major copper-nickel discovery in this area. The Cartaway property is on the west side of the company's project  9  and is 6.5 kilometres east of project 13.  
<P>
Geophysical surveys and a drill program in late 1995 have provided Birchwood with good initial sample material.  (Please phone the company for complete drill results - project 9 & project 13).
<P>
Management believes that mineralization in the Staghorn Lake area  occurs  in  a geological environment which may be analogous to that of the rocks overlying the main Voisey's Bay deposit located 70km to the  south.  Information  released  to date suggests that drill holes down to the Eastern Deeps deposit at Voisey's Bay encounter an overlying sequence of  layered  troctolite/anorthosite/norite  with isolated  pods  of  Cu-Ni-Co bearing sulphide mineralization which have migrated upwards during emplacement of the main sulfide
deposit at depth.                
<P>
Birchwood/NDT will be mobilizing crews to the  Staghorn  Lake  area  later  this spring  to  initiate  an  extensive  exploration  program incorporating this new model. The 1996 program will include  prospecting,  geological  mapping,  ground geophysics  and  diamond  drilling, including deep drilling, to further evaluate
targets in this very prospective area.

<H2>Gallery Resources Opens & Moves Up.</H2>
<P>
<P>
Gallery Resources open up trading on May 14, 1996 with a bang up more then $ 0.94 at the start to fall back to a price of $ 1.27 up $ 0.48 cents for the day on a volume of more then 3.3 million shares.                         .
<P>
Gallery came out with further drill results from its Cabot lake property, that now are in lab for anaylsis.  Initial indications from the news release look very positive.  I would think we will see further drilling to take place 
shortly on the Cabot property.
<P>
A second but very important point on the news release was the last paragraph announcing that the private placement of 1,000,000 units at a price of $ 0.75 had been completed and the the placee was the owner of the company, Mr. Bruce Costerd.   From this I read that the Bruce definitely believes in his company, this is a rare occurrence for alot of VSE and ASE listed companies.  The final paragraph is as follows:
<P>
Gallery has recently completed a 1,000,000 private placement, consisting of 1 common share at $0.75 with a warrant at $0.80 to be exercised within a two year period. This private placement is subject to a one year hold period. The placee is Mr Bruce Costerd, President and CEO of the company. These proceeds will be utilized for the spring and summer's mining and exploration budget as well as general working capital purposes.

<P>
Reports large increase in first quarter sales</H2>
<P>
<P>
For the first quarter ended March  31  1996,  revenues  were  $7.7  million,  an increase  of  107%,  as  compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended March 31 1995. Net earnings  for the quarter ended 
March 31 1996 were $2.46 million before taxes  and  $1.47  million  after  taxes  compared  to $665,000 before taxes and $475,000 after taxes for the same period in 1995.                               
<P>
Earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31 1996 were $0.08 per share,  an increase of 60%, as compared to $0.05 per share for the same period in 1995. Revenues and earnings for the quarter 
continued to grow at an  impressive  rate. Earnings  per  share  were  lower than originally projected due primarily to the dilutive effect of the company's equity financings during the  last  quarter  of
1995  and  the issuance of shares on the conversion of debentures. 1996 revenues and earnings are 
projected to exceed $55 million and $12 million  for  the  year
<P>
A day later the company released the following news showing  that being a gaming industry supplier is possible a sure bet.
<P>
<P>
<DT>05/10/96<DD>The company is pleased to announce that  a  further  800  gaming  terminals  
are presently  being  installed,  under  a  new  three  year  revenue  participation agreement dated 
May 7 1996 at an existing casino in California. The company  has 514   gaming  terminals  at  this  
casino  under  a  previously  signed  revenue participation agreement. The casino, operated by a company owned by a  federally recognized  Indian  tribe, is south of Los Angeles and caters to a population of
over ten million people within a one hour driving distance from the  casino.  At present,  the  company 
receives $675,000 per month from the 514 gaming terminals at this casino. Management expects the
new  800  gaming  terminals  to  generate revenues  of  $700,000  per  month  during  the  next few 
months while the final touches to the casino expansion are  being  completed  and  increasing  to  over
$900,000  per  month upon total completion of the expansion. This will result in total revenues of 
over $1.5 million per month from this casino alone.           
<P>
On January 19 1996, the company had announced  an  agreement  with  a  federally recognized  Indian 
tribe to set up a turn-key permanent casino to be located 120 miles north of Los Angeles metropolitan 
area. The company and the tribe now have agreed  to  set  up an initial temporary casino to house 
250 gaming terminals to generate revenues until July  1  1996,  the  expected  completion  date  of  the
permanent  facility.  In  the  permanent  casino,  the  company  will install an additional 250 gaming 
terminals with the total number of terminals increasing to 1,000  by  December  31 1996. The company expects to generate $250,000 per month from the temporary facility.                                                    
<P>
After the installations of the 800 and 250  terminals,  the  company  will  have approximately 2,900 
gaming terminals under revenue participation by May 31 1996. By July 1 1996, the beginning of the 
third quarter, the number of  terminals  on revenue participation will be in excess of 3,100.

<H2>Loumic Resources (VSE:LOO) - Finds 2 carot diamond </H2>
<P>
The company has discovered gem quality diamonds on the offshore diamond  leases of  the  Casierra  Syndicate  of January 1995, an option agreement was concluded with Malaysia Mining Corp Berhad (MMC) allowing MMC to earn a  51%  interest  in the  property in return for carrying out the further exploration and development of the project and bringing the property to commercial production. The  cost  of all such works is to be borne by MMC.                                           
<P>
Prior to concluding the option agreement MMC funded an evaluation of the  marine sediment  sample  concentrates recovered during the first surveys carried out by the syndicate. The concentrates, derived 
from 1.3 tonnes of core sample material from 48 sample sites, returned 639 micro diamonds. Of these, 
69 were in the size range 0.6mm to 1.2mm and would be classified in Canadian  exploration  terms  as
macro diamonds.
<P>
These initial results confirm the presence  of  gem  diamonds  on  the  offshore leases  but  cannot  be used 
to determine the grade or size of the deposits. The geological consultants for the syndicate advise that the  occurrence  of  the  2  carat  stone is significant because there is a high statistical chance of having
many more diamonds in the size range 1 to 0.1 carats  accompanying  this  larger one.  The syndicate views 
the new work to indicate a significant step forward in the evaluation of the leases. 
<P>                                                  
Further work is continuing on the leases with highest priority  being  given  to the  most  prospective  areas.

<B> Banff Resources (VSE:BFF) - Major Financing Complete & New Management</B>
<P>
Today Banff Resources moved up another  $ .20 cents to close at $ 4.00 per share on a volume of more then 100,000 shares. Banff Resources has had two days of great news.  Yesterday Banff Resources release news that its long awaited $ 23,000,000 financing finally came to completion and today the Company announced a new president and group of directors would be taking over the management of the company.
<P>
Investors that have been involved in Banff Resources have seen the stock move from $ 0.40 to $3.20 per share in a (14) - (16) month period as the company finalized its acquisition of a rich copper/cobalt mine and mineral stockpile in Uganda.  The company has completed a joint venture with La Source, a world class  mining entity.  The joint venture provides Banff Resources the mining expertise and access to funding which will be 
required to place the Uganda mine back into production.  Upon announcement of the financing being completed investors may see exploration results from work currently being done at the mine site. Early indications are that the drilling program has great results providing further reserves of cobalt and copper then Banff originally estimated or that past mine operators had found with past exploration activities.

<H2>Apex Resorts Corporation Now On the Move.......</H2>
<P>
The Vancouver Stock Exchange turned to the upside Friday March 29, 1996 with month end and brokerage house year end closing.  The VSE index moved up 27 points on a volume of 43,000,000 shares.  An outstanding day for many publicly traded issues.
<P>
Apex Resorts Corporation was one of these winning issues.  As mentioned a week earlier in a report published by Markets West, (below March 24, 1996) Apex Resorts looks posed to move up in value over the next (4) weeks or so as anumber of specific events finally come together.  On Friday Apex Resorts Corporation moved up $ 0.03 to close at $ 0.24 per share on a volume of more then 493,000 share.
<P>
<P>
<H2>Loumic Resources - Glitters with diamond potential.</H2>
<P>
Heavy selling Wednesday and Thursday of this week due to month end and year end clean-up of brokerage accounts put a halt to the climb of Loumic Resources to a new 52 week high of $ 0.79 cents.  The heavy selling of these two days brought the stock back to a low of $ 0.68.  
<P>
On Friday Loumic Resources rallied back to close at $ 0.70 on a volume of 261,000 shares.  Investors should see this rally continue for the next several weeks as the company releases news on its activities regarding current exploration and the closing of the acquisition of the new offshore mineral concessions in Sierra Leone.  Please review the report published several weeks ago on Loumic Resources March 11, 1996 and 
February 29,1996. ( See below)
<P>
<P>
<H2>International Hi-Tech to build manufacturing plant.</H2>
<P>
As per my March 21, 1996 stockTALK Alert, seen at sight: (http://www.markets-west.com/info-data/)
I suggested that investors may want to take a serious look at this company as a investment opportunity.
<P>
To back up my suggestion the company released a detailed press release stating that International Hi - Tech
is ready to build its manufacturing plant.  Parts of the press release follows below.
<P>
Construction of a permanent manufacturing facility will commence  in  June.  
The facility,  which  will  be  constructed  in  the Tilbury industrial area at 7393 Hopcott Road, 
Delta, BC, will consist of approximately  62,000  square  feet  of manufacturing capacity.                                                         
<P>
Initially, it is expected that the facility  will  produce  approximately  5,000 square  feet  of  
finished  housing  per  shift,  using one production line. The production plant startup, construction 
and capital costs for one production line are expected total approximately $7 million.
<P>                                    
In conjunction with a Vancouver firm of architects, the company has developed  a project  
schedule  for the permanent manufacturing facility. Engineering for the facility has commenced and 
is expected to be completed by the end of April 1996.
<P>
The  manufacturing  facility  will  be  constructed  from prefabricated building panels  produced  
at  Canadian  hi-Tech's  pilot  manufacturing,   testing   and development   facility  in  Surrey,  BC.  
It  is  expected  that  equipment  and construction tendering will be completed by the end of 
May  1996  and  that  the installation  of  pilings  will  commence  in  June  1996.  Construction  of the
permanent manufacturing facility is expected to be completed in early 1997.  The company  will  be 
prepared to accept, on a firm commitment basis, orders for its product in the fall of 1996.
<P>                                                   
The company will finance construction costs for the first production line with a combination  of  preferred  and common share offerings and conventional mortgage financing. The company's objective is to finance construction costs for  further production  lines  from  a  combination of debt and equity offerings and, 
at the option of the company, cash flow generated from its manufacturing operations. As
announced  earlier this year , the company entered into a letter of intent with a US-based investment  
banker  respecting  a  proposed  offering  of 1,000,000  non-voting  preferred  shares  and  3,000,000 
warrants at US$5.00 per share.  Also earlier this year the company entered into an agreement with a Vancouver  mortgage  company,  to provide mortgage financing of  up  to  $7 million.  This agreement will be completed by April 1996.
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996 the company has raised a total of $3 million in  equity  capital  in  connection
with  private  placements  of  its  shares.  If  all  of  the warrants issued in connection with those private placements are  exercised,  the  proceeds  to  the company  will range from approximately $3 million 
to $3.45 million, depending on when the warrants are exercised.                                                
<P>
The company is continuing with discussions  with  members  of  the  private  andpublic   sectors   in   Atlantic  Canada  for  the  establishment  of  a  second manufacturing facility in Canada.
<P>
For complete details on the company, its aggressive marketing plan, plant construction and financing plans please call the company at (604) 733-5400 and ask for Randy Miller.

March 24, 1996
<P>
<H2> Apex Resorts Corporation Could Begin to Rise </H2>
<P>
<P>
As per the February 28, 1996 company news release, Apex Resort is having a very successful 
ski season.  A record number of ski visits have been recorded, very little native road blockades 
and excellent ski conditions could give Apex its best ski season ever.  Skiing should last well into
the spring.  The most important point to note from the recent company news releases is that 
Mr. Mel Reeves was appointed President of Apex Resorts Corporation.  
<P>
Mr. Reeves is very respected in the Vancouver business community, very business astute and 
has dealt with the provincial government in past business dealings.  Upon Mr. Reeves arrival to 
Apex Resorts his first task was to attempt to bring the corporations debt situation under control, 
and resolve it in the Company's favor. (Specifically the corporations $ 8 million owed to the 
Bank/Provincial Government - required when the native road blockades started several years ago.)
<P>
Resolving of this $ 8 million outstanding with the government is believe to be close.  A deal that 
will turn this  $ 8 million into a non - trading preferred type share with dividends payable most
likely many years out.  Upon this happening the company would be debt free, people close to the 
company say this could easily add  $.30 to $ .60 cents to the current price of the company stock.  When 
this rise occurs it will probably happen in two or three stages.   Following closely to the approval stages of this type of conversion/government deal passing through the governments appropriate approval bodies.  Looking at current trading activities and several recent company news releases and company activities one can
conclude that a deal of this nature is near completion.  Upon this announcement the stock will probably rise quickly.
<P>
Further great potential news is that the company is also entertaining joint venture proposals with 
respect to the further development of the resort's substantial real estate holdings on the mountain, 
currently dramatically discounted due to the current road access situation.  
<P>
Upon  the company debt being  eliminated, and the company proceeding with its current business 
objectives for the Apex Ski Resort, Apex Resorts Corporation becomes a company with a strong
potential of being a takeover candidate.  Possibly another reason why one might look at Apex Resorts
Corporation as an investment opportunity.
<P>
Recent movement of the company stock from $ .014 to $ .024 cents indicates many
investors feel that this company is finally in for some long awaited good news.  Note
the current trading in the company stock suggests investors are accumulating stock 
at the $ .20 to .24 cent level.  Important benefit to note of the Apex stock is that it is very 
liquid, meaning one can purchase or sell the stock whenever one desires.  No appointment necessary.
<P>
For complete details on the company, please phone investor relations at (604) 662-3493 or 1 (800) 567-8181

<P>
<H2> VSE Could Trend Downward For (3) to (5) Business Days</H2>
<P>
<P>
Over the next (3) to (5) business days the VSE and many stocks that have traded volume since March 1, 1996 could trend downward.  This will be caused by two events.
<P>
<B> General Month End</B><BR>
    - cleaning of debts in investors accounts. This is done by selling stock or paying for the shares purchased.
<P>
<B>Brokerage Firm Year End.</B><BR>
    - Several large VSE brokerage firms have year end as of March 31.  All debts in any accounts, investor, trader or a house accounts  have to be cleaned up.<BR>
<P>
For those investors who do not understand month end, Month end is an event that occurs (5) business days prior to the end of each month.  Many investors purchase stocks at the beginning or within the month on credit and do not have to pay for the stock for (10 + ) business days.  At this time the debt has to be cleaned up by either selling the shares at a profit or loss or paying for them.  This occurs because most of the shares traded on the VSE are not marginable (have not traded at a price of $ 2.50 per share for a specific amount of time.)
<P>
Due to both events occurring at this time, a fantastic buying opportunity will occur for many equity issues on the VSE.  All investor should look closely at some specific stock toward the end of this week and in the beginning of next week.  Remember specific stocks that have traded volume
due to promotions that recently have occurred or currently going on are prone to toward pressure unless large amounts of buying can be maintained.

<P>
<H2>International Panorama Resources Corp. continues to Shine.</H2>
<P>
<P>
Up more then $ 0.70 cents as of Thursday March 7, 1996, this stock seems like 
it does not want to stop.  With more the $2.5 million in the bank, good management
and excellent mineral properties, International Panorama is posed to move upto the 
$ 3.00 to $ 4.00 range within several months.  Look for further results from its 
Southeast Asian property within 4 to 6 weeks.  The company will be starting a work 
program on its Voisey Bay property in the spring  early summer and with the issuance 
of new options will be adding more funding to the company treasury shortly.
<P>
The following are a list of properties held by International Panorama Resources:<BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> 100 % ownership in 2,341 claims covering some 150,000 acres in VOISEY BAY.  About 
    100 km southwest of the Diamond Fields discovery.</LI>
<P>
<LI>1400 sq km. of exploration property in the Union of Myanmar (formerly Burma) that contains
      high - grade gold mineralization.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Two properties in the U.S.A. - California ( The Spanish Mine Project) and (The Platoro Project)
     in Colorado.  Pre-feasibility studies and results available on these properties.</LI>
<P>
In a week or two I will be releasing a special report on International Panorama's Union of Myanmar 
propery detailing its potential and what it could mean to International Panorama Resources Corp.

<P>
<font size=+1>International Panorama Poised to Net US $900 Million<BR>
From Cobalt Project In Zaire.<font size>
<P>
Project feasibility projections prepared by Bateman Minerals & Industrial Ltd of South Africa, indicate earnings for International Panorama in excess US$900 million after-tax over a ten year period from its interest in the Kambove/Kakanda tailings project in the Shaba region of Zaire.     
<P>                                              
Bateman is a multi-national engineering firm with  extensive  expertise  in  the development  of  tailings  deposits and a history of operations in Zaire. It has been engaged by  International Panorama  to  produce  a  full  feasibility  study  on  the Kambove/Kakanda project. International Panorama is 51% owner and operator of the project under a joint venture with Gecamines, the  state  mining  enterprise  of Zaire.  The agreement was approved and signed into law by the Zairian parliament in September.  
<P>                                                                 
Total tailings reserves on the project site are estimated to exceed  61  million tonnes, grading an average of 0.19% cobalt and 0.98% copper. This equates to 255 million pounds of cobalt and 1.3 billion pounds of  copper,  with  an  in-ground metal  value  of over US$6 billion, based upon current metal prices. Preliminary
metallurgical tests indicate recovery rates  of  70%  for  cobalt  and  90%  for copper.  Capital  costs  for  a  processing facility capable of 5 million tonnes annual throughput, are estimated at less than US$190  million.  The  plant  will consist   of   agitated  vat-leaching,  solvent  extraction  and  electrowinning treatment, and a sulphuric  acid  production  facility.  Plant  construction  is scheduled to begin in May 1997, with commercial metals production by late 1998. 
<P>
International Panorama President, Kenneth MacLeod, said "We are very pleased with the Bateman report,
especially their projection of achieving capital payback in the first year of production and the generation of approximately US  900 million in after tax profits for International Panorama over a ten year project life.  This forecast is based on an average cobalt price of approximately US $12 per pound.  <b>Currently the price is over US $ 20".</b>
<P>
The Bateman summary states, "A sensitivity analysis indicates the project to be successful at cobalt prices of US $$ 6 per pound or more, and to be relatively insensitive to all other input variables.
<P>
Cobalt is used in high temperature alloys, tool steels, rechargeable batteries, as well as permanent magnets.
<P>
International Panorama's operations at Kambove  and  Kakanda  are  proceeding  swiftly  and smoothly.  Dump  &  Dune Drillers have completed the drilling program at Kambove and Kakanda on schedule. The samples have been shipped to Johannesburg for assay and metallurgical analysis.   
<P>                                                  
The company has not experienced any delays or disruptions in conducting business in  Shaba  or  at  the  office  in  Kinshasa. Two of the company's directors, Mr Gilbert Mundela and Mr John Tyson, are  supervising  the  company's  affairs  in Zaire.  The  unrest  on  the  Rwandan  border is occurring over 1,000km from the
company's operations at Kambove and Kakanda and is  a  continuation  of  a  long standing  traditional  rivalry  between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes. The company's Zairian management are of the opinion that the current strife  will  not  affect future operations.       
<P>                                                       
This transaction was approved by shareholders on September 12 1996.

<font size=+2>Sultan Minerals (VSE:SUL)</font size>
<P>
<font size=+1>Summary of Summer Drill Program - Jersey-Emerald Property<font size>
<P>
The company has completed  1,300  metres  of  surface  and  underground  diamond drilling  in its continuing exploration program over the Jersey-Emerald property near Salmo, BC. Preliminary exploration drilling has  been  completed  over  the Bismuth   gold   zone,   the   Emerald   gold   zone,   and  the  Iron  Mountain copper-zinc-silver zone.      
<P>                                                  
<B>Bismuth Gold Zone</B>
<P>                                                               
Consistent gold values and mineralized widths  are  being  obtained  from  drill results  over  the  Bismuth  zone  which  parallels  the east limb of the Jersey lead-zinc orebody. Surface drill hole G96-5, a 200 metre step-out to  the  north of  previously  reported underground intersections in hole UG96-1, has confirmed
the continuation of this flat lying, 9.0 metre thick zone.
<P>
A review of the mine records for drilling completed in  the  1940's  and  1950's indicates  that this gold-rich sulphide zone was intersected in drill holes over a north-south distance of 1,100 metres. These  records  suggest  that  the  body follows  the  east  side  of the Jersey lead-zinc orebody and ranges from 1.2 to
18.0 metres in thickness. The former  drilling  was  done  for  lead,  zinc  and tungsten and therefore the holes were not assayed for gold or silver.  
<P>
<P>         
<B>Emerald Gold Zone</B>
<P>                                                               
Results of the recent program have also identified a second gold  enriched  zone along  the  west  limb  of  the  former Jersey lead-zinc orebody. This zone, the Emerald gold zone, was initially intersected in a 1994 drill hole and  has  been identified and sampled at three locations along a 600 metre, north-south, strike
length. The zone is narrow but persistent and dips east at  55  degrees.
<P>
Due to the lateral continuity with areas of high grade, this zone  will  require additional testing along strike and down dip.  
<P>
<P>                                
<B>Iron Mountain Zone</B>
<P>                                                              
The company has recently completed 600 metres of drilling in three holes along a 500  metre  section  of  the  Iron  Mountain zone. This 2.5km long by 1.0km wide copper-zinc-silver soil anomaly is in an overburden covered area, 1.5km east  of the  former  Jersey  mine.  All  three  holes intersected a laminated, 160 metre
thick, sulphide-rich schist sequence, carrying  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  sphalerite and  chalcopyrite.  Within  this  zone  zinc concentrations ranged from 0.15% to 0.65% and copper values  were  less  than  0.1%.  The  three  holes  demonstrate enormous   tonnage   potential   for   this  zone.  The  banded  nature  of  the
mineralization  is  encouraging  and  suggests  that   economically   important, sediment-hosted,   massive  sulphide  mineralization  may  occur  over  adjacent portions of the zone.         
<P>                                                  
Drilling  and  surface  exploration  is  continuing  and  in  response  to   the encouraging  results  to  date,  the  company  is  considering an expanded drill program.  <B>For complete assay results, please call the company in Vancouver.</B>
<P>
For further details, please call the company at (604) 687 - 4622  Ask for Farah Alibhai.

The holes were drilled to investigate the grade and attitude of a reported 2,000 foot long, flat-lying, gold and native  bismuth enriched horizon which overlies the former Jersey lead-zinc-silver deposit.     
Hole 1 drilled at +65 degrees intersected the bismuth zone over a core length of 30.7  ft.  The results show high grade gold mineralization along both margins of the mineralized structure.    
<P>                                                 
Hole 2 drilled below hole 1 at +35 degrees stopped short  of  the  zone  due  to drilling complications.              
<P>                                           
Hole 3 drilled at 45 degrees to hole 1 intersected a parallel gold zone  over  a core length of 3.9 feet. 
<P>                                                       
The three holes have also intersected sections  of  significant  zinc  and  lead mineralization.   Complete drill results from the summer drill activities are available from the company.
<P>                                                              
A 5,000 foot surface diamond  drilling  program  has  begun  to  test  the  Iron Mountain  copper-zinc-silver  zone,  the bismuth gold zone and the Emerald-Leroy gold zone. Four short holes have been completed over the Emerald-Leroy zone  and the  first  of  three  deep drill holes planned for the Iron Mountain anomaly is
currently being drilled. 
<P>
Upon completion of the three holes, the drill  will  be moved to test the strike extension of the bismuth zone where drill logs from the Jersey lead-zinc mine suggest that the mineralized body could be up to  50  feet thick.
<P>                                                                          
<font size=+1>Regional Program</font size>
<P>                                                               
Geochemical sampling has expanded the Iron Mountain soil anomaly and is defining a  silver-zinc-copper  anomaly of similar size and magnitude in the Wilson Creek area, 3.0 km along strike to the south of Iron Mountain.  Prospecting  currently underway over the recently acquired claims has located and sampled new showings. Of particular interest are the Tungsten King and  Truman  Hill  prospects  where high grade zinc and lead showings have now been discovered.         
<P>            
Because of the magnitude and open-pit potential of the Iron Mountain  zone,  the company has expanded its mineral rights to 10,000 hectares along a 15 km section of this highly mineralized belt.          
<P>                                      
<font size=+1>Database Acquisition</font size>
<P>                                                            
The company has acquired Placer-Dome's geological database for  the  Jersey  and Emerald mines. The database includes over 2,000 maps, plans and sections for the two mines as well as surface maps and reports on many nearby  mineral  deposits.
<P>
Logs  and sections for more than 4,000 underground drill holes provide important information  on  the  deposits  and  on  several   adjacent   untested   mineral occurrences.  Of  particular interest are the results of an exploration drilling program completed just prior to closure of the mine. The extensive data base  is
currently  being  studied.  It  is  anticipated  that  new drill targets will be generated by this study.

<font size=+2>International Panorama Resources (VSE:ILP)</font size>
<P>
<font size=+1>Acquisition of Copper/Cobalt Tailings Project in Zaire<font size>
<P>
After moving up more then $ 0.64 cents on Friday the company halted International Panorama for the long awaited major announcement.  The acquisition of a major Copper/Cobalt Tailings Inventory in Zaire.
<P>
As per the company's news release today of the acquisition the following details have been released.
<P>
The company has secured the rights to a joint venture to  develop  copper/cobalt tailings  near  the  concentrators at Kambove and Kakanda in the Shaba region of Zaire.
<P>                                                                          
The acquisition has been accomplished through the purchase of all of the  shares of PTM Minerals, a Cayman Islands company which has entered into a joint venture agreement with La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines,  the  state-owned  mining company  of Zaire. The PTM/Gecamines agreement has been formally ratified by the government of Zaire.   
<P>                                                         
Gecamines reports that the tailings at Kambove and Kakanda  contain  61  million tonnes  grading  an  average  of  .19%  cobalt and .98% copper. A summary of the tailings inventory can be obtained from the company by calling at (604) 687-7294.
<P>
The company has allocated from its treasury up to US$3 million to  commission  a feasibility  study  to  verify the stated reserves and determine the appropriate recovery techniques. The feasibility study Is expected to be completed by spring of 1997, following which production could commence within two years. The company
will act as operator on the project.       
<P>
The company's initial  review  suggests  a  requirement  for  two  SX/EW  plants (solvent extraction/electrowinning) to process a total of 17,000 tonnes per day of tailings, providing for a mine life of at least ten years. The capital  costs for  the  plants  are  estimated  at  approximately  US$45  million. The company anticipated that financing  for  the  plants  will  be  accomplished  through  a combination  of  debt  and  equity instruments. Revenues from production will be distributed on the basis of 85% toward the reimbursement of capital and start-up costs,  and the balance of 15% will be distributed to the partners In proportion to their interest in the joint venture, specifically 51% to the company and  49%
to  Gecamines.  After  recovery  of capital, the profits will be allotted in the same  proportion,  subject  to  a  1.5%  net  profits  royalty  attributable  to Gecamines.      
<P>                                                                
Following the acceptance by the company of a feasibility study recommending  the construction  of  plant  facilities,  the  company will pay Gecamines a one-time option  premium  equivalent  to  10%  of  the  annual  budgeted  cashflow   from operations,  as determined by the feasibility study. This amount will not exceed
US$5 million.           
<P>                                                        
The consideration payable by the company for the acquisition of  the  shares  of PTM  is US$250,000 and the issuance of up to 11,500,000 shares of the company in stages related to the development of the project. The first issuance,  amounting to  a  maximum  of  2,875,000  shares,  will  be  effected  upon completion of a
pro-feasibility report on the project. Following the  successful  conclusion  of the  feasibility  study,  the  company  will  issue up to 4,600,000 shares. Upon receipt of the financing required for production,  up  to  2,875,000  additional shares will be issued. The balance of up to 1,500,000 shares will be issued upon
the commencement of commercial production. The shares  are  subject  to  a  hold period  of  12  months from the date of the agreement. All shares issued will be escrowed and released at the rate of 10% per month.          
<P>                   
The tailings are in the heart of the Central African copperbelt, 120km north  of Lubumbashi,  with  ready  access  to  several  seaports  in southern and eastern Africa. Due to close proximity to the  concentrators  at  Kambove  and  Kakanda, major  infrastructure,  such  as  rail, road, water and hydropower, as well as a
trained and educated workforce, are available at the tailings sites.
<P>
For further details, please call the company at (604) 687-7294 or 1 (800) 931-1818.

A 50% interest in a 9,000  sq  km  exploration  area  in  northwest  Kazakhstan. Interscope's  joint  venture  partner  is  a  private company owned by the south Kazakhstan  Geological  Institute  and  other  Kazakhstani  business  people.  A US$250,000 exploration program is planned for the remainder of 1996.       
<P>
<P>     
<B>Title</B>
<P>                                                                           
Interscope has created three joint ventures to hold the Kazakhstani  properties. Title  to the various licences is currently being reviewed and will be finalized in the near future. The current situation is as follows:       
<P>

<P>                                                           
Cordal has been actively pursuing the Kazakhstan property acquisition since its news release of  May  3 1996. Since that time, representatives of Cordal have visited Kazakhstan, geologists have been retained to evaluate the properties and meetings  have  been  held  with  Kazakhstani  lawyers, bankers, accountants and
representatives of the vendors, each of the  three  joint  venture  parties  and representatives of the Kazakhstani mining company.       
<P>
<P>                       
<b>Geological and Valuation Reports</b>
<P>                                                
Cordal has retained Mr Henry Meixner, a Vancouver-based  professional  geologist to  prepare geological reports on the three properties. Cordal expects the first of these reports, on the Arkharly to be available by mid July.  The  second  and third reports will follow shortly thereafter.      
<P>                             
Cordal has retained ACA Howe  International  of  Toronto  to  prepare  a  formal
valuation of all of the properties.  Mr Meixner and ACA Howe are currently in Kazakhstan working on the reports.    
<P>
<P> 
<b>Share Exchange</b>
<P>                                                                  
A formal share exchange agreement providing for the acquisition of Cordal of all of  the  issued  shares  of  Interscope  is  currently being negotiated with the shareholders of Interscope.   
<P>
Once the Howe report has been delivered and approved by the VSE, Cordal plans to acquire  the  shares  of  Interscope in exchange for shares of Cordal at a price equal to the value of the properties as determined by ACA Howe. Cordal will  pay for this by issuing that number of shares that are equal to the valuation amount
divided by $1.25, or such lesser number of shares as may be negotiated by Cordal and the shareholders of Interscope.        
<P>
<P>                                     
<b>Interim Borrowing</b>
<P>                                                               
In order to keep the properties alive it was necessary to advance certain monies to  each  of the joint ventures and to pay certain costs. After carrying out the above described due diligence, Cordal advanced US$250,000 to Interscope.  Cordal borrowed  the  US$250,000  from  five  parties.  Interest  is  to  accrue on the
outstanding balance at prime plus 3% and a maximum bonus allowed under  the  VSE guidelines.
<P>
<P>                                                                     
<b>Continuous Financial Commitment</b>
<P>                                                 
Cordal currently estimates that it will be necessary to fund Interscope  to  the extent  of approximately $400,000 per month in order to ensure that the licences are transferred as  required  and  the  properties  are  properly  explored  and developed.    Once the Arkharly and Bolshevik licences  are  transferred,  Cordal  intends  to commission  pre-feasibility  studies  to  determine  the best possible operating plans for the two operating mines. Once the Skyline licence  is  issued,  Cordal intends  to  carry  out  an  extensive  exploration  program. The costs of these programs will be developed in due course.  
<P>
<P>                                   
<b>Private Placement</b>
<P>                                                               
On May 2 1996 Cordal announced a $2,500,000 brokered private  placement.  The proceeds of the financing are to be used to advance the Kazakhstan  projects and for general working capital.                                                
CM Oliver has agreed to act as Cordal's  exclusive  agent  for  the  purpose  of effecting  the  private  placement for specific consideration.  Please phone the company to see how far the acquisition has progressed.

 July 30, 1996
<P>
<H2>Apex Resorts Corporation (VSE:APE)</H2>
<P>
<font size=+3>The Story & What Could Happen Next?</font size>
<P>
Directors and management of the company are shocked and dismayed by  the  recent irresponsible  and  malicious  response  from  the  provincial government to the resort's continuing financial dilemma. The company's financial woes are a direct result  of  illegal  Indian  roadblocks in November and December of 1994 and the continuing threats of further roadblocks as recent as two weeks ago.  
<P>         
Prior to the provincial election this past spring, senior  government  officials had  approved,  in  principle,  the  terms  of  the  proposed  repayment program formulated by both the government and the company.                              
The premier and ministers asked for the indulgence of the company for a  90  day delay  in inking the final deal in order that they could tend to the task of the election. In keeping with the spirit of  the  deal,  the  company  granted  this delay.  The delay was granted reluctantly as it would cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars.  After numerous delays, weak excuses, run arounds, and a chaotic beginning  to  a new  term of government, The NDP finally responded. But even though the treasury board recommended to cabinet  that  they  accept  the  proposal,  the  political process  seemed  to prevail over good business sense at that cabinet meeting two weeks ago. 
<P>                                                                     
It is important to reiterate why the company was forced into this financial mess in  the first place. In 1993 the then NDP premier Mike Harcourt sent a letter to the company assuring that his government would not allow blockading of roads  in this  region and would take immediate steps to remove any such economic threats.
<P>
With this assurance, along with all necessary permits and approvals, the company proceeded with their previously approved development plan.  Well, blockades were set up on all access road to the resort by members  of  the three  local  Indian Bands just prior to the completion of this project. The NDP
government allowed the blockade to remain for five weeks while they made a  lame effort to negotiate for ownership of a road which is already documented as being owned by the provincial government.           
<P>                                  
This resulted in a $3 million direct cost due to  the  company  having  to  take desperate  measures  to  complete  the construction project in time for the fast approaching ski season, plus 10's of millions of dollars of indirect losses  and a  continued  loss of revenues due to this government's inability to resolve the
continuing Indian issues in this province.   It is important to note that the  $8  million  loan  from  the  company's  bank, guaranteed  by  the NDP government was not used to operate the resort but rather
to pay down debts already in place for the chairlift and the  hotel.  As  stated earlier,  the necessary funding had already been secured by the company prior to the Indian blockades and regular threats of blockades  which  continue  to  this day.  That  funding of course was withdrawn when the government failed to uphold
the  laws  of  the  province  when  this  region  was  governed   by   two   NDP representatives including one cabinet minister.           
<P>                      
The announcement by the government on July 22 that they intended to file to have the  courts appoint a receiver manager on August 8 is not completely the reverse of their previous decision, but it is irresponsible to  the  taxpayers  of  this province.       
<P>                                                                
The company has raised more that $6 million since the blockades of 1994 and  had in  place  more  that  $2.5  million  pending the government's acceptance of the company's repayment program.  The  government's  security  position  would  have improved  by  more  than  $1  million  with  the acceptance of this plan and the
government would have been released from the $125 million lawsuit. A substantial win for the overburdened taxpayers of this province.  
<P>                          
The company repayment proposal was a win, win  for  all  parties  and  was  even somewhat  one  sided  in  favour  of Mr Clark's NDP government as the government would not then  have  been  liable  to  pay  compensation  of  $3  million  plus additional  unspecified  costs  to  the  company for damages suffered during the previous Indian roadblocks.           
<P>                                          
Last week the company was approached by representatives of the government  on  a receivership  deal  on the parent company and the two operating subsidiaries. It appears to the directors that the government would only operate the resort for a 60  day  period and then close it. The company employs close to 300 residents of
this region in the winter, and, in only the second summer of operation, about 70 are employed.    
<P>                                                               
During the winter months, the company is  the  third  largest  employer  in  the southern Okanagan.                                                              
These latest announcements by the government have again put  the  company  in  a financial  quandary  however  directors personally advanced funds last Friday to cover cash requirements including payroll for the resort  staff  the  government doesn't seem to care about.    
<P>                                                 
The company will work aggressively to block this latest threat to  their  future and will aggressively pursue their $125 million lawsuit.

<H2>International Hi - Tech  Provides Corporate Summary  (VSE:IHI)</H2>
<P>
<P>
<B>International Hi-Tech Industries</B> has experienced  remarkable  success  over  the past six months in all areas relating to the development of its state-of-the-art construction technology. As is often the case, good news does not always  result in  coverage  by  the financial press and so the company would like to take this opportunity to review  its  continuing  progress  in  the  areas  of  technology protection, corporate simplification and debt and equity financings. The company would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  provide  a  summary  of  the construction invention held under licence by the company.                       
Technology Protection 
<P>                                                         
During the first six months of 1996 the company received confirmation of  patent protection  over its licensed technology in several key jurisdictions, including the US, Taiwan, South Africa and several other African  nations.  As  well,  the company  received a favourable International Preliminary Examination Report from
the International Preliminary Examining Authority under the  Patent  Cooperation Treaty. National phase applications will now be filed, where patent examiners in 70 nations (including nations in the European Patent  Convention  Community  and Canada) are expected to endorse all claims that have been favourably regarded in the International Preliminary Examination Report. Canadian,  American,  European
and  Taiwanese  protection  is  regarded  as  important  for the development and manufacturing stages while Africa and other developing  areas  are  regarded  as excellent  areas  for  the  technology's  end-use.  Patent  protection  for  the technology has now been issued or is pending in over 178 nations throughout  the
world.       
<P>
<P>                                                                  
<B>Technology Testing</B> 
 <P>                                                            
Physical tests have been conducted by Inchcape Testing Services/Warnock  Hersey, an  internationally accredited testing and certification organization. The tests confirm that the design specifications for the subject panels (manufactured on a 1:1  scale) are extremely well-suited for heavy industrial applications, as well as for commercial and  residential  applications.  Further  particulars  of  the conclusions derived from the tests will be subject to a further news release.   
<P>
<P>
<B>Corporate Simplification</B>
<P>                                                        
The company has completed a series  of  corporate  reorganizations  designed  to simplify its existing structure which will in turn assist with future financings and other transactions. As a result, the  company  is  now  a  Canadian  federal company  (effective  May 31 1996) and directly owns 100% of the BC manufacturing
property as well as the Canadian technology rights. Previously, the company only indirectly  had 65% of the manufacturing property and the technology rights. All profits derived from the rights will now accrue to the benefit  of  the  company and,  ultimately,  to  the  benefit  of  the  company's  shareholders. Worldwide
technology rights, other than for Canada, are held  by  a  wholly-owned  Bermuda subsidiary,  IHI-International  Holdings  which  is  continuing to actively seek joint venture and sub-licensing opportunities in Europe, Asia and South America.  This  simplified  and streamlined corporate structure will permit the company to focus on the final stages of its product development.
<P>
<P>
<B>Financing Success</B>
<P>                                                               
During the  first  half  of  1996  the  company  either  completed  or  received commitments  with  respect  to  more  than  $10.7  million  in  debt  and equity financing. Financings included a $6 million construction mortgage, which will be used  to  construct  a  permanent  manufacturing  facility.  The company is also proceeding with plans to complete an offering of convertible preferred shares in the  US  later  in  1996.  A  comprehensive  registration  statement  is nearing completion and will be filed with US securities regulators shortly. The  company expects  this  offering,  if  completed, to raise in the order of US$5.3 million
which would be used for the construction of a  second  production  line  at  the permanent manufacturing facility and, in conjunction with government assistance, a second manufacturing facility in Atlantic Canada.

<B>1996 - The Second Half - Commencement of Construction</B>           
<P>                
Expectations are high for even greater progress for the company  over  the  next six months. The company will again be participating in the world-class home show event in Luxembourg  this  fall.  Last  year's  participation  resulted  in  the development  of  several  strategic  alliances which are already benefitting the
company. IHI-International also expects to continue the progress experienced  in securing  revenue  through licencing agreements which are expected to help bring the products produced from the technology into worldwide markets.  However,  the company  is most eagerly awaiting the start of construction of its 62,000 square foot manufacturing facility in greater Vancouver. Not only  will  the  facility, when  completed,  produce  panels  based  on  the  company's technology, but the facility itself will be constructed using these state-of-the-art panels. Company president  Roger  Rached  describes the facility as a working show-case. "We are proud and delighted to have come this  far.  Our  new  facility  will  not  only contain  the  value  of  our  product  but also make it available to the world." Panels, derived from the Hi-Tech building system, will begin to be  produced  on July  15  1996  at  the  Surrey  manufacturing  facility. On August 15 1996, all
shareholders, business associates and  friends  of  the  company  are  cordially invited  to  attend  the  spade  turning  ceremony at the Hopcott Road property.
<P>
Commercial  production  is  expected  to  commence  May  1  1997.  For   further information  and to register for this spade turning ceremony, please contact the company's head office at (604) 733 5400.         
<P>
<P>                               
<B>Background of the Invention</B>                
<P>                                     
The invention relates to an earthquake, fire and  wind  resistant  prefabricated building  panel for use in making a three-dimensional structure such as a house, apartment, office building or the like.                                         
<P>
Prefabricated Panels            
<P>                                                
Prefabricated building panels, in general, act as building components which  can be quickly and easily fastened to a pre erected frame structure. Many man-hours, however, are  required  to  preselect  the  frame  structure  and  prepare  such structure  for  receipt  of  prefabricated  panels.  In  addition,  conventional
prefabricated  panels  are  normally  fastened  to  the  exterior  side  of  the pre-erected  frame which enables such panels to withstand positive wind loading; however,  negative  wind  loading  such  as  created  by  hurricanes  cannot  be withstood. Negative loading normally results in the exteriorally fastened panels
being ripped off of the frame structure.  This  also  occurs  with  conventional plywood  board  sheathing  which  is  also  fastened to the exterior side of the frame. What  is  desirable  therefore,  and  what  the  construction  technology delivers,  is  a  building  panel  or  building  system which can withstand both
positive and negative dynamic loading.      
<P>
<P>                                    
<B>Three Dimensional Structure</B>
<P>                                                     
A consideration in most building designs is the susceptibility of  the  building to  seismic  forces  such  as  created by earthquake activity. Many conventional building  designs  include  a  solid,  unitary  cast  concrete  foundation  with engineered  footings  suitable  for  the  soil  upon which the building is to be
erected. The solid unitary foundation presents a problem  under  seismic  forces because  it  is  unitary  and  rigid.  Although  this  permits such forces to be transmitted throughout the foundation, such a rigid foundation is unable to  act sufficiently and elastically to absorb such forces without cracking or breaking.
What is desirable therefore, and what the construction technology delivers, is a sufficiently   resilient   elastic   building   foundation  and  a  sufficiently resiliently elastic frame structure able to  withstand  and  distribute  seismic forces.  
<P>                                                                      
In addition to the need to withstand earthquake forces, there exists a  need  to provide  prefabricated  building  structures  capable of quick and easy erection with minimal  labour  requirements.  Transporting  prefabricated  structures  is costly  and  requires  an enormous amount of space on a ship, for example. If it were possible to ship individual components of a structure and  then  erect  the structure quickly and easily, shipping or transportation costs would be reduced, labour requirements of erecting the structure would be reduced and the  cost  of erecting  the structure itself would be reduced. Thus it is desirable to provide building components  which  arc  capable  of  providing  these  advantages.  The construction technology under licence to the company provides these advantages. 
<P>
<P>
<B>Summary of the Invention</B>
<P>                                                        
The building technology under licence to the company provides for advantages  in customization,  strength,  quality,  accuracy and cost savings; products derived from the technology will be unique and extremely important for the  construction industry and its related markets.

<H2>International Thunderbird Gaming Continues Impressive Growth</H2>
<P>
<P>
The first quarter ended March 31 1996 demonstrated another quarter of  continued growth and new developments for the company. In January 1996 the company entered into its first turnkey casino development project by signing an  agreement  with the  Tule  River  tribe,  a  federally recognized Indian tribe in Tulare County, California to finance and build a state of the art  turnkey  casino.  Under  the terms  of the agreement, the company will sell all the necessary casino supplies to  the  casino  and  provide  up  to  1,000  gaming  terminals  on  a   revenue participation  basis for a period of five years. The company expects to generate
a cash flow in excess of $68 million from this casino over the five year term of the  agreement  after  allowing  for the repayment by the casino of all advances made by Thunderbird to construct the casino.   
<P>                                 
In February 1996, the company's shares commenced trading as an exempt company on the  Toronto Stock Exchange. The company also entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Eagle Co. Ltd., a leading Japanese developer  of  gaming software,  video gaming terminals and electromechanical slot machines. Under the terms of the joint venture, a new company, Thunderbird  Eagle  Gaming  Inc.,  has been  formed  to  manufacture  and  market  a new line of electromechanical slot machines. These new electromechanical slot machines,  together  with  the  video gaming  terminals already being manufactured by the company, will be marketed in North and South America as well as other internationally licensed markets.     
<P> 
For the three months ended March 31 1996, revenues were $7.7  million,  compared to  $3.7  million for the same quarter in 1995. Net earnings before income taxes were $2.46 million, compared to $665,000 for  the  same  quarter  in  1995.  Net earnings  after  income  taxes  were $1.47 million, compared to $475,000 for the
same quarter in 1995. Earnings per share  after  income  taxes  were  $0.08,  an increase of 60%, compared to $0.05 per share for the same quarter in 1995. Revenues and earnings in the first quarter continued to grow  at  an  impressive rate.  Earnings  per share were lower than originally projected due primarily to
the dilution effect of the shares issued by the company for an equity  financing during the fourth quarter of 1995 and the issuance of shares upon the conversion of debentures.              
 <P>                                                   
The company's casino operations division had over 1,800 gaming  terminals  under revenue  participation  as  at  March 31 1996. The continually growing cash flow from these gaming terminals has  now  reached  approximately  $1.8  million  per month.  In May 1996 the company announced that under a new three year agreement, the company  is  placing  an  additional  800  gaming  terminals  on  a  revenue participation  basis  at  an existing location and 250 gaming terminals at a new location. As a result, the total number of gaming terminals in operation by  May 31  1996  under  revenue  participation  will  grow  to  over 2,850. The company currently has contracts to add another 1,500 gaming terminals over the next  six months   and   is   negotiating  to  place  more  gaming  terminals  on  revenue participation  at  several  new  locations.  Under  the  revenue   participation agreements,  the  company  continues to own the gaming terminals while receiving
between 14% to 25% of the net revenues generated by the gaming terminals.
<P>
In an effort to capitalize on a new and untapped market, the company has entered into  a  joint  venture  agreement  with  IGC  Internet  Gaming  Corp.  and Axion Communications to develop an on-line Internet casino. Under  the  terms  of  the joint  venture,  the  company  and  Axion will each have the right to earn a 20% interest in the Internet  casino  by  providing  necessary  expertise  and  some startup capital. IGC will be the operator of the Internet casino and will retain a 60% interest in the Internet casino. This joint venture will allow the company to  become  involved  in what could potentially be a very explosive market while
still keeping complete focus on its core business.

<H2>Banff Resources Near Completion of  Major Acquisitions and Financing's</H2>
<P>
<H3>Summary Of Pending Acquisitions and Financing</H3>
<P>
<P>
Recent company investor forums in cities of Europe and in Toronto has brought some attention to Banff Resources.   Suggestions are that Banff Resources is near completion of its major Ugandan acquisition and 
$ 20 plus million dollar  financing.   Company representatives have said that the recent investor forums have created significant analyst interest and movement in the company stock price should occur upon completion of the financing and acquisitions pending.
<P>
News should be released shortly.
<P>
<P>
 <H2>Summary.</H2>
<P>
<P>
The LaSource Group owns 55% of the shares of Kasese which owns the Kasese Cobalt Project.  The remaining 45 % of the shares of Kasese are owned by Kilembe, the Ugandan company that has granted Banff Resources an option to acquire a 65% interest in the Kilembe copper/cobalt Mine.
<P>
<P>
<H2>Kasese Cobalt Project</H2>
<P>
<P>
Kasese was incorporated for the purpose of exploiting Kasese Cobalt Project which principally involves the reconnaissance, financing, marketing and exploitation of cobaltiferous pyrite stockpiled at Kasese, Uganda
<P>
<P>
<H2>Kilembe Mine Project</H2>
<P>
<P>
Banff Resources has entered into an agreement with Kilembe Mines Limited, a Uganda corporation wholly-owned by the Ugandan Government giving Banff the exclusive option to acquire a 65% right, title and interest in and to the Kilembe Mine and certain mineral leases and assets associated with the mining and metallurgical operations by concluding certain work under the agreement at an estimated cost of US $ 1,085,000 and a positive feasibility study of the project.
<P>
The Kilembe Mine is located only 15 kilometres from the Kasese Cobalt Project. Upon completion of the Kasese Acquisition,  Banff Resources will have the controlling interest in the Kasese Cobalt Project.  In 
addition to the two project stated above, there is also substantial exploration upside associated with the mine.  
Any cobalt production from the mine would be treated at Kasese and could result in a significant increase in revenues and the life of the project.  It is anticipated that the Company will benefit from numerous operational and management synergy's resulting from the combination of the projects, as well as from the expertise of a significant international mining house.
<P>
A recently commissioned report which Banff requested on the Kasese Cobalt project  estimated the project at fair market value (55 % ) interest would be worth approximately US $ 35,800,000
<P>
The Kasese Cobalt Project and the Kilembe Mine Project represents a combination of the two most significant projects in Uganda today.
<P>
<P>
